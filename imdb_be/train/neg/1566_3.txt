For the experienced fan Beatles, of prime importance in this movie just sit and pick faults, inaccuracies, all-around, lowered events, greatly exaggerated the events, people lowered, on the time scale errors, wrong quotation attributes, wrong clothes, with geographical songs, and ( shame shame) the wrong tools and other boners I just can not think of right now. Disadvantages come fast and furious, so you have to be alert. <br /> <br /> I did not give it a "1" in the first place due to the fact that he was shot in Liverpool and actors (group Rain) to give it their all (character Lennon defined and does a good job) . In addition, the song Â«Cry for shade" is heard at one point, and that counts for something. <br /> <br /> So ,,, watch it for fun, but please do not take it as historically accurate.
