The film starts slowly and then decreases. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing happened, I went out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There's no story. Symbols vague ideas most boring people any of us know. The producers of this film can be sued in court, when they try to sell it as a "movement" of the image. There's no traffic. I could say the same "story" with a pair of still images with captions. Scenario joke. It's just awful. I doubt that any doctor in the world scenario can save it. My biggest regret is not the fact that I spent 60 minutes of my life watching "Love in the Time of money," but I let a great opportunity to be a leader. I could be the first to come out, but I was expecting a little too long. Instead, I watched about 20 people walking in front of me.
