Andrewjlau, I could not agree more. My girlfriend is looking at this very moment, and I think that this film is appalling. Quote from my Chinese friends, laughing: "They are doing all this for a manÂ» <br /> <br /> I think that these women have no intensity, no sense of struggle between tragedy and identity, and that these people are unlikely? worth fighting for. During the dance scene where Zhang Ziyi wins them men look silly more than admire. <br /> <br /> The Japanese people have a much greater intensity than the Chinese, and to be a geisha Japanese culture. I am sure that the Chinese something like that, but the person does not comply with the basic. <br /> <br /> In any case, the dialogue on Only unmysterious, so American .. If Europe did so with a European the Orientals, they would have done much better <br /> <br /> I have to add that it seems to the majority of people who liked the movie American Sadly to say. but not surprising. All spelled out for you, rather than instinctive, not passionate. I think that the Chinese actress cute, but I could not say that they were good actors in this movie. So, film is great, but at the actually, I can not see how it can be seen that these characters are complex, deep E individuals. <br /> <br /> I'm going to Japan to see the real thing. I'm sure it would be strange to see.
