I agree with one of the other comments, the author of a good story and good actors, but incompatible, and I would also say to hurry. It was about 24years, since I read the book, as it was in school. But I felt that you should know the story of Jane Eyre when viewing one of these as the bits are omitted, and therefore, it does not completely make sense. Such as Jane and Mr. Rochester just talked and then he proposes marriage !!! Actors do not have time to let the audience know how their character is feeling every thing happening in story.The actors are good, but not given enough time to do the story justice. I'm sorry to say this, but I do not really like this version version.The 1970 Suzanne York and George C. Scott is Jane Eyre film of my benefits but you must check the version of series 1983 BBC mini with ZIL Clark & ​​Timothy Dalton 2 starring . I love it so much I'm watching it regularly.There is an abridged version of which goes to 225mins or full version for 330mins.
