"Private Practice" The Division is currently in a rather successful and well written "Gray's Anatomy." The cast is incredible. The room can even work. But writing is just awful. <br /> <br /> Pre-masked pilot episode of Gray's Anatomy was my first warning. The plot was just blah. I might have thought it was an accident. So I put the DVR to tape the pilot and all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> As I watched the pilot, I just kept wondering how the show with a cast of great actors could muster sad pilot. The pilot must suck people in and keep them coming back again and again. There had to be the excitement, flash, great writing, intriguing storyline with spectacular, which must answer for the entire season. Surprisingly, this show was not anything like that. <br /> <br /> Thinking it was an accident, I just watched the second episode of hoping for the best. And a little bit better, it does not come close to what it should be interesting can not miss TV. <br /> <br /> I just cleaned up this show with my list of shows to watch. IMO not worth the effort, and I would be very surprised if this show even makes it to the middle of the season. Skip this for people.
