This film incomprehendably bad. It starts with a few accidental explosions, and then cut to a sock puppet in the T-Rex, the negotiations (!) To the audience. He goes back and forth between the toe and puppet animation around, probably because the filmmakers could not afford to live actors. I'll spare you the long, tedious, continuous storyline that pulls this poor film during the brutal 85 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of my friends found this very rare video in a hobby shop somewhere that sells a type of B-movies, and he bought it for the sole purpose of obtaining pleasure, but, as it turns out, our intervention is not it was neecessary. This film ridicules better than we could. <br /> <br /> I thought that "Plan 9 from Outer Space" Ed Wood was Cheesiest film there, but leave it Japanamation / Lego cars / Sock Puppet outdo him. If you see this film anywhere, buy it without hesitation. This is a very rare and worth a lot, a lot of good laughs.
