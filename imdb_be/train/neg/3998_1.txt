You may say: "All the shock, there is no plot?" There were so many unexplored areas in the film. There was no history of the room, except death. * * WHY was this wickedness? What made it so? Why "hour" countdown? Then there were the unknown things hinted at; for example, we * saw * the camera in the air duct, he said. But when he got up and said deflector, there was no camera. <br /> <br /> How about the fact that all the ghosts looked "the Digital", and things "went out" before it hit the ground, making the static noise? Hmmm ... when you put all * those * things together, it makes the room look like a 1408 high-tech ghost house. Do not except that there was no follow up on this. <br /> <br /> Yes ... by the way ... the electronics do not work in 1408. Well, except for the TV ... cell phone has no signal, but wireless internet works fine. Incontinuities how you can possibly add? I'm sorry, but this film was nothing but "a shock after shock." All this has been done before. Reflection in the mirror. Things only from the site. Changing the picture. Bleeding walls. "Oh, it was just a dream ... no, it was not." And if the room was "evil," why does our protagonist to get used to the death of his daughter if she would keep him trapped there forever, or so otherwise? It just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> In addition, there was no reference to "the first book," he wrote. Just some vague information about "dad was a jerk" and so on. Speaking of hats that were a little bit about your father? "You'll be in my place." <br /> <br /> In general, really awful movie. It was 100% adrenaline shock factor, without any new or innovative effects and, of course, not the background, character development, etc. <br /> <br /> My general impression is that the entire film was made on the "cheap"; largely using a single set of locations and a couple of shots, and there was nothing but the effects in the film processed, cheese, "it is clear that, to the" effects.
