... you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, do not rent this film. If you want a documentary-squire look at the "hood life" you are in the wrong place, as well. If you are looking for a ridiculous piece of film, it is a real winner! Effective flat as a sheet of paper. The best example of this is, of course, investigating officer drove past. I can say that he did the voice of the operator 911, and the flat tone of his voice. If I could hear the conversation of the carton, it would probably sound like this guy. Oh, and "zombie" did their best impression of the snake, which is on par with their fi action as a whole (note the sarcasm ... it is not to win an Oscar for best MAKE-UP) Quiroz ...... did not make any guide. I felt like I was watching an improvisational part of the period (the period is more like 1990-LA) direction, but the one-uped the worst scenario, I think, ever to decorate a movie. I have not heard such great lines as an epic single word, beginning with the film «F ** to!" After all, Ice Grill, which was another "urban" thriller. This only works, of course, coupled with the well-epic soundtrack of hip-hop! All 3 or so songs out of it! In general, what the hell do you expect from a movie called «Hood of the Living Dead"? I made this film with full intent to make fun of him every scene, and he delivered the boy, and much more! I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys, and laugh at the low-budget horror in (yeah right ...) the movie at night. An unforgettable experience for sure!
