After ten minutes a big fan T.V Â«Stella Street" episodes, I was waiting for this movie with excitement and anticipation. Unfortunately, I left feeling very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was dismayed by the way, that almost all of the gags and liners were directly borrowed from the TV series, and comes with far less enthusiasm and comic timing, and when the actors say them once, and could not be bothered to tell them again. I bought my copy on DVD and felt cheated that I parted with hard earned money to watch the same jokes again. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The film starts with the Stella-Street (in normal English street in Surrey), gradually populated by "some of the stage and screen the most famous people of the last forty years," including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All the celebrities on the street eventually cheated from all his wealth to local fraudster, and forced to live as vagabonds and people, the general working class. There are some good points, but overall, the authors were able to take an interesting idea and make it pretty boring. * END spoilers * <br /> <br /> In T.V episodes, all the characters are played by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including women), but Ronni Ancona film is added to the cast. I think it was a mistake. Its implementation was not funny, and she felt her characters have been included in the history just to give her something to do. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of episodes of Stella-Street, you can find this film interesting. But if you're a fan, I think you can walk away feeling a bit cheated. 4/10
