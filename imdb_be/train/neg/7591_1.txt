This film is based on the novel by John Fante. Can someone please tell me why? I see absolutely no reason why this excellent book should be adapted in such a way. If you want to make a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Farrell and Hayek, how could you make a connection to Ask the Dust (novel)? -And if you want to make the story in the film, then why would you want to do it in a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Farrell and Hayek? I do not understand. <br /> <br /> In the film adaptation of the story are poorly made, and if you read the book and liked it, I'm pretty sure that you do not like what Toney had done to him, <br /> <br /> In the beginning film you might find the odd casting, bad acting and cinematography only slightly exaggerated. But hope for the best. I'm hoping a lot during this movie. I really wanted it to be good. But it only gets worse, and it is as simple as: If you have read Fantes novel or not, this is not a good film. Another romantic melodramatic Hollywood production, combined with bad acting, lack of structure, and - of course. - a lot of shots Colin Farells bare ass <br /> <br /> I could complain a lot more about this film, but why waste my time. I've seen it. All right. I had to see it, because I love this book so much, and it was interesting. And I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 for sweet tendrils Colin at the end of the film. So sweet ... If he wore it constantly until the end, I would give it a 2/10.
