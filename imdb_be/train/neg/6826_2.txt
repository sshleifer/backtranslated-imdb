It's been a long time since I last saw a movie is bad .. the action is very average, the story terribly boring, and I'm at a loss for words as to the execution. It was a very unoriginal. Oh, and it's just a comedy, Schwarzenegger as a pregnant Clint Eastwood! <br /> <br /> One of the first scenes (one of the TV show - where the hell are you) got it right - throw was 80% let's face it - the forgotten actors. If they were in hopes of restarting his career, I think it could never happen to them with this challenge? The script had potential, but not 80% of the actors nor the director (which the actor, and should strictly adhere to an actor) took it off. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed to be better than any of the others <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but if you've ever wondered, watching it. - I strongly encourage you to turn to something less traumatic, because not only is a complete waste of time, but also a weak example of what the movie looks bad.
