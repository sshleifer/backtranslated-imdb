Me and my girlfriend went to see this film as Â«Premiere Surprise", which we bought in the ticket preview in the movie before it was opened here in Denmark. We sat through the 1:00 or so, and then we left! The meaning of the film, it seemed, simply reflect the era (and Club 54), but he did it in the expense of character development that was not there, and a plot that was not enough. <br /> <br /> Rarely have I been so indifferent to the characters in the movie! <br /> <br /> Music was good, though. So if you want to hear good music and get your fix of what the mood of the 70 years I think it is normal. But do not wait to get the plot believable characters. <br /> <br />
