Those listening to one of those old-time radio, something children of the 1950s to the present day will be watching on TV. However, they are not television, if this cartoon was made, so that people get their entertainment - from music to comedy horror stories - from the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom literally shaking in his boots, listening to some story about the "phantom". He's actually literally does everything the narrator says, for example, "hair on end, icy chills racing down her back, her heart beating in my throat," etc. Jerry, meanwhile, watching Tom and his laughter example in his Scaredy -. feline antics <br /> <br /> After that we will get a taste of what we will see for years afterwards 194- cartoon in which Jerry Tom torture for no reason other than the sadistic pleasure. If the cat is asking for trouble, that's one thing, but when he ignored his own business and Jerry physically (and in this case, mind) to swear, I have a hard time rooting for the "little man." <br /> <br /> These early efforts of T & M have also been moments longer than all that has been. Sometimes that one minute counts. He has done here as it actually dragged on for some time. It could be reduced to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches went too long. It's common for Tom and Jerry. As a rule, they are much faster pace.
