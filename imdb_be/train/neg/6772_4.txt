Yes, because when the coat of arms made its first appearance, I was quite happy watching Dean Jones mug away. I just wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat too much butter popcorn. Now, unfortunately, I have expectations riveting / beautiful story every time I watch the film, if I'm not on any kind of medication. And this is another good film for medical. There are no big laughs, does not display complex storylines, no complicated bends. Herbie Fully Loaded great for a full load. <br /> <br /> It was the first time I saw La Lohan on the screen, as it has changed places with Jamie Lee Curtis (I thought she was beautiful in it), and I can not say that I I was very impressed with this together. In addition it is constantly changing, and unhappy unnatural hair color, it just does not ring true, like a child in the neighborhood, who had spent all his life hanging around road racer. Her "need for speed" is not been represented consistently in the movie - maybe it was somewhere else - she looked older than her part, and always seemed to be looking for something on (and Togs designer party a new place to spend the money ?? ) set. I could not see any chemistry with Justin Long; that the novel seemed obligatory at best. The only time when Lindsay appeared engaged when she interacted with Matt Dillon, which I thought was appropriate over as the Evil Bad Guy Trip Murphy. <br /> <br /> It was great to see the coat of arms, and I loved the film intro with the material from the old movies. If Disney jumped out of the car with some 53 jewelry, I might wear some just to be loyal. His new feature (?) Was a little inconsistent (he channel the thoughts of his driver? Whether it is now a skateboard?), But no matter. We all knew it was going to end, but I want it to be to end up with someone a little less sluggish than Maggie. And my head still hurts from this lesson, Maggie, and we spectators were killed back home. <br /> <br /> What would a movie cost? There is an old Herbie in real stories from real story - at least, Herb as well as the fate - but it is clear that asking for too much. Why is it that Disney always returns to the same well as "Herbie Goes Bananas" and "This Computer Wore Tennis Shoes", when it comes to innovation? <br /> <br /> I'm sure it was a great film for children and those with any expectations. For the rest of us .... that if you have "flu, and can not simply take over the suspension of the rear window.
