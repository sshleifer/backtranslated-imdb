The concept of a legal gray area in love crime contributes about 10% of the film's appeal; the remaining 90% can be attributed to a flagrant bad Ness. To say that performance Sean Young as the so-called district attorney wooden gross understatement. With its soothing costumes and excessive hair gel, Young does a decent job to convince the audience of their pious hatred of men. Why else would she ask her only one to represent as a prostitute just so it could arrest the police officers who are trying to raise them? This hatred is the only reason why she stubbornly pursues perverted photographer who gives women the contractual thrills and driving force behind this bad movie. Looking Young come from frigid to full frontal nudity does little to raise interest, but she throws a tantrum while standing next to the fire, the lake does. Watching her rant and rave about his self-loathing and sexual frustration makes criminal love is worth the rent, but it's all downhill from there to. Despite her desire to bring the character of Patrick Bergin to justice, it completely avoid the skills of police work it in the grip of his weary lust and passion. Patrick Bergin does a decent enough job as irritable sociopath; when he was working in bed with the enemy, he sure as hell can work at it. But I can not help but wonder if the Young noticeable lack of energy leads to conflicts with his film tack. I believe that it does, and the result is a "thriller" with a thrill that thoroughly bad, and yet comic.
