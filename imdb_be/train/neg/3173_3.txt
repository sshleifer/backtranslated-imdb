This film is like a game called "Blithe Spirit", written by Noel Coward. The plot of the ghost of his wife and the media is closely related to the work of Coward. I'm surprised that this kind of movies do not recognize the concept of the original writer. I understand that the public may not be aware that it is a fake, but it's there. <br /> <br /> Garden. These movies are so expensive to produce. I cheered up when the script is original. I perk up even if it is an innovative way to produce work that was previously released. Some samples were referred to (e.g., Topper, etc.). <br /> <br /> I understand that cinema is still relatively affordable form of entertainment. Nevertheless, I am not pleased when the taste of the audience is taken for granted. In this situation, forget the taste of the public. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to get a better production of the movie entertainment. <br /> <br /> In this case. I prefer to see the game.
