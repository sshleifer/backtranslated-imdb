Minute started forward, I knew we were in trouble! The premise is ridiculous at best. The storyline was even worse, if possible. <br /> <br /> acts were hard, and the actors gave off a feeling of inexperience. You expect more from the likes of Slater, Reid and Dorff. The lines were delivered as from the robot. And I'm sorry, I love Reid, but it was really incredible, as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff picked a lousy movie, to try to put them to return. <br /> <br /> continuity was expelled through out the entire film. These creatures were not bad, but they really have not been good. <br /> <br /> In the end, I want to ninety minutes of my life back. They can keep the money, but give me time! What a waste.
