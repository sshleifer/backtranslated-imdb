RUN ... do not walk away from this movie !!!!! Aimed at very young children, this film will bore you to tears. If Gamera trilogy 90s has raised the bar, this movie just dropped it. It's a slow pace and fight the monster well, but rarely seen. This film was my attempts cat box. Just a very poor offering after a phenomenal 90-series. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS for this item !!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top 10 reasons Gamera fans Series 90 hate this movie. <br /> <br /> 10. This film is a drama that follows the child, trying to cope with his mother's death and is afraid of losing a child to fight Gamera after knowing his father saw an adult Gamera dies. <br /> <br /> 9. You can see that adult Gamera per minute, can be, at the very beginning of the film. He gets his ass pushed several Gyaos and self-destructs ??? He looks old and dull. In addition, it does not look like any Gamera you've ever seen. His suit looked expensive and away we go. <br /> <br /> 8. Young Gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a Pokemon. Big eyes and cute ... it will remind you of child with Godzilla Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera is too cute. <br /> <br /> 7. This film has paced view NASCAR race for 3 hour delay rain. I watched this movie with 2 other supporters Gamera, and no one was happy with how slow the film moves forward. I saw an SUV full of fat people walking up the mountain road to move faster. <br /> <br /> 6. As Godzilla: Final Wars, the film was very little Kaiju time on the screen. The final war was much more, in fact, and is fighting better, though short. <br /> <br /> 5. The children take the leading role. All children each topic and writing a bad form of Gamera killed the original series in the 1970s and the story is repeated in the 2000s. The most successful films of Gamera has left a feeling of Sesame Street and went into a dark place. Why go back to a failed formula? This was to be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue (thank God). <br /> <br /> 4. Gamera lost pictorial moat. Now it sounds like an elephant with strep throat. <br /> <br /> 3. This film can produce a new Olympic event ..... Imagine the baton, which includes sending very small children in danger. You should see the ending to understand this point of view. Where were the parents? About yea..right there send their children to the zone Kaiju battle. <br /> <br /> 2. The special effects were good, but a subpar movie Gamera. Legion and Iris were the best effects. The best effect, which shows the size of the baby apple Gamera fly. Not too impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This film is simply not something that adults Kaiju fans waiting. Director participated in the Power Rangers, and it shows. He comes off as a cross between ET, Always: Sunset on Third Street and TMNT. Kudos, you know all 3 links. <br /> <br /> For Rent in the best case or watching a time when you buy it, to complete the DVD series.
