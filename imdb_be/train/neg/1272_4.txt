Did anyone else notice every time they are in the car every time the camera takes a new angle they switch the road. Like in one scene is one track with a residential sidewalks, they are close to a multiple highway divider, near a two-lane country road with double yellow stripes. I can see a low budget, but it was just a sloppy film work. <br /> <br /> I also read the other reviews and do not agree that this is a bad movie. I think that if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy, then you can enjoy this film. If, however, you will find your work / not funny, then I would recommend staying away from it.
