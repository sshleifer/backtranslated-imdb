When you get your hands on the British film are you waiting for some money. And when it comes to action, camera work, lighting, etc .; this film does business. This is done by highly skilled craftsmen. This in itself can bring you a nice one and a half hours. But when you look beneath the layers of professionalism, you do not really find anything. Besides making you feel good and promote liberal drugs, there's really nothing there. The script is mediocre, the plot is predictable and the end has to be one of the worst to the east of Hollywood. In general, it is English comfort, it is simply a shameful and cynical attempt to make another «Full Monty». Why did they make this movie? I have not got a clue, except for making money, of course.
