Rather than to leave things as they were completely finished, they went on to produce it; the first installment of this franchise apply sorely lacking character. <br /> <br /> This film never should have happened. It is not intended for there was the fourth film in this line, and it sure shows. The premise is idiotic and the images were the same. <br /> <br /> After the wonderful experience that was The Omen, it was a big disappointment, which stank 70 cheese and hardcore action. It was like The Amityville Horror in those aspects, and leave awful stench stored for a long time after it was finished. <br /> <br /> It is the rate of 1.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
