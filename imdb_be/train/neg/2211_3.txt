Hahaha !!!!!! The funny thing is missing this film in one word.What shit, it is a "thing", since it might kill me to use the word movie!?!?! I hope that the director, writer, producer does not mean that it was good, because it's really not a scientist !!! turned his son in hammerhead shark, shark and kill a bunch of people, scientist invited to the island !!! Oh Gooooooodddd !!!! I hate this movie so much that when I watched it, I was laughing all the major parts because they were so corny and unprofessional .... and they could not do sharks seem more unreal, even though it " thing "was a little larger budget than most low-budget movies.All I have to say, watching this film, which is waiting to laugh at all the bad actions, and stupid banal dialogue, because if you are waiting for a good movie you" will be sorely disappointed.
