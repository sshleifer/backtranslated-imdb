I made this film to think today, that it may be a good football movie, because I'm a big fan of football. Boy, I was wrong. This film is very religious and instructive, and it is really unrealistic. This film is very much to say that if your a Christian, you can get anything you want in life is easy, how to become a great player! You do not become a great football player, as a Christian, and ask God, you're doing it in practice and hard work. All you have to do is ask God, and he will give you something .... PUH-lys. That is not true spirit. I laughed a few times because of this difficulty. The only part that was funny was when they were dumb (Schultz cartoonist? No, dude, that was flying over the Atlantic, etc, etc ..), but in fact this film was not so great. I do not recommend, especially if you're not a Christian, lol.
