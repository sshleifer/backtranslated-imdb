Im the type of person who always goes the horror section 2, when I choose a film, so I chose five through my eyes, I was disgusted with this film and thought that there was no story line, and it makes no sense, so you can enjoy it, it I made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch movies that are simply encourage violence in the hell it was low budget and very bad! I think I could have done better with yourself. I think it was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, and you should not worry to see his actors rubbish camera was awful the picture was poor, and the sound was not up to scratch, I think it was a little bit as a cheap rip off of the baler, which project and it did not work at all, it was a foul.
