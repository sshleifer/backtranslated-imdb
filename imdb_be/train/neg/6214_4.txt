What ?! ?? Why do people say is "afraid?" Just before this ending at the end of the worst in the history of cinema! 4 Left and the world over! Not to mention the character of 9 was an idiot constantly, he received all killed. 1 was right all along when he donated 9, it is not because it would not have happened. People giving there lives a stupid reason, and for what? ... make it rain? I acknowledge that the film was his part, and the whole concept was exciting. But much of it was stamps one by one. And did anyone else get the feeling that it is a lot like "Lord of the Rings?" Characters died for stupid reasons, there was almost no development of character, and honestly ask ourselves what is good to have just four guys who were in the world; it is pointless and stupid. It was one of the short films I have ever seen, and thank God! As robots turn against creative people in any case! This was done as a hundred times! This film is really stupid, go see a movie that is worth a look as Star Trek, The Hangover, and Inglourious Basterds, it was a good movie!
