!!!! NEKREKI POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> When I watched the first half GUILTY AS SIN I can not believe that this was done in 1993, because he played like Jagged Edge / Eszterhas clone from the mid 80s. It begins with a murder and `s left for the audience muse" Whether he is guilty or not guilty, and he will go to bed with your lawyer? "But halfway through the movie it shows his early 90s office, turning it into a" Lawyer gets manipulated and persecuted its customers' type of film, which ends in a funny way, and GUILTY AS SIN is even more ridiculous the end in this respect. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad thriller, but the most unforgivable thing is that it was directed Sidney Lumet's the same man who brought us to continually classic courtroom drama 12 Angry Men
