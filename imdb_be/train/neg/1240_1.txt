I think everyone was very disappointed with this sci-fi movie. On the one hand, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing is that it's a remake, what should be a classic. I found it boring, rude, and funny. If you saw it, you know what I mean. Almost everything on the IMDb say this crap, and boy, they were right! If you do not, avoid it. It Khrapoun. 1 10.
