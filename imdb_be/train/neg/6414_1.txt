It is in a much worse cr4p piece I've ever seen in my life. It hardly made sense. It was not scary at all (unless you class scary as loud noises and screaming?) Sarah Michelle Gellar must stop these horror movies sh1tty. I think that everything else in the movie agreed with me when I shouted "Shit", when loans are rolled up. <br /> <br /> The list of the worst films ever, as it were: <br /> <br /> 1. Return 2. Fever 3. Silent Hill <br /> <br /> The reason I did Silent Hill third, because he showed some frightening scenes, but otherwise was an absolute cr4p. Same with irritability, it does not make sense, but the return exceeded this list. Its worse than Silent Hill and fever together
