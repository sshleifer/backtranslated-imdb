Check spoiler alert just in case. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the worst films I have ever seen, Mazes and Monsters felt that I wasted 101 minutes of my life. Only redemptive quality of the film were scenes that were trying to be serious, but ultimately funny because they were so bad. Evil Dead anyone? Unfortunately for the M & M (luckily for us) it did not develop a cult and lead to a trilogy. This film tries to solve a number of problems that the main character, Robbie (played by Hanks) that occur throughout the film. End, that a video of kindling fear stereotypes that helped fuel R & D is devil's movement in the 80s. <br /> <br /> If you want to avoid wasting time and money, stay away from this stuff. <, Br /> <br /> PS - Even though the cover looks curious, so I believe that my brother bought it, it does not happen in the fantasy field, except for New England or New York, to be such a place.
