I confess - Emma, ​​in my opinion, is the only greatest novel ever written. This is as close to perfection as any mortal creature may be. Jane Austen reaches the top of his art here <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is at best a palimpsest <br /> <br /> Comparing version Gwyneth Paltrow is inevitable. -. This version is much more faithful to the spirit of witty books and much more pleasant to look <br /> <br /> There are some good elements here -. Kate Berkinsale (and previously played Flor Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, obviously smarter spiritual twin Emma) Emma is excellent. Raymond Coulthard makes a corresponding decorative Frank Churchill. Manufacturing beautiful, but the interiors are too dark. <br /> <br /> However, there are several major problems. Mark Strong first - in the first place, he is not looking directly at Mr. Knightley. This is possible because it plays a role in picky Victorian father. This is bad false. <br /> <br /> The second problem is the length. Simply put, the film is too short - to get the right kind of feeling, you will need twice as long <br /> <br /> And finally, the most important thing is the quality of adaptation of Austen's dream .. adapter - all the dialogue already there. It should be pruned down and is only properly. Andrew Davis seems to think otherwise. First, it's pretty grim film, and the last thing Emma to be gloomy. More important, Davis thought it necessary to rewrite the ending as a kind of a bucolic holiday. That the planet, or minor work of Thomas Hardy, this come from? It's out of style and the spirit of the novel. And I believe that it is extremely presumptuous to try to make improvements, -. Improve <br /> <br /> See Paltrow version, or playing Kate in Cold Comfort Farm.
