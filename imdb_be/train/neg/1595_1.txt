The film seemed to me to appeal for a new type of Pokemon Celebi. But the story came out, of course, and it was not as interesting as the other movies. It was a waste of money and time. The same banal humor and clich√© bad guys. The film was not used to do, if you want to make the famous Pokemon. The film should better not associated with anime, such as DragonBallZ, Digimon, or Yu-Gi-Oh. Picture settings and do not have the level of growth to the original anime standards. It is a shame even to speak about this movie. I bet Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the results of the film and give up Pokemon. Digimon more of the anime and do not fall anywhere close to the other films in Pokemon.It out in late 2002.
