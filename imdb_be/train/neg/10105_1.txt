Zombie Nation 2004 R <br /> <br /> Hey, I was bored. I looked in my Comcastic boxes to find a movie to watch. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. He says the director has some cult in the description. Funny how he did not warn me to watch this movie. I could use this advice. <br /> <br /> Zombie Nation just like Troll 2 is that it is totally misnamed. He has little (if anything, depending on your point of view) to do with zombies, and happens all within the same city. The film revolves around a crooked cop, which acts as much as possible (it should try to suck this much), while it arrests woman over trivial nonsense, and then kills them. Yes, he's a serial killer cop. Not only that, this film is broken, thinking it was a zombie flick, he also gets her serial killer facts completely wrong. Serial killers like to kill, they live for it, and they get down and personal with him. This guy knocks the woman, and to introduce them to some kind of poison. He did not even have sex with the corpse, or divide it. Talk about boring! In the end, one of the unusual five women he kills is protected by Voodoo did it and for no apparent reason, all five came to life and head to kill this guy. All of them were buried or dumped into the ocean, but you do not know what to buy a sharp clean clothes they wear. Women then are very bad, and take revenge. Oh yay. <br /> <br /> This film was shit in each category. Acting shit, shit letters, sets crappier and crappier effects makeup. Women do not look like a zombie, except very dark eye make-up to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie. All of them can speak, behave, think and act in a completely human. Blood is weak compared to even many PG-13 films and nudity for short. You see a glimpse of the breasts in the opening sequence ... Then the exact same bumps later! Go figure it out. Guess only one actress was ready to go topless on the vulgar. The police station is so poorly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse, they are obviously filmed. You can see the pipes and poor lighting and the setting is too sparse, and even if you are blind, you can see the director fails. Stay away, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> 1/10
