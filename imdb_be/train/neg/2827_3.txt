A story from the very beginning of an interesting: slavery in the (end) of the 20th century from West Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem with it is that it deliberately castigates two favorite enemies directed by Richard Fleischer in: the Arabs and Germans. In order to make us believe that the very Arab-looking people will move freely and easily catch Blacks in West Africa as believable as Whites hunt slaves in the "Roots". Obviously, both transactions / governed by local residents, and include (D) a much more complex network. While Arab countries involved in the modern child and sex trafficking in Israel is one of the worst offenders according to Amnesty International. So why only show on the Arabs, and then choose German as the only European customer? This is an obvious bias and hatred of the Jewish people by the director. <br /> <br /> action is above average, especially Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) well, as always.
