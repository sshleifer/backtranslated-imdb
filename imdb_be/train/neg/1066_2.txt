I saw "Paris Je t'aime», because a friend really wanted to see him, so I went along with it. Walking, I was indifferent about the film, but leaving the theater, I really regretted spending his life 2:00, sitting through this cool production. The "history" almost completely forgotten the fact that most of them were terrible, but. What Gena Rowlands and Gazzara has to do with Paris? An endless parade of American actors definitely gave it a French film is strange, is not a French feel. Clichés about Paris were endless. So, most of them playing with clichés about Paris, but spending so much time making fun of French clichés, they are directly and, unfortunately, contributes to them again. So, Paris is the city of love. . We get it <br /> <br /> worst segments were: one director Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); one with Nick Nolte; MIM one (worst?); hair products alone; one of Juliette Binoche (Willem Dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of Paris?); a vampire (When I think of Paris, I think Elijah Wood). One of Natalie Portman, who really looked like Mentos advertising and it was stupid (blind young man needs to know just Portman plays the role if she called him). On and on it went. He felt infinitely. <br /> <br /> I do not like the Coen Bros one as well. He is really playing with these clichés Parisien, but I did not find it funny. Just annoying. Gus Van Sant has been an interesting one, but it was so small (and the culmination was obvious) that it barely registered. <br /> <br /> There were only two "successful" segments, and they were one of the immigrant nanny who leaves her child in kindergarten only to nurse the baby for a rich woman. Good irony. And segments of the Africans who stabbed. This is the best segment in the entire film, but this segment has nothing to do with Paris. The story could take place in any city around the world. <br /> <br /> the last segment, one of the plump middle-aged woman was also interesting varieties, but the underlying tone was bad. They wanted to celebrate her limited understanding of French, but the segment came out as condescending. <br /> <br /> The whole project felt forced and inspiration. Almost like the French government sponsored this film to promote tourism. Overall, only about 10 to 15 minutes of interesting, «Paris Je t'aime» was awesome cinematic experience.
