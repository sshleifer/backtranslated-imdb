Suffice it to say that - despite the odd ridiculous eulogy of his Soi disant «ability» located here - the director of this stupid, odious nonsense not made a film since. Well, that is great news, as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br /> Dead Babies has all the bile of its creator, but lacks the intelligence and technical skills that make the novelist Martin Amis readable. <, Br /> <br /> If the British film industry wake up and realize that if he wants to regain the status he once he had to stop the production of garbage like this and do something real people really want to watch? <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague.
