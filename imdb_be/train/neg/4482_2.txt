Perfect little brutality ... I doubt that if one shot lasted longer in reglamentary-MTV 4.4 seconds. Woeful casting, even worse than in Kusminsky version (reminder: he managed to Juliette Binoche miscast and Ralph Feinnnes). But, hey, the rich got what they deserved. Dark and brooding Heathcliff is reduced to the state of the gold locked angel, delicate and Angellic Catherine presented as plump breasts melon Heffer, good-natured and weak Linton is the radar, and the innocent Isabel becomes a character, Sarah Michelle Gellar, from cruelty, 15-year-old Eddie Bauer Abercrombie and Fitch Donners-notice. This thing has been done for you. It's an hour-and-a-half long music video, where everything is given to you; you are saved from the uncomfortable need not even trying to understand the complexity of the characters, but even from the initial shock at his actions. Actors tried, but, as I said, they were miscasted. Decent photos, but editing at TV production class in high school. I pray all: read a book, or even cliffnotes; view previous versions of this, even Kusminsky-x; but stay away from many future iterations, during which you will not benefit from the commercial-free premiere.
