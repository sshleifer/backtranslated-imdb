Back in the day, I remembered seeing a dumb comic Nintendo Power, which had the same design as the show ... and then came up with the word that the show was coming to a TV near me! I was not Estatic, but interesting ... I was wondering how bad this show is going to suck. My friends all said that this show had no real value and was too stupid for straight people like me to enjoy (I'm actually gay), so I decided to watch the show with low expectations. <br /> <br /> What a horrible experience !!!!!!!!!!! Firstly, I hate new characters. Tiff and Tuff so stupid and I hate how many fans are drooling over Tiff, it's boring. I hate how they did Chef Kalasaki (or whatever his name was nonstraight) nice guy who owned the restaurant. Bad move, 4Kids TV! Escargoon nothing other than loser adviser to King Dedede (which sucks big time in this show), and I hate a person, that one of the company which holds the supply Dedede with this terrible weapon to kill Kirby. So stupid, I hate this show. <br /> <br /> Then I began to hate Kirby even more, since it was obviously Nintendo, Kirby eager to get some popularity. Kirby'll never beat Mario in the fight for coolness, and Kirby will ever be anything other than a tiny cream puff fun. NUF SAID !!!
