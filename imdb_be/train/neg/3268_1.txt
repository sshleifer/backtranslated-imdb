This is a real challenge to make a film about a child eats wild canines and mother wrongfully accused of killing fun, but in spite of all this one has time. Meryl Streep gives the performance of his life, melodramatic, overwrought, but with the comic genius who keeps you laughing even as a mother grappling with the ultimate horror. <br /> <br /> If a comedy about absorption babies dogs are not your cup of tea, you may be uncomfortable to watch it and, yes, it's an odd choice for a farce topics, but in fact very little of the film has nothing to do so, it focuses on the provision of a strip showcases for her Australian accent and personality distortion. <br /> <br /> Throwing in an evil media bias and sensationalism and contempt for any truth or ethics gives the film a chance to make a bold point that these things are bad.
