Words really can not describe how bad this film. I thought that Zandana was bad, but at least there were some good shots and sometimes a good chin, stroking the moment here and there to stop you from nodding off. That's ridiculous! Scary scenario, bad direction, hardcore action and you know what? I can not think of one thing to recommend it, except that it is not too long. If you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment, book yourself a dentist and have root canal work - (! Provided that you need it) is much more enjoyable and much better value for money and quality. By the way, I need to print 10 lines of text to complete this survey - PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS FILM. This is terrible!
