Stranger than fiction made me angry, so I signed up for IMDb simply write this review. Stranger than fiction surprisingly complex, touching and thought-provoking film until the very end. After you suspend some illogicality (why not Will Ferrell hear the voice of Emma Thompson, 10 years ago, when she fist started writing your book? "The phone rang. The phone rang again." How could she not know that it was he calling? And etc ..), the film puts his thoughts on death, fate, and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> A brief history of literary topic, subject, especially Dustin Hoffman must entertain former English major. And Maggie Zhillenhol always nice, even though Will Ferrell may just as easily be an ax murderer as clumsy soul. Its rapid trust its powerful big leap of faith. <br /> <br /> Oh, but the ending. Until the end, I would not give a 9 out of 10 stars in the film. The film as a metaphor for life's journey, as a tribute to the concept of "write exactly" as a reminder of that great literature is either a comedy or a tragedy, but not both, is outstanding. The entire film leads the viewer to understand and take a moment of destiny in the Will Ferrell . and no matter how cute character, he might have become, we know why we do not accept the end. The last act takes place, the screen goes white, titles. A deep and powerful end to an almost perfect film. The end, which would be discussed in a few weeks. <br /> <br /> nOT !!!!!!!!!! Loans are not rolling . Say it is not so Say Hollywood sun tack on another 10 minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and the heart of the film Dustin Hoffman got it right when he said:.. "This is not a masterpiece, it's okay." Inclined movie review . Except for me, it was not even in order. I was so outraged about the treason to "write like that," the decision to indulge in a movie that I actually pour out the angry tears that explain it on the way home from a movie. I do not often cry. I could care less about most movies, but I'm still angry about that one <br /> <br /> My questions Zack Helm, writer, this :. I made the original ending of the film when the screen turns white? And you are made to fresh movie states that-be changed tack entered the core of the film? Or you tack tearful ending for yourself? I read you're a genius. I hope that your original script to complete the film for the first time. <br /> <br /> I know that Zach Helm will never see this review and I could not find a contact for him to ask himself. But please moviegoers, I'm the only one who feels this way about STRANGER fiction? One good thing came to me to see this movie: I half admire translation difficulties today.
