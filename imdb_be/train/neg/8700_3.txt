I very much hope that the Concorde / New Horizons is not trying to make a serious horror, thriller, or even when they did carnosaurs 3. Film stupid thins from start to finish. Even the humor in C3's funny because it's bad. Defined high assessment of water in the "so bad it's good" genre. If you love the worst of the worst, this is for you.
