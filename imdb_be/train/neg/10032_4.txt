The storyline is fine. Akshay Kumar was good as always, and it was the only good thing about the film. Kareena Kapoor looked bad. There was so much hue and cry over her size zero, but it does not look good leaner. I do not know why the hell, Anil Kapoor took such a bad role. There was nothing much to do in the film to him. Just because it's a film Yashraj does not mean that the actor must take the role, but it's bad. Said Ali Khan was in order. I think it is time that Indian directors and producers are beginning to think Indian customers as a reasonable deal. What are we? fools !!!! What do they think, that they will show two men take on the special squad to Teeters and we will believe. Is Indian police so stupid that they are trying to steal some criminals .... they occupy the entire squad 100+ police and no one was there to surround the palace. The action was shit, and I've never seen such a bad thing. Akshay Kumar was among a circle of 30-40 policemen shooting at him ..... and he shot back at them. None of the police bullets did not touch him, but he killed all the police. Shit. Shit. <br /> <br /> I think that the fight director, who thought the scene should take retirement. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend not to see this movie.
