As a relative, which gives you a bad gift, Soul Survivors has its heart in the right place, but the trip with a bad performance. Stephen Carpenter writing / directing effort borrows freely from other, better films, such as Jacob's Ladder and Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). For those who have not seen any of these movies, I will not give away the room; Suffice it to say that it is not so well treated than in the two top films. <br /> <br /> Seyzhmiller stars as Cassie to go to college. Her current boyfriend Sean (Ben Affleck) and former boyfriend Matt (Wes Bentley), and friends, and Annabelle (Dushku pungent) in a car accident after being pursued by the two killers (?) In the transparent masks. She survives wreck, but at that time in college learning is a vision of the suffering of the hospital and the dead people appear and disappear, leaving him in a state of utter confusion: who died? Anyone alive? What is real? <br /> <br /> Soul Survivors looks bad-been there, done that, of Gore filled with blood splattered, body styling teen exploitation flick. True, it has its share of scenes killer-annoying-The-sacrifice (rich repeats, and intoxicating), but at least he is trying to build suspense through the idea, not punches, unfortunately, quite unsuccessfully. This generates confusion more often than unity, as the story becomes jumbled, messy and incoherent near points secrets (predictable as it is.) <br /> <br /> Horror fans who pick up will not have any idea they in the course of the film, which is more concerned with building a daunting facade of reality than the body count delivery. Carpenter merit for trying to create something beyond the teen horror flick derivative; It is a pity that he has created a derivative psychological thriller. Sagemiller also deserves credit for showing strength in the central performance, in fact, the development of her character, and causing a sense of emotion, like unraveling Cassie. It's great that the filmmakers are trying something different, but the film ends with a mixed bag and failed experiment. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
