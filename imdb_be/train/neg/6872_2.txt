This show was very good stories, but bad dialogue. The main character was particularly annoying. It is obvious why this show was canceled, although, like most of the UPN show, I never knew that was not even born until he was in syndicated re-runs. <br /> <br /> Most of the sites it appeared to be copied from other shows and movies, leading me to think, manufacturers do not have an original idea in his head. <br /> <br /> I did not comment enough. You must have at least ten lines of text. The special effect is not bad for the 2001 show. <br /> <br /> Gnome was a good character.
