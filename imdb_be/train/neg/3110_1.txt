I usually come on this site before going to the movies, I'd like to see what other people think about the movie. I read a lot of reviews that say not a thriller horror film. This prompted me to give this film a try. I do have to take issue with this "/ horror thriller" statement, as it was not! I nearly went and asked for their money back, and if you do a lot of reviewers liked this garbage .... and you should be easily satisfied! At the end of the film, the people behind me said loudly, "What a waste of time," and I turned to him and said, "I could not have summed it up best," I'm waiting for something ... but it is not so was the potential of many.. good panic (or thrills, if you like), but neither happened. Williams played the role well enough, but I felt he was cheated a bad script that fluttered around and did not go anywhere. Save your money people, this turkey which will point to a DVD-shop "transaction field" next to you in the very near future!
