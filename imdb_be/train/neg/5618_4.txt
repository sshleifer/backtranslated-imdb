I'm really surprised at the amount of good ratings this anti-Christian pseudo-documentary received. Now, I respect the opinion of a guy and faith, I do not, in this state, believes the student of Christian doctrine. Nevertheless, anti-Christian propaganda of a different issue. <br /> <br /> This film has the real items, but they are very few and are presented in a very biased context. I do not recommend against its view. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide whether they believe it or not. And it's actually a better chance than the one the director gives the Christian doctrine. Instead inquisitive approach on this issue, it looks like a personal vendetta on the Christian school, which affected his childhood. It also distorts the Christians most of the time, no matter how incredibly naive or fundamentalists, Sun moderation between the two. <br /> <br /> The director uses film scenes from the Passion of Christ without authorization, establishes an interview with the director of his former school and is almost exclusively anti-Christian historians and writers. I actually was the Director of the school to be the most down to earth person and I think that his attitude was completely justified. I also very much doubt that any of the Christians who consulted an epilogue or even said before the interview for the purpose of the investigation were interviewed were conducted. <br /> <br /> At the same time, as they say, there are, of course, new and interesting facts to be here and some very original ideas on the subject of Christianity. But the way in which made the whole brain is often offensive, very unprofessional and extremely biased.
