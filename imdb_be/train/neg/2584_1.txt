So, American Pie Presents: Beta House American Pie is the sixth film in the series. Although, in fact, it has nothing to do with the original three American Pie films with the exception of some of the characters have to be connected with the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy in it (not the guy to get the best concerts?). <br /> <br /> There is very little to praise the film. There's no funny jokes. Act painful to watch, especially the girl with the "southern" accent, which sounds more as the epitome of Canadian women in the UK, making it appear to be a mountaineer, using the word "ya'll." This movie makes me feel like an idiot. Why did not I apply to college, where nobody goes into a class (but everyone gets good grades), girls regularly take their clothes off in public places, everyone is promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of children and sexually transmitted diseases, and you can ejaculate all over family photos the girl without her Minding? Indeed, this series of standards has dropped to erotic porn. Maybe for the next, they finally break down and hire Ron Jeremy as moderator. I'm sure they can simply attach it to the series, making it the third character of Stifler's uncle once removed or something like that.
