I am very surprised that this film will get a rating like this! I have not seen such a bad movie for years.Omg it was a very bad movie. Splatter, are not enough to describe the unnecessary (almost comical) scene of blood). If you do not like or hostel2 Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) ..well it is 10 times worse. History reminds me of RL Stine goosebumps.! <br /> <br /> I can not say about the acting, because the script was so terrible.Clich√© constantly. (Why should I write 10lines? I never understood this.) <br /> <br /> == spoilers here == <br /> <br /> The story of the butcher is killing people all the time in the subway. We are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notified. In fact, these people are just not enough. And there's a good guy who is trying to solve the puzzle (well, there is no mystery to us, because we know from the beginning of the bad guy), and, as usual, no one believes him! what a surprise! In the end, he puts a butcher clothes and fights to the death of a butcher murderer!
