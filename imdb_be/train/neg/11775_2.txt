Watching «Kroko» I would like to leave a lot of the movie for the first time in my life. I would not recommend watching this film: flat protagonists - absolutely no development, for example, German Kroko metaphorical problem child remains pure metaphor without the possibility of positive participation, in spite of the several plot wise likely to do so. Uninspired actors entirely releasing the story. I think that the film tried to environmental due diligence, but nothing happened: the camera appeared shaky and not motivated. Photos were low - contrast, gray and dark - I am sure that consciously, but components do not add up to a convincing impression of the social environment. History had some potential, though, he could make a good novel.
