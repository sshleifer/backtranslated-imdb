It's not so much that little self-ignition capability. Indeed, under the name of the studied phenomenon is very intriguing and, at least in the first half, this effort Tobe Hooper promises to entertain in a way only a cheesy 90's horror could. But somewhere in between, again, again Dourif performance and overly complex plot, is the future thriller loses its way. <br /> <br /> Dourif, shown here before its built-in fan base of horror gathered, average guy, Sam. Of course, the average guys do not stay in the middle for a long time in a horror movie, so that after a well-made origin of the sketches, we see different parts of Sam's body begin to light up. Soon he igniting other people as well, much to the dismay of gal pal Lisa, I played unmemorably Cynthia Bain. <br /> <br /> While the title of the film implies fire happy monster on the loose, director Hooper chose Sam to be an unwitting assassin. This approach gives the film an added depth of the human it would otherwise be missing, but it also prevents us from really afraid of human flamethrower. We can only guess, it is whether it would have worked better as a straight-up villain force-against-all ala Nightmare on Elm Street. <br /> <br /> Auto-ignition pretty rated force when all is said and done. He will wear the added attraction for fans Dourif and those who can not get enough of the horror of the 1990s, whether good, bad, or in between, but only at a slow night.
