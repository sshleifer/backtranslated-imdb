During the first 3 seasons Magic parents were as tasty as candy, bright and sweet and addictive. Now it's as tasty as Pepto-Bismol. And, unfortunately, Pepto-Bismol that's what you need after watching later episodes where all the sweets have been replaced by icons and violence as a result of laughs. Cosmo, once one of the most endearing characters Nick handed in abusive unfunny idiot that throwing Family Guy does not even want to know. Those became selfish arrogant jerkwad, Bart Simpson gleefully beat the snot out of (and given snottiness Tiogo that would be a lot of beatings). And poor Wanda ... a real charmer who has been the victim of her husband and godson, she now has the attribute of "cut" for the care of the welfare of others. Cosmo plus stupidity hurts everyone else, but he was never punished for it, he also did not learn the lessons. Which pretty much sums up the attitude of Butch Hartman for children: they are rude, vulgar and not too bright. Thank goodness this lousy toon was canceled, along with the road Butch Hartman, Danny Phantom. At least Butch got what he deserved - in contrast to the Cosmo.
