(Very light spoilers, maybe.) <br /> <br /> Usually supporter Diane Keaton, I tried to see it today. I had to remove it to two, because I was absolutely no sympathy for her daughter or mother. And came across as self-centered, with little concern for others, and his daughter is also adding to the rude, disrespectful and unreasonable to the mix. When the daughter died, the only thing I was thinking, "At least we will not have more to look at her." Keaton did a good job of moving into her stunned state and sadness, but it was too far for me then. I just did not enjoy it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to take care of the main character, you need to take care of my characters much earlier - if it is almost an hour, and I do not care, it's too late <br /> <br /> supported. cast was sincere and played well - I felt to * them * - and hilarious best friend was great, but even taken together, it was not enough to carry the film for me.
