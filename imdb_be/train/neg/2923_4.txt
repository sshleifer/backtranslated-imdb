The plot was quite interesting, with the background of the Russian Revolution. I also enjoyed seeing Budapest, the film was partially filmed there. Unfortunately, there was zero chemistry between the two main characters, so it was hard to believe in the love story between them. Love scenes were forced and mechanical. Jordan kirckland was really hard, almost icy. Rob Stewart was very charming and boyish, so that it was similar to his older sister, not his girlfriend. The ending, when we finally find out who was actually behind them was rather weak and did not have any sense. I think I would have enjoyed this movie a lot better when the relationship between the two actors had a bit more confidence.
