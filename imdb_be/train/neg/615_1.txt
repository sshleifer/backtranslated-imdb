I must say, I usually like horror movies, which I had never seen before ... But this one was just pathetic my bloody taste. I'm used to a bloody, painful bowel types ... but this movie was lame. Action was horrible (yet banal (no pun intended) one-liners have been nice). And the sequel to it, Scarecrow Slayer was even worse! Yes, probably when it first came out, there was a huge rave about it, and people loved it. But if films such as The Ring and The Exorcist Emily Rose came out, such films, as do films like stuffed seems childish. If you want the movie just to pass the time, choose this one! The special effects are cheesy as hell. But seeing that it was a low-budget film, I can kind of see where it will come. It will be a kind of remind you of the movie "Children of the Corn." Independent films rock .... most of the time. So if you want to see a scarecrow to kill a man with corn cobs, or in the future, 2 stuffed going at it, these movies would be for you.
