This film is a prequel, which means that the original film had already laid out some history for us, and this film should end where it starts an original or, at least, lead to it. Not one of the close friends of old Carlito from the original make an appearance in this film, they are not even mentioned. Luis Guzman, Pachanga in the original film, but it plays a very different character. The original occurs in 1975, and the prequel takes place in 1969-70.

In the original, with Carlito Since his release from prison after spending 5 years in prison. Here are just a few months between the end and the beginning of the original prequel!

What will happen to Gail? This lack of continuity that made this film to go straight to video release.
