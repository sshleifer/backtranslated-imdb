Think about the final Grudge 2 with the following: <br /> <br /> - a man who has repeatedly said the word Sunshine - cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar sharp self - and horrible mirror <br /> <br /> OH AND ANIMALS scuba SEA ... yay ... <br /> <br /> not a good movie ... I seriously do not like it at all. The poster for the film is extremely misleading as well, and I found that it was just suck people to see ... I can not believe that I went. <br /> <br /> Save your time and money ... go watch the movie Saw III ... where the writing makes you feel like there was an attempt to put into it ... <br /> <br /> Im Mike and Im out
