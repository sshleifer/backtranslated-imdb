I'm sorry to say it, but acting in this film is terrible. Dialogue sounds as if they read their lines for the first time ever. Maybe I got a "rehearsal" version by mistake. Director excessively use slow motion during the special effects, perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance the actors themselves. The story is quite well written, and the fight sequences are actually better than I've seen in many action movies. Fights seem quite real. But all this is happening while the two leading actors time and again miraculously survive an incredible amount of focus with automatic weapons, grenades, bazookas and ammunition Morter. The enemy soldiers, certainly some of the worst shots I've ever seen, especially if they have arising truck in their sights from about 30 yards, and one grenade launcher shot wide, at least 50 feet. These bazooka in serious need of calibration plot.
