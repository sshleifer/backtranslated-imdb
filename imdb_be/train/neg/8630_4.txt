I know that in this episode, there are other things, other than what I am going to discuss, and in fact I think it has some merit; for example, the fact after we gave a very negative opinion of Jean see Sun memories in "House of the Rising Sun", we can see the direction of Gina things and get a new, more balanced view of his life. <br /> <br /> But there is an element in this story that made me so profoundly uncomfortable that she strongly dampened my enjoyment of the whole episode. Until now, in the scene where Jean came with blood on his hands and shirt, it was hinted that Sun's father was someone who got rich through shady, illegal methods. I thought maybe he was the boss of the mafia, even; mobs operate in Korea, as well as almost any other country in the world, so it was a reasonable possibility. However, in this episode, we learn that the father of the sun, in fact, the boss (or executives) Korean car company, and what he did Jin physically attack a government official (which will actually be killed) to his name. <br /> <br /> maybe I particularly annoying about this, because I happen to work in the automotive industry, but I would say it's spectacular offensive and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing happens in Korea; that huge, major companies such as Hyundai or Kia (which should be a model for this fictitious company car, as they are the only ones that actually exist in reality) work with these mafia methods, rather than as any normal automotive company with the west. it's incredible to me that the authors would have had the audacity to write something like this in the history, and there was no indignation in Korea over him. It feels like an outsider "Buy American!" Propaganda, drawing foreign car companies as criminal, not credible, third world outfits.
