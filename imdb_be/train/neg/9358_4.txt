Since the film begins, already there is a mismatch. How is this film a place on the border of Normandy and the Middle East, as well as international film might be expected, the corresponding accents painted. This is done, as most of the cast of the American sound. Also, I think the actor be practiced in the best case, the storyline a bit difficult to adhere to begin with. Who's who? Otherwise the film is very accurate in costume and scenery. If you want to see the movie to get a sense of what it was like in the past (although in the absence of accents), this film is worth a rental. If you are looking for a film as epic as the kingdom of heaven, then look elsewhere.
