Going to the movies, as I have, I did not expect absolutely nothing entertaining for whorde homicide, except ..... what I got was even less. <br /> <br /> Christmas Eve, one thousand nine hundred forty-seven child witnesses his parents do it while Dad dressed as Santa. Frightened, he runs up the stairs and cut himself. The story begins 33 years later, Harry and stall your normal everyday Joe ..... CERT because he is obsessed with Santa. After his boss was making fun of him, he is going crazy, soaking up as Santa and starts killing nya Santo believe patrons and his boss. Unruly neighborhood catching him just as they were going to set it on fire, he drives the van off the cliff ..... per month. Not the best conclusion I saw, but it was the original. <br /> <br /> It was a slow paced, boring film that really had soothing qualities, except when Harry went on apeshyt church parishioners. Was hardly the blood and even "sex" scenes were relaxed. <br /> <br /> Too sad ...... 4 of 10
