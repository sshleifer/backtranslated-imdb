As a supporter of research Eric Rohmer in a modern war between man and woman, I really wanted to see the "royalist (L'Anglaise et al Le Duc)» for the way he would treat men and women during the real war, the French Revolution. <br /> <br /> The film looks beautiful, with each stage designed as a period picture, lifelike picture. And I've been waiting to talk a lot, because it's in style Romer. But maybe, Romer constrained scenario-based on the works of a real woman is, why it is generally felt to be a version of the docudrama "scarlet primrose." <br /> <br /> As horrible as the excesses of Robespierre and others, how about some recognition that French aristocrats were spoiled? I hummed to myself: "Marat, we are poor / poor and remain poor," you can also select a song from «Les Miz» <br /> <br /> I'm not all that pretty, as the central figure should go back and forth. between her hometown and country estate, to stay ahead of the revolution, in a certain moment her maid says the pantry bare, but I'm sure that he was able to lay a fine meal. I just do not understand it, the English supporters who alternately deflects and protects her former lover and patron, as he had to save the revolution shifting political trends asts; I think I was supposed to sympathize with its consistency more than their political machinations, as the character of «The Scarlet Pimpernel" Hey, the only reason why she did not come home was her outrage after an affair and child with the Prince of Wales or someone. . <br /> <br /> usually, in the revolutionary period, there are some bottom changes occur in the relationship between men and women, but I do not see any here. I once went to a lecture by Herbert Marcuse, which ended with a long Q & a ; the last question from the member of the audience is much older than the rest of us aides, staples it was gray hair, was "Why so gloomy revolutionaries?" She was buzzed in and Marcuse did not deign to answer it seriously - but that's the only thing that the stuff I remember from the evening. Romer suggests that the counter-revolutionaries also dark and didactic. <br /> <br /> (originally written 2002/11/08)
