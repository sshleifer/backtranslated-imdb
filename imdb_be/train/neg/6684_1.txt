It should be re-titled "The Curious Case of unfair Filmmakers Who misrepresented A Non-snoring like horror movies shock." This is a long, boring story about fraternity hazing gag is so clear that even the Flounder from Delta House could see through it. Jeff East, an actor on the stage of paying dues, can be forgiven for any job he could get. The same can be said of Charles Martin Smith, who previously played for such cinema heavyweights as George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once available on tape, but fortunately, not a DVD. MISREPRESENTED debris as it relates to the dump anywhere.
