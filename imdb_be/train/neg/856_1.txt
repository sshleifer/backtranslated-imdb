These works written about the end of the story, so do not read if you have not seen this stuff. <br /> <br /> I found this rubbish film in the horror section, which made me think it would be horrified if I owned a video store, I'd put him in a sad chapter. This film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you've lost your toes. <br /> <br /> This film contains endless shots of people driving as if it was scary. Well, I go to work and back (and sometimes in the store or visit their cat) almost every day, and believe me, it's not scary. He even begins with 20 minutes of some of the management of people. Even a small child is doing it too. Round and round it goes, and it never stops. What's so scary about watching a small child riding a bike for an hour? I think nothing, and if you look at it, you will not think the same way. <br /> <br /> The family in the car come to a big castle, and they gave a tour just walk endlessly look at the kitchens. Then the man walking around for an hour and trying to kill his family for no reason. This is all that happens, and as you can see is garbage.
