I gave 1 to this film. I can not understand how the chips, one of the great directors of Italian cinema, made a film like this, so stupid and ridiculous! All the stories of the people involved in the film are irrelevant, boring and not interesting. Too long, too boring. The only thing that saved me in this movie are Giancarlo Jeannine and Vittorio Gasmann. I hope that Scola will radically change the theme and style in his next film.
