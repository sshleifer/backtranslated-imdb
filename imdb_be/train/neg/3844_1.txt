First of all, I would just like to say to anyone who has seen this film, the actor who played "transvestite" Is a friend of mine, his name is Robert Dugdale, he's a terrific actor, although it does not say much about his filmography he has been in several plays and musicals. He currently resides in terraces BC that is where I am, he comes to our house almost every Saturday * laughs * Well, now about the movie, I would not recommend it for those who have not seen it, because it is not a film worth watching, the main reason I found it's a bad film never stays in place, it saves, so that kind of bouncing back from time to time it is difficult to stick at some points, and, secondly, it is very sad * laughs * Although great actor, the film simply does not compare.
