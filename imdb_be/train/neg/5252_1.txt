I read some of the comments on the internet about this film as "... difficult then Hostel ...», «camera never screens when it gets really hard ...". But none of them is true. The camera never screens, because there is nothing of the screen. The same scene is repeated hundreds and hundreds of times over. Women are on the table, the killer abused woman several times, the killer cut off the woman to pieces (you will never see it throughout the film!). The police come and arrest him. Killer fools jury. The film ended. In Germany we would say: «Viel Lärm um Nichts». In general, one of the most boring films I've ever seen. Absolutely not recommended.
