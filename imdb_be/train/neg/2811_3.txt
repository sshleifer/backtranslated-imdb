Will they ever make movies without nudity and sex? This happened at 3:00 on a Sunday afternoon, and I could not believe what they showed. Thank God, my son was on the outside, or I would be shocked if he could see the soft / medium porn! There are people who make films do not care who they offend or corrupt? Children could be engaged after the church, and that is what they show ??? !!! The action was good and I enjoyed the unknown, but the first! It was the violence and the bad guys, but that can be expected in the western movies. Randy Travis was really good in their roles. If the writers, directors and producers just throw to put on so much ridiculous sex scenes. What needs to happen to get them to stop going in this direction? Where can I complain?
