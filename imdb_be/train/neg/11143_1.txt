Hi, I'm a werewolf movie, and when I saw the name DarkWolf hitting the shelves, I was like "um, simple and a good name for him, at least. Althou ... I wonder why I have not heard it before. "<br /> <br /> First of all, the film begins with boobs. A lot of boobs. Tsytski pretty much everything this movie budget went. Who cares about the werewolf effect, just pay actress enough to get topless shots! <Br /> <br /> Thus, the mysterious character DarkWolf (some spoilers ahead, but who really cares ...) he's your average everyday biker. not even a super-tough appearance, but as an old wise woman says in the film, "he is much more powerful and dangerous than you've ever seen before. "Just apisvayuch th her tattooed biker-type guy. Pretty original. I even had to look twice when they first used the "red glowing eyes" special effect! I mean, my god, that "allows plant-red-point-to-voka- because computer "effect has been used since the seventies. It looks ugly here! and do not get me started with the werewolf 3D-CGI. as stated earlier, both bad and old video games. <br /> <br /> and finally I love werewolf movies, like I said. They always build prettymuch werewolf legend of its own. DarkWolf does build werewolfworld, as well as about some silly legends of werewolves, hybrids and ancient ancestry. BUT. Almost immediately after the establishment of rules of interaction Â«DarkWolf kills any girl touched" begins random spray. That just does not make sense, why bother telling us the rules of the murder, if they will not even play with them ... Aplus wolf-point review photos were taken with a Sony Handycam or something, taking largely on the floor and walls. Just add a growling noise and you have a super werewolf effect. Blood partially OK. But if all the cuts the wolf with an open hand, just basically laying a hand on the victims, it just does not do the trick for me ... <br /> <br /> In fact, the WHO gives money to make these heaps of rubbish straight to video horrortitles, they not even funny kind of bad movies, just boring.
