Being forced my children to see this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 Christmas, I feel qualified to make a decision on this version of the classic tale of Dr. Seuss, and ... it's not very good. Firstly, after the classic act as Chuck Jones animated TV special it will be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so heavy-handed and soft to be positively numb. I recognize that there are a few inspired gags, but in general, the film comes off as a calculated money grab, at the same time as it is supposedly condemning the commercialization of Christmas. Jim Carrey, as a rule, over here, but it is completely at odds with the character of the Grinch. As characterized by Boris Karloff, it was a slow burn; methodical and cunning. There's no way to madness Curry, and it is only the most glaring mistake made. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski absolutely nothing here. Why, Universal, why? I mean, I understand that Tony Hopkins will take just about any role offered (as well as his compatriot Michael Caine), but this one should be filed under "Movies that have never been made." This does not bode well for the Cat in the hat, is even more thin folio, which is universal preparing for this Christmas. I get the feeling that I'm going to do the same recommendation that one, as I have with this: skip it, and how to read a book or watch TV special. It's 2:00, you can never, ever get back.
