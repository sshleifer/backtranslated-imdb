This type of film has become old hat now, is not it? The whole thing turned into a thick nostalgia over a certain feedback loop <br /> <br /> It sure sounds like a good idea :. A large ensemble cast, some good gags, and some human drama that can be / could be. Unfortunately, there is no central event that binds them all together, as it was in «The Big Chill», one of the seminal films that are born copycat films like this. You will eventually want to see more than one or two specific people, rather than short takes all. The superficiality of this creates not only annoying, it's crazy. Below average script does not help.
