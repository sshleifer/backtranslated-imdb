"Giant" is one of the most boring, too long Hollywood contraptions ever. Many scenes seem completely fake and without energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean wasted in this great Hollywood production. The central concept in this film that the farmer will ever oppose drilling for oil on their land, it is absurd, and I know this, because I'm from Houston. A couple of scenes, especially Dean Taylor serves coffee to redeem this boring movie. For more accurate and interesting descriptions of how modernism has changed a ranch in Texas, "It's bad" section (one of the great performances of Paul Newman) and Â«The Last Picture Show."
