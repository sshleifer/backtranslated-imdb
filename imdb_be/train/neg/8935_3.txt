Rarely seen with film distribution in 1970 MYRA BREKINRIZH became the laughing stock of the rough and tumble of the legendary cinematic proportions. Now, finally on DVD in unexpectedly nice package, it is unlikely to win a wide audience today as it was when first released. <br /> <br /> 1968 bestseller Gore Vidal was darkly satirical statement. Most filmmakers believed that history, structure, and the overall tone of the novel will not be translated into a film, and industry insiders were surprised when 20th Century Fox has acquired not only rights, but also hired Vidal, to adapt his novel to the screen. But studio executives were soon cold feet: Vidal devices were repeatedly rejected, and an aspiring writer-director Michael Sarna brought to bring the film to the screen <br /> <br /> Studio executives are hoping that Sarna would tap the youth market. they saw as a target for the film, but Sarni was even more sync'd with the material than the leaders themselves. Overwriting overwriting followed. Throw feeling trouble becoming more militant. In his DVD commentary, star of Raquel Welch says she rarely had any idea of ​​what the motives of Myra were from scene to scene, or even in the most any one stage, and that each person involved, it seems that making a completely different film. The accompanying "prehistory" documentary, Rex Reed says MYRA BREKINRIZH was the film shot a group of people who were hiding in their dressing rooms, waiting for their lawyers to return their calls. <br /> <br /> The accuracy of these comments show the film itself. Fundamentals of history Vidal there, but not only was the story devoid of all the broader implications, appears to have no meaning in and of itself. Everything runs in several directions, no links, as well as numerous scenes undercut any logic of the previous scenes may have had. And while the director Sarni repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as pure farce, only laughter generated random. <br /> <br /> Chief among these accidents Mae West. It is true that the West is surprisingly well preserved in appearance, and that it has not lost its way with one-liners - but does not avoid the fact that she is in her seventies, and her conviction that she is still the sexiest trick leather shoes are extremely disturbing, to say the least. But worse, in fact, is the fact that the West is out of her era. Her effort to put himself in the thigh and the results of people taking place in one of the toughest independent cartoons ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast mostly wasted. Raquel Welch, significantly underestimated the actress plays a major role in the world is very similar to the Barbie doll on steroids; not an actor Rex Reed unexpectedly effective as Myron, but the entire role, in fact, without a point. Only John Huston and cameo players John Carradine, Jim BACKUS, William Hopper, Andy Devine appear relatively large. Yes, it really Fiasco all participants of the film was afraid it would be: fast, when it should be slowly, slowly, when it should be fast, relentlessly unfunny from start to finish. It is true that the director Sarna really is a random inspired idea - both in its use of film clips all from Shirley Temple, Judy Garland, to create a counterpoint to the action - but by and large, if Sarna was presented with the choice of how to do what he seems , I made a wrong. <br /> <br /> how and why of this becomes clear in audio comments in Sarna. Serna did not like the novel or, for that matter, the whole subject. He did not want to write the script, but he needed money; he resolutely did not want to direct the film, but he needed money. He makes it very clear that he did not like the author Gore Vidal and Rex Reed (at one point he states categorically that the Reed "is not a good man"), and to this day he believes that species and Reed worked in tandem to sabotage film, because he refused to play their "homosexual agenda" - which, when you come right down to it, apparently, was the desire that actually Sarni video Vidal's novel, not his own fanciful imaginary takeoff on it <br / >. <br /> Despite the fact that he spends a lot of time from the comments that the film was widely liked n -soobschestvo, Sarni never quite seems to understand that the attractiveness of the movie for the gay audience comes from his laughable inaccurate descriptions of homosexual people, when taken in tandem with the film itself, Sarna acts as more than a little homophobic -. and completely open only the worst choice of writers and directors who could be made for this project <br /> <br /> in the annex to the comments Sarni and Welch and production documentary, DVD edition includes several trailers, and two versions of the film: a "theatrical release "version and the" restored "version. The only difference between them lies in the fact that the final scene in the "restored" version was printed in black and white. Changes made before the film was released in a general release have not been restored, but the documentary details of what they were. Widescreen transfers both amazingly well and the sound is pretty good. But to end where I started, it really is a film that most interest to historians movie, movie lovers and fans of the cult film. I give it three out of five stars for their sake only, but all the others have to go through it. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, known GFT, Amazon Reviewer
