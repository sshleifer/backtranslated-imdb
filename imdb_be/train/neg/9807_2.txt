Very rarely do I give less than rave reviews on show or movie I do not like to IMDb, but powerful Morphin Power Rangers just as thoroughly awful, it's awful. <br /> <br /> I would not mind if it was an animated series-would have been better, I think, but how to live action show that the prototype of the terms "cheesy" and "mannered". Of these, there are Power Rangers. Five multi-colored, spandex wearing teenagers fight evil, using his martial arts skills. horrid- suits, they look like something that reminds us of the fact that athletes and female gymnasts will wear. Acts slides, and fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to see how she was doing, Jean-Claude Van Damme, look equally good as Bruce Lee, who is an understatement in itself. In fact, they look as if they were jumping and dancing around; as it was some version of "The Nutcracker", or they do ballet, not wrestling. In addition, there are some cartoons that are very different martial arts and it's all done in fun, but not so cheesy way that makes him look ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Children show or not, it's just so lame and to the point of absurdity. And even if this version is set in the US, you could be forgiven for thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences, they have not been withdrawn in the United States and Japan; Thus, several "fake" fights and shots have been borrowed from the Japanese version only be articulated in the American version. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of thing, and then follow Sentai- Japanese equivalent.
