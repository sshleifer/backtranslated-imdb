Finding a high rating on IMDb, I decided to go see this movie. In addition, high rankings, I deliberately avoided reading any of the reviews. I wanted to go to the theater with a clean sheet, without knowing the plot or predetermined expectations. <br /> <br /> Given my top, you can see that I was disappointed. I enjoyed the development of the main character, Mike Enslin. I also enjoyed how the hotel manager tried to talk him out of the entrance to the room. By that time, Ensslin entered the room, I was ready for some scary stuff. <br /> <br /> The first sweets appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin responds in a plausible manner. He was worried. I am inspired and think to myself, it will be good. The people who made this film to understand that less is more. <br /> <br /> But that's what happens next that was a big let down. Subtlety are rapidly changing in a predictable shotgun approach ... Just blow the audience with every Hollywood scary trick in the book, and I hope that something works. Let's see, Clock Radio, which is activated by itself? Well, it's always scary. Objects that move around the room? Well, you can not complain about it. Blood drips from the walls and the sink? Excellent. Ghosts who commit suicide? All right. Anything else? How about loud noises, shaking, fire, more trembling, spoiling room, more blood, etc. etc., it's all good. And it's all been done before. Our very annoying attention-deficit disordered audience with all kinds of things in quick succession, and they could not look away. <br /> <br /> Well, it does not work for me. And you know what else? When I see a horror film in the cinema, it is typical to hear a few groups of girls in the audience scream in terror scary moments. But this movie was not scary moments. The audience was silent and disinterested. I felt chills down my spine. Never mind. Shining was 100x, this film tries to be. <br /> <br /> So who are all these people who are saying that this is one of the best horror movies ever? director of Friends? Unfortunately, I just do not understand.
