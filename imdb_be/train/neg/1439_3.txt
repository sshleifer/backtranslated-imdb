I give 3 stars only for the beautiful pictures of Africa. The rest was ... well, pretty sad. About 50 minutes later, we have the plot scheme ... In the war of the worlds, the introductory part lasted for about 10 minutes? Then there was the real action! It is something like: "Let's walk in the savanna, and gasp at the beautiful sunsets" And maybe deliver a message such as "Do not kill elephants"!.!. Very environmentally friendly. I would expect that with the "new" Steven Seagal movie, not from this ... Lead actress makes me think about the fake tan, dyed hair and too much of a reason! And I have not seen one scene where her hair messed up, or she sweats, or dusty clothes. It just does not look like a woman of the 19th century! And the bar, where they are looking for our hero, Swayze makes a comment about the commander, that it looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and he became known in the coming years. Livingston and others have traveled to Central Africa from 1840 to 1880. Thus, if the action does not take place between 1896 and 1900 .. Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze makes a good impression .. in a nutshell - hard on the outside but soft and pleasant on the inside. Not that I would cuddle with a nut, but you get the point. It really is possible to have a puppy that whipped across his face several times. The movie stank. Too long and sad. do not look! Do not buy it! It's a waste of your money!
