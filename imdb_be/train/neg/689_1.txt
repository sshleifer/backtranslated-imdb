........... What is it? This should, without doubt, will be a big waste of film, camera settings and ever. I know that you can not set your expectations for 80-slasher high, but it's too silly to be true. I baught this film for $ 0.89 and I still feel like going to demand their money back. Can you imagine anyone seriously stinks? <br /> <br /> Who violent killer in this film, and what his motives ??? Well actually, you probably could care less. Why do you need? The creators of this piece of garbage is not exactly worried. They were not trying to create a tiny tension. Director (Stephen Carpenter - I believe that it is much easier to find the money with the same name) and relatives (1986) which was quite nice, and the last time he made a Soul Survivors. Full of shit as well, but at least one was Dushku. This stuff has a debut Zuniga !!! (Who ??) Yes, that's for sure, Melrose Place chicken. Its a very memorable character dies about 15 minutes. after the opening credits. She is the second person to die. The first victim died in the first minute, but no one seems to mention or skip it then, so who cares? Other actors ... they do not deserve life on the actors really, really not interested. You hope that they die quickly and painful death ... and not only their characters <br /> <br /> My humble opinion = 0/10
