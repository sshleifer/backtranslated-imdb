It may have been based on historical events, and we know that the creators of the TV docu-drama took the liberty to make it more dramatic - I can live with that - but it was just so badly done! I was amazed when deploying mid-air crisis, how calm everything seemed sure who would panic, and that a smooth flight, boarding and alighting of passengers discomfort is obvious - do not go! Not sure about the rules, now some airlines security things seem OTT nonsense, but why take off your shoes before the emergency landing, common sense tells me that this is not a good idea! Cadres of this huge airliner that went on this remote airstrip were unconvincing and fake. In fact, it would have been an awesome sight to watch the ground nearby, in this film, he was out of proportion, and she looked like a model is likely to be. Escape slides appeared on the front and middle of the emergency doors, but no one appeared to come from the front, although the fall was much less. The captain returned the aircraft after landing - why? it has never been explained. We know that an emergency landing was due to the addition of the fuel, but even in this case should be a certain amount of fuel, hang around in the bottom of the tank, as well as the risk of explosion, it must have been a very real danger, but the evacuation seemed almost slowly, and all stand around at the foot of the rescue slides instead of as far as possible, as I'm sure I would have done. There were too many inconsistencies, errors and fake action in this. I would love to have seen the presentation of the drama in real time and with realistic motion of the image plane. It had the potential to be very exciting, but certainly it was not possible due to budget constraints, and made one feel that the plane lost all engines was not a very big deal, and you would be safe to slide down a bit bumpy landing, but not real danger! - reality, of course, though somewhat different!
