Someone needs to explain to me why every movie that shows the poor and takes a pseudo-sand look like something seen as "realistic" by some people. <br /> <br /> I do not see anything about realistic characters (although the actors did their best with very bad parts) or situation. Instead, I saw an emergency, shy force at the time of "acute", "rough" and "down and dirty". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it takes much more than from the hand holding the camera without any rhyme or reason and unable to illuminate the film in order to achieve some of the qualities listed above a significant way. <br /> <br /> It is a sad comment on the state of independent film distribution, that the only films that see in a movie theater is now all carbon copies, with a bad film, a non-existent direction of the camera and a lot of the mat, which seeks to convey themselves as "art ". <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that such films as "bedroom" or "About Schmidt" to get such rave. I found them winding and very average, but compared with the current kill those independent clones as "Youth Victor Vargas" they utterly brilliant and inspiration. <br /> <br /> A few years ago I saw "independent" film means that you probably will be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care, and maybe a few technical glitches caused by low budgets, now , this means that, most likely, you will get one more buy-to-numbers, let -shake-The-camera around-in-two o'clock attempts to appease the lack of taste of independent distributors. And, of course, everything that serves the characters and situations that are totally unrealistic and far-fetched. <br /> <br /> Is it any wonder that the independent market is less and less the surviving company? Not at all, if you see films like Raising Victor Vargas, who do nothing but copy the worst of films that preceded them.
