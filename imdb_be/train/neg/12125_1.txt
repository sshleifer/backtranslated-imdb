Why do people who do not know that a particular time in the past was how to feel the need to try to determine the time for others? Replace Vudstka the civil war and the Apollo moon landing sinking of the Titanic and you have as realistic flick like this template soap opera, populated by exceptionally low life trash. Is this something that the children who were too young to be able to go to Woodstock and who is not an elementary school to do a composition? "I'll show the old Meanies, I'll put my own movie and prove that you do not know about your topic Nuttin still make money!" Yes, we already know that. The only thing to watch this movie made for me to give me a little insight Underclass thinking. The next time, when I see a whore in a bar that looks like Diane Lane, I run the other way. This abuse of children to allow parents that are not worthy to raise children. This abuse of the audience simply follow moonlanding Woodstock and in the film, as if it means that by the mere fact the film depicts the 1969.
