This absolute rubbish is based so closely on Friday the 13th series, which is actually a carbon copy, to take in order to be an Australian film with people who can not act. <br /> <br /> Once a young boy was accidentally burned during the filming of the video for Lake Eildon. Now, several years later, the boy is all grown up and take revenge on all who come to the lake to shoot a music video. It's a clich√© covered and a waste of time and money to see it just out of curiosity, or if you are an aspiring actor, trying to learn how not to (be able to) act. The leading role of Alan Dale used to star in the television soap opera Neighbors, but end up in the X Files - How did this happen?
