Bad performances of Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Underdeveloped supporting characters. Irritating Talky with no real plot. Ending emails you flatter than a pancake, with more loose ends than you could tie in four sequels (that is, if you even care about these wooden characters). McLain was the only real asset. This is the penultimate sequence, in which the "Chicago hood" looking nature of Sinatra clown. Music in this sequence also leaves much to be desired. And in the final scene when the hero Martin takes off his hat for a woman, which he called the "pig", almost made me go out and find a stone to throw across my TV screen.
