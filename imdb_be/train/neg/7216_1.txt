I love westerns. I could watch them all day. "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is my all time favorite. I watched "Silverado" for probably the 8th time the other day, because now presented on the MCT. However, this film, Shiloh Falls, without a doubt, the worst Western I've ever watched. The acting was terrible all around. They did not explain at the end of the mysterious compass which looks things. The only good part, I think it looks good Cantina girl. Very visible long pauses between dialogue seemed deliberate just to compensate for the time to make a film suitable length. This film was not even worth a new rent I paid at our local video store. I felt like I was robbed and worthy of the rental coverage if there is such a thing. The only reason I ended it because I hate to not see the movie until the end. I turned it off halfway through, because it was so bad. For the director, please do a better job, if you decide to make another. It's kind of a film that has the potential to turn people away in westerns.
