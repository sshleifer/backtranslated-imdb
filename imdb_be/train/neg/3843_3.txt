A few days before the gore and sex exciting, the real horror movies were made. Blood Castle, in my estimation, one of the best, although other reviewers gave it mixed reviews. In an odd form, it reminds of the last other that was in theaters a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Director Margherita remade his own picture in the 1970 titles at this time web spider (AKA Nella Stretta MORSA del Ragno). Why he did it, I do not understand, though a remake starred Franchoz and Klaus Kinski and was very good in its own right. Perhaps he saw a good story, and wished to adapt it more American audience. I really do not know. I wonder what he did in the original black-and-white and color alteration. <br /> <br /> Castle Blood excellent Italian Gothic. La Danza Macabra called unpublished work of Edgar Allen Poe, "it is", which in this film. Poe and Lord Blackwood, the owner of the castle ghosts, the pledge of the American writer Alan Foster (George Riviere), that he can not spend all the night of the soul in this castle and survive. Foster willingly accepts the bet, but soon regrets it, because he is a witness to a series of murders committed by spirits. It seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years, but convicted again enact the crime they have committed in life. Lord Blackwood is conveniently forgot to tell Foster that his blood is necessary for them to resurrect themselves at the next All Souls Night! <br /> <br /> It does not take Foster and beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood (portrayed by Barbara bright style) for a long time to fall in love, but their romance was doomed because Elizabeth is one of the ghosts. I will not give away the ending, but only to say that the blood of the castle every bit of romantic tragedy, as it is a horror story. <br /> <br /> Note. This film is very atmospheric, even beautiful Italian standards. My personal opinion is that they do the true horror is better than anyone, and more dull black-and-white filming only reinforces this. In fairness, spider was good in its own right, even with color and greater brightness. I loved hang fire, the majority of modern day directors do not have the patience. In fact, when Alan first part of the doomed castle, we were treated to a few minutes, he does nothing but wander from room to room, the terrible awkwardness ANDS building in his face and manner. By that time, it is the first ghost, the audience carefully primed and ready. There is an excellent dialogue between Alan and haunted, something not often done in standard ghost stories. There are also memorable scenes are very clear for this type of film. "Murder" Elizabeth and dance scene (reminiscent of several such ghouls dancing in the carnival in 1962 Souls) were particularly good. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, few general interest viewers have never heard of, much less see this movie. It's a shame, because this one is a cut above the rest. I received a copy of Sinister film, and I'm not sure that you can buy elsewhere. For those interested in this genre, this is a must see.
