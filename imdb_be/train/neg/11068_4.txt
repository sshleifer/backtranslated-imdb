Dahmer, a young man confused. Dahmer, confusing movie. Of course, I had a few beers while watching a movie, but it does not explain why I was so bored by this flick. <br /> <br /> His memories are not other than the misleading and annoying, and there is no real story line with a beginning and an end, the only thing that made sense in the film was an explanatory text at the beginning and at the end of the film. Material between them, which would be a movie, it's just boring pictures and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> We never see the actual murder, it's all just a bunch of hints. Sometimes even just get the feeling that Dahmer dream of the whole thing, but you know that it is not, since it <br /> <br /> is based on a true story, and it actually happened, at least, most of them. But what happened? It's not easy to say. <br /> <br /> I do not encourage people to spend time on this movie. I <br /> <br /> do not like it one bit, and I felt cheated when he suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> * / *****
