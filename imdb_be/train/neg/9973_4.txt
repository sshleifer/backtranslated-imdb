"Severe child" is one of the goofiest movies ever. This is not the worst (although some people will disagree with me on this one), but this is not the best either. It is a diabolical 7-year-old boy who sunken ships comic chaos on childless couples (John Ritter, Yasbek) who recklessly accepts it. This film is too stupid and unbelievable, because I do not buy for a second that the child can act as unrurly how the child is doing in this film. It is stubborn and absurd, but I laugh a few times during the (I really do not know why). But I can not recommend this film. I know that I'm too good to her. If there is one positive thing about the "problem child" that is better than the sequel, which was just awful. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
