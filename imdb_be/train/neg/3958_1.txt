I will not spend much time on it, because, as I understand it, it's really not a movie, to start with, just sloppy hodgepodge of borrowed footage and striking amateur new frames are made solely for the purpose of inserting the whole mess together and call it a sequel "Boogeyman." Just 80% of the film is stolen from it is far superior to "Boogeyman" predecessor, the film is that the authors of this trash, apparently, did not even bother to look, because they could not even get the name of the actress Suzanne's love of the original character ( Lacy) rights. And to add insult to injury the invisible killer in the original frame, and visible in the new frames, apparently, they think their audience is as stupid as they are. 0 out of 10, and I want to IMDb rating system has gone that low, most callous and blatant attempt to disrupt the people's money, even I could see that you have been warned!
