I usually do not have any problems walking away from a bad movie, but it was a unique case. This movie was so bad that I actually sat through the whole thing almost praying she will have one minute a good movie time to justify a half hour that was wasted. Needless to say, I was severely disappointed. Set on a beach house, where a group of college friends celebrating holidays, the film suffers from many problems, which makes it not worth seeing. Firstly, there is disclosed the plot holes. Second, very few of the C-list (I do not even dare to call them B) actors can act worth a damn, so any scenes that have the potential to fail miserably. Thirdly, the film speed is very choppy and uncomfortable to watch most of the time makes the suspense building is very difficult, which leads to very few surprises for the audience. Fourthly, and most importantly, the ending is quite anti-climactic, in part because of how it ends (set / killer who turns out to be), and partly because the dialogue just brutal. To honor films, it's the only film I ever say, the worst film I've ever scene, and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> So, just as a bad joke, you would all be happy never to hear that the next time someone asks you if you want to know the secret, you will cry, no, you're on actually not you run in the opposite direction.
