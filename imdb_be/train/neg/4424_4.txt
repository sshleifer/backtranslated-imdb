Oh-oh! Another gay movie. At this time, it shows the black side. Bet your bottom dollar he's going to have a miserable end! But why? With just under a dozen exceptions, all gay films should result in death or «Addio» finale. It is, like all European Film Noir releases in the '40s,' 50s, '60s and' 70s. ... lead a man or woman should die or go alone into oblivion. Why in God's name have writers, directors and producers of the audience leave the theater feeling depressed? In the end, he must be gay ... nya gloomy. Perhaps category should be changed to "moody" film. A large percentage of homosexual relationships last DO and DO pair rode off together into the sunset! No matter who writes or produces, it only shows the bottom side of gay life and gives the wrong idea about gay life. This movie just proves my point. If you rent a DVD, take an antidepressant, because here comes another "gay" film! This is wrong!
