I decided to watch this movie, because he got good grades here on IMDb. But a lot of people either have a very bad taste, or someone was fixing the bill. <br /> <br /> In any case, it was a real disappointment. The film is just silly and contrived, as the name would suggest. There's really no reason to give a brief summary of the plot - but here goes: he felt that someone thought: "Would not it be great to make a film where there were snakes on a plane And then for some snakes? the reason will go crazy and start biting and stuff?!? "And that's about it! The plot is thin and unoriginal. Snakes bad CGI (but it makes sense to cut corners on the film that no one would recommend to anyone! Sane). poor action, and all the people incredible type stereo <br /> <br /> In summary: This is one of the worst films I have ever seen - stay away.!
