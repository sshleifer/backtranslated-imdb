This film was supposed to be portrayed bachelor brand «Ladie MAN", who was ready and willing to settle once and for all. However, I did not care about his mission to calm down, because I did not care about his character. I do not understand that all these beautiful women saw in him. He had absolutely no class or charisma. He should have at least been so myself, what did the lady weak in other than its knees saxophone playing, but to no avail. Just because he is a musician does not make it sexual. Not to mention the fact that he has made to draw the attention of a married woman he fell in love for five minutes, knowing it is absolutely outrageous and ridiculous. Do you have this man no shame, that, yes, someday? If he had been removed, and stopped doing and talk nonsense, he would have been more appealing as a character, but unfortunately his character was gentle and sad. <br /> <br /> character Gina Gershon was too British. It could just as easily have been alarmed by the visitors of her regular voice, saying, than to make a bad British accent that sometimes will go through out the movie. <br /> <br /> Only two characters I have take care of fish and frogs. Now those two have chemistry! Academy Nominations for both ?? STAT! holes of the earth, the lack of character development, hardcore action, unnecessary drama cliché moments ... What a mess the film.
