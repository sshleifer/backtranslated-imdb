This is the most saccharine romance I've ever sat through. The ideal film for idle housewife in kerchief, housedress and ostrich circumcised high heels mules to watch in the afternoon, lying on the couch, eating candy. In fact, sweets play a significant role in the movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I was able to watch until the end, then, that I was finally able to look at the dreamy face of Keanu Reeves in almost every scene, in most of his films, he's moving too fast to get good view. Only quick action in this show Giancarlo Jeannine waving his arms in Latin emotion - over Italian Mexican, actually. <br /> <br /> In the dialogue as a hard as wood. Unfortunately, bodices Sun burst - the hero shamefully perfectly mannered and soft. Aristocratic old world warm family clich√© as old as the hills. What does it matter if they are Irish or Italian or Mexican? It's a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> I knew that before the title to finish the job, it is not a film that I was hoping for. Lights grapes looked the pattern of all food ads in Women's Day Magazine. I did not see his name on the list, but the art director, of course, was Thomas Kincaid paintings that draws millions of Irish cottages nestled in fuchsia. This film was literally through rose-colored glasses. If you want a dreamy pink and blue sky, this film is for you! (In fact, the candy looked good too!)
