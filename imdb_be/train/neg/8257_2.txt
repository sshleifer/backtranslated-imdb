"The game of gentlemen," uses the game of golf in a country club, to illustrate the discovery of a teenager on the honesty, superstitions and other life lessons. Several times I thought I knew where the film was going, only to be denied. Unfortunately, I'm not so sure that the filmmakers never knew where he was going, either. A defining moment in the film, probably a scene in which Sinise mocks «The Karate Kid» and detects any idea what he was going to become a teacher for teenagers golfers. It is refreshing, so that the film refuses to follow most simplified and over-worked formula film. However, too many still comes off as contrived. For no reason people abandon all pretense of politeness, does not stick to things that, in their opinion, are exposed to something much less respectable than their place in society involves. Unfortunately, they often do not permit these moments. And for the fact that the club serves as a backdrop for them, except, there is no real continuity or binding them. It's a shame that the writers and director could not save the best film, especially considering some of the talented actors and the potential to install.
