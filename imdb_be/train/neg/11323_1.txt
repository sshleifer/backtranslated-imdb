This film will contribute to the improvement of the mind. Read the book! It's unbelievable someone think this movie deserves the time and investment to make. I saw «B» movies before, but the film «C» has just been invented. I do not think I ever enjoy Power Rangers, since my children stopped to watch, but I found myself looking at the video fifteen minutes to "knight". High school production better than this, and the actors involved must delete it from your resume. Confusion is one of the many descriptions that come to mind. My roommate, who like these types of movies even turned it off. Now that must honestly tell you something. If you watch this movie, and it's like, I'll pray for you.
