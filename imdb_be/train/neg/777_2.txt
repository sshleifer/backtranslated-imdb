I can not believe that such a slanted, jingoistic material is passed to the Americans, as the art house stuff. Previously, with such clear lines as "we want to make sure that they play in the right team" and manipulative framing and lighting, A Love Divided shows that this is the true face. Blunt manner in which the Irish Catholics is shown as a hegemon, Protestants, as a peaceful and killed like poor idea of ​​history as the earliest American westerns that depict the battle between cowboys and Indians. True stories are distorted stereotypes and open denigration of Irish Catholics in history; corruption allowed by the filmmakers! It is sad that today people still think that they can win the moral authority to make a movie so easy to recognize, as it is obviously the intention, so far from attempts at art. This film does not have any business, which is located somewhere in some legitimate cinema or library.
