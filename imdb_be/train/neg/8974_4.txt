this film, I would not call it a "film" was basically nothing, and operated mainly for popular acts of the time. but war was in full swing (pun), and this film has given troops and our viewers pleasure. <br /> <br /> but let something with a little more substance. <br /> <br /> enjoyed seeing the young Buddy Rich on drums. Music was good throughout. <br /> <br /> but one after another cameo gets old fast. <br /> <br /> I did not even recognize Mostel! so if you are one of "the greatest generation", as they say, you'll definitely enjoy this ... <br /> <br /> film.
