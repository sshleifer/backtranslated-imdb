I missed the beginning of this film, which might explain why I did not like it so much. On the other hand, I have studied the fall of the Roman Republic during the years, so I know the story. Again, this may also be the reason why I did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has more historical inaccuracies than extras. Although it is so inaccurate, I do not think they made an attempt to be correct, in which case it can be forgiven. What is surprising is that they sometimes go to great lengths to be historically accurate, which ultimately becomes confusing. Like throwing married Anthony in Octavia, and then pushes it towards two scenes later. Why even bring it up, if it does not serve any purpose and plot Octavia had never even seen? And as a challenge to Antonius his real name (Marcus Antonius) in some scenes, and his wonderful English name, Mark Antony in other scenes. <br /> <br /> Although the historical inaccuracies aside, the film can still be entertaining hour if it was not for the leading lady. There is not one ounce of dignity in it. She's hysterical, dramatic, and completely lacking control. Instead of being intelligent and Cleopatra was transformed into hysterical teenager with a bad case PMS. 95% of what happens from bad actions, but also 5% due to the poor script writing. Too many stupid dramatic scenes in the script. Sometimes you have not watched Anthony and Cleopatra, you looked immature version of Dawson and Joey from "Dawson's Creek." <br /> <br /> If you want to see something about this period, see ... nothing but this,
