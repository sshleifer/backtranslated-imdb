Oh, my God! Rarely film "horror," I'm bored, and made me laugh, just like this one. After an energetic start with an intriguing, it descends into a not much larger than the chopper Flick, with some supernatural and sexual deviations. Usually fine Alice Krige wasted in this, and ridiculous plot twists. Do not worry if you are really desperate. Rating: 3/10.
