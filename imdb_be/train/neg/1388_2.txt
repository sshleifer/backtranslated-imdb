I went to see this movie in the hope of seeing some flash Jet Li, we were amazed at deadly weapon 4. Unfortunately, too many of its combat tricks so obviously fake that it took even that pleasure from him. Flying kicks would be much more impressive if you can not see the wires holding it up as he flies through the air for about 4 seconds and 9 strokes. <br /> <br /> Too cartoon and very disappointing.
