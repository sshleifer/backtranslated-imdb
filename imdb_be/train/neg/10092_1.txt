Seriously crappy movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film begins with a police officer and his partner parked warehouse / furniture store. The "bad" cop takes the girls, they are tightened to the attic storage, while a novice policeman sits outside and ponders what can happen there. "Poor" The cops eventually come back with a heavy bag and aspiring police do not think that there are some problems, but he still wonders what was in the bag, so he asks to receive an answer of stupidity, then he thinks everything is OK (for now). <br /> <br /> «bad» policeman repeats this process and even once with tits scene (made it a little better). But in the end, people are starting to catch on, it took some time, given how f *** ing obvious that it was. One girl gets bait curse placed on it only if she dies, as I do. Now, "bad" cops eventually kill the magically protective bitch, and then he gets rid of the body of the glove-bags. <br /> <br /> Since she was oogey-boogey magic put on her, she comes back with a lot of eye shadow, which should show that it might be a zombie ... well, magic curse causes all the other girls to become "eye-shadow monsters." Some of the girls meet with a guy who seems to currency specialist, and he offers them a ride (they look normal to him, apparently). But when the girls see the other person, such as a girl's husband, he is worried because she is disgusting (some people are worried, while others do not even notice) .... massive plot hole. <br /> <br /> So, to wrap it up, the eye shadows of monsters to kill "bad" cop who, in turn, become a zombie ends in the last scene. It was as if they were trying to preparatory us to continue! As someone who would like to see part 2 of this cow dropping.
