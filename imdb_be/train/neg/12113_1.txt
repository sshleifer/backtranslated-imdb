Townies a lazy film I've ever seen, and I've seen in a movie Blair Witch (on the first and second parts). It seems confused about the fact that he wants to be. It's not funny enough for comedy, it's not tragic enough for a drama, it is not enough bloody terror, and it is not good enough for viewing. He is a man to do the scene, "a farce / bloody" carat, so I think this film will be in the spirit of the Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Then he jumps without warning into the drama of the missing girl, delayed (mental handicap) women and mothers confidence. Then he slaps a single good part of the film, which seems to be set as a sitcom without a laugh track. Part townie I say lonely, so lonely that he finds solace in a rotten corpse. It was the only part of the film, which gave me a feeling. The rest was the state of my life. Then, to show how CRUEL Wayne has a sort of documentary film at the end of Wayne (Director) ridicule by Toby (star) in public places. It made me sick. Even if the killer Nerd Nerd and groom killer (two other Wayne films) are not the best, they are at least thoughtful enough were you can party until the end credits. I even like the killer Nerd little, he had some great lines I still use to this day. <br /> <br /> If you like underground movies, if you like the aerial film, and if you like to watch your feet, just relaxing, they were, you do not like Townies! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (with ****) <br /> <br />
