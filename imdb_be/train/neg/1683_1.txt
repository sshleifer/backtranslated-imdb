It's hard to call The Grudge horror film. At best, it made me a little jump of surprise for a few moments. <br /> <br /> If a person forgets the (failed) frightening dimension and looks at other aspects of the film, he was again disappointed. Action is OK, but not great. The story may be a little interesting in the beginning, while the one trying to get what's going on. But before the end one realizes there is not much to understand. "Scary" elements, it seems, were sometimes added to the scenario without reason ... <br /> <br /> So ... (yawn) See this movie if you do not have anything more interesting to do as sharply carrots or looking up at the clouds.
