Rarely have I seen such a waste of talent disinterested. There's almost nothing constructive to say about this movie hopeless swamp. What are some interesting strands of the film seems to promise initially be little more than a red herring. Growth actors - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - are deployed in roles that do not lead anywhere; Director of accidental genius produces a film that looks like it is shot through the camera lens coffee stains; writer (John Grisham), who had never done anything Q-factor opens new depths under motivated by inconsistency. The film has a low-cost, Slutty feeling about it - but hardly at the level of comments - it is really a part of aesthetics. I usually come on IMDB write balanced, as a rule, the grateful comments. This is a blatant disaster movie just makes me want to produce an endless, bile recitation. I will not, but only because I do not want to take my "reason" with this garbage.
