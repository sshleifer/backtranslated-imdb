Decent animation and a working character development to keep this bike horse animation from DreamWorks, at least watchable ... but it is fairly slow paced and plot a bit on the silly side .. It is interesting to see a reversal of the typical cowboy and Indian roles, but here it just seems a nod to political correctness, not the right solution plot. GRADE: C
