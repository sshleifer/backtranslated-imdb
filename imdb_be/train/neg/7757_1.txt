I have one piece of advice for those people who made this film as well, if you're going to make a movie, as it may be, you got f / x, to support him. Also, you do not get a bunch of Mr. list of actors to play in it. Another thing is, almost all of us have seen Jurassic Park, so do not be rude to copy it. Overall, this movie sucked, f / x sucked acting sucked, unoriginal story. Let's talk about acting only for one second, the guy Carradine, who's career peaked in 1984 when he made the "Revenge of the Nerds" (which was actually more of a comedy). He's not exactly Mr. list, he can act. He just has to say no to so - so fur. He would have done what Mark Hamill made after "Return of the Jedi" and go quietly into the night. He made his mark as a "fool", and that should have been that. I understand that he has bills to pay, but this is unlikely to prepositions - so fur. Did I call this a film that so far? GOOD. I just wanted to be sure. When I sound a bit hostile, I apologize. I just wasted 2hrs of my life, I could have spent doing something productive, like watching paint peel, and I feel cheated. I will close on this note. Thanks for your time.
