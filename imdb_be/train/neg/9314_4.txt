Well ... well, this movie was pretty much useless, and it is basically a horror film that will end up being more of a comedy. I just rented the movie last night, when my friends and I went to the blockbuster looking for a scary movie. It's definitely not what we were looking for, but it satisfies our sense of humor. Actors in the film (especially Brandon) is so fake that it's ridiculous. And even more so that Tracy girl every time she is in the boarded up room, saying a clown to go. They show almost no emotion, and it's just so obvious that they are acting. Also, if a clown is looking through the black paper box thing and grabs Mark, he did not even look like he is afraid, even though the clown as grabbed him and began to attack him. But seriously, you would just be free, if you chase down? I am a man running for his life! (Even if someone can probably outpace that clown because he is 300 lbs.) Not to mention the fact that the effects are not as great as every time clown cuts off the head of Susan in the forest, every time when he throws her head in the boarded up room with Denise and Tracey, when Dennis throws over head. In addition, as in previous comments Man, beginning makes absolutely no sense, and I do not even know why he was even included in the film. So this film, shot in 2003? Music is sound, as it was done in both the 1980s and the camera-ing (?) Do not even really look professional. Half the time, it seems that the camera can not be stable if it is suppose to be. Overall, I must say that I enjoyed the movie. I would not recommend it, though, if you're trying to find something to scare you, but if you are looking for something, maybe get a laugh or make fun with, I would recommend it for sure.
