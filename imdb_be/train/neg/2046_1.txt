I can not believe that this film even made this video, and that video rental stores are ready to put it on their shelves. I literary asked to return the money. Take the fact that the film has no historical truth it, and it is still worse movie ever found in a video store. It's not even good enough to be called a B movie rating. Do not waste your money or time on this movie. Just listing the voice again and eerie music made me sick. All those involved in this film must be removed from the Union, gives the industry a black mark, but after watching this movie, I really do not think that someone is involved is a member of the union.
