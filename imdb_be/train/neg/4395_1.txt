December holiday discount as the original Frosty, should be rich in the production of high-quality music and helpful, even lighthearted storyline. They should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays. Basically, they should look, sound and feel ... well, "special", and they should have a decent and appropriate December holiday overtones. <br /> <br /> So, when I saw The Legend of Frosty the Snowman in the TV listings, I have my children (6 and 8) is pumped into it, telling them the story of the original frosty and passionate about how much I loved it as a child. As my wife and children cozied on the couch watching a movie expectations were high, but after 10 minutes my children yawned, and my wife and I gave each other "the look" and rolled her eyes. After 35 minutes of my children were actually ask to go to bed - I believe that they were fed with insensitive language and meaningless, disconnected segments. I was actually ashamed of their (and my) disappointment of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, The Legend of Frosty the Snowman is more like a bad episode of Magic Parents crossed with worse than a normal episode of SpongeBob than the classic holiday movie. Do not get me wrong ... these shows are beautiful, and I like them as much as the next guy, but when I look at my father or Magic Sponge Bob, have low expectations (for the mediocre, the deviations from the color of zero implication, mad stupor episodes) always performed. <br /> <br /> We have selected some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together. A much better choice than the strikingly poor Legend of Frosty the Snowman.
