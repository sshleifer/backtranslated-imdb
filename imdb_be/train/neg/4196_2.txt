This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Not only the story, but remarkably bad acting. Dialogue sounds like someone is reading news. <br /> <br /> It is ranked as the comedy / drama / romance, this is not one of those things! This is a small action, that's all. There really is no comedy and drama in general. <br /> <br /> If you went to the cinema to see it I feel sorry for you. I would not recommend it at all. Almost everything else that you want to see better. This is largely the action / crime movie. These actions scene sucked, and the story of the crime was very predictable. <br /> <br /> If you are not very interested in a good story and good acting. And you just want to look at the "outer" film to appeal is foreign. Then this could be for you.
