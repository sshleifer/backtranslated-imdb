The guy did a lot of title design for film ligaments, and I believe that he said one day; I have to choose the cheapest scenario, try to put as many titles in it, like a can (cause after all I the name of the designer) and try to convince people that it's actually a movie. One of the worst I've even seen that this is true. If you dropped the desire to see good titles, go check out some posters do not waste your time watching this. <br /> <br /> It's kind of ironic do not you think you've seen the poster? Only part of his project, which was supposed to cover the work have almost nothing!
