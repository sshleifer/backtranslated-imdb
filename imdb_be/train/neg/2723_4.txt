Claire Denis film seems to fall into one of two categories: violent and bloody or quiet and cozy. «L'Intrus» determined falls into the first category, but it's not as bad as «Trouble Every Day» or «J'ai by Sommeil». <br /> <br /> At the present time, since I saw «Chocolat» I made it a point to see each new film by Denis does. And I was always disappointed. «L'Intrus» was no exception. She still has to make the film, both personal and as a movement, as her first. <br /> <br /> You get a lot of regulars Denis: older, but still a wonderful Béatrice Dalle, who seems to be in the film only to show their full lips, the gap between the teeth, splitting its rich and some good coat ; black guy with «Trouble Every Day» and «on Sommeil J'ai» Gregoire knees, and that the Lithuanian or Russian girls. Michelle Subor character was interesting enough, but the camera stayed on it so long, that I was irritated by this curly bangs of hair hanging over his forehead and was relieved when, somewhere in Korea, I think he finally got his cut. <br /> <br /> There was certainly some kind of action - the terrible murder, the search for the son of man - and perhaps even a story, but one view was not enough to understand it, and there are two views, I'm afraid may be out of the question. On the one hand, the cost was harsh and intrusive (as in "Beautiful work"). On the other hand, the seasons have changed too drastically, bringing you even more confused about what is happening. Oh, there were some pretty shots, and if you like "Friday night" with his arrows in heavy folds of drapery and bed sheets, you can appreciate the aesthetics of "L'Intrus." Otherwise, stay away. <br /> <br /> I saw this film in French, and maybe I missed something crucial. But the dialogue in the movie Denis rarely more than five pages, double-spaced with wide margins. In «Chocolat» silence sublime; in «L'Intrus," it's just boring.
