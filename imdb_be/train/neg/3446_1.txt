This film on paper looked like it would be a good thing, after watching, though, I realized that this film was a very terrible !! The plot does not make any sense, and I think I counted the better part of 5000 cut scenes, each of them makes the film more irritable sad and funny. I watched the late night pitch black no noise just add to SCARINESS it, but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music that they would call a tragic music they play opera I mean seriously !! This film sums up all that is not good about this type of film. To be honest, poor to say the least, but look at your own risk, this film is simply nonsense, Enjoy !!
