I will go back to the film in a minute. Firstly, someone wanted to "proof" of Clinton's comments in Georgetown, where he argued that the United States "deserved" 9-11 attacks. Well, that's what Clinton said: <br /> <br /> "In the First Crusade, when Christian soldiers took Jerusalem, they first burned a synagogue with 300 Jews in it, and began to kill every woman and child who was Muslim on the Temple Mount . I can tell you that the story is still spoken today in the Middle East, and we are still paying for it. " <br /> <br /> we're still paying for it? WHADDYA have "we", paleface? Marines storm the Sun Temple Mount. <br /> <br /> But in fact, Clinton never came out and said firmly that we "deserve" 9-11. Like all of his statements during his presidency, he meant that we have earned 9-11. Just show on "fact» A, B, C, D, and perhaps let the listener to conclude that they should add to the conclusion X. When in fact, most of the "Facts" Clinton added to the guacamole. <br /> <br /> But this does not apply to the case. We are here to talk movies, not politics. Unfortunately, when Oliver "Captain Conspiracy» Stone making a film, you can not avoid it turned politicians. It was only a matter of time before he focused his paranoia and anger at the Reagan Era, and what better time than when dreams come true almost Stone, on the day Reagan almost bought the farm. Could not find any nefarious plots and schemes in an attempt to assassinate Hinckley, he invents one of Al Haig. From a simple misunderstanding of the constitutional powers of the chain, Haig transformed from a civil servant, who really should have frosted his citizenship in remedial insane megalomania. You almost expect Haig rub his hands together as Montgomery Burns and say, Cap Weinberger to "Release Hounds." Stone even recruits smarmiest people in Hollywood to play our former Secretary of State, Richard Dreyfuss. The guy hated in mind. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is OK. Average, hovering at below average. Do not bother renting or buying. Try to catch it on cable. 4 10.
