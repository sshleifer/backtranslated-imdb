it's terrible, terrible movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> primarily TOOO length. the longest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The curse stories too over the top !!!! <br /> <br /> but there are too many stories on the fact that the story line is destroyed. <br /> <br /> comedy is not comedy !!!!! it was not funny .... <br /> <br /> story is so repellent and poorly written that it does not matter if the characters live or die ....... <br /> <br /> I had some expectations from this movie ......... but my expectations were completely broken down within the first few minutes ...... <br /> <br /> The only thing good about this film is the music ...... and, obviously, Vidya Balan. It gives you better performance and stands out among all the senior actors ...... she's just a beginner, yet it shines and makes the rest of the cast look so sorry !!!!! Govinda and blond, who playes his love interest and help save this disastrous film. Govinda is perfect in the role of a taxi driver. blonde and also gives a very fine and consistent performance .... <br /> <br /> another talented actress Aisha still completely lost in this movie !!!! so Priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay plays its part, but it seemed too over !!!!! Anil and Juhi is also completely wasted ...... <br /> <br /> Only one good reason is Salman because he has no talent what so ever is wasted !!!!!!!!! <, Br /> <br /> as a whole it is very impractical to Mishmashed film script and TOOO Masladar, that storyline formed in accordance with the blunt comedy scenes. Imagine how silly this movie !!!!!! <br /> <br /> 3/10 it lasts four o'clock !!!! think and rethink before going to the cinema !!!!! better to avoid it !!!!!
