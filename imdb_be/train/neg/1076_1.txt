It was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Branaugh, seemed so much trouble remembering his accent, he could not deliver his lines. The plot was definitely not worthy of the name of John Grisham. Not surprisingly, it has never been published in book form and released in theaters. I have not even watched it all. I decided that I do not care who did it, I realized that it was not a "whodunit" to take care of!
