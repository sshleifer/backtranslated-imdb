First some background; I am in English and lived in London all my life. I have been in many games on «The Den» and most of the other clubs in London bases. I'm familiar with the type of person who gets into hooliganism, and I know how they operate and how they are saying. I must say that this is bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic films I've ever seen. I spent most of the movie flattering embarrassment. I felt that I should write a mini review, because I felt that I need to point out a few things <br /> <br /> a) People just do not talk like that in London in real life. the filmmakers took all the slang thing too far and made it sound stupid. Unfortunately, bullying types exist, but the ones you see in the Green Street more like a parody. b) the actor who plays Pete Dunham (Hannah), unfortunately, goes something like "English" or "cockney", as Osama bin Laden. He is from the north of Newcastle, and I'm just amazed at some of the other participants can keep a straight face acting together with it - we have to take it seriously. Why do not they just get someone from East London to play the part, is beyond me. I could make a "bang-up job" himself, hehe. c) Mr Frodo. I mean, I can wait to get serious about Elijah Wood kicking ass men twice his size and that really nasty bullies. He would have been dead. Simple as that. Frankly (as Brit) it was difficult to watch this movie. I am sure that this movie will bomb here in the UK. It can do a little better in the states, because the Americans just do not know (or care) how inaccurate it is. <br /> <br /> Please, my American and foreign friends, do not believe a word of this nonsense. Yes, these firms do exist, but it is very underground and Hush Hush, and on a much smaller scale. The movie gets only 2 away from me, because they actually shot some of them in London. they usually try to take these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something and wait, we all do not notice.
