.... This mini does not get better with age. I've seen it and it is a continuation, if the original broadcast, and, like many others was blown away. In early 2002, I learned how to WOW novels and W and R, and even more impressive. Then I decided that I had to see how again and has invested $ 200 plus a DVD sets. Again, I watched as the Minis in excruciating detail and realized that I was doing things back - I would buy novels and borrowed <br /> <br /> on the DVD do not think that it is lamentably miscast.? Read novels and see for yourself. I do not think it is dated? The screen is for someone not old enough to have seen it originally broadcast and watch the reaction you get (warning - the reaction from people ranging from those of horror on the belly laughs) <br /> <br /> According to the trivia section for. this mini - himself Dan Curtis chose Ali McGraw and Robert Mitchum. A guy !! Product quality, music scoring, dialogue - the big story was turned into the late '70s soap opera overly ambitious producer / director, who was in way over his head. This thing was dated a minute it was completed. <br /> <br /> The two Minis have been great if the original broadcast, and for those of us who saw them then, nostalgic tug on the line that reminds us of the youth. IMO - this mini is not nearly live up to its reputation and seriously disappointing.
