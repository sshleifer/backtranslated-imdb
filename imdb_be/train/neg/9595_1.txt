In recent years, the movement to bring Asian films in America, this is the last film to be released here. Being a big fan of Asian films of all genres, I was browsing the internet and came across this Sung will be re-released on the US market, so I decided to check it out in advance and take it off at the local video store. <, Br /> <br /> Believe me ... the fight scenes are incredibly frustrating, Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey completely blew this film of water. Jet Li fell asleep while watching the combat sequence. If you are looking for martial arts entertainment, your time will be better with Jackie Chan flick !!! <br /> <br /> Besides ... you think you are going to see martial arts with some girl covered Vengence her parents' death, but the mishap !!! A good hour of the movie in the middle was filled with dialogue, in absense of action, lack of devloping concerning the plot pretty much nothing to do with the premise we are inclined. It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, and the boys with his conspiracy group in which the producer / director of the wholly devoted no time to elbaorating, yet dedicated the film pulls question. Used to be much better if they just cut that whole hour, and developed a story in itself through a different movie and focus on the martial arts aspect. <br /> <br /> By the way, I really do not believe choreographer Iron Monkey, made a sequence of actions in the Princess Blade. I was completely outraged at the frequent use of slow motion and quick change of the camera to display the physical speed of the Assassins. I just do not buy it. <br /> <br /> Please ... I'm warning you, please do not waste your time / money with this film. intrigueing room, and the trailer may even tempt you, but I'm sure that this film is not suitable for public (maybe in Japan, but not in the US) and will be the worst film brought to the United States from the Asian film industry.
