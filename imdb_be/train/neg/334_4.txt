Bad film for sure. It's such a ridiculous fantasy with lots of bad special effects, a lot of hasty scenes (one airport, for example), and real-time unfunny. (Charles Dance) wretched as an evil guy, and he is much better (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) makes no-comic joke, and I heard that it is sunk already a success, great success time ?? !! I could never understand why and how ?! In a television interview, I heard (Eddie Murphy) himself when he was nominated for an Oscar in 2007, regretted it in a humorous way !! <br /> <br /> One of the comments said (Hey ... It's 1980!). Well, not my friend. This cinematic frenzy, which made a lot of Razzie movies all over the years, whether it is in 1980 or 1950! <br /> <br /> There are 2 reasons forced me to write about this movie. First of all, I will never forget the long tan fascinating feet (Charlotte Lewis), especially when she was in bed before the bad guys attack on her house, wearing only a blue shirt and OH BOY camera was make a poem about her bare feet, as it should be. But how strange! As I watched her in the next film, and it was not so nice again? !! In any case, the second reason is that I found the name of this movie lately on my list of the worst 100 films ever <br /> <br /> The result: Bad movie, Greeeeeat feet.
