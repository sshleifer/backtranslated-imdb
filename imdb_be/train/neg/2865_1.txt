Actually, I do not minus, and if this site could, I would give this movie -3 with 10 sense I really hated this movie. I thought that Uwe Boll alone in the darkness was the worst that I've seen so far, but at least I gave it a 2.5 out of 10, in my opinion (Stephen Dorff shooting nothing made me laugh, so I increased ratings by some). Hell, if it was, when compared with BloodRayne, Bloodrayne would win the Oscar for best film, when they competed. <br /> <br /> Now the plot of this film about the BTK killer, which is fine, but they could have done better. Start looked good, but that's all I had to fast forward most of them, because death, which sad. Like killer movie and even if they suck, they can still get some interesting death. I'm not an expert fantasy movie, but believe me, he would have killed himself if he saw it. Sorry for the talk, but there was nothing good to say about it, because it looks like someone took a video camera and shoot it .. it .. thing disasters. Sun Uwe Boll your movies is no longer on my list of the worst films ever it took the cake. <br /> <br /> Well, sorry that I could not explain the plot (if there was one), but it was the best that I could. Now, if you do not mind, I'm going to crawl into a corner and move back and forth and remind me of how bad this movie scared me for life .... OK for Sun Life
