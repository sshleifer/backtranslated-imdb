Eight roll film I watched, possibly, the country; intriguing plot (such as it is) seems initially too flimsy to handle even its cladding 84 minutes, but it somehow manages to get inordinately confusing as it goes along! Potential vampire (poorly dressed, as promised in the title) is held captive in a remote chateau and is only on the "ball" in the blood of those wishing to victims (which seems to be the members of the suicide squad) as if not sure where all this would lead it was written and directed, ultimately, a human villain ?? in fact, the eccentric father of empty faces hero ?? ridiculously shown how mutant (?!) from the future! Sluggish pace and dream-atmosphere (sectarians wearing hoods and masks of animals to hide their features from the sheltered women), of course, characteristic of both film-maker (Ditto seaside setting in {} anti climax) and style of "Euro-CultÂ», equal to as well as a bevy of beauties mating display. Personally, the most pleasant thing in the whole visually attractive but intellectually idle deal watched a familiar character actor Bernard Musson (who appeared in six newly minted Luis Bunuel films) appears embarrassed by it from time to time!
