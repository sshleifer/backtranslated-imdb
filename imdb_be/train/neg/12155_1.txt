If this film was written by the director and producer for the purpose of creating a bad cult movie classic, it may (I say might) was a hit. Have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its shortcomings? Well, this is it. Each of the existing cast to be nominated for worst incentive actions. It would be difficult to find another film with this kind of production budget, containing so little of no value at all. All this, from the opening scene defies logic. Dialogue is absolutely incredible and illogical. The same applies to the behavior and the general storyline of the film. What it is really incredible that some clowns in the conference room were actually decided to spend the money on this piece of garbage. Wow.
