It's not my fault. My girlfriend made me watch. <br /> <br /> There's nothing positive to say about this film. There are already a lot of years, the idea that Madonna can act, but she can not. There was an idea for years that Guy Ritchie is a great director, but he's only mediocre. The confusion on all sides. <br /> <br />
