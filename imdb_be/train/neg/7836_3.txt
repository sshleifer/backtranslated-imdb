The first episode set the bar pretty high, I thought. He starred William Hurt as a hit-man who killed a row toymaker. We were given very little information about his character or who is paying him to kill, in fact, the episode is characterized by having no dialogue at all. Returning to his modernist penthouse he delivered a package containing a soldier, it gives him a smile, but he does not accept it and goes about his business. But he spent the night of hell, the soldiers are alive and how to wage war, jeep driving, shooting machine guns and bazookas, and even fly helicopters!. The special effects are good for a TV show, and it gets pretty busy as he dodges around the apartment, using his wits to survive, sometimes prevails and other times not. I will not spoil the ending, but suffice it to say that it was a clever little twist. This gave me hope for the rest of the series, but I was in for a disappointment, other episodes were all rubbish and I lost interest on the part of the fourth. Stephen King adaptations always heterogeneous, and they are no exception
