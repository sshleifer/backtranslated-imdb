First of all, I just want to say that I love this show !!! But this episode ... this incident makes a mockery of the whole show. <br /> <br /> I do not know what they were trying to achieve with this episode, but they have successfully created the worst episode in a series. <, Br /> <br /> There's no storyline, everything is chaotic and jokes ..... crap. <br /> <br /> By the way, they tried to answer some of the outstanding issues in the game. .... For example, "in furlings look", creating this stupid "earlier ..." ...... it's just uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the authors of the work of ideas, and it is really very bad.
