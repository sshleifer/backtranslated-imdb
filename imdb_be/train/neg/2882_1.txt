This film is the biggest steaming hill you know that being on and grow in Wichita Kansas, I know that 90% of the film was fake. Besides the names of some of the victims, nothing special was not right. The film looks like it was done with the father-friendly camera, it was shots that I believe came from another film with footage from a slaughterhouse. I usually like to watch bad movies for fun, but because of a bad action, bad or non-existent produced sets and very blunt and short ending.It was a struggle to see it to the finals. I recommend you do not waste money on this movie or you will be sorry. crunch
