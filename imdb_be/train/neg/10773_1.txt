I just watched this disgusting thing on TV. Needless to say, this is one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get. Frankly, I do not know how much lower can go bar. <br /> <br /> The characters consist of one lame stereo type after another, and a clear attempt to create another "Bad News Bears" It is a shame to say the very least. <br /> <br /> I saw some turkeys are valued at the time, but there is no reason to list any of them, since it «Numero Uno». <br /> <br /> Let me tell you this way, I watched the movie Ice Vanilla, because it was so bad that it was interesting. This ... this ... is not even that good.
