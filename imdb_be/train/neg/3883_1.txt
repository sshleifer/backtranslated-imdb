No, just kidding. It was God awful. <br /> <br /> I was watching my local Sci-Fi station last night, playing a movie every night, within the monthly theme. This month is Â«Space turkeys, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb". Movies so bad that they should never be made. It was a good choice. <br /> <br /> All of this film thoroughly awful, with two exceptions, gore makeup (which showed potential) and editing (which is a little did the rest of the film, in terms of staying horrible). Actions got everything, awful dialogue, screenplay, direction. It's not a very good film. <br /> <br /> It consists of two forms of special effects and gore footage space. I will focus on gore. Watching this film, I thought to myself: "What was the reason for the shooting of the film" People like doing things, of course, but I did not dare to think anything good could come out of this for all those involved. I came to the conclusion that this film was made as a means to increase the make-up effects Man Demo Reel. He (Rick Baker) actually went on a pretty good career, he worked on the STAR WARS (1977), King Kong (1976), Men in Black (1996), and even the incredible shrinking woman (1981), as well as alongside other notable flicks. Besides, I can not say I ever actually saw a real, live man melt - incredibly, somehow - but I must say that it seemed a fair representation of one <br /> <br. /> Now, when I think about the poor editing, I usually think of, maybe, a scene where someone is talking on the phone, and then, in the middle of the scene, the phone jumps to his shoulder, or something like that. This film really is especially noted for the fact that a bad edit can take many forms. In particular, excessively long and completely useless scenes. Almost every scene lasted longer than it should be, a little bit of dead air to these crazy long shout from the scene Cleaver Girl. And that severed head in the river, his head thrown into the river (in slow motion), the film brings in a few minutes, and then we cut to a floating head and watch it fall down the waterfall. Although I'm sure they were all very proud of his severed head, what the hell ?? <br /> <br /> Finally, I will mention the fat lady running / slow motion scene right at the beginning. Jerky slow motion says to me that they were not filming a scene in slow motion initially, but then decided that it was "not working yes' and then slow it down. Oy vey. In any case, if you ever see one more film in which a thick hysterical woman running down the hall, and then straight through the closed glass door - all in slow motion, mind you - remember the incredible fused MAN, for it * is * where it all began. <br /> <br /> Movies like this are best treated at home with a bunch of friends. This one is a bit slow most of the time, but that's just more time to come up with their own intensity. This is not the worst of the worst, but it's pretty freaking bad.
