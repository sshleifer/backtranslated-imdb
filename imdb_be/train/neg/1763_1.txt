This is one of the worst movies ever. Banal. Predictability. Flat. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was a nominal one point there were a few good scenes, highlighting Barcelona. I believe that they will use such films as Guantanamo or some other hidden prison CIA / NSA torturing suspects. <br /> <br /> Most bad movies have some redeeming features, it has nothing. If I was in it or work on it, I would change my name. Indeed turd. It is difficult to write more than this, but I feel like the world's film reviewers are required to toe on it. On the other hand, it will make a great gift for the people you can not stand. <br /> <br /> You can send it to you like a politician, in-laws, ex-wives, you hated teachers, former employees, Dick Cheney, W., as well as many others.
