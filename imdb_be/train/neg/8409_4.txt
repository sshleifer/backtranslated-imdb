Eddie Murphy for best supporting actor ??? What an insult, Alan Arkin and Khonsu. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx (who can act) passes through the film like a zombie. <br /> <br /> Beyonce ??? It works ??? <br /> <br /> This film pales in comparison to Chicago or just about any other recent music. <br /> <br /> If it were not for the great singing and performance by Jennifer Hudson, I'd give it ZERO. <br /> <br /> A and no, I have never seen a play, so I'm not doing the typical Hollywood vs. Broadway rap.
