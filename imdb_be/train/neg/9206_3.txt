The subject seems quite dated today. Adapted from the book TV Rona Jaffe; we stumble and stumble through fantasy existence. Four college students are actively involved, playing a live version of the board game Labyrinth and the Dragon (based on Dungeons and Dragons). One player, a young Tom Hanks, is a world of fantasy too deep. His co-players have to come to his aid and save him from himself harmed. <br /> <br /> David Wallace, Crewson and Chris Makepeace round four games. Supporting cast includes veteran actors, Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. <br /> <br /> On this day, it seems lumbering and hand. But the nail observation to see Tom Hanks among his "bosom" salad days and a big splash in SPLASH on the silver screen. The youngest of the audience will receive a maximum of pleasure.
