I can not believe how uneducated this film. It's like watching a police academy, except for the fact that he was with people who did not have a clue about what they say, and ... Wait, there's a stupid robot that has to be the sidekick. I know of no confidence suspension, but it's just nonsense. Not only there is no story in this film. It's like watching someone pretending to be a doctor, nonmedical throwing words around as if they were the chief of staff at a large medical facility. Plus, people in clothing, non-adequate for the space program. I feel like I'm looking at the valley-girl «B» cinema in space.
