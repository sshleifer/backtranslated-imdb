I stayed in one night and was very sad about 2:00 am, so I flipped aimlessly through the channels and came across H.B.O. where is the "classic" played. At first I was glad I caught something at the beginning, but my happiness was gone for about two minutes in the movie. The entire film around an unattractive man, who had a fear of women, four beautiful, but empty-minded woman, who works as a waitress in a diner of his uncle, and his very fat and very miserable cousin, who also works at the diner. There are some amazing twists in this film that make it a little interesting, but certainly not worth watching. Basically, if you do not have anything to do some night, or just can not sleep medication works much better. But the guys have a lot of skin, so that it can be good to watch without sound, but even this can be annoying
