If you study the Wells and want to see how far he had fallen after Citizen Kane, this film will prove it. Cheap excuse to make the main character repented dummy, to explain how he could get into such a half-baked scheme does not explain the absurd trials of theatricality and ridiculous plot twists that in the end will come. Do not be taken in high ranking of this film in the database, as I have; All I can guess is that there are many die hard fans of the old Welles and Hayworth there.
