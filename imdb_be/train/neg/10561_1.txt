I saw this film in a period of time when the birth of a child out of wedlock not only destroyed his life, but the stamp of your child as a bastard. In these days of "single mothers" that may seem very far-fetched, but it was very accurate. And I'm not crazy laugh at someone who stutter, either. Between these two problems, I was hard to find this movie funny. At that time I did not know who sent it or what an amazing reputation he had. I knew who was Betty Hutton, and it just made me nervous, because it was so hectic. I loved the "Raising Baby», but I think that this movie is simply a shame. I am sure that the impact of some ecclesiastical functions, likely to have been treated, but I was the one needing a drink after watching it again. The idea of ​​the girl have to drink to "get married" and become pregnant only added to the misery. The whole city can include you in these circumstances, so the result of this film is really fun part. Of course, shoot me, I do not like "It's a Wonderful Life" too.
