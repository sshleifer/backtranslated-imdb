Today I wrote this review in anger against Uwe Boll and Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Hollywood released a movie based on one of the darkest days of our nation. 911, everything changed. It has changed our perception of security. It changed our perception about the evils of man and mankind. The most important and devastating, he changed our world. <br /> <br /> However, I can not emphasize how completely reflected, disappointed, and I was angry with careless, outrageous ignorance of Hollywood trying to make a lucrative profit from death and destruction. This film and the ones like this inevitably causes controversy among word of mouth among moviegoers and critics; most accurately be repeated in the mainstream press. Hollywood has fallen to a new low. Even lower than the evil bastards who have committed the most barbaric acts of cruelty and unrelenting cruelty. In all that Uwe Boll. I am very angry with this film. How dare they disrespect the memory of the victims families? How do they dare to mock the life of brave men and women who risked their lives to save those who have been convicted in the towers on that fateful day of infamy?!?!? How dare they try to ridicule and at the same time earn a national tragedy and mourning in the fog of fatigue after 911 world?!?!?! ... How dare they ...? <br /> <br /> For those who have the audacity to even think about seeing it morally horrible travesty, I say this with a heavy heart, with all his might to remember. Remember the same day, and ask ourselves whether there is or not you are in a state of consciousness and moral person. Think of the day, ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and a shame to the life of the dead on that day. Remember the day the cry of families close. Remember that day in the life of the victims in the two planes. Think further carnage he caused after the attacks. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself if you have a soul. <br /> <br /> Think. Remember. Respect the memory of those killed at 911, not seeing this movie at all.
