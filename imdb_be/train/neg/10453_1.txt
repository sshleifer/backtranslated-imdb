This film deserves more than 1. But I give him one, because many fricken fan boys gave him 10 as a result of which it receives a rating, which will take it to the top 100 list. Seriously, it's not so great it is not so bad. His silly cult with so many fan boys fricken funny. These types, which are probably still laughing at the Chuck Norris jokes and still say, "I'm not going to growl James! Tch "No matter how many years or it gets annoying. I'm afraid to hear "I'm tired of snake Mfn Mfn on this plane," a month now from the idiots who are trying to be funny. Its plot shit shit acts etc. its good to love a bad movie, but you still have to admit its a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Wait Marine starring John Cena, if you want to see a real movie
