The whole world says that the film Tashan is a good movie with great pleasure, but it is not. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress Kareena Kapoor. It was unbearable throughout the film. Her tom-boy look is not very good. Even the film story of the film does not make sense. Everyone said that Quetin Taratino Vijay from India but not quite Quetin. Talent Anil Kapoor has been involved in this stupid movie. Indigo is a high-caliber actor, and this film is not. Akshay Kumar is also a victim of this film, as well as all Saif. Phoormola style and not very good in this movie, I was disappointed
