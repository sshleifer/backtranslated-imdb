I was thrilled to discover that the late sixties comedy watching some of my favorite people - Maggie Smith, a very young Newhart and, of course, Peter Ustinov. My disappointment was therefore deteriorates to open the film does not work, or as a comedy or robbery movie. Ustinov plays a small crook just out of prison, that sets its sites on a major American corporation based in London. Bluff your way past the far distant CEO Karl Malden and technology geek Newhart, Ustinov pass from himself as a computer expert, and immediately plans a "perfect HeistÂ» part of the film. To do this, he needs to get passed the alarm security system that protects the mainframes corporation. But one problem. His perfect plan is working just because everyone else in the film surprisingly gullible and stupid. His lame excuses are accepted at face value, and it should only be a computer center in any place, not to mess around with video cameras. The second problem lies in Heist (fraud really) occurs during the first 30 minutes of the film robs the rest of the picture much in the way of dramatic tension. Maggie Smith, unfortunately, as Ustinov miscast in ditsy neighbor / secretary, who just can not keep a job. I love Maggie Smith, but it just seems too along here, too, it is a part of the call for a more eccentric, physical comedian. In addition, Ustinov, and Smith did not have chemistry together, maybe it's the age difference, but later a romantic relationship, devoid of a real romance as it is, this time goes a little creepy. Ustinov co-wrote the script, and he thought that well in a while, but I found it unfunny, winding and sad waste of a great cast.
