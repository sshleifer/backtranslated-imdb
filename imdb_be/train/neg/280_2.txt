God, I was bored with my head, when I watched the pilot. I expected a lot from him, as I'm a big fan of James Cameron (and not just "Titanic", I might add), and his name in the credits, I thought it would be a guarantee of quality (Then again, he also wrote the lead strange days ..). But the thing failed miserably at capturing my attention at any time of its nearly two hours duration. During all this time, he hardly goes beyond its two-line synopsis, and I would be very difficult to try to figure out a coherent story with all the mess of locks that did not go anywhere. Also, I do not think acrobatics surpassed even those of «A-Team» any regular episode. As for Alba, yes, gorgeous, of course, but the thing is that it only shows one single facial expression the entire film (Pouty and unattractive), makes me too annoying her "gal wit relations" schtick rather quickly. You can count on me for this one, Mr. Cameron!
