Watching the videotape replay about 8 different 1994-1997 Spider-Man cartoon made me realize why I could not stomach it when it first came out. <br /> <br /> I'm from the old school, where the 1967 Spider-Man cartoon was the best and still remains the best. (I will not go into a psychedelic version that scary - give me a traditional villain please.) <br /> <br /> entering the new material lousy, read a letter to both without feeling or replay. Sex soles, where are you now? This guy was the best in scoring for Spider-Man. No one comes close. Watching Secret Wars, a great idea for a mini-cartoon series, made me wince. Dr. Doom sounds like a comedy version of Bela Lugosi. In the scene of the Red Skull and Doc Ock, Red Skull has a German accent, and Ock heavy Russian! Old Marvel comic hero series in 1966 was much better voice acting. Iron man sounded like he was dressed in the Iron Mask, sounded authoritative Captain America is not like any teenage child. Paul Frees as a thing in the 60s was the best thing ever. The old voice actors were the pioneers, and will never be anyone like them. Ever I heard the son of Mel Blanc? In any case he can repeat his father. <br /> <br /> Animation Sun clumsy. Okay, so they have all the fashionable shades of character and beautifully drawn backgrounds. Sometimes you can say more with less traffic when more traffic looks bad. Sometimes, when you let the computer take over the movement that they become robotic. I really do not think that any of these animator knows what is in betweeners. <br /> <br /> Stories poorly written and some of the lines that they give terrible hero. Why, for example, when the characters have come together for the first time when they start to fight with each other? The Secret Wars, it was lame base that got them in disagreement. I can see where the hero was a dark, unknown and mysterious. - as the Punisher, but for some reason the thing and Iron Man can not keep his characters with each other is ridiculous, the Torch joins This is one of the later comic tendency to get hero calming one on one for a few seconds, because "all" want I see things. Give them the best reason to fight, and perhaps it can be pulled off, but "Hey, what are you doing here" and "You do not tell me what to do" lame reasons. Another poorly written scene in the wedding, where Harry Osborn exposes himself to ruin Peter's wedding. This whole scenario was a terrible <br /> <br /> Last but not least, it is the fact that another critic called Juvenile violence. - means no shock at all. The Secret Wars Lizard carefully ducked charge of things. But Thing beats the bad guys through the whole block in the comics. He should just go back to lift heavy things and subduing a bad guy, clutching at his cartoons. Of course, these cartoons were made, not only for us adults, but for children up to 12 years, so they can not be perforated, because Mom and Dad did not believe in that kind of violence. But you can compromise, these cartoons will include it. As a child, before political correctness came into vogue I have seen cartoons punching each other. What's wrong with kicking chops? Is there really less violence in the world today, because these are slippery and treacherous new cartoons removed the strike? I believe this is the most offensive of all, when I look at the new stuff. They have written "punch", because we all could hurt yourself. <br /> <br /> The children enjoy these cartoons all you want, I've seen enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10 rating
