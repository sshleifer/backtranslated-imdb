I thought that the main character, an astronaut with a bad case of the runs (in his case, his skin, hair, muscles, etc.) can always get more work in film after it has been reduced to a puddle. All he has to do is get a job as a Blob. The premise of this flick is quite inaccurate. Astronaut infected by solar radiation spot (I think), and therefore begins to act like ice cream on a hot day. Moreover, it is a difficult task, but, apparently, he had to kill people and eat their flesh, so that he can maintain the integrity of some cells. And? Have you ever noticed that if any kind of radiation accident or experiment going on, people instantly transformed into a killing machine? Why? <br /> <br /> Astronaut thunder on the night of "secret facility" (which has no security at all), dropping parts of itself as it goes. Apparently, he keeps only enough memory to get his head to the launch pad, perhaps because he wanted to go back into space. <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the movie, which is quite a lot of filler, with the doctor, walking with a Geiger counter, trying to find a melting man buzz he admits. It kills the stupid Bill Gates look-fish discourages little girl a la Frankenstein monster movie, and ends the silly top pair (karmic punish them for stealing some lemons). Then there is a short scene where he beats his former general, and very long scene where he kills a young terminal and drives his girlfriend around. You would think that after she cut off his hand, and he ran away, the scene will change. But no ... we were treated to about ten minutes the woman huddled in a corner, gasping and screaming in terror, even if the monster disappeared. All I could think was..director girlfriend who? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film even lamer than anything else. Melting Man does not end turns into a pile of goo, and then ... nothing. That's all. This is the end of the film. Well, at least it means that there was no place to continue.
