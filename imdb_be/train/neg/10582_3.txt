At first I was convinced that it was a film made for television, which was not worthy of a prime. But after a few minutes of silent fear of failure, I realized that there was at least the comic value in the over-the-top stunts and action of the film. This film would get 1, when my wife and I did not laugh as much as we have seen it is a wonder that the actors could keep a straight face. It was like a less funny version of Spy The Big Hit (I laughed so hard that actually bought Big Hit DVD) with an even worse effect. We were disappointed that Nick decided to get married to Elena, not Jim, after all the hugging and high-fives. Several rum and coke, will certainly help him to go down easier.
