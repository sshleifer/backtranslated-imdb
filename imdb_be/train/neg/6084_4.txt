It is possible that a man named Sonny, could have been done irreparable damage to the floor of the room. Perhaps someone will require the director cut one day, but I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> James Garner decided to cash in on the spaghetti western market and at the same time brought a whole bunch of older Americans to fill out throwing. People like Dennis Weaver, Claude Akins, John Marley. And, of course, we have Vic Morrow, who wrote and directed the film. <br /> <br /> Garner always gets cast as the nice crooks, because it's so damn good at playing them. But he played seriously and do it well in films such as The Children's Hour and hour gun. He may come off from their usual stereotype of the successful. But a man named Sonny can not be regarded as one of its successes. <br /> <br /> He got the title role as the notorious Sani Luther an outlaw with a big price on his head. After partner Tony Yang killed in the cabin and Garner takes appropriate measures in Eastwood style, he went out of the cabin, John Marley. <br /> <br /> Marley spent time in neighboring Territorial Prison, and it seems that the gold shipments to put under lock and key there for a rest stop for people who transport the material on a regular term. Garner gets a gang together for a robbery. <br /> <br /> This is where the film goes completely off the wall. Usually Heist films show the main characters, who go into a lot of methodical planning. Of course, it took place in the War Wagon, which some other reviewers cited. But this Garner decides to enter the prison as a prisoner of the United States fake marshal Dennis Weaver and cause a jailbreak in which time will be robbed of gold. <br /> <br /> It was too much to swallow. If you take this gold it was easily should have been done long before. But I will say to those who love the blood and guts of Italian Westerns, during this break the prison there is enough there three films. <br /> <br /> This is not all of it, of course, the robbers fall and we have another gusset festival before the movie ends. But by the time all the films lost a lot of coherence. <br /> <br /> great film thirties singer Alan Jones featured in the credits. But for the life of me I can not find it in the film. Maybe choir Donkey Serenade could do it better. <br /> <br /> It may not hurt.
