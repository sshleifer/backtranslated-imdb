JUDAAI was a bold film Raj Kanwar at this time in 1997, if this topic has been a hell of out of the box <br /> <br /> To give him credit, he's happy to show how greed changes a person and a the degree of a person can go to get what she wants <br /> <br /> film, however, damn melodramatic, a lot of places, funny <br /> <br /> wonders why Anil does not buy a TV for his wife? if he earns so much time to show how poor it? <br /> <br /> Turn handled well, but the appeal straight from the 80s Johny- Paresh comedy that entertains here and there stands out like a sore thumb as it does not fit in the history <br /> <br /> Even there are several cringeworthy scenes <br /> <br /> The direction of Raj Kanwar adequately, although sometimes too melodramatic music is OK, but most of the songs have to look <br /> <br /> Anil makes it part of a well Sridevi beautiful in a decent part of Urmila Kader Khan, among others, as usual, Johnny Le Verrier funny, Paresh annoying Farid decently
