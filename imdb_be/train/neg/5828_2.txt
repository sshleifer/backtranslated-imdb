I could not agree more with the other reviewer that said Jodorowsky. <br /> <br /> Barney, it seems very sad and uninspired "content-wise." It can produce eye-candy (I love sweets), but its pretentiousness and fundamental artistic emptiness simply reduces all the joy. <br /> <br /> I am afraid that many people do not distinguish between similar (but really only on the surface) of the work Jodorowsky or more linear filmmakers like Tarkovsky and Kubrick (I love the 2001 Odyssey, and was never bored through which the end of the scene ...) This kind of art like M.Barney brand adds to the confusion and saves viewers who might start to appreciate the experimental cinema. Typical empty postmodern "conceptual" art. And check out his interview. I just do not buy it, I'm sorry. And so sad. <br /> <br /> I've never been sad to see movies Jodorowsky, while drawing restraint 9 was a complete disappointment. Especially while he offered the opportunity to be something that is really saying something in nonlinear unorthodox ways (for example, at the beginning and a great dance dance and prepare for the ship to sail. Ships "meeting" of the sea ... Ideas feces as a precious object (if it was feces). the "pearl" of divers ... Everything would be great to build a surreal film with some content. But it is not. and these terrible scenes of pathos disguise and fake tea ceremony ... How useless and fake and pretentious philosophical, but empty it can get? <br /> <br /> I byt_nast some great colorful scenes, but the whole movie has become so boring and pretentious and utterly empty and fake, that it made me. physically ill <br /> <br /> and it has a good pace I like the slow pace of the movie, but it was just boring in some scenes -. because it was pretentious and fake - so I just was forced to witness prolonged scenes of artistic vanity ... <br /> <br / > This movie just kill art and Spiri t, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I want more Jodorowsky !!!
