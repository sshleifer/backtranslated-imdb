As an advocate of Elvis, I can not understand how this can be done proyect. There are, of course, the worst Elvis-related film of all time, just not funny, silly, and a lot of mistakes about the king. Come on, Elvis's grave in a public park? Mention of suspicious Minds in 1958? ... and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast trying to do my best, Mike Starr funny (especially as a simulator), Tom Hanks cameo is a surprise, but the guy plays the young Elvis sucks.Overall movie lacks fun and is becoming increasingly sad minute after minute. If you want to see the ultra cheap, mad, but it is a funny movie that is associated with Elvis, I really recommend you Â«Bubba Ho-Tep" instead mess.
