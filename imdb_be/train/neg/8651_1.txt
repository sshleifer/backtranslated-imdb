I watched the first 15 minutes, thinking that it was a real documentary (with annoyingly too dramatic, "the camera" producer). <br /> <br /> When I realized that it was all set, I thought, "why do I want to spend my time watching this stuff ?? "So I turned it off and went on the Internet to warn others. Symbols are not plausible manner. too many immature emotions. for a guy to travel halfway around the world in the war torn country, he acted like a child. and I do not believe that this was because "the character was so upset about the explosions mall." <br /> <br /> very trite and silly. <br /> <br /> Have you seen the "lost city of the children?" French dark fantasy film about a guy who kidnaps children and steals their dreams ... I liked it!
