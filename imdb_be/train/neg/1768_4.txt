This is another of those films that would be great. The basic premise is good - immortal cat people who kill to live, etc. -. A kind of variation on the vampire concept <br /> <br /> The thing that makes it all falls apart is the complete folly of the main characters, even psychopaths know that you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive. - look how long it took to catch Unibomber, and this is because the family members understand it <br /> <br /> In contrast, the child (and to a lesser extent, female), behave as if they shall be inviolable. The child kills without a thought for the Sun leaving a trace or evidence or living evidence. How do these people have managed to stay alive and undiscovered for a month incredible, not to mention a few decades or centuries <br /> <br /> It's really a shame. - it could be much more if it was written plausible, ie giving the main characters of the level of common sense, they would need to get by for so long. <br /> <br /> In addition, not a bad show. I loved the bit at the end where each cat in converging on the house - every time I put food on the porch and see our cat suddenly burst from where they were before, I think that this scene.
