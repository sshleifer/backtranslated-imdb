"Brain Machine", at least put your own brain into overdrive, trying to understand what it's all about. Four subjects of different backgrounds and level of intelligence were chosen for the experiment, one of the researchers described as the scientific study of human health and environment. Since the only common denominator among them is the fact that each of them has no known family should have been a tip off -. None of them will be missed <br /> <br /> The thing is under the control of a mysterious creep is known only as a whole, but it seems to me that it takes its direction from a senator who wants to remain anonymous. Good call there from the senator. There's also a shadow guard, the camera continuously focuses on that later claims that he is not on his side from the general or «The Project». It is a pity that he was not more effective, it was suppressed quite easily, before it all went kablooey. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, the film is a real treasure trove of technology 1970s involving repeated rounds set of phones, computers, room size and teletype machine that will not go away. Perhaps that was the basis of the alternative name of the film - «Time Warp", nothing would have made no sense As for me, I would consider the name proposed by the murdered doctor Krisner experiment, entitled «Stress Group Project This also applies to the actors and.. viewers, so the film. <br /> <br /> Keep only over the head of General in the pool when he asks the agent to his arms, the boom microphone can be seen over his head for several seconds. <br /> <br /> you can catch this film if you are a die hard fan Makreyni he could ever that young? James Lep Shea is also a few unusual role of the mysterious nun, but do not call him father. For something a little more to his lane, try to get your hands on the 1959 «The Killer Shrew." This one, at least does not pretend the fact to take yourself so seriously.
