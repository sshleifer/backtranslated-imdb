This film (along with Rinne) are small stones among RETREAD memory tribute pictures that went to horror movies so far in 8FTDF «HorrorFest.» And, yes, this is a weak praise. Because there is not much worse than in filmdom potential filmmakers who feel the atmosphere of a substitute for a coherent plot. <br /> <br /> And that's all you get with the rest. This is a film that was almost entirely in the mind of directors. Of course, it would be good if it passes it to shoot, but it happened instead. This is a very beautiful film with few real scares, but the last coil is strictly for latte sipping crowd connoisseur and lover of cinema.
