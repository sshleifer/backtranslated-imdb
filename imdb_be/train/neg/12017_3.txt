I'm a big fan of the work Ludlum, and because of the Hidden one book, and I have often thought how incredible it would be made into a film. Imagine my excitement, then, to learn that this movie really existed! "Hades Factor" is the first in the series seemed an obvious place to start. <br /> <br /> From the outset, the film was disappointing. Simple elements of the film, such as the first meeting of the Griffin Smith vain differ from books, and much less exciting. Several characters are poorly cast, too. To start Dorff is poor as Smith. Not a bad actor, just incredibly bad choice, because it is too soft, and do not exhibit many of the features that are the end of John Smith. <br /> <br /> Re-naming, re-appointment and even omission of certain characters further exacerbates this film. For example, the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire background of the virus, including participation VAXHAM makes the whole point of the film somewhat vague. Marty Zellerbach very large part of the book and place it takes a lot to vary the rear seat (not to mention the fact that the shares of the film Landmark nothing to do with the character in the book) is not yet another big mistake. <br /> <br /> Rachel Russel is supposed to be Randi Russel from the book. Not only that, it has to be the sister of Sophie Amsden (should be called Sophia Russel), but it should also work with the CIA, not the "last-one." This brings me to the final point, and I think one of the most important. COVERT-ONE does not even exist at the moment! Not until the second book of the series entirely Covert-One, designed by the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorism. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I could go on all day. In short - if you love the book and want to see a good adaptation, I am afraid that you will be bitterly disappointed. Even gunman is thoroughly average, mainly due to very dim editing and bad effects. Ineptly storyline and dull, like a desperate scenario of water are final nails in the coffin of this very cheap film.
