Dark Rising your typical bad, obviously, quickly made the horror / sci-fi / fantasy film. He has an amazing, inexplicable plot holes so big you could put an elephant through them. Most of the time I do not know what the hell is going on, but it really does not matter, it was a simple demon hunter is back with a hell dimension, to keep the camper story with the addition of intricate material about witches and evil books with story elements and characters that have no meaning or disappear entirely without reason. Act is bad, but there honestly is not much they can do with this script I guess. There are a couple of topless scenes, which is probably the only reason for this bad film got made (like so many other bad movies). Give it a pass if there is nothing else on TV
