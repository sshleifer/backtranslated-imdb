This is pretty much the first film Jason Scott Lee, I saw. I say a lot, because I saw the soldiers, in which he plays a villain ... but from what I've heard, it is not considered a film Jason Scott Lee. This, however, is. And if it is any indication of the quality of these movies, I do not see any of the others. Or mostly passable as an artist, martial arts ... as a leader, he's terrible. He gets to deal with random characters with no name every few minutes of the film, probably because the author of the script could not figure out how else to stretch the film to the minimum required operating time for a feature film. The villain is the only character, even with a hint of personality, and aside from the fact that he was certifiably insane, it hardly seems a villain at all. Much of the film is mainly Lee in pursuit of a villain in time ... or maybe it's the other way around. I can not say for sure ... and I just will not watch it again to make sure. Effects is not entirely terrible ... but it's close. The name is derived from the popular idea of ​​using a time machine to go and kill Hitler. Anyway, the film screws up this interesting idea, as well. The plot is too complicated for its own good. Walk poor. I can not think of one positive thing to say about this film ... I really can not. It's just too hackneyed and meaningless. If only I had a time machine, so I could go back and prevent this film ever made ... no, it does not matter. I just hope that, like some delicate minds are affected by this, as far as possible. Listen to the negative reviewer. Avoid this turkey. I do not recommend it to fans of Lee, and no one else. If you are looking for high quality film ... well, it's not. That's right. 1/10
