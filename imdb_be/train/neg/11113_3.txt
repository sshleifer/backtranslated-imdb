I often feel like Scrooge, slamming the movies, others rave about - or, I'm writing a review to balance unjustifiable raves. I found this movie is almost unwatchable, and unusually for me, was a fast-forwarding not only through the dull, clichéd dialogue but even stupid, the clichéd musical numbers. Regardless of the originality of his existence in this film - an unusual internal setting for a musical, a lot of imagination, some animation - this is more than offset by a script that is not an ounce of wit and thought-provoking story. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey seems to good people, but can not carry the film as a team. Neither really charismatic and has a lot of sex appeal. They are both flat. I love Billy Gray, but his character is fairly one note. The best part of the movie, to me, in June Haver beautiful costumes and great body.
