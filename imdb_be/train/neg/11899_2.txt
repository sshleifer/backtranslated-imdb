Robert Forster, as a rule, very strong character actor, lost at sea throw here, as New York family man seeking revenge bandits who killed his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion. Scary subject for base maintenance of thrills in the spirit of «Death Wish». It's not hard to scoff at this flattering thing: dialogue full of pearls, crime statistics irrevocably out of date, and the supporting characters are ridiculously rewritten (especially despicable judge who allows the accused killer to go straight from the courtroom). Low-rent production contemptible in its complacency, especially since the violence in our cities has only increased. * From ****
