Sitting down to watch the 14th season of Bachelor ( "On the Wings of Love"), I knew I was in for a "fun" time. I watched some of the previous seasons bachelor among other things; watch an episode or two, and missing the next three or so. I believe that the bachelor is often attractive and intriguing, though the quality and morality is often lacking. <br /> <br /> Â«On the wings of love" part occupied by Jake travels in 31-year-old commercial pilot from Dallas, Texas, to find true love, the true love, how to find a season ago, the reality dating show drama . Jake meets 25 beautiful girls from around the country. He starts to get to know them a little bit, but mostly superficial; how well you can get to know someone in a few 5 minutes of calls? Jake tries to make his true intentions known from the outset, at least, to the audience. He pointed out that he not only wants love and a good time, but he wanted the bride or wife. We can only assume that he made it clear to women in the competition as well. If so, it would explain to some extent, some of the actions of women. Women are very competitive. Despite the fact that they do not even know Jake was still on, they are still in it to win it, no matter what the cost. <br /> <br /> Not only women are competitive, but they were also confident and catty. Threats, Backstabbing and warning "Caution!" Everything indicates that these women were not there for a good time either. Jake said that he was not just looking for sex appeal, but is looking for "connection". Nevertheless, the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress Jake said tight. They arrived at the house in short dresses ?? either cut or short circuit. <br /> <br /> While some girls seemed to maintain a sense of decency, others missed the memo as a whole. One girl, Channy, said Jake was "a nice guy" to whom it could be a "naughty girl." She went on to say that Jake could land on her "runway at any time." She got flack from others girls for her provocative statement, which showed their take on these situations. <br /> <br /> Thus, the reality dating show can not be that bad, right? Besides the obvious issue of attracting sex initiatives, there are other problems that spoil this seemingly harmless show. This is the right way to find a future mate; vie for someone's attention to flaunting themselves in extreme proportions? Unfortunately, however, it is that America has reduced the love these days :. Fun and sex without commitment and a bit of luck on the side <br /> <br /> Another problem is the premature emotional attachment with which many girls linked himself Jake. Several girls, in particular, seemed overly attached. One girl said: 'If I do not get that first impression rose it would kill me, "As mentioned earlier, they do not even know it yet, and she talks about the particular roses, not just one of 15 roses to be eliminated. <br /> <br /> Michelle, in particular, seemed to have some problems with addiction to Jake. Other girls have noticed this too. After one particular gap Michel, Vienna claimed that Michelle was a "mental disorder, and we are only an hour." Michelle got the last rose pm on the first show ?? almost no exception ?? and it was very emotional about it. The other girls thought it was ridiculous. Another girl also cried, but because it has been eliminated. <br /> <br /> He started with Survivor, and from there it just took off ?? reality show. This shows our entertainment interests of both countries; if we did not watch the show and give them good grades, the network does not continue to run them. The only logical conclusion to be drawn that America quite touched. One thing is clear: America (in general) love reality shows and the ensuing entanglement <br /> <br /> It is asking me a question :. Why is it that we even like reality TV? What are neighbors, that draws us to him? This is because we see the similarity to our own lives, or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others? Regardless of what attracted us to it, we should be cautious in the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds. I'm not saying that all reality shows bad; However, I am saying that we have to evaluate each one <br /> <br /> The episodes, which are used to criticism :. Prime Season and Episode 2.
