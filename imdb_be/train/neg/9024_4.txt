«Shinobi» is one of those movies that thinks that the act of killing the character automatically brings a sense of ambiguity or emotion to the story. Unfortunately, for the audience really care about people dying, you must develop the characters, otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is particularly complicated, if you have a ton of characters, each of whom die. <br /> <br /> So, if you can not be bothered to make the character memorable and cute in any case, you can at least make the reasons for which they die plausible, does not it? No. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, with none of the parties do not know why they are fighting with each other. They kill each other, because the emperor says. But even after how well it becomes apparent that the outrageous emperor wants all of them are dead, they still refuse to abandon their meaningless tasks. It's not stubbornness ... it's just nonsense. <br /> <br /> Well, well! There's no character development and the story does not give any reasonable justification for fighting. At least, they die in the fight with cool scenes, right? But then again, NO! In fact, many of the battles did not even fight at all: super ninja, the film spent so much time and effort, presenting a die suddenly (and unconvincingly, in my opinion). I'm talking about things like, «Lalala, I go along and I- * * neck gets slashed." END to this sign. Not even halfway through the movie, I threw my hands in frustration on his ludicrousness.
