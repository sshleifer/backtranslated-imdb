This budget starved Italian action / sci-fi hybrid is equipped with Warbeck as a reporter for Miami, which selects the ghosts of the people of Atlantis (!) To stop the evil businessman (Oscar nominee John Ireland) using telepathic fruit grown using spores from an asteroid to rule the world. Do you have anything? Despite such a crazy story, it is actually quite boring and RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS sneers at him with disdain. Frankly, most (intentionally) creative things about this film is a remake of a small Beverly Hills COP threads Herbie Hancock to the opening credits. Most unintentionally creative bit includes a scene in a laboratory that is inexplicable shown twice back to back. Maybe the director Alberto De Martino wanted all of us to the avant-garde in the twilight of his career? I was going to announce the worst film of the Irish on your resume, but then I saw Satan's cheerleaders was listed there. I would also safely say that I am probably the only person in the history of the world to make this dual function and dizziness Hitchcock.
