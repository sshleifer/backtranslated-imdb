I saw this film in my class cinema. I'm glad I did not pay to see it. I went into it with an open heart, and was even a little excited. I really like Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the rest of the cast was interesting. I just never connected with this film. The acting was great, the cinematography was interesting, but the story, or rather the lack of it, was a problem. There was no central, uniting theme for the film. Was it a romance between Norton and Wood? Well, no, not really. Was it a Western? Look, but do not. I'm all for turning to the cinema, I recently saw "Brick" and loved it, but the place that the film was too went there. It was so strange, and if I would not have needed to spent the whole movie, I would have left. Writing was not terrible, but it was just everywhere. By the time the movie was over, I just left terribly confused and wanting it to end sooner. It was just something about this film that does not resonate, I understand more extraordinary films as "Fight Club", but I just did not care at all about the characters.
