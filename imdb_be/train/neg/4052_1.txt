I just saw "If you ??" I remember the advertising of the film in 1968, so I was interested in eventually seeing it. This may be the prospect of an American who never went to a British public school and misses some of the social link, but I thought that movie was awful. On the one hand, as already mentioned, it takes almost the entire film in many ballyhooed-na-na-a riot to break out. On the other hand, there is a real or imaginary last scene, what happens is not a revolt, and the shooting rampage. There's quite a difference. <br /> <br /> I know that this may be bad form to judge the film on these events, but we can not do it here. One person wrote a message board announcement asking us not compare the movie to the end of the incidents in the Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. But if there is a grain of difference between Klebold, Harris and Cho on the one hand, and Travis (McDowell), on the other hand, I just can not see it. All four of them were under the delusion that they are going to clean the cannonade A F ___- ed up world that they proudly bear no responsibility for <br /> <br /> This brings me to :. Why, hell, Travis and his chums even at school they so despise? They are adults, or close to it. They are not in a military prison, as prisoners in «The Hill», much better, a British film about the same time. No one is forcing them to go to college and take a beating from the lashes, with the exception, perhaps, ambitious parents in need of awakening of the nature of their sons. I had a chance in college to join a fraternity, except that I could not stand to give a stupid, cruel orders of criminals who claim to be my future "brother". I took the consequence of not having a "c" with an establishment that frats software, and I can not say I regret it. <br /> <br /> If Travis is host the second coming of Lenin (whose spine picture hangs prominently in his room) he is free to go out and organize a union or locksmith work Michael Foot in the next election. If he wants to be Jack Kerouac, and then get on the road and start writing. What are the possible benefits it provides light in the motorcycle joyriding and drunk in his room? <br /> <br /> Sometimes, reviewers should be like a man who responded to the scene in "Last Tango in Paris", where Brando spleen that had to go on a date with cow dung on his boots. In the real world, the person said, the listener will say, "Why do not scratch it? Change shoes? »--Don't allow fictional characters lay Self-pity trip on you, because you do not dare to point out the common sense of an alternative course of action for them. So here.
