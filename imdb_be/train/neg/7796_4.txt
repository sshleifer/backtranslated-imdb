Wow, it's not just the film "a new lesson in a real bad taste", but also a lesson in ". Real bad movie" Do not get me wrong, I appreciated the concept of "Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence", but at the same time we must understand if the movie is terrible. If you missed out on the story, the plot of "Zombies" 90 "is about government plane carrying toxic chemicals that because there is a failure in the desert, causing chemicals to spill, turning local people into hideous looking zombie. The next thing you know, zombies throughout the city in the diet of people living, while blunt prospective doctors and government agent trying to figure out a disease that makes these people eat one each - hence the name "Extreme pestilence." Since then, we see a zombie, having a field day at each local in sight - nothing but extreme and heinous disembowelments and dismemberments accompanied by endless buckets of guts and gore. It's a German film, the film had to be dubbed in English, and if you do not laugh inflate the zombies, the voice-over is quite fun and entertaining as well. As a user UnratedX mentioned * Spoiler * Spoiler * Spoiler *, there is a scene in a movie that crosses the line between what is acceptable and not acceptable, therefore, a scene in which a woman who takes her infant baby, now wheeled around in a wheelchair on some dude and hordes of zombies do not come out of nowhere and attack them. One zombie grabs the child and tearing it to pieces, has its own bodies, as you hear a baby crying. Wow, that's a new lesson in REALLLLLLLLLY bad taste. I tell you the brutal, brutal.
