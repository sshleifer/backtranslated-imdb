### Spoilers! ### <br /> <br /> What is the movie now! With the edit control and Cinematography, which coincides with a terrible story. It is sad to see the talents of Denzel Washington are wasted in the trash as a this.We, of course, hinted as Mexicans can not save himself, the external force required may be militaristic, American. And we know that his father was a shady character, he is a Mexican in the end, unlike his wife, who appreciates Creasey more, because he is an American. He killed them all to think that she was dead. And did she? Of course, she will not, she is a young guy, and you do not have to touch the feelings of ventilation Hollywood. Compromise scene was the only thing stopping me from rating it below "incredibly successful" (as some critics have pointed out) "take". Nausea such films take time to go. It is in the ranking of the movies that we should doubt credulity.7.7 IMDb in for a movie like this and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho. Go figure it out! The shaft will be in the range of 3.5-4.0
