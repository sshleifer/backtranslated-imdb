Can someone please stop with John Carpenter constantly and deliberately ruining his reputation? How low can you go? It seems that this man has lost self-esteem. <br /> <br /> This episode looks like it was made a film student, do not even begin to say that it was bad, because it's just borefest, directed by someone, without or without talent as a director of any motivation ... <br /> <br /> Well, Mr. Carpenter, please, just go with the rest of the self-esteem and to stop the flood of garbage like this in a bad tradition of Escape from LA to Ghosts of Mars. <br /> <br /> get drunk instead.
