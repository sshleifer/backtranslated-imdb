This is a wonderful fusion of New Age babble and luridly bad filmmaking can not "open" for you to take one of his favorite verbs film, but it may leave the jaw slack and your stomach sick from laughing or vomiting. Based on the bestselling book by James Redfield, the first (self), published in 1993, is the wealth of kitsch tracks spiritual awakening of the American history teacher (Matthew Settle), who, on a trip in the deep, dark, phoniest Peru and sniffing or air or something more illegal. Namely, what he finds is a Shangri La trash populated smiling zombies that can be nuts, or just much medication, perhaps because they are often accompanied by a pipe to flourish and single shout from the heavenly choir. Despite the fact that there is a lot of talk about the "energy" that the quality is clearly not enough of colorful actors, whose numbers include Krechman, Annastet Gish, Hector Elizondo and Prochnow, all of which are already firmly established in the pantheon of the camp. For those who care, the plot includes the military, the terrorist and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni, provided that mismanagement while Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the script beep. In short, the film is easily the worst seen in 40+ years of watching movies.
