Probably the worst Bollywood movie I saw. <br /> <br /> A lot of the story line. Very small changes in the nature. <br /> <br /> Full stupid and pointless humor. The entire film was chaotic and less direction. There was no proper ending of the story. The airport was filmed at the mall. <br /> <br /> The same story chewed again and again, until you do not want to say "please, just move on with it !!" Even the song and dance was pointless and poorly choreographed. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this film is that there were hot boards of directors all around ... but most Bollywood films have, in any case, these days. <br /> <br /> By the way, I am not of Indian origin <br /> <br /> 2/10
