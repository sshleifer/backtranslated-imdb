Enchanted Boat sells itself as a "fog" meets the «Open Water». In many ways, that's for sure. There are scares and amazing looking people to keep you interested. <br /> <br /> However, the acting skills poor at best. Showing clear signs that this is just a bunch of friends that make a horror movie. That in all the credit they make the best of their abilities. If you are taking a low budget makes it very difficult for special effects, a haunted look quite a lot like the man with rubber masks on. <br /> <br /> Many aspects of the film are terrible and strange. But it suffers from the use of too many twists and turns in a short period of time, which just leaves you bored and confused. From the point of view of saving, you'll make a movie is very good. Not paying attention to unnecessary twisting every 5 seconds towards the end, you really want to know what's going on. And willing to wait 1 hour and 35 minutes to climax. <br /> <br /> This is not the Ghost Ship, but it will definitely make for an evening in front of TV
