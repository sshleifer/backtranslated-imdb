I remember seeing this cartoon when I was 6 or 7. My grandfather took a video of it for free at the mall. I remember that it really sucks. The plot makes no sense. I hated the fox, who became a member of Casper. It was so stupid! Casper shouted his head off if he can not find a boyfriend. So what? Get over it! The only good part, and I do not want to sound mean-spirited was when the fox was shot and died at the end. I laughed my head in the payback, because this cartoon sucked so much. The bad news is that the fox was resurrected and becomes a ghost. I want him to stay dead. I think I even made a video of someone, because I hated it. Not surprisingly, they did not offer it for free at the mall. If you have a child, do not let them watch it. They would probably agree with me that it sucks.
