... but the key word here is "usually". I, as you know, I love all the movies think that dumb. But in the world of B-rated films, this one Z-rating. Absolutely ridiculous. What I respect most of my favorite B-rated movies, they do not take themselves too seriously. Filmmakers like this kind of film-processing easy, even if it is a heavy topic. I have the impression, however, that the producers of this film took its way seriously as they put together 10 stars of classic, complete with a poor attempt to blunt painful lines and camera images. However, despite all this, I still gave it a 4 out of 10 stars as I'm biased to films like this. If you rated B fan, but I would like to try too hard to find it.
