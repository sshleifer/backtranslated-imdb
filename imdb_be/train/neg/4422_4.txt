This is one real bomb. We must believe that Merle Oberon sequester is the daughter of an ambitious politician who has to prove Tom DeLay 1930s that he deserves support as a presidential candidate. Poor Merlot can not go anywhere, but among politicians and their quacking, trembling wives and only supported kindly Uncle Harry Davenport. She joins her two maids on a blind date and Gary Cooper happens to show. Some frames rodeo might liven things up, a la «Misfits», but there is no such success with it. Gary later breaks into a formal dinner, where Merlot chairs, and although invited to sit down and join a group, read them a lecture about their snobbery. Where this sudden eloquence uncertain cowboy come? The most excruciating scene in the film the phantom party, Gary has in its unfinished house for his missing wife, Merlot. Will it never end? One to avoid.
