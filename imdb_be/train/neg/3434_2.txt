I am a huge horror / splatter fan, I even enjoy horror movies, some people think, how stupid. I would also like dried blood. The more, the better, as long as it makes sense. <br /> <br /> After reading the reviews of others on the site, I was convinced that this film was supposed to be a little gem. But to my disappointment it turned out one of the most pointless movies I have ever watched. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, dialog boxes were stupid, the plot does not make sense, special effects and editing were in vain, probably done by someone who has been dead for the last 2 years. I used to think that all these characteristics make a great horror film would be. But not in this case. <br /> <br /> I have a waist 11 euros to get this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you really do not enjoy mindless gore (such as "violent sh * t" films) avoid at all costs!
