Currently, the film listed on IMDb, as the 42th worst film ever made - that's why I rented it from Netflix. Nevertheless, I am disappointed to report that the film, while bad, no where near bad enough to be merit in the bottom 100 films ever made a list. I have personally seen at least 100 movies worse than this. Daybreak approval, but it just did not match the expected level of terrible to be included in this shameful list. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Stuart Moss and McAndrew their belated honeymoon (by the way, they were married in real life as well). He's a doctor, who will receive with bits and insists that they go to a nearby cave. Once there, they are very, very, very stupid (the hallmark of a bad movie) and soon bitten by a bat. According to this film, like the bats attack people, and there are vampires in the US - both of which are not so <br /> <br /> Strangely, after a bit, man, do not even bother. going to the hospital !! First, in whose mind (especially physician) to get medical help right away, but it's not a fool. Soon he attacks - as long as he is still not interested in looking for help! Again and again you continue to think that it must be more stupid couples in the history of cinema !! <br /> <br /> After a while, in the end, he goes to the doctor and to the hospital. But, by then it is too late, and his attacks are becoming more stringent, and it begins to kill people in order to suck blood. If this is obvious to all that this man crazy killing machine, his wife (who, like her husband eat grapefruit for the brain) refuses to believe that he is dangerous - even after he attacks people, steals ambulance assistance and operates a police car off the road !! <br /> <br /> At present, most of the time Moss experiencing these episodes, his eyes rolled back and he looks like a normal person. Ironically, however, a couple of times, he develops a bat, like the hands and up to the end, they used some good prosthesis on it to make it look pretty bat like. If it was really bad, the film would have deserved to 1. <br /> <br /> At the very end, in turn, who hardly made any sense, inexplicable wife turns into a mad beat Lady and had a flock of bats killed evil sheriff. As all this was arranged it was a mystery how it was Moss and McAndrew belief that this film will do something to help her career - even though they both had quite a long career in television, playing a bit role in 1974 <br /> <br /> In general, very blunt. The plot is stupid and makes no sense and is highly dependent on the people who are too stupid to be real. . Not a very good movie at all, but not one of the worst films of all time, or <br /> <br /> Note: For some reason, IMDb shows graphs for a set of three DVD for IT'S alive, and it's two sequels to the web page for BAT PEOPLE. While MI have been seen with the title "This is AliveÂ», the two films are not really related. It is easy to understand the error - especially since they both came out in 1974, but the film, which I just reviewed starred Stuart Moss and McAndrew and the other film was shot by John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
