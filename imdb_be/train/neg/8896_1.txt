I saw Brigadoon on TV last night (12 September 2009). I am 61 years old and was watching movies as long as I can remember. I can honestly say that Brigadoon stands out as by far and away the worst movie I have ever seen. Accents were disgraceful. Local kids club would have made the best sets. The characters were so wooden that they are likely to have contracted dry rot tears patrons who had the misfortune of watching them. It is hoped that the stars of this film are sufficiently thick skin to protect them from the embarrassment that they have suffered, seeing this film. The owners of this scar must perform a great service to humanity and destroy all copies of the film.
