fashion designer stumbles cat and falls into the pool, hitting his head on something who is floating on the surface. When enough cheese effects (this TV movie), she pops out of her body. She floats through the tunnel swirling rings of orange smoke, and black tip rigid figure in her point of view (they look like mannequins in the apartment). I almost thought I was watching a film Jess Franco .... As her friends to revive her, the black hand grabs her wrist, and she has to struggle to get freedom. When she revived, she remembers, and has a bruise on his forearm. <br /> <br /> Shortly after this, she almost gets hit by a car out of control, which comes on the sidewalk behind her. On Halloween, she decides with his friend to go to Mexico on vacation. If she is, she was surprised to find that this Day of the Dead. They irritate another American tourist who keeps after them, and he almost drowns them. <br /> <br /> The designer invited to join the group of people who have had near death experiences. They all experienced the tunnel, but not the black pieces or repeated near escapes from death. One of them, and he really wants to. It also encouraged to meet with a psychic. <br /> <br /> The doctor tells her about what he calls the "Walkers" (the title of the novel it was based on). They are people who allegedly died from one of the reasons why the study proving died from other causes. Thus, they continued to go after death, until they again did not die, but he blames it on poor accounting. <br /> <br /> I've been watching it for 102 minutes of video, and it was an awfully long time. I can not imagine that there are actually 192 minute version! Maybe if it was to watch for two or more nights on television it would be better to watch that way than in one sitting. <br /> <br /> I just read one of Gary Brandner novel, Float, and if it is representative of his work, he is not the most original writers. The float was a common story: a child teased kill people in revenge. Even the change was quite common: teasing a child dies and kills people years later, in revenge from beyond the grave. And in fact it has a common point with this film, is that the practice of child astral projection, and when he is drowning, he emerges from his body, as here. I do not know how close to a dull night is behind it Walkers novel. I understand that movies Howl does not bear much resemblance to his novels. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly slow film, as well as special effects and cinematography really contained (allegedly) with a low budget and made for -tv disadvantages. There are many easily recognizable character actors in it. It also feels very dated over the early to mid-1980s than in 1989, I found it boring. Much better low-budget film covers similar subject, which I do not think so poorly timed, is the sole survivor (1983) (perhaps the inspiration for 2000's final film Destination). Blows with a dull night away.
