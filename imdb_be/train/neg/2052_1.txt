It's a waste of time, it is completely unnecessary remake of a great movie. Nothing new and original Sun added except the reverse overshoot flame Perry, with a marginal interest. It does not have a documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made him so effective. Also missing is a painfully sharp Quincy Jones soundtrack, which is added to many of the original film. I can not understand what high marks for it at all. This is very bad. Why times someone waste money or do shit like this and why I spend time watching it?
