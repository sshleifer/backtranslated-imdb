I was so disappointed with this show. Having heard and read all the hype about it, as it was "an innovative show," and all kinds of wild promises, if the quality, I tried to look at. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment !! Action was forced path and exaggerated. History has made very little sense. As for any hint of the much-vaunted "peek into the lives of teenagers," I could see only feeble attempts that had as much reality is like a reality show. <br /> <br /> Some are wondering why so many negative comments about this show. The reason is that it's actually not all that well and beat the drums on the quality on the show only serves to draw attention to how poorly done it.
