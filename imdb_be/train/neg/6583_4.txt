Interesting idea, and a plot that does not quite work. <br /> <br /> If you're watching a movie, maybe you'll feel as unhappy ending, like me. I really do not know who hurt the film, Taye Diggs looked bored, as a detective, the other characters seem to be one-dimensional and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> If Alice (Mia Kirshner), the victim was a nice girl, we could really enjoyed seeing the plot unfolds and the perpetrators brought to justice. The problem was that she was a bitch, like the other girls, turning from a cute girl in connivance inferior cokehead. I can not understand the moral message of the film, and as a detective thriller and it does not work.
