(This is a review of the later English release of Disney, featuring Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart and Co.) <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie to be good. In fact, it really is. I'm a big fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after all the glowing reviews on this before the movie of Miyazaki, I was ready to see him. But I was shocked, shocked I say, as this film. These later films can boast of a well-designed areas, the 3-dimensional characters, and the best film music since ... well ... ever. This film just does not come close. <br /> <br /> You can also start w / the positive aspects, though. Like all the films of Miyazaki, is another very imaginative, with a quaint atmosphere fantasy / Sci-Fi, in a post-apocalyptic world in which insects are the dominant species. Nausicaa also boasts some of the animation is far superior to other films of its time. (Though not so nice and fluid, like Miyazaki's later films) and English voice acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> But this film ... just ... nya ... well ... symbols full board - from sweet lovely Nausicaa, to ruthlessly scrapping Tolmekians, each between them. Once you've seen every one of them within 30 seconds, you have seen all there is. And the fact that the story is just playing on will not help. <br /> <br /> Then there is music ... Now, Hisaichi hands down my favorite film composer, but Nausicaa does not do it justice. Half of the 80-key music on overdrive, and it usually goes in and out so suddenly that it distracts the visual rather than help them. I really suspect that Hisaichi told to make a lot of music before he even saw a picture. <br /> <br /> But wait! There's an excellent message with this film, right? Let's save the environment! It is a pity that this film hits you over the head with it as a sledgehammer. There is a scene where Nausicaa hugging a tree. No really. I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> It makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this movie. But for some reason, all the other reviews on IMDb, it seems like it. And if the characters have to talk yourself into extended sentences to tell you what's happening, it's lame. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who worships anime has 80 music, and plants a tree every day Arbor, you'll probably like this movie. Otherwise, save your money for his later films, because they rock big time.
