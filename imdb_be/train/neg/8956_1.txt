Prequel quite frustrating to the first two films, it has neither of the first unknown or other interest. Focusing on the guys who are "working" cube, it basically takes away any feeling of tension inside the cube, as we simply do not care about the characters within. Much of the film just sad, and it only gets really scary with the introduction of the Chief of the eye glass and green-eyed crazy sea. After that, however, he simply sinks in over-the-top fun unintentional. Ending fitting, though tying it back to the first indirectly. The script is terrible, which operates at best mediocre and unimpressive direction. Significantly less supervision.
