I was very excited when the series premiered in 2005. The room was very simple and attractive: each episode is one o'clock mini-film of the famous director, distinctive horror filmmaker. Then, when I finally watched them, it was a bit of a disappointment. Some good came out of the episodes of the first season, but overall it was a mixed bag. I attributed this to the learning curve, and I realized that Season 2 will be much better. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was shocked. At least one season, had some good stories here and there. Season 2 (with the exception of "Black Cat" starring Jeffrey Combs beautiful) was a complete and total loss for me. The episode "sounds like" may very well be the worst that I have seen on television over the past 10 years, and most of the other episodes are not much better. I really hope that the season 3 turns around the next year, but I'm not holding my breath.
