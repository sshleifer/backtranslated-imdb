This film, originally released on Christmas Day 1940, long thought lost. Very poor copy surfaced and made into a CD, is currently for sale. Do not buy it! The film is unspeakably terrible. Poor casting, the script is terrible, terrible, and directing. <br /> <br /> Photo Roland Young singing and dancing. And that was the highlight. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this film was lost intentionally.
