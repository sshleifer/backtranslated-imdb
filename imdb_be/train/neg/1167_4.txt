I really tried to like this film, but in the end, it's just not working for me. I have seen most of the Kitamura products and found that it is very volatile. Live, as well as all of his films has an interesting storyline, some nifty sequence and a fair amount of creativity. However, these qualities are painfully lacking in living. The plot is great, if not all that original and would make for a pretty wasp film. Unfortunately, Shagan painfully slow and the film takes an age to start working, to achieve a sufficiently predictable place. Action only on-road, with the final battle is pretty cool, and early on OK. Previously also marred overspeedy camera-work, making for less coherence. There are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue, but the film still draws badly. These characters are neither well-fleshed, well-acted, and no set-up and the overall color scheme is monotonous and boring. The film is not entirely terrible and has several points of interest, perhaps judicious use of fast keys can improve it. With twenty minutes removed during operation, it can be a pretty decent science fiction thriller. But a full-length movie is boring. Recommended only very patient and determined Kitumura supporters.
