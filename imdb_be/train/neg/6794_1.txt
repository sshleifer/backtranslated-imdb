Friday 13th stage is over! There is officially the worst film than your hated the series there. I won this film in competition at the college, and it's a waste of money, even if it was free. Jack Jones stars as a truly awful singer is trying to find some kind of a killer or something. At least, on Friday the thirteenth never bothers me. I would like to have my nails pulled out than to see it again.
