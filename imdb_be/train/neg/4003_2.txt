The main disappointment. It was one of the best in the UK crime drama / detective shows from the 90s, which developed an exciting title character played by Robbie Coltrane Scotland. However, this one-time little to add, and may be suffering from the inevitable let down due to increased expectations, when a privileged show returns after a long hiatus. Coltrane Sun really given much to do, much more attention is spent on uninteresting killer, and that he must act, he seems to be uninvolved, almost sadly. The story of a former soldier to write a book and try to restore us to a family life Coltrane appears easy. Perhaps if the authors had a number in front of them instead of just one two-hour show, they would have written it with a much greater depth. How to skip it and watch the old Cracker from the 90s, which is much much higher.
