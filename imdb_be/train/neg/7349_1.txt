Polyester was the first film of John Waters, I have seen, and I have to say that it was also a "worst-case" a film that I have seen up to this point. <br /> <br /> group of water with "talent" included several people who I am sure has worked for food, and were prepared to say the line Waters wrote. Every thing about the film scary, acting, camera, editing, and the story of a woman, played by 300 pounds transvestite God was pure nonsense. <br /> <br /> However, I have to recommend this film, because it is very funny, and you would not believe the crap that comes with poor Francine. Her son snorts solvents and stomping feet of unsuspecting women in the grocery store. Her daughter is a whore sluttiest city. Her husband clucking A-hole pornography, which is doing everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate the poor Francine. <br /> <br /> only Francine each plays Edith Massey, possibly the worst actress ever. Edith looks and sounds like she's reading off-line card with a cane and had never seen the script for the shooting. <br /> <br /> Despite all the adversities Francine in Waters prepares fabulous Hollywood ending, and all (who survive) lives happily.
