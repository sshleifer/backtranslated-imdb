Well, what the hell, TRASH I was watching at the moment? "Hill of Witches" have got to be one of the most inconsistent and insane Spanish manual clicks ever, and yet, at the same time, it is also a surprisingly convincing. There is absolutely nothing that makes sense here, and I even doubt that there ever was a scenario to work, but for some reason I could not turn it off. Scratching your head with an error begins immediately, with the opening sequence of the angry little girl who had killed her mother's cat. So you think this film revolves around the children were possessed by evil forces? Heck no, because after this introduction, the girl and her anger just is not mentioned any more. Then cut to the guy with the most precise clipped mustache you'll ever see who breaks up with his girlfriend in a rather unsubtle way. When she asks him to spend your holidays with her, he immediately phone his employer asks him any kind of concessions! Big move. The film finally begins now, as he rides in an isolated mountainous area to photograph some of the peaks. Although before that it raises a new girl (Patty Shepard) and photographed her topless! Throughout his travels, all kinds of strange events occur that ?? You guessed ?? never explained. She wakes up in the middle of the forest, numbness loud music playing everywhere and someone even steals a jeep! Indeed, the car jack witch? Apparently, the coven has a silent mountain, and they practice on wood violators. This is as close as I get a description of the plot, but there is a good chance that I'm far away ?? More important is the atmosphere! "Witch Mountain" is sometimes very terrible, with terrible music and exciting cinema. That support the characters all look terrible and excellent Patty Shepard plays a good character. This type of European horror film that would be legendary, if someone worked to write a structured script.
