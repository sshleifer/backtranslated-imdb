Of course, this seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese comedy Neil Simon. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie and you will learn. <br /> <br /> In fact, Martin, lead is incorrectly cast. It does not make a big farce it is known from films as «The Jerk», but instead plays a kind of intermediate character, that does not work. Hawn, with no one to play off, it's terrible. Cleese is the only even partly funny cock. <br /> <br /> On top, the story is quite silly. I can not say how much it can be modified, but the characters do not seem to have the least common sense. They slip through New York, that is correct, and Unfortuneatly, nothing funny about not doing. Not only that, the whole room is completely unbelievable, it seems, it makes it clear that people who do not live in New York, not very bright, a theme repeated throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In summation, instead of seeing it, go rent the original «Odd Couple» again.
