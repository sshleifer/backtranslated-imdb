This is another incredibly typical and not a piece of Hollywood dreck would be pointless. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell as Snake Pliskin in a business suit, convinces me that it was better second baseman. Ray Liotta as a psychotic cop predictable and absurd. Stowe its ordinary cardboard itself, and makes little convincing a victim. <br /> <br /> Every scene in this joke is absolutely predictable all the way to the end if Kurt Ray cloth with a vase or something, knocking him down and out. Kurt Madeline and then make them mandatory end-to-film hugs, and everyone --- except Russell and IT KNOWS Liotta going to come back and threaten a couple again. <br /> <br /> It does of course, and Russell drills him 10 times with his 9mm that was not needed. This film is just as likely ended Kazhiano scene --- EXCEPT Hollywood is obsessed with unnecessary violence, and the more they can add, or "strengthen", the more they get slobbery.
