This film is one of the scariest horror films I have ever seen. From the very first scene, I knew that this would be the collapse of the smash. It begins with a seemingly bad girl kills a bunch of nuns at the mission. As it turned out, the people in it were possessed by some random zombies. Well, a few years later, some college kids pull some pranks deposits. Terrible acts come from collateral athlete's head. Things like jock to scream at him to do things in a totally not-chalonte, the pledge by the reaction and over-doing everything, "aims to be the popular role" What really took the cake with this last battle. Absolutely horrible special effects with guns. For example, guns make noise with no muzzle flash, and vice versa. this is followed by a stop-animation zombie (for some reason they are moving in the traffic stop is a secret), cheese music, and about 40 guns that come out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie crap. Just like many others, you can rent for 50 cents in the near low-brow place video.
