Exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor was bitten by a bat, which causes some disturbing side effects ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes eerie atmosphere and some decent (although under applicable) Sun makeup to keep this in the horror film from being subpar story about man-becomes-being. The Bat People Aki He lives at night suffering from his pointless stories, which awkward graphics and dull in the stimulation. The plot never seems to go anywhere much, and the film never offers an explanation of what is happening, or even a satisfactory conclusion for all this. The cast is quite mediocre in their performances. <br /> <br /> However, I give the film some aspects of its aims the theme song and the beautiful location shooting. Make-up work of the late Stan Winston is very good, but it does not get most of the storefronts here. Missed opportunity for sure. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the lesser-click a person being there. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 to ****
