Mr. Perlman gives an standout (as usual). Unfortunately, he has to fight with a guaranteed scenario and some goofy sets of parts. <br /> <br /> Larsen «Die Hard» mode complete with a singlet and bulging muscles, I'm sure he could have done better, but it seems happy with grimaces and snap through his part. <br /> <br /> excellent Erika is very decorative (even when fully dressed!) and shows some signs of "getting" acting last. <br /> <br SFX /> C mostly poor and steal from other movies <br /> <br /> bullet sorry. - worthy of A-Team <br /> <br /> not even worth seeing Perlman - AVOID
