However, I think Al Pacino to be a guilty pleasure. He was a great actor to the smell of a woman, where he apparently overdosed themselves irreparably. I was hoping that this film, which I did not hear almost nothing growing, it would be nice little gem. Overlooked, ahead in time, intelligent and attractive city-political thriller. This is not so. <br /> <br /> City Hall film that darkens his story with so many characters, names, and "realistic" citywide problem that for a while you think that part of his story in such a broad and engaging that as Once you know the truth, it will blow your mind. In reality, however, these deviations result podagovory and ultimately pretty tame and very famous urban brands such as the history of government corruption, two-faced politicians, mafia links with the police, etc. Theoretically, this setting allows for some spectacular tension, fear that none of the characters are not safe, and everything can happen! But then again, it's really not. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the only things that happen fairly predictable, and we are left with a number of "Confession" monologues, which are designed as a whole to develop a modern A bike race, a lesson of moral ambiguity "real world" of politics and society. But after 110 minutes of names and there are no reports, and a web of lies and cover-ups, the viewers tend to treat more open match. I do not think we were that the mayor's office, and while this is a very full movie, I do not think that as a whole is rich.
