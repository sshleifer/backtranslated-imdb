I chose this film to cover only think that I was in for an adventure on the level of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom." Unfortunately, I was in for a virtual yawning. Not like any of yawning I had before, though. This yawning was so great that I could hardly find anything of quality in this film. I described a little amazing special effects. There was not one. The film was so easy that even the very stereotypes painted. It really gives the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Well, if you want to teach their children that. I do not. Keep away from it. If you are looking for a family vacation, you might find something that inspires others.
