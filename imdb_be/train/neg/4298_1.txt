Incredibly intricate, it repels and ultimately ridiculous ( "horse, oh, my God, the horse!") Thriller. This is a terrible time to time, but it has one of the worst-case scenario ever written for a horror movie. See how in the last 10 minutes of the "magic" does exactly what it takes to land a "solution" to occur. Soft performances conclusions typically eccentric one Richard Lynch. Video sharing is a real hack job by cutting in half the scenes and makes the film even more difficult to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.
