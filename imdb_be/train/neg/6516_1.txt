.... a rip-off of the top ten films. In particular, Stephen Martin «LA Story", which at least was pleased to be clearly fictional, even though it starred his then-girlfriend plays his girlfriend in the movie. <br /> <br /> So, naive boys and girls, "20 Dates" is a mockumentary, although I'm not quite sure what Miles meant Berkowitz, when he started. I got the impression that he started the project half-seriously, then quickly realized that it would be pathetic and funny when he does not make the situation more and more ridiculous. As a result of all this is not an easy, cheap and insincere feeling about it. <br /> <br /> As someone fighting noted that the film has two of the "date" is judged and put restraining orders on Miles and yet they appear in the film, which is impossible, since it would require the informed consent form. In addition, it seems to me that the majority of women who look like "date" are professional actresses (albiet entirely known of them, except for Tina CARRERE) - they are just too obvious, quite polished, thin and comfortable in front of the camera to be average civilians. <br /> <br /> Mr. Berkowitz makes the classic mistake of just throw this kind of very beautiful fine actress, instead of using different plausible woman who could make a room (even in the mockumentary) more believable and funnier. He also skates over what is probably his real problems, and that is that both characters the movie and the real world Myles Berkowitz are functionally unemployed (his real life IMDb loans virtually non-existent, with the exception of the film) . Even in the world of cinema, his ex-wife divorced him for not being busy. I think that the audience (even if the actual terms of life alone Mr. Berkowitz in) deserves an explanation from him unable to live in one of the most expensive urban environment in the US, in a luxury apartment, driving a car fantasies and eat at expensive restaurants, if he has not seen to any source of income whatsoever. (Is he a drug dealer? Life for his rich parents? I do not know!) <br /> <br /> You can get away from most anything in the film, when the joke is really funny. "20 Dates" hurt UN incredibly funny. Mr. Berkowitz idea of ​​a joke should have its own character, while at the restaurant date to announce his companion as the food served is likely to give him or diarrhea, or constipation. - the worst kind of child potty humor <br /> <br /> it is not surprising to find that Mr. Berkowitz has never made a film before "20 Dates" and over the last 8 years, has not made a single film, appeared as an actor in someone's movie, or have written, or a loan of any kind. My intuition tells me that this film was not financed by the "El" (thug money man who appears behind the frame), but more likely, from wealthy parents, Mr. Berkowitz, or perhaps is a shocking abuse of credit cards. Whatever it was, we can all be confident that we are unlikely to have to see Myles Berkowitz or any of its creative efforts EVER AGAIN. Hallelujah !!!
