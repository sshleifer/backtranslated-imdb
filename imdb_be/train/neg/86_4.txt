In the Southern Baptists, it pains me that I have to give below-average rating openly Christian movie. There is, of course, is not so much that I want to keep the filmmakers of the genre, it's boring unclaimed. However, I must honestly say that "Law Abiding Joy Love" is, as a rule, low-budget, low-key, shyly Christian film. The plot is predictable, mediocre acting (I'm good), as well as editing brutal. In the TV movie it might be a bit above average, but as a feature film is poor. Try guys. You have to have a film about the real Christians inside you somewhere. May I suggest that you refer to Chesterton and Lewis some inspiration?
