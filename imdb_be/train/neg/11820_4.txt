I saw it on DVD (It`s known as corrupt in this format) and annotations on the body is really hyped as Harvey Keitel`s character Frank just like the one he played Lieutenant BAD "This gritty and powerful police thriller ". What `t didn body says it's an old Italian film. How old is he, Theo? Well, if the character plays the music he doesn`t put on a CD player, he gets a big plastic damn thing puts him on a kind of a revolving plate, where the mechanical arm touches the pancakes thing, causing the music to be heard. You see my point about this being an old movie? DVD case did not give any clue it was a film shot 20 years ago. It`s also a film with poor production values, like many other Italian films disguised as American. Except Keitel cast terrible, although the performance of Johnny Rotten`s quirky, not frightening, cinematography statically picture and sound quality, giving the impression that I watched a pirated copy of the fourth generation (I do not know when `s down a dodgy DVD or if It`sa very poor print film) and worst of all Ennio Morricone`s account. It`s impossible to believe a man who made an irritating obsession with the music for the same corrupt, who did the music for the westerns of Clint Eastwood. <br /> <br /> In total this is a pity, because the corrupt have their moments. It`s not the biggest psycho thriller ever created, but it was to keep my interest and, as always Keitel put a good job as a strong psycho cop. Just wish the rest of the movie `t didn coincide with his high standards
