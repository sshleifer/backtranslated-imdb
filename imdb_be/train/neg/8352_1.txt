I rented this movie because it falls under the genre of "romance" and "West" with some bargain Grand Canyon scenery. But if you expect a typical useful romantic western, forget about it. This film is pure trash! The romance between a young girl who did not even gone through puberty and middle-aged man! The child also wished the other evil people. It's a chore. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda is indicated as a virtuous, trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields and her character is basically one that has on relationships. He's trying to chase her away at first, but eventually he gives, and they drive off, as a happy, loving couple. This is outrageous. <br /> <br /> I do not see how this movie can appeal to anyone other than pedophiles.
