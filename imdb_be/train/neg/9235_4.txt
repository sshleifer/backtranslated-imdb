That woman never ceases to speak throughout the film. She memorized every line, and deprived all without a share of the natural emotion. It also has the most uncharming lisp, and the height of her voice sounds like nails on a chalkboard. This film has too many Betsy Drake, and not enough Cary Grant, who served as the little that remained of the film entirely on his own.
