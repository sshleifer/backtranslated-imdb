Guys, anybody else thinks about watching this film has already received some inconveniences that go through their head .. This film has nothing to do with Jack the Ripper (incase you thought) another of his B, I mean the E-Grade film, consisting of a bunch of horny teenagers in some sex scenes observed, before they get the spleen splattered on a nearby tree. It's not scary, funny or amusing. If you really feel like a bloody stuff, no story, then watch Fever, at least, the director did not fall asleep halfway through directing this crap.only watch this unless you absolutely have nothing to do in life and the only thing on TV Oprah Winfrey weeping on TV.
