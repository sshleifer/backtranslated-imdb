There are some bad movies out there. Most of them are quite fun. "Crazy criminals 1" was one of those clicks. So bad, that it was pleasant and had a value of re-look at it. "Mad 2 criminal" should be one of the worst movies ever, and coming from me that's saying a lot, because I am not the right person to say something worse. But believe me, it was just downright awful, and are only 1:00 1:00 too long. <br /> <br /> The film has a rather incoherent plot, but who cares about the history, if all you want to see a big fat woman running around killing people because it is not provided. Well, you do not see that in the film, for all historical sequences that at first, except one. New storyline could really funny with Ethel sent to a halfway house and kill everyone in there, but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the film, and at this point you've already filled. <br /> <br /> the camera work in this film is simply brutal. It literally reminds me of what I was shooting with my friends when I was 15. The sound quality is something else, as you can not understand a word they say most of the characters. To give an example of how bad it is, go to the New York City Subway and try to understand what they say of the speakers, it is something that sounds like this movie. Not so important, that they are talking about anyway, because the actors as dry as a dead piece of wood. <br /> <br /> Now I know that saying this is the worst movie, there is quite hard, but words can "t describe how bad this movie. If you do not believe me, see it for yourself. 1/10
