Why is the story of Mary and Rod should be so strict? Divorced women with indifferent daughters. And why very few references to the original show and the characters? Subsidiaries characters were stupid and uninteresting. Why can not there ever be a daughter who loves his mother on TV? It makes sense that Mary will leave Minneapolis, and Rod will return to New York, but why could not Phyllis or Cb Ann Nivens be guest stars? It just seems pathetic way to remember such wonderful characters. It was good to see Mary and Rod together, of course, but it could be better, much better. Well, there was Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, I hope Mary will be better next time, when she again reconsider its old stomping grounds Mary Richards.
