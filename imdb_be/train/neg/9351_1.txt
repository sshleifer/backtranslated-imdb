This is only the second time I stopped part of the way video / DVD to the end. <br /> <br /> I was ready to give the film the benefit of doubt in the first, despite the fact that managed to be both small and stereotyped stupid .. and humorless, plodding and pretentious. <br /> <br /> This was after school Special director of this amazing brand nine child who thinks no one understands him ... terrible and boring, with voice-overs that only the most mistaken teenager will be considered poetry. .. and some singing, and ... no, actually, the poor child suffering ... <br /> <br /> Enough already, especially when it turned into a blatant, clumsy and insulting Clockwork orange robbery. And did I mention the singing? <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film I've ever seen, but definitely one I felt at least forced to sit through. I do not recommend it to anyone.
