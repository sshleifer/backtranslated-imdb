Wow. What a terrible film adaptation of a wonderful novel. Here are a few gripes. - Screenwriter eliminated two major characters from the book. - the land was grotesquely changed. - Voiceovers sound as if they were directly borrowed from written passages (which can be read, but not the same thing when they speak, especially with a work style in Chabon). - Act more than a wooden house. (Esp Bechstein.) - it must be established in 1983 ??? 2003 feels more ... <br /> <br /> To be honest, I could not bring myself to watch this movie, so it's possible that he redeemed himself ... (sarcasm). I really hope that nobody paid to see it, or at least those who read this book in the hope that something decent (a la Wonder Boys). I like Chabon as a writer, but he should be ashamed of this adaptation. <br /> <br /> a lot of stars.
