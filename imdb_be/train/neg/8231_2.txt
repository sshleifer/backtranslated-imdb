MAY contain spoilers ... But doubts may actually spoiled !!. <br /> <br /> Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word .... Amateur. This film tries it's best to be different from the majority of films like "The Blair Witch Project" picture .... it does not work .... it just ends up looking and feeling like someone an inexpensive video camera, a van and decided to make a film. History has no explanation, the main character has no real motivation (and looks like a lesbian to wear a power suit, compared with five girls) and there is no violence to speak ... just the sounds of screaming and crunching. The entire film takes place inside the van, that is worthy of the scenery Problems with I have. Five girls really do their best with what they were given, but on the whole the impression of a rather scary actresses ... but with the material given that it is difficult to judge whether they can actually ACT .... they spend the entire movie shout, scream and whine .... so half the time it's hard to make out what was said and the camera is so bad that it's actually hard to say who said this. this video depicts himself as a hard film of torture, but actually only five girls in the van screaming in terror ... what Litoral b on sums up the entire film ..... then we get to the end, after what seems to be a constant squeal of 5:00 and all five girls are still alive ... with one drawback finger. Only thumbs up (get it ... finger .... LOL) poor actresses who have tried and are likely to have lost their voices (and honor) after making this horrible film. Do not judge by the poster .... you will be very let down.
