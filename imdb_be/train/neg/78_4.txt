Annoying mouse and lullaby really there for me and really has nothing to do with the story ... This is what I would have done my first year at film school. Very sad. In addition, the story just seemed to stretch for no apparent reason ... there were too many things that are just thrown out there that had nothing to do with a story that makes me feel that the creative team did not know what they were doing, or simply that it should have been shorter ... that would be a boon, not a crime. As I just watched all the episodes up to this point for the last week ... I must say that it was much worse, and I just wanted to warn others not to start with this.
