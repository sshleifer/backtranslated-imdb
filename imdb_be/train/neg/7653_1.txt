Firstly, I would like to say that if I had to honestly evaluate the film from 1 to 10, I'd give it a -4. This does not mean that I am a harsh critic, it's just that the movie is so bad. Everything from stories, to directing, to editing badly. History is not even halfway decent to start with (you can not expect too much, because it is based on a video game, something I did not know to go to the movies), but the management and editing made it worse. The film is cut in awkward spots and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous; some as a quick scene in the middle of sex, do not even make sense to turn in the history of seeing how the characters do not show any feelings towards each other. You might get into this movie expecting to see a bunch of crap on the screen for an hour and a half, and you will still be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay to watch this movie, you are spending your money and if you do not pay anything, you still spend an hour and a half of his life. So do yourself a favor and do not watch.
