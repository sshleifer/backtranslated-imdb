As a former submariner, it was one of the worst submarine movies I have ever seen. First of all, the revolt on board any vessel of the US Navy, in particular, nuclear-powered Trident submarines in the unthinkable. These people are the best of the best, and are intended for their mission. The responsibility they bear is amazing, and they take it very seriously all the way from the captain to the youngest member of the crew. I could never see the crew of any ship to split the alliance between their captain and executive director. Executive Director, who acted as the character played by Denzel Washington would have done relieved of his duties and the court martial, and then drummed out of the Navy. This is not surprising, the Navy refused to send a technical consultant to help in the creation of this film. And finally, if any member of the crew of the submarine made of the amount of noise is underway on this ship, they will be severely reprimanded. Submariners learn early in his career to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. They do not slam the door, and even speak softly and wear soft-soled when underway. I was amazed at how loud they drew a command to move. Loud music will never be tolerated. I know life drawing submarine in reality will not sell movie tickets, but it is from the top to the point of ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
