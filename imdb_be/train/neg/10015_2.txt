Phantom of Dragstrip Hollow is a typical 1950s teen movies in the confusion. This is not a horror or science fiction movie. The site belongs to the group of teenagers that are going to get kicked out of the club "hot rod" because they can not meet the rent. Once expelled, they decided to try an old haunted house. The only salvation for the film is that the "ghostÂ» (Paul Blaisdell in Creature She costume), turns out to be a monster film work plays Blaisdell.
