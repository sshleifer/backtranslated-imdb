WARNING! Small plot Details! <br /> <br /> I can not find almost nothing positive to say about this film. It is written so much that each character is a caricature, but it seems to take itself seriously. This is bad cast, especially Ralph Macchio (all baby-faced, 5-foot-nothing of it), as a street tough. Elements of land is drawn in black and white, with each situation almost immediately escalate to some at the climax. <br /> <br /> The most egregious adults (SCHEDULE PART ABOUT BEING REVEALED) is perhaps the most gratuitous and contrived a nude scene in the history of film poluseroznogo. One can only imagine the creators of the film, saying: "We need to shed its top JoBeth ... hmmm ... I got it! ... at the beginning of the movie, let's give Nick some kind of conversation about exposing themselves in the corridors. ..then JoBeth can use this line to it later, and really expose themselves in the corridor ... yes, that's the ticket! "<br /> <br /> I will give producers credit for solving a weighty subject in 1984, one that was too significant in the late 90s with events like Columbine. However, the execution is awful. This film could be dark comedy in the spirit of "Heathers", mannerisms political statement as "network" or a serious test as "Brubaker" Instead, he is trying to be all of these things -.. and ends being neither one of these things "teachers" get F .
