I hate this movie. I hate the show. I hate just about everything about it. It's so annoying and stupid. all say that Nat and Alex Wolff heroes in the music world, and they're going to make it big. What drugs you take ??? !!!?!?!?!?! nat and Alex will end up as either homeless, or end up as Jane Hudson with "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?". I could only get through even 20 minutes of this, almost 30 seconds of the show, and I was able to survive for approximately half an hour in the "Battle of the Bands." As someone who can cheer for the guys in the room in the children's Choice Awards, I do not have a clue. days before the film's premiere on Nick, most teenage girl actresses Nick (Jamie Spears, Emma Roberts, Lindsey Shaw, etc.) appeared in commercials that affect the brain of the dead children on how strange and Alex Fiz Wolf is. Firstly, they expect, that deceive me, and secondly, Nat and Alex, probably either drugged them or paid them a lot of money to say that and not convincing, because I do not see how anyone you may find the show / movie is interesting. the music is terrible. Nat singing sounds like a sick, dying moose on crack. Alex is the most annoying movie / TV show character EVER. it's not funny, it is annoying, it's really weird, and he thinks he's hot and knows all about the girls. this guy is lucky if he ever manages to have sex. You know what this show is fake, if you find that some of the characters (in real life) does not even exist !! Jesse character actually plays Nat and Alex's cousin Jesse Draper (mustve they had some budget problems). Their father is not one, he married Polly Draper, but it does not appear on the show, making it seem Wolf mum is less. Vera does not exist. Her name is Allie Dimeco. I'll tell you what Naked Brothers are going to be in some deep sh ** when their "fans" to know the whole thing is staged. 0/10
