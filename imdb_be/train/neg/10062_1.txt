Nintendo !!! You #% $ @ ERS !!! How could you do this to me? I can not believe it ... this film is actually worse than the first. I went to see it in the theater with my brother because my mother forced me to tag along .... Oh ... where do I begin? The plot sucks. Postproduction sucks. Animation sucks. The ending really sucked. If you liked this film, you suck TOO. And Futuramafan1987, who said that it was the greatest movie ever, the TOOL you, plain and simple. This is not a film for everyone, except the crack addled ten-year-old boys from the game, who think that Pikachu is God. I still cry in the day to think about that horrible turd of a movie .... and here Adventure Pikachu ... to not even get me started on this film a terrible mess. It is, in all truth, one of the saddest experiences of my life. Do not go looking for it at any price <br /> <br /> The result :. Go out, find all copies of the film is that you can, and write it down. Burn them all, and then continue to shoot a good movie, foreigners ... or bowling for Columbine ... or back to the future!
