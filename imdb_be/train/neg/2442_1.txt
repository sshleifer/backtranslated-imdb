I do not know why I keep doing it for yourself !! I continue to defend the Dutch and Belgian cinema and saying that he should get more credit and chances ... and then they smack you around the head with garbage like this! Intensive Care terrible production and, perhaps, the worst thing that has ever been done in the Dutch speaking countries. A Dutch attempt to create our own franchise of horror films, of course, is based on American classics mainstrain shredder, such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. Producers and authors aim really high with this, but have fallen very low. Intensive care has become an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved, and therefore a cult flick here. It is almost impossible to track down a copy of the original, and it showed in special cases, such as "Night of hostility." For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even create a scene ... then it turns into a lame and low brain n slash cutting the film with terrible - yet very fun and cheap - make-up effects. Actions just throw disgusting, though there are some respected names involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters ... This guy may be the most famous and favorite artist in Belgium. He's favorite singer, presenter of TV shows and the idol of many young girls. He never mentions this thing, he starred in, though. Like everything else in the Netherlands, he is trying to convince myself in intensive care and did not happen.
