As a former resident of Kalamazoo with a love of the city, I look forward to see this movie. But what a disappointment! Although the actions and value of production are not bad, a terrible scenario, the plot is unrealistic, and the subject is alarming. <br /> <br /> The main idea of ​​this movie is that women are not without their husbands and children. I can not believe how regressive it is in this perspective of women. Was the writer lived under a rock? <br /> <br /> While I enjoyed seeing my favorite city on the big screen, I would not want anyone to offer this film. It's terrible. It's a shame for the city is to them.
