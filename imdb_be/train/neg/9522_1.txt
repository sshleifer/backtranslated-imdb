Wow! I remember so many horror films that can rotate around the high school since the early 1980s. As a rule, they had stretched someincredibly plot and a lot of 27-year-old actor, who claim to be students. As I watched this movie, I felt a little nostalgia grew up in the 1980s. Nevertheless, I believe that this film was made in 1989? Say what! Well, nostalgia factor ends right there, it's just bad. Plot of the city is preparing to close the high school and threatened the bus all the students in the inner city high schools. What is surprising is that the students in this school are rich and wealthy. In fact, the protagonist lives in a mansion. Makes you wonder how they can not find the money to keep the school alive, they never heard of the real estate tax. Oh, and here's the kicker. The school board said that they will keep the school alive when students can raise $ 200 000. Therefore, the elderly to go about it. Hmm, you raise $ 200,000, but instead save that in college, you put it in the side of preserving a high school senior in you? And why they will close the overpopulation of the school year's end? And forget ... aah, this movie was stupid and did in 1989?
