Sad and pointless bit of fluff (bloody fluff, but fluff). Bad scenario, with stupid and wooden dialogue. You do not care where the marks (in fact, even if the actors themselves) live or die. Little grace or charm, a little action, a little sense of the whole thing. Perhaps some of the sets and settings will be interesting - those gaps between the boards of all the buildings can be faithful to the way life is lived. During the meeting it is unnecessary and distracting, and the character itself Hoppalong Cassidy as a boring and inept.
