I am quite confused why this film even liked, let alone held in such high regard, especially since a lot of critics who, otherwise, it is quite reasonable. <br /> <br /> There is a keyword that describes this film to its core. - irritant <br /> <br /> most easily explained by an example of this is the use of the director - or, rather, misuse - music. In the first half, really sad reggae melody played about three times (if you once too often). But in the second half, Mommas And The Papas "California Dreamin 'Â» played at least seven times, usually in the upper volume. Godsakes, whether or not the song you advance, you will be thoroughly fed up to the end of liked. Just think, some people claim to have seen the movie four or five times. This means that they were listening to California Dreamin either 28 or 35 times ..... <br /> <br /> All of this unnecessary hyper-repetition (he contributes nothing to the story) might be justified if the rest of the film had any remaining dignity, or if the story was in any way with the participation of. <br /> <br /> But this is not the case. <br /> <br /> the only aspect that I found pretty Brigitte Lin was charging around and still plays in Asia invincible cloak and sunnies. Even this disappeared pretty quickly <br /> <br /> I'm sure an undeserved good reputation of this film will convince many poor youngsters, to go and see it <br /> <br /> I can only warn you - if .. you've never seen the film HK before, do not start with that. <br /> <br /> If you have to watch it, avoid at all costs, seeing it in the movie. Fast forward and mute button are important tools for survival here. <br /> <br /> You have been warned!
