This film does not offer nothing to anyone. It is not possible at any level. Actions badly winded boring digging. They are obviously the length of the end of the sex scene was trying to be shocking, but only ended up being pretty much a parody of the film was aiming. Full garbage, I can not believe that a funny movie it was. <br /> <br /> And I am very sure, Rosario Dawson was in this film, because it is, although it will be a sharp break off her indie hit, wowing NC-17 film. The problem is that no adult is not going to stick to the film, as the film plays out as uninteresting episode OC or something aimed at teens. Helpless.
