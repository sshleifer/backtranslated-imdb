Firestarter rather poor clone that looks more like a bad TV movie than a bad feature film. What a disappointment for this comes from Hooper and Dourif! <br /> <br /> The state contractors doing the human experiment with the hydrogen bomb. The boy was born to the couple in the experiment constantly running a fever of 100 degrees, and when he is an adult, the people in his life spontaneously start combustion. He's trying to figure out why. <br /> <br /> People are completely on fire, well done, but when they get to the point that they have done well in another sense, they obviously changed to the nipples. If you fire a jet of fire weapons, and characters, it looks ridiculous, but no worries as it should. Also funny is the fire, which apparently passes through the telephone lines and breaks in large jets from the receiver earphone. How should this happen, right? <br /> <br /> Something else that struck me as silly about the movie when a character has a vision of his late parents. Later we see the same footage of these visions in home movies.
