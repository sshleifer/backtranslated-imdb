What a disappointment! <br /> <br /> This film seemed to be trying to copy the "cutting edge" comedy, but the direction and the script was sloppy, weak and sentimental in the worst traditions of cinema. Jack Black, actor / role was self-indulgent and self-respect to ... and the other characters were the same exposure and uninteresting. The soundtrack was tedious. We are (or have been) Black supporters, but none of us did more than scabies forced chuckle during the entire period. Why did he feel that he had to make this mistake? <br /> <br /> We will not see another one of his films more carefully read the reviews first !! <br /> <br /> He was drunk when he read the script before signing up to this nonsense?
