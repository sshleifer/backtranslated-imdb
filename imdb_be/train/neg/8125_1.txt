«The Bat People» is a very bad movie that deserves MST3K treatment in the same way as the other film is "creeping terror." <br /> <br /> In this, we are in some mountainous terrain full of bats, we see a lot of things going on, like bats and flying attacks, and so on, wagon chases, incidents in the ambulance, and more! All this, plus cheese mediocrity 1970s (hey, I think, "Mitchell" here!) What makes «The Bat» People actually one of the best of the latest «Mystery Science Theater 3000" episodes made in the series! Moviewise, it's terrible. Avoid like the plague when Tom Servo and Crow do not look to you <br /> <br /> «The Bat People» - more like a "bad people !!!!!". LOL <br /> <br /> 1/10 of course !!!!!
