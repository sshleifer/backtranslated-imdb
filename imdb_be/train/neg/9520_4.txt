[Possible *** SPOILERS ***] reputation of this film precedes it, so it was with the hope that I sat down to watch it in a mailbox on TCM. What a major disappointment. <br /> <br /> lovely acting and production values ​​are first rate but without the depth of the characters, the plot is thin, and it all takes too long. For the film, which deals with alcoholism, family units, infidelity, gambling, and sexual repression, the film is interesting flat, prosaic, lifeless and cliché-ridden. One example is the image unfaithfuness Frank Hirsch: its rather ponderous request to his wife to "go upstairs and get some rest," then it predictable plea headaches result - even more predictable - an evening connection to his secretary ( " hey Nancy, I've got the blues today. Let's take a ride "), all in accordance with a well-worn formula. We do not believe they are real people, but cardboard cutouts acting as a puppet of the game. in addition, the source of the apparent friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch really never not investigated BT and explained. Passion Dave with time / off-again Gwen is inexplicable in light of its stupid inability to defecate or get off the pot. His next marriage of desperation to the character Shirley MacLaine / Ginny, since it seems to still viewer, anyway, obviously doomed to failure, and it was clear - the conventions of this type of soap opera - that it can be resolved only someone had been killed in that time, jealous mistress began to run around with a gun, I began to bet with himself, who -. Dave and Ginny - kill. «P» All this was false capital. <br /> <br /> Having said that McLain performance and that Dean Martin honors are here. But overall I think the interest in the film, to be clear, that part of the period of the history of Hollywood.
