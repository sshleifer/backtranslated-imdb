Obviously, none of the previous reviewers, most of whom praised the film for its accuracy, to actually read a biography of Louis Pasteur.The most glaring inaccuracy is not between Pasteur and III.Back Napoleon in 1930 the latter was always referred to in a bad light. While far from a beautiful character, he was inept politicians and self-styled "military genius", which allowed France to be dragged into a disastrous war, he was not stupid reactionary pictured here. He was an intelligent interest in science, and, like many other people in the 19th century saw a bright future because of the improvements it would bring.Far from exile Pasteur, it was his patron, building his laboratory and to give him all the resources that he need for its research.While laboratory is under construction, Pasteur became seriously ill.A bureaucrats deciding that it is a waste of money to build a laboratory for someone who will soon be dead, ordered the work stopped on its own authority .When the emperor learned of this, he aburen and shocked the bureaucracy, so that there has been a flurry of passing down and work quickly resumed.The emperor personally visited the Pasteur to calm him down and convince him that he would get it lab.The Emperor often brings members of his yard to admire the project of Pasteur, and it it was obvious to all that Pasteur was one of the main concerns of the Emperor favorites.Pasteur relativity Emperor that Napoleon thought Pasteur was actually Mirac le worker who can do almost anything, and constantly assigning him the task beyond its previous experience.Pas teur, a very humble man, always protest, but Napoleon would have said that he had full faith in him, and Pasteur, despite his misgivings, always came through.They always had close and friendly relations, and after Emperor was overthrown, Pasteur refused to say a bad word about him, thanks to the end of his life. <br /> <br /> part of his daughter, the child, and Pasteur sacrificing their principles to get a doctor, never happened.The part about anthrax and rabies, for which he was famous, usually correctly, but the concept that experiment anthrax raised him from obscurity to fame false.He was known and respected in the time it happened.This OK film with a dramatic point of view, but it is very distorted in the biography.
