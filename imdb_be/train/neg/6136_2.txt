The dollar's role as The Kahn recalls Bob Barker (with the right price) runs the country, just as he works his show. But there are many more to chuckle and breathe through this turkey.

There's a few terrible moments (in the village Crazies, mostly) and some slightly spectacular martial arts sequences. But any given film «Ninja» will give you much more fun, and you will not feel guilty laughter.
