I never could stand to watch Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in the film features Scott Baio (skateboard chase scene!). Jodie Foster in her first role of the "adult" turns in his usual professional activity, but that is no excuse for this sorry mess. Two hours of my life that I will never get back! No distinctive characters, incredible story, questionable editing and cinematography terrible, but worst of all, I could not care less. History of California teenagers in the 1970s, where the children are living miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Do not waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.
