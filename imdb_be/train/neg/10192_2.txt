One of the lamer wedding movies that you will see. Claps as too much of his time, so that it was due to the date before he got into the theater. Ethnic stereotypes as Henny Youngman joke, except for the fact that they simply AINT anymore funny here. Ringwald, what else should be said. Give you a clue to the nonsense, it destroys Wedding Dress $ 10,000, because "It just would not be me," making it in the cloth, with straps and puts on the cylinder, and all the cute smiles at her Moxy, not ringwalding her neck. His hellish cast also check how heavy Ally Sheedy is. Wheeeew!
