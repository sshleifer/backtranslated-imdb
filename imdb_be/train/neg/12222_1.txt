(Frankly, Barbra, I know it was you who or extract all these "No" with my review. 22 times ?? How many people do you have to instruct, to help you here? Do you have nothing better to do, how to look at myself in the mirror all day?) <br /> <br /> Steven Spielberg said Barbara, that it was "the best film I've seen since" Citizen Kane "." That pretty much says it all - and serves as a dire warning <br /> <br /> What are the ingredients for an unmistakable cinematic disaster, and one that will haunt you, not letting forget the tears and the laughter and the pain? Ingredients :. Face Barbra Streisand, music, feminism, the voice of Barbra Streisand, Barbra Streisand directing, and ultra-corny / stupid background <br /> <br /> Hollywood egomaniacs complete, this much we know. In fact, almost all ?? by definition ?? must be selfish in Hollywood. Why would anyone want to act? For "art"?!? Well, if you're stupid enough to believe what they tell you in their carefully prepared interview ?? And Streisand has the biggest ego of them all! This is a great achievement. To be surrounded by the narcissist nerds, and still managed to fill them all ?? is great. <br /> <br /> in the film, as well as all its "solo" endeavors, it is bragging right out of hell. every scene Streisand automatically destroyed. Stillborn. But, as it was not enough, she sings a whole bunch of songs Streisandy ?? you know, the kind that allowed Mariah Careys, the Celine Dions, and Whitney Hustons g Ralea world to poison our valuable airwaves for decades. Just for that it deserves not one but 100 South Park episodes mocking her. <br /> <br /> Inside, Streisand cleaned as a person to learn to become rabbi sounds like a funny ZAZ comedy. in addition, it's a cliche, the obvious problem is that Streisand does not look like a woman, or what she looks like a man ?? I'm actually not even sure that she's human. The way she looks in this film, and ?? it can not be described in words. alien looks like a high school athlete in comparison. It looks more alien than Michael Jackson in 2015, it looks terrible. <br /> <br /> song. They made me shiver. In particular, "Papa Can You Hear Me Squeel Like crazy Male Walrus in the heat?" and "Tomorrow night I'll Prepare Sequel, YENTL 2: Return of bitches." <br /> <br /> You know that Streisand is considered to have a nose job early in her career, but changed his mind when they told her, her voice can change? Can you believe that? She should do it!
