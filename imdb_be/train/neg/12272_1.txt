Simply put, this is the worst movie since "Police Academy: Mission to Moscow" (if you like this movie, you will probably like this) <br /> <br /> What were they thinking.? Some ideas should remain just that, an idea. The fact that this idea could shoot itself should be a criminal offense. <br /> <br /> What was so bad about it I hear you ask. One word ... everything <br /> <br /> Price Hire :. $ 4.50 Price in time to watch: 89 minutes <br /> <br /> I want to return the money on both!
