Think about this film as a Saturday morning live-action programs from centuries ago. Even small Tykes will find this one to please, because it works like molasses! I can not fully understand how God is terrible to do something too typical and uninteresting, especially in the costume department! Too much of a warrior master films from there using the same old story many times over, but it is powerful enough, because of its appeal to the young favorite. And who could afford a topless mermaid be cast in the first place in the world? I thought it was a "family" movie! MST3K, here is another wonderful gem of the 1999 TV season!
