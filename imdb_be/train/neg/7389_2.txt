I buy, or at least to watch every movie SEAGALL. He came out of a few good movies, then going down in the history of the poor, poor camera work and a walk-through person, he almost lost me. Several films ago, he remembered how to make a decent movie. Now he forgot again. This film seriously dark (at any level you care to name). There is a lot of slash wounds and is going on without appreciable purpose if it is not meant as a warning against the military. <br /> <br /> SEAGALL, may have been a stunt double for many of his scenes, as is often too dark to tell, and someone else's voice much of the time was used. Unfortunately, the only interesting character was a bad guy who killed a guard to escape custody and then raises havoc everywhere. Well, since when did we have an armed guard in a holding room with a prisoner? In any case, this is a bad guy, at least colorful and very focused. There's a lot of gore, if you like, that the king of thing. He looked at me as the bad guys tore a gash same every time. I'm just glad that they do not suck the blood of their hapless victims. I HARKEN you to my resume. Basically it is a horror film, disguised under the film.Dec 6,2006
