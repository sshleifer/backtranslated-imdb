It is some time ago that I have seen Sleuth (1972) with two big actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but he is now my husband Jude Law and his wife's lover. The story is the same, and it's a fantastic game. <br /> <br /> In the film, I always had the feeling to watch the game. This is one reason why I do not like is a remake of the classics. When I watch the film, adapted from the game, I still have to feel, to see the movie and not just play. Directed by Kenneth Brannigan made some wonderful films in the past, but this time he missed. Another reason was the film's look. The design was modern, stylish, clean, uncomfortable and cold. I never got the feeling that someone has ever lived in this house. The pictures were not bad, but the lighting was terrible. Sometimes it was a light blue, dark, green light to round it is not friendly to the eye. <br /> <br /> The action was really good. Michael Caine and Jude Law's perform at their best. I would really like to see these two guys play together on stage. But I must confess, I've never been a supporter of Jude Law. The weakest part was the middle part. I remember that in the original, this part was still very mysterious, and just gorgeous directed. I tried to watch it twice, and always in the middle, I feel asleep. The end of the better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) entirely horrible, but it seems to be more a movie for criticism than for the audience. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more interesting than a detective (2007).
