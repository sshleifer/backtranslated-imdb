I gave this show (I saw only seven episodes) Four stars because most of its jokes / adjustment appear to fail. Some of them are not funny right, but some of them are funny - the 12-year-old boy kind of way. It reminds me of that New York artist who throws paint on a canvas, call it art and sell it for big money. Silverman throws what she has, including the kitchen sink, while she was praying, a couple of things that stick to the wall in her quest to be funny, but in a different way. <br /> <br /> At the same time, that it is "received" is often not enough time, as it lacks the kind of observation through a good comedian should succeed. <br /> <br /> the whole enterprise, as is done under the potatoes.
