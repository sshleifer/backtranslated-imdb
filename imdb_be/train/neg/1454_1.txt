I recently watched this movie twice, and I can not understand why the h * LL manufacturers have made this a bunch of crap. I mean, yes, it gives a great impression of Hitler's entourage, and I mean the way they played in Austria in the late 1890s, the First World War and in the interwar period. What I can not understand why they are portrayed Hitler as a 100% pure evil, insane, inaccurate, mentally unstable freak. He still was very thoughtful, loving and intelligent man who, of course, had its dark side, no doubt about that. But why in the name of God portray it that way? All of its positive aspects have been carved out of the script, leaving nothing except for the propaganda as a portrait of a man who had a great influence on the history of modern civilization. Yes, he left Germany in a devastating 2nd World War. Yes, he was a racist, and he sometimes menially unstable especially at the end of the war. That's right. But then again; Why the hell are they plain LIE public? In order to warn us? <br /> <br /> I absolutely do not think that this film was a warning. The real danger of Hitler and the Nazis was the fact that they were able to rise to power in moments of strong global weakness. The fact that evil was so recognizable, but it took almost every German alive (not to mention the Austrians and many other people) makes this warning modern civilization, not a fact, Hitler was a "weirdo." If it would have been like the creators have us believe - I would be confident that the German people backward. The man in this film would not have received had anywhere near the leader of the party - not to mention the Chancellor. <br /> <br /> 4/10
