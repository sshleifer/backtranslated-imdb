Do not even ask me why I watched it! The only excuse I can think of that I was sick with bronchitis and is too weak to change the channel. :) It's too terrible for words, a film that, Sun bronchitis. Acting sad, Richard Creek hams it as a militant, gun-Rigging a serial killer with a penchant for knocking the police. Nick Mancuso phones by the policeman on his trail and Nancy Allen was able to put in the only nice part of the entire film. gloomy scenario, filled with clichéd line, "Are you ready, Pardner?» Richard Creek purrs to each of his victims. Dire. Avoid.
