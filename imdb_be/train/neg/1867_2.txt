Unfortunately, the only spoiler in this review, there is nothing to spoil that movie.Even when B. Mattei never made any master piece, he used to do his job with a bit of humor and madness that made him funny director Eurotrash. But over the past 10 years he seemed to have lost .tak film is simply empty, nothing at all wakes us from a deep sleep you sink in after the first 10 min.No sex, no blood (it will not assume that about Snuff?) or actors, no dialogue, just as bad as 90'TV film.It worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics.So rest of the world Bruno, you will remain in our memory forever anyway, thanks to memorable gems as: Zombi 3, RoboWar, rats, l'Altro hell virus, Severe jaw and several others.So, except if and you want to see B Mattei possess the spirit of a new film Jess Franco, pass it one.But, if you do not 'know, this cute artisans career track down his old movies and have fun.
