First of all, I really enjoyed ZOMBI 2 Lucio Fulci. This movie was a complete waste. I could not bear to watch. The storyline was a joke, acting was a joke, and the fact that Zombi 3 has nothing to do with Zombi 2 more joke. <br /> <br /> We jump from Voodoo death 1 Harmful AGENT Brining people back to life. Regardless, this movie is not worth the $ 1.00 it cost to rent it. I really enjoyed Fulci films, but this one was terrible. If Zombi 3 is an indication of how the new recruit 4 and 5 will be, I think I'll just skip them. <br /> <br /> Zombi 2 flique Tho is surprising.
