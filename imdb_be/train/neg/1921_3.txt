For some strange reason in the world of film is a fashion movement. Someone making a film about sharks killer, then suddenly the film 's oceans are awash with giant squid, killer cephalopod and sea monsters of all kinds. Man is pursued with ex-girlfriend from hell, every character in the film pursues cop from hell or a hell of a neighbor, or a babysitter from hell. Then, when a large company producing big-budget Hollywood FX laden blockbuster about tornadoes then other film manufacturers jump on the bandwagon, the fact that they are Don `T have the budget to pull it doesn`t stop them. Night tornado is an example. What struck me is made for television film is that he tries to hide his lack of budget at the expense of advertising breaks. Everytime a tornado is Camara locks on the frightened look of actors as they shout something like "Oh, my Gawd` second header of the way" and "the Run for your life", the screen darkens to save the manufacturer need to up the budget special effects. Unfortunately NIGHT budget twisters have been increased to include the best actor. Cast in any case is not bad, but not impressive and do not have enough skill to carry the film, which is a character-driven. Where`s Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood, if you need them? <br /> <br /> And the last word on this as TWISTER clone ..... few months before but TWISTER TWISTER was swollen for several months how to be a summer blockbuster of 1996 and was released to the Nott Nott have a rushed feel to it which leads me to believe that this was done and released to tie in with hoopla surrounding TWISTER
