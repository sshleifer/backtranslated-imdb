In fact, very bad slasher movie. Psychotic people escape from the orphanage. Three years later he kills a professor of sociology, the end of the scene. One semester later yesterday (hey, this is what the name says the card) is the new professor of sociology at the school. She is friends with another woman, a professor of sociology, who works there, and begins to meet another professor. Students all boring, as we are. <br /> <br /> There are a few header card with an indication of how much time has passed. The scenes are rather short, and will cut different characters in a different place, which makes for a little progress of any kind. Many scenes involve characters walk and talk, sit and talk, and little sense. Despite the passage of time, many of the characters are always wearing the same clothes. Sometimes obscure over time means that when we see the body for the second time, we ask ourselves: how long the body was there? And also, it seems, have been omitted other, at least one of the dead people. <br /> <br /> The killer manages to kill one person, causing her chest, the other stabbing him in the crotch, and the second, cutting her forehead. whether it was poisoned knife or something <br /> <br /> video box cover has a cheerleader: There is not in the film. The back cover has a photograph of someone in a graduation cap and gown threatening a group of women in a dorm room. The central red in the photo in the film, but no one ever wears this outfit, and there is no such scene. Killer strictly alone.
