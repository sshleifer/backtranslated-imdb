Kay is now the one out of the way, I just want to say that in the world of these idiots that call themselves "masters" think they are doing ?? The last time I checked the host does not discriminate, spewing hate-filled tirades on television, or try to shove their beliefs down every poor soul that the enterprise of the canal. All those that crazy, idiotic, conservitive, bible-thumping, Fred Phelps lover Pat Robertson makes a daily basis. I am for freedom of speech, but since when did this cover guy that pretty much says that if you venture away from his ideal lifestyle you will immediately be sent to hell? This is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause SOOOO many problems. One day in my classroom we had a substitute teacher in so we decided to watch TV, as taught to not give us no trouble. And we (against many of us on request) observed 700 Club, and, of course, that jerk Pat were talking and raving about the Bible, and he said to Simon on the line, "God says homosexuality is a sin," and I actually heard kid go "Hmm, I think he's right.Â» WTF ??? Seriously, if the owner is trying to get people to think that someone else's sexual orientation is a great sin, that they should take seriously this node, tape them and throw them a cruise ship in the middle of the Arctic.
