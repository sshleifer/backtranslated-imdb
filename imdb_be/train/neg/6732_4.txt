I found this film on IFC, and I thought it would be interesting. For "small" love stories, some of the stories really stretched in this film. The fact that none of these women did not have the names of almost leads one to suspect that the actress spoke about his own real sex life, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I must admit that I want to start seeing some of the more romantic view of the first sexual intercourse again, as in "strike! (1998), "if the friend Odette Sinclair began to question her alleged for the first time, and tweets asked:" Was it nice? "<br /> <br /> Some may think, re-enactment and retrospective to improve this film I think. that this will make things even worse. this does not necessarily have to be a hardcore porn to get my attention, but somehow I just expected more.
