This film was positively the worst movie I have ever watched. I could not sit through it all. I also think that the writer must have a strange fetish for women to urinate tear and crapping ... I mean, what was that all! I can not believe it was even done, and I am disgusted at #ingwasted rents in the amount of Â£ 4. The quality of both picture and sound horrible acting ... well not exist. It was a poor excuse for a movie scene and pee, buckwheat and vomiting were like 2 girls 1 cup. Urghh ....... AVOID AT ALL COSTS! The girls looked like they were shot out and only got part because they would be ready to take their tops off ... While these girls have a good body is, of course, did not invent for them squeal it was terribly unconvincing and pain ears. <br /> <br /> This was (perhaps worse) than in manufacturing ammateur school without proper directions and hey there is no need to set, as well as everything seems to revolve around the car ?! <br /> <br /> Definatey not one to buy people. Sorry if my first comment is very negative, but I could not find anything positive to say, and I would like to think that could save someone to spend my money as I am.
