Dear God! I kept waiting for this film to "begin" ... then I waited for him to redeem himself ... and if he did not, I just sat there, amazed that: 1) it might be a bad thing, and 2) I only spent a couple of hours just stupid. I believed that Drew could not have done a bad thing from the movie ... and boy, I'll never lose my faith! Do not bother with this one! Drew tried, but the film was poorly written, poorly acted, and just poorly conceived! I can not believe that a scenario ever get funded is bad! It was a million chance to do something with the idea (the word "concept" is too great for this film even qualify for!), And it still does not go anywhere! Its just pathetic! Where the other reviewer got the idea that it's not the worst of it was, excites me! Because, believe me, when it got worse, I would slit my wrists before you finish it!
