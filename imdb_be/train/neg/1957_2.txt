I enjoyed the movie most of the time, but I kept getting the feeling that I was watching a children's movie. I sincerely believe that someone wrote GHG scenario, and then, during the filming, I decided to add some blood, nudity and language. it was a big let down. is that he believes that the magic of children that exists in movies such as "Baby" (pig) or "angels in the outfield," which triumphs over evil tooth fairies. parents begin to believe that their daughter about her ability to see ghosts, and use this skill to defeat the supernatural tooth fairy. I bought this movie, I thought it would be a response to b-movie to the eerie darkness falls; somehow manages to make the best film with 1/4 of money, but they do not. they did worse than film, and are likely to lose the same share of the money lost in the darkness falls.
