This is a quasi-horror film followed by J young woman as she returns to his childhood village on the island of Shikoku, to sell the family home and meet up with old friends. She believes that one, the daughter of the priestess sat, sunk a few years ago. She and Fumiko (another childhood friend), then know that the mother Sayori in trying to bring it back to life with black magic. Already connection between the dead and the living become weak and friends and residents see the ghost. Nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie. Unlike the star of films J-horror, suspense does not really build, the result does not seem too threatening and end borders on the absurd. <br /> <br /> This film is like a normal white rice cooked too long, so that it borders with soft. Sometimes you get it in poor Asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long. You end up eating because you need it with food, because the Chinese or Japanese food without rice, but it almost destroys the food because of sticky, tacky bad taste of it all. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
