There's no reason to see this film. A good story idea is treated very badly. In the middle of the movie everything is changing, and there is nothing to make a lot of sense. The reason for the murder is not clear. Act badly. Nick Stahl, obviously needs more directed. He was very rich in the bedroom, but here it's awful. Amber Benson from Buffy ', must change its character ever. Even those of you who love gratuitous sex and violence, will be disappointed. Despite the fact that the film was 80 minutes, which is too little for a good movie (but too long for this), no distant scenes in the DVD, which means that they never bothered to fill in the missing parts of the characters. <, Br /> <br /> do not spend time on it.
