Very unlikely, improbable and incoherent Spanish production of ... well, let me see how close I can get to it. The film begins with a woman having one of her cats killed a young girl. Then she asks her lover to take her somewhere on vacation. He refers to the work and requires that he lose vacation time, and she says that he will pay for it. What does this plays only guess at the end of the film, because the guy swarthy photographer spy beautiful Patty Shepard, the queen of the Spanish horror film it seems, taking her bikini perfect for a moment so he could snap a picture, ask her to dinner, and then his appointment to Witch Mountain - for reasons we will never again involved in. Before you go, Patty should go to the house and loudly, "horrible" singing echoed in the ears of our hero. Again, this is never explained. The film goes with them two stops at the hotel, going to the mountain, and finally understand why the mountain is called Witch Mountain. You know, there are several aspects of this film, which makes it better than a bad movie. He has some atmosphere, some of the character actors really very good (especially the blind innkeeper and an old woman), the wire is at least adequate, and the climax - even though it makes absolutely no sense at all - well choreographed (literally) with witches in white bras and long black hair. It just does not make sense, though, and this is a huge detractor me. I could watch a movie ten times, and even more than I did after the first show I do not know. This is a serious problem. Witch Mountain curious film with a long line of cheap, European atmospheric horror films that covered the decade. If you can get more out of it than me, better power to you.
