I was looking forward to the first showing of the film since it was given to me on DVD for Christmas. Once reserved a special slot for him last night, I sat down to watch my daughter (age 17 and a student of cinematography), candy, of course, in eager anticipation. We love Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> After the first two minutes, we knew that we had been shipped. Shaky camera shots and angles, the total bad cinematography, direction and wooden performances have left us feeling flat and unhappy. Dull, we looked on. <br /> <br /> Anne, played by Sally Hawkins, looked strange and without any specific goals directly into the camera several times, disrupting our hard-won "the fantasy of the moment" and attaching ourselves in an almost "I love you I find "stalking mode. <br /> <br /> Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who played Captain Wentworth, did all he could with the script and direction, bless him. I hope they paid him well, however, as he almost drowned in one case, a huge wave, which predictably burst a dam, flooding him and his co actors. They were almost carried to the sea. Health and safety would have a field day! Poor Rupert left spitting seawater in order to supply its line. Presumably there are not left in the bank to re-shoot the scene enough money. Any person who has any sense would not try it in a day, in the first place. <br /> <br /> In addition to Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige gave only a convincing performance as Lady Russell, but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of unconvincing picture of Anthony Head's annoying Walter Elliot. <br /> <br /> long-awaited end of the film, Captain Wentworth appeared surprisingly decorate Anne with a visit every two seconds, taking great pains to avoid it for most of the film. It was as if he had developed a memory impediment that made him forget his very reason why. In contrast, Ann ran, hyper- ventilation, from pillar to post in search of a good captain who, at the same time, he was able to call on almost Bata we have said, for a total of three or four minutes, not even worked up to the seventh sweat. <br /> <br /> We did not feel any charms Anna crossed the screen. Indeed, we are left wondering what the charismatic Captain Wentworth have ever seen in a simple, spineless, an opinion less than Ann and why someone who did not speak then, inspired by Sir Walter just closed brackets to. <br /> <br /> a decisive kiss is usually our favorite girly moment, painfully stretched. As they moved closer, Anne kept opening and closing her mouth, which had an influence on the screen, making it look as if she were chewing gum, lip before finally met. Eww! <br /> <br /> The best part is that last night was a candy and a half-hour exchange of views between mother and daughter about how bad the movie was. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that to destroy a magical and engaging story, filmed in some of the best scenery in England. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Jane.
