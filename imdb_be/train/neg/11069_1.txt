I really felt cheated after seeing this picture. It felt like I was watching the movie 101 minutes is nothing. I do not understand what they were thinking when they did this. It is unlikely to fall in the Jeffrey Dahmer kills and there is no end. It felt almost like they left the movie open to continue. It was like a television episode of The Sopranos. It ends abruptly, and you know that it will be another episode next week. He also felt that I just watched part 1 into two parts of the film. There are many possibilities for what went wrong here; They get lazy, they run out of money, they did not know the rest of the story, they wanted to make Dahmer 2. After watching the film, they all sound very sure. I watched Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the woods. Suddenly I hear the music play, you come to write on the screen and says, like Dahmer 2 years and his suggestions and was attacked by fellow inmates and killed at the age of 34 Wow, he's going to walk in the woods before he died in prison. How about showing how he got there. How about showing the court Dahmer. How about showing a little more detail. I can not even explain what happened in the film, because she jumped everywhere. I actually found myself saying sure, "That's it, that's the end?" I would like to conclude this review by saying there is still a good movie Dahmer remains to be done. For the filmmakers, I would say that if you're going to do it, do it right.
