It really is a god adaptation of the novel by Jane Austen. Compared with the US version with Guinneth Paltrow, the script was written to resemble as much as possible of the book. But the effect was terrible. In addition, Kate Beckinsale, who I believe was the real likeness of Emma in the book, all the other actors were too trying. Mark Strong was not a "gentleman", he should have been. He is often rude and offensive, had no sense at all, and throughout the film you could not see his love "grows" Emma at all. It was a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale, who seemed to be trying to "rescue" her leading role as well as her partner. In addition, there was no chemistry between all gypsum. Hariett Smith plays Samantha Morton, it seemed to have no real attachment to Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. Thus, it does not seem as heartbroken as it was depicted in the book. Movie options are also too poor. Costumes even more so. I would imagine, Emma Woodhouse dress more fashionable and elegant that it does here. The ending is also too long. It's good that it resembles the end of the book, but that's a killer for the end of the film. Again, I do not see any sense of happiness in the face of Mr.Knightley. Finally, I thought that this adjustment to be loyal to the book, but with bad actors. It seemed that the film was made without a budget at all. I would prefer to see the "light" version with Paltrow and Northam, even if it is clear that it was made to be a "blockbuster", than to watch these actors (with the exception of well-Olivia Williams and better Kate Beckinsale) will spoil the whole script .
