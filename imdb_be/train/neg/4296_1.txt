I was going to say that it was the worst movie of gay themes I've ever seen, but I can honestly say this is the worst film genre I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> You know you 're in trouble when the film begins with a "personal note" from the director asking for "understanding" of the audience for the "many problems" faced by the director of the first time. Soundtrack is so bad in many scenes it is virtually impossible to follow the dialogue, and it is a DVD-version. Poor lighting, bad set, bad pictures bad scenario, as a rule, bad acting all add up to make a "movieÂ» unwatchable. I did this through a bad ending, after several attempts, and immediately gave the DVD I foolishly bought. I'm sure there are many problems faced by first-time director. But do not try to shove this lame attempt as a finished product. I see the details of IMDb, it is not only the first attempt to directing Richard Natalia, but only just. This is one positive thing I can say about this alleged "cinema."
