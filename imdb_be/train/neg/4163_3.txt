I can see where some people who participate in this rout of write reviews to share their side of the story, and I thought, what they wrote was useful for understanding it. The fact that they basically came up with excuses - rewrites, budget constraints, production formats, etc. - simply underlines how bad this movie. And my criticism panned it did not personally targeted, but simply a warning that this one does not make the cut. <br /> <br /> It is watchable, but almost so. There are plot holes in each corner, a dialogue borders on the ridiculous, and the ending is telegraphed a mile away. Modestly interesting feature of the hologram interacts with the scout team drowning in bad dialogue, as someone who makes a meal in the middle of what should be a tight and deadly collision with an unknown enemy. Will I wrassle us some Hamburger Helper Sally, between us killed these automated carpet sweepers? Perhaps this is an elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic miracle armor connected Do not have access to Moe. Once they get to the last room they belong to a place, a four star bed and breakfast than a deadly collision zone. <br /> <br /> The reasons for the meeting with the formidable rook that he can not be killed alone, but only one stage ago, the hero makes the case abandoned the king to do just that. And? Vivian B was attractive and hands down the best acted character in the film. But this is not saying much.
