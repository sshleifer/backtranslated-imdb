Worst of all, and full of people who really should know better (cast six Oscars between them). It is set in the "modern" Africa (it was made in 1979), as well as the slave trade. It's terrible script and acted (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden achieve a career low in this), and completely missing the excitement never objected to moral attention. It is also ridiculous graphics. You do not for a minute believe that any of the characters will behave as they do in these circumstances. Richard Fleischer directs, but you get the impression it was on the phone. It's as bad as it gets.
