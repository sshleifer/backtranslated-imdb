I laughed all the way through this rotten film. This is so incredible. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a breakdown in front of the office real estate. What happened? Office manager comes out and offers her a job !!! Hilarious! Next thing you know, two women go at it. Yes, they are lesbians! Nothing rings true in this "life for women with nothing to do" movie. Clunky dialogue, as "I do not want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and do not take it" does not help. There's a rich, distant mother disapproved of her daughter's new relationship. Impudent black servant - is incredible that in 2003, the movie gets made, in which there is a blatant black maid. Hattie McDaniel must have been in his grave. A woman has a husband who is worried and wants custody of snotty teenage children. Sheesh! A lot of clich√©s is left unturned.
