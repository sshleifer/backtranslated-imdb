This low-budget "Scream" film in style. "Maddie," a new employee in a prominent office-nameless, where she meets and begins a relationship with her co-worker, "Chris." During the hot tub party, Chris and his friends convince Maddie they belong to «Murder Club», where each killed someone by the feet. If Maddie loses it and kills someone really, jokes come. <br /> <br /> The film looks good, and there are prerequisites for the genre and the budget level (poverty, dried blood, maybe a few cameo of the few big stars than the cast), but, after the credits, you ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of my life watching.
