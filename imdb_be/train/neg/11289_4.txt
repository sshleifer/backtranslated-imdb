Elizabeth Ward Gracen, which probably will only be remembered as one of the Â«Bimbo eruptions" Bill Clinton (in which there is a pill for that now!) Is probably the weakest element of the show. It really keeps the tired formula Highlander Series- immortal hero encounters other immortal with retrospection of the last time they met, but there is some kind of conflict, and a sword fight at the end, where you have a sequence of cheap special effects. <br /> <br /> Then you have the character of Nick Wolfe. In principle, your typical unshaven 90-character, with typical "sexual tension" storyline. (Seriously, why do you think Hollywood types of sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) It was a joint Canadian / French production, so that half of the series takes place in Vancouver, which mimics the New York and the other half is in Paris ... Just like mountaineer made.
