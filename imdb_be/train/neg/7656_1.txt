Alone in the Dark is one of my favorite role-playing games of all time. I remember spending the whole night in front of a computer screen, trying to escape this house and actually struck twice when the monsters come suddenly charge at the moment, mind you. - I'm tired of "computer generated games" movies. I do not remember any stories of success in this new Hollywood genre, although some of them are interesting enough to be watchable. And yet, I am a big fan of the game, I could not resist. My confession is that when the film was the story, which is the same as the game looked like it would be good. <br /> <br /> Man, it was 90 minutes (which were like 300) in my life that I will never go back. If I had the chance, I would have gladly spent their rearranging my sock drawer instead. It's not even in the "so bad it's funny" category. One would have thought, even Christian Slater had a bit more sense than to join this stink bomb. Now, Tara Reid ... I'm not complaining about its presence. However, if the aim is to deliver the chick in the lead role, to have sex scenes - which I fully understand and support (hey, I'm a guy!) - I saw more of her body at a press conference. <br /> <br /> There's no plot to speak. Do not waste your time pitching it to you. The accuracy of the story is below "I have not had sex with Ms. Lewinsky. Effective, but a few notches above the« Street Fighter », which, incidentally, is one of the worst films I have ever seen, I would recommend over this one. <br /> <br /> Children, I recommend Video game he has a much better story, action and many other thrill as for the movie, here's a spoiler -.. wait stinks porn version!.
