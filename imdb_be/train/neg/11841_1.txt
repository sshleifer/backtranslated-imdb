What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? After a brilliant director, Trail Blazer ... now scraping the very bottom ... This is the same man who directed "The Last Picture Show"? Here he takes a few interesting (albeit contrived) room, and turns it into a chewing gum that loses its flavor when you take the first bite ... Dunst is not bad, but Izzard is as Chaplin miscast, and all the other actors seem to have been cast for their "looks", and not because they were right for the part. Too bad. I'll rent «Paper Moon» again.
