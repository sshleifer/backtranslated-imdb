It would seem a good movie, I thought it would be a good film, and throughout the film, I was hoping that this would be a meaningful use of my time, and so, I have to admit that the acting talent Kapadia and Deepti Naval which is really commendable, but despite all efforts, the film falls short of effectively convey a meaningful message, it seems, it seemed, was that Somnath September trying to do. Final point comes short and the ending seemed unsatisfactory delivery after all, what is happening; a bit like a real life for that matter, but unlike real life movie ends around 2:00 and the ending should leave the audience satisfied, when in fact it was the intention of the director. It falls short in this respect, and that's what excites me the most <br /> <br /> Another aspect that concerned me was the national stereo-typing of the American character. - they all seem to be cut from the same block, I think that most American symbols in Indian English film based on how common the Indians themselves perceive Americans to be as it is clear that no effort was made to bring any sense of depth and complexity to any American in the film. <, Br /> <br /> These two aspects together they make for a disappointing history.
