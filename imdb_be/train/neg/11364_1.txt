The first ten minutes of the film that the international cinema in Belgium, all right: you can see a real chaos on the set, a producer on the verge of a nervous breakdown, cold BEEN Director (Mickey Rourke), poorly seasoned stars, etc. You've all seen before, but it's well done. But then! The rest of the time the film is simply repeated: the same ten minutes over and over again. The culmination of a lot, there is no dramatic development, any good action, not even a bad game, it just goes on and on and on. Mickey Rourke has two good moments when his character talks about his f ** runtsa up a career in the scene where reality and fiction meet. In general, it is good 12 minutes. <br /> <br />
