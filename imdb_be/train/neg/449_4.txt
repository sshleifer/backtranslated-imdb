I admit that I only watched a few episodes, but each of them seemed to be completely different from the other. It seems that after the first season, the producers decided to completely retool the show, characters fall, introduce new and rewrite all shows dynamic. <br /> <br /> As you have probably guessed already, the show about the quirky, unpredictable teenager Hall (Amanda Bynes) who moves with her high string sister Valery (Jennie Garth) in New York. Decent enough premise :. The odd couple + a fish out of water + high jinx <br /> <br /> While I miss the former comedy, this show unfortunately misses at times funny, and it's sad because they have a decent talent. <br /> <br /> In addition, they insisted on changing the show (Val lives with a regular cast of BF one season, then he suddenly disappeared, so it opens up a bakery? what?) If things change dramatically, you get the feeling, even * show * knows that it is bad. I mean, a whole new sets of characters are written off and new show regulars! <br /> <br /> On a side note (this is just nitpicking), I know it's a TV show and not real at all, but Val and Holly end up living in a huge attic duplex (a ladder) with terrace ... in MANHATTAN! Are you serious?
