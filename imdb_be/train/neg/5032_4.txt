This film was a fantastic 50-pack my friend got me for Christmas. It is very similar to the first film of Gozilla, and how this film, there are scenes with American actors, inserted no real reason. One interesting thing about the inserted scenes that have the tension of the Cold War represented between America and Russia. As in Godzilla, Gamera awakens atomic explosion and outrage around the world, focusing on Tokyo because there is no big monster movie would not be complete if Tokyo Sun bites him. In general, it is normal film. Some scenes with Gamera, especially in scenes Tolah, very spectacular and special effects that have been pretty decent at the time. If you love the Japanese giant monster movies, you really get a kick out of it. I give it 4 out of 10. If that were unedited Japanese version, which I watched he probably received 5.
