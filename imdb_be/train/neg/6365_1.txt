Wow, I knew that this movie will be bad, but it's not bad. Spoilerific comments come <br /> <br /> Roddy Roddy Piper annoying retired policeman, to help everyone. (Clichés!) - grinning like a lobotomy patient after surgery through the rolling out and lamenting over his dead son. His adopted son back from the Armed Forces "commando" and because he "saw things" - drew clenched teeth when someone mentions anything about the past. Time to clean the streets from another man who once knew Piper and his dead son (who killed the bad guy) and his adopted son. <br /> <br /> So, the love interest of a pretty young woman who decides there is no reason that she wants to jump the bones of former Man Army. This occurs after about 2 minutes, 1 stage. <br /> <br /> The action could have saved this movie, but it's even worse than the plot and the action. All this has been done before, it was all done much better (Ong-Bak is a prime example). This is the worst movie I have ever seen. - and I could see Waterworld, twice <br /> <br /> ERM, the film is called HONOR (Spelled Wrong for Americans) and the tag line "from creators and Blood kickboxers" - check director David worths other films, and you'll quickly realize why they put these 2 films out there, despite the fact that they have more than 10 years. Such classics as «Attack Shark 3: Megalodon» - says it all really <br /> <br /> I'll give you £ 10 if you do not go to see this movie <br /> <br / > .. PS - Sorry for do not know the characters' names, tells you something, though.
