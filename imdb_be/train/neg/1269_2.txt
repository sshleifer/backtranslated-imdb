This series gets two stars only because it puts some of Dickens's Bleak House on the film, and perhaps someone will read the book. Contrary to what is likely to popular belief, Diana Rigg was poor as Lady Deadlock. It was awkward and wooden. Lady D. reserved character, but not a martinet. Denholm Elliott correctly, incorrectly, incorrect Zharndisom g. So I'm going to interrupt myself and to respond to all those people who say, "I have not read the book, so that I should not accept the opinion of this guy because he is basing his assessment of the book." It is true, and not true. For ex, Diana Rigg bad in his role because of a bad action is not whether you have already read the book. On the other hand, Denholm Elliott Zharndis passable (although too old). Series fails not because it is unfair to compare it to the book, but as different storylines and characters just do not merge to make a consistent, dramatic, mysterious andcompelling entertainment. It's boring and flat. If you want to make a good apossibly Bleak House, you need to spend 20 hours in 10-hour movie episodes. But I believe that manufacturers, etc. Dickens leave alone (even Christmas Carol). TV mutes the genius of Dickens as manifested in his inventive plots and unforgettable characters.
