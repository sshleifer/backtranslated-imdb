Directed by Kevin Connor and wannabe action hero / romantic role, Doug McClure, again a team in this ghost story set in Japan. They were moderately successful together in the 1970s, with the likes of "Earth, forgotten time" (1975), "On the earth's core" (1976), etc. No plastic monsters carry the narrative together, though, the results are frayed and derivative in the most formulaic way. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a prologue set in the 19th century, with a samurai husband kills his wife and her lover, before committing suicide. Moving forward to the present time is the couple Ted & Laura, visited Japan and move into the house where the tragedy took place. <br /> <br /> a lot of surprises, what will happen next, with the spirits of the dead, starting to take on new residents with a family friend Alex (McClure), which provide for the role of her lover's wife. <br /> <br /> All rattles clumsily together with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant, to the inevitable (but surprisingly dark) output. The main attractions are two weak beheading ( "The Omen" has a lot to answer in promoting this as a standard set of a horror piece), and scenes of love-making with the image of the eyes of a doe, but very strange, Susan George. The first long "Do not look now," inspired some of her husband, complete with piano music; the second is much shorter (probably at her request) from McClure weave looks like a pretty uncomfortable. In any case, there is a silver lining, and both scenes show her fantastic knockers so all is not lost. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not decide whether the "house where Evil Dwells" is garbage, garbage watchable, entertaining or in a masochistic sort of way. If you are not in the genre there's nothing here at all, but for fans of horror there is probably enough to cause an amazing rye smile and a grateful nod of respect for the efforts <br /> <br /> best scenes. - in any other film large, black, climbing tree, Japanese muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show. They eclipsed even the legendary scene of food a family where there is a ghostly head in the soup daughters. Seeing a ghost, she asked what the soup she (!!!!) to be told beef and vegetables before uttering the immortal line "Ugh - there are ugly face in my soup" If that was not enough the answer is "Yes, okay. , eat soup Daddy. Â»Laurel & Hardy rest in piece.
