DOWN TO EARTH / (2001) * (out of four) <br /> <br /> According to Blake French: <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" is misleading and desperate comedy that makes sitting on the couch at home watching chris Rock standing-act comedy on TV looks like the sky. Speaking of the sky, the film is based on the 1978 film «Heaven Can Wait». It was a good movie, and it's good to show how a group of novice writers can take good material and turn it into garbage. Directed by Chris and Paul Weitz miss almost every goal. From concept to storytelling, "Down to Earth" fails miserably; this is one incredibly bad production. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock lousy comedian, and his role in this movie and in real life. He plays Lance Burton, whose manager (Frankie Faison) even feels sorry for him when he was booed off the stage during amateur night at a local theater. Soon after, the script sets its mediocrity, the character is killed by a speeding truck. Death, played by Eugene Levy, made the mistake of taking a spear before his number was up. God's Assistant (Palminteri) is very angry and decides to let Lance is the rest of his time on Earth, by the time he takes the only available body of 60-year-old white millionaire. <br /> <br /> Mr old name of Wellington, whose life has its own problems. His wife (Jennifer Coolidge) has an affair with his assistant (Greg Germann), who robs him his money. But it's all right, because Lance inside Mr. Wellington, fell in love with a young black woman named Sontee (Regina King). Meanwhile, there are areas to kill Wellington, in Lance is trying to get a better body, and confusing feelings Sontee consider the situation in the hospital with the participation of Finance, Mr. Wellington. <br /> <br /> «down to earth" there are some good ideas, but they are pointless and unconvincing love story, full of tricks and recycled materials. The biggest problem, it works in the way we perceive the Spear, Mr. Wellington. Chris Rock is the actor's popularity and publicity, so it will not be missing a big part of this film; all characters to see the new Spear Mr. Wellington, but we see it as Chris Rock. It is convenient for a love story; we believe that the young woman will fall to Lance, but in fact, it's actually an old, gray-haired old man. It is not so convincing. <br /> <br /> one-joke comic situation should see the old man does funny things that really made a young black man. But what inspires laughter, when the characters are faced with conflicts without their knowledge. Just look at the "There's Something About Mary." The funniest scenes of characters undergo an uncomfortable experience, rather than at their request. Here, in Lance knows that he is in the body of the old, and does things the old usually do not. Lance did not know if the body was in fact that might have had the potential <br /> <br /> Another problem with the concept. We never knew, Mr. Wellington, in the first place, so how can we compare the spear into his body when we do not know what it was originally. In addition to this, Chris Rock to be the center of attention here, and makes the character too much like the Rock. It reads a simple routine standing joke which are tedious and painful; his dialogue is so obvious wood and straightforward. I hated the sense of humor of the film. There are so many unfunny jokes and terrible comic situations. It's like watching a Chris Rock Chris Rock, not a character in the film. <br /> <br /> Let's emphasize the positives in "Down to Earth.» Mark Addy does worse here than he did in "The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas." Eugene Levy and Chaz Palmentari well-cast, but they are on the mercy scalpel scenario. This is all the good qualities I may mention at this time, and if you give me another week to remember that it is likely that I will come up no more.
