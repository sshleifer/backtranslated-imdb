Well, I bought this movie with Woolworths for my friend was seriously sitting on his birthday, because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it. <br /> <br /> But we decided it to watch it anyway. Just for fun purposes. <br /> <br /> And I'm sorry, but this must be one of the worst films in history. <br /> <br /> He started to take in order, and we thought, "Well this might actually be OK." But after about 10 minutes we were sadly mistaken. <br /> <br /> It started when "a mysterious paint BallerÂ» turned out to be the most obvious symbol, Scouser / Australian (I'm talking about, because he had an accent that can not be identified), which acts, maybe I'm just saying , it was lamentable. <br /> <br /> Then he got in the end, and by the time we had lost the will to live. Paintball finals. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did like about this site is that they actually do not win, but they won quite annoying default. <br /> <br /> And I know this has nothing to do with it, but the name of the team was given was terrible. Critical damage. I mean, they could select more than a strange name as "destroyers of the Antichrist" or something. Or is it that the film should have been called anyway.
