GOOD. I know what I want-to-be John Hughes movies 80s were unilaterally flat, hope that this film ran quite low. <br /> <br /> However, after sitting through this shit, there is one key thing I can 't seem to get out of my head :. <br /> <br /> I just sat through the 80th film Rob Lowe, who had no nudity and just a hint of sex they <br /> <br /> To act terribly sad and flat characters, the image of the absolute icons of Oxford, and rowing scene uninteresting, unprecedented, and fuzzy. <br /> <br /> If you do not get some strange Ally Sheedy and Amanda Pays (or I guess Rob Lowe) fetish, there is not even any reason to see it.
