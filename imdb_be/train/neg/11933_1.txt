My child is doing better video than this! I feel ripped off $ 4.00 spent for rent this thing! There's no date on the video case, apparently designed Wellspring; and, what is worse, there is no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie! The only date specified in 2002, leading to an unsuspecting landlord to believe that he is getting the recent film. <br /> <br /> This movie was so bad, that in terms of outdated and irrelevant for any period of time, but just when it was done, I'm surprised that someone would take the time and costs to the market as a video. It may be of interest to students of the counter culture of the 1960s, anti-war, anti-establishment, tune in, drop out and dial-culture; but if you read the back of the video case, there is no hint that this is what you get. If you make a mistake, rent it, though, it is probably best viewed while on drugs, so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your state of mind, watching it, I can tell you that it does not get better after the first scene; so knowing that, I'm sure you'll be fast asleep long before the end.
