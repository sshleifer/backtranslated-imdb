I thought the film was good in the beginning aroused parts.The .the first 30 minutes of the film were good.The angles within the first 30 minutes were strange, and I did not want it coz they are not blocked by actors fully. <br /> <br /> I think the last 25 minutes of the film really is not so great, from which we expect a lot in the case of such films. <br /> <br /> dialoques not make sense, and I do not think they are very clever. <br /> <br /> I felt as if they were trying to rip movies like Phonebooth in terms of dialogue, but not miserably.it they seemed many of the scenes between the actors have been introduced for this purpose, and has no meaning in the history of . <br /> <br /> the whole movie has only the law and Caine. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's a waste of time, his IQ film, but not gr8
