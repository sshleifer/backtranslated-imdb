This is a moderately interesting end of the 80 gores a festival with some reverse slugs with a taste for human blood. If you can get past the absurdity of everything that you could actually get some slight pleasure from it. Acting and terrible plot is just there to hold the film together between the bloody attacks of snails, but the film is not a waste of time. The special effects are really very good, and the blood is well done. It reminded me of the Blob remake, probably because of all of this mucous. In general, you could certainly do worse with a half hour of your time, but I would not advise you to see this film if you have not got a strong stomach, and something like that.
