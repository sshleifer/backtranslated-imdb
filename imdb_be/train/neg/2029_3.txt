I do not see enough TV game shows to understand the appeal of Show me the money, but I believe it has a certain attraction for the undemanding audience. Ostensibly quiz, it offers our members a huge amount of money by answering a few simple questions. Nevertheless, his quiz elements play only a minor role in the production, which I find tortuously complex. For example, before answering the question, the participant chooses which question must be asked by selecting random numbers from "A", "B" or "C" range. Does it serve any other purpose than to slow down the game? It would be much faster to just start with "A". Participants can send questions, but must answer one of three questions in each category <br /> <br /> After answering the question, the participant is then asked to "fix" the answer - is another delaying tactics The next task of the athlete. 'is the name that a woman about ten Go-Go dancers in cages to reveal a map that shows how the question is correct answer adds a dollar cards figure to cumulative total of the contestant;. wrong answer takes the same amount It is time-consuming step in the. actually it has some zabavlyal th value, since it allows the audience to get a close look at the half-naked and equally gorgeous dancers. Meanwhile, the athlete said that a bad choice "killer card" will end the game instantly. This, of course, makes the contestant sweat and cause further delays in the nerve participant considering the sudden loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. I suspect that the possibility of sudden disaster is a major entertainment show. <br /> <br /> meanwhile, the whole process slows down even more empty banter between taking William Shatner and pits contestants, along with random procedures cage dancers. All these delays are burned so many times that it might be possible for the audience to forget that the original question is the time reveal the correct answer. <br /> <br /> A typical 30-minute episode of Jeopardy often gets through as many as 60 questions. The first 30 minutes SMTM, I looked only got six questions (many of whom belonged to other TV shows). No one in their right mind would watch this show, because it's fun to play together, answering questions at home. This leaves three possible reasons to watch the show. <br /> <br /> A. To see how the participant is responsible for which is on the verge of winning as much as one million dollars, only to lose it all in one move. <br /> <br /> B. In order to look at the gorgeous young women performing sexually suggestive dances. <br /> <br /> C. In order to enjoy the scintillating banter William Shatner in. <br /> <br /> My Choice «B», but women not on camera long enough to justify the suffering of an hour of the show.
