The film was poorly written, poorly acted and very predictable. It was a very low budget, and I can understand why it was never released, and went straight to video. It was not even mannerisms of fun, it was a disaster, and I would like to get 1-1 / 2 days ago! The colors were horrible with the plot, which has a hole so large that it can drive a truck through them Macintosh. <br /> <br /> The story itself was a young bride doing what it absolutely was not physically capable of doing - that is stretching! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre. Almost any movie comes to mind, it's better than that. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
