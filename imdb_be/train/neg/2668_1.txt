It will not be tricked into renting this movie. It has nothing to do with the escape from death row, in spite of the (English) name. I can not think of a single good thing to say about the film. Bad actions, bad editing, bad direction ... ridiculous "story", and sound / music was so annoying, it is surprising that this film does not come with warning label. The only possible way to sit through this film and enjoy it for its historical as cheesiness. They just do not make movies that bad anymore.
