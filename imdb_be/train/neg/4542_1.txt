I went to see this film with the crowd, which consisted mainly of "spiritual" New types of age who, just this film very much unlike me, --- although, in accordance with the fact that she knew the book (apparently, there is a book contains more of this nonsense), the film is not quite as good. So if you tend to think of themselves as "spiritual", believe, or at least can tolerate such a thing as "aura" and "astral body" and not against the frequent use of the term "energy" outside the context of physics and technology you may, in fact, like a movie, and probably more like what this book is apparently based. <br /> <br /> However, if you are mainly due to the physical universe, when your ability to suspend disbelief easily exhausted meaningless New Age nonsense and sites based on them, when in addition to this you have a low tolerance for cheese light effect to indicate that there is spirituality, and possibly even wait for a reasonable non-interactive cast and then it is my recommendation to you about this film: Hold on. Away. <br /> <br /> Do not even think about it. Today, this film moves Dungeons and Dragons as the worst film I've ever personally seen in a movie theater (I do not think the movies I went to see them with the expectation to be bad, for example, Plan 9, and so on). At the same time, he picked up the result of the film, I almost went to the two (D & D is the other). I do not go to the movies, and not even that, but I have, when I first saw the image of the visual aura, as New Age BS continues to get thicker and thicker from that moment. <br /> <br /> a story about a group of people associated with the myself with some old prophecies, in search of spiritual enlightenment, and aimed at, to humanity to the next step in its evolution. Or something like that. They actually talk about this spiritual material is the next step in human evolution, which should make anyone who has even the slightest idea of ​​what distorts human evolution. The film is full of shock whoppers, like this. Sometimes people beam to the fact that they are, of course, be described as "another dimension", or perhaps "other plane", only to become invisible to those around them who have not yet attained enlightenment. Perfection. <br /> <br /> In the end, the director patronizes the audience by rolling the "understanding" that make up the prophecy, painfully slow, apparently, so that we can remember them and leave the cinema as a better, more enlightened person. <br /> <br /> The good thing about the film? Some very beautiful nature shots, and some decent supporting performances Elizondo and de Almeida. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that this is seriously affecting my ability to make a person seriously if they think that this film interesting or acceptable. It is really el cheapo spiritualism most naive kind, and if it's not your thing, you'd better make something else out of your time and money.
