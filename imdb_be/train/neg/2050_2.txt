Not that "a film by Ulli Lommel" filled me with hope, but I must admit that the Zodiac managed to sink under my lowest expectations. There is a trend in recent years among young filmmakers use digital video for his early projects, that all is well to give these children the opportunity to create jobs without spending all your money on expensive films. But many of these young filmmakers also have wised up to the filter concept of the finished film, so it seems qualitatively more celluloid. The effect is not perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really works only for the "mockumentary" style, because she never looks anything other than video. This is the main problem with the Zodiac. Watching the film feels like watching a daytime soap opera on the killer. It does not feel like watching a movie. And what is even more unforgivable that Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker. He should know better. He must know that it is virtually impossible to make the horror (or even unknown!) In the video. For the love of God, this guy was direct from the sixties! He may be the only director who could not improve over the forty-year career in the business. And we were lucky that he wrote too! Thus, you can expect the bizarre actions that do not mean anything unreasonable behavior, and at least one for sure pretentious plot element that will leave you completely unsatisfied. Please, please, skip this movie. You'll thank me later.
