Each generation of fully believes that living in the end times. Now this was true for thousands of years. And movies like this feed on it. How they get great Orson Welles, to tell this train wreck? This is a documentary film about the Biblical prophecies of Armageddon. He is trying to link the prophecy, as well as he can to what happened in those days, it was made, making it clearly outdated and silly. <br /> <br /> The reenactments look like they are from the "unsolved mysteries" but without the high production values. People were embarrassed to take part in this. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is dated, silly reactionary, and useless. well, if you want to laugh, but not good enough to actually look for.
