Complete waste of time .... This film is not a comedy, it's not a drama, it is not romantic ... even teenage comedy at least !!! History ... it must be some kind of treatment at one end ... but it's so frustrating! If the film has a turnover at the end, I expect the turnover to make the film even better (the expo. "Fight Club"), but this turnover makes the movie even worse .... When I look at the teen comedy, and I don "t do, that very often, I expect lousy jokes and a lot of nudeness ... jokes too disgusting, and there is no nudity ... you only have one .... very good-looking, I must admit ... the girl, and that's it ! And she was fully dressed the whole movie! Responsibilities bad ... like a soap series ... Do not waste time! There porns with a better story and acting! <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
