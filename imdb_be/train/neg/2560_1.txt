Well, I watched it last night, and the one thing that does not make it completely terrible, it's straight ahead. There was no marking time, that this child was the Antichrist. However, the film was just a poorly written. For example, they did not explain how they did the incident dentist "accident", or in the end, just as the police miraculously found himself in the house in time to save the child, without the police, even when he was still called. death scenes were just too bad, not at all entertaining. The child they decided to play the Antichrist was boring, and they really could have chosen a better child. Just do not waste your time watching this.
