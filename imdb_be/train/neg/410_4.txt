Unfortunately, one of the best efforts so far made in the field of special effects were done completely pointless, when placed next to the logging, stupid and senseless as the plot and inadequate clich√©d script. Invisible fairly useless film <br /> <br /> Almost all seen here were done to death -. (! Especially the lift shaft) symbols, ideas and sequence of actions - with the only truly intriguing element in a film being impressive special effects. However, it is just a special effect is done again and again, until the end of the film that has been done to death, too. I had hoped that, before watching Invisible that Invisible theme that is hardly original in itself, will be the foundation of something newer and more interesting. This is not so. Not long before the film becomes excessively familiar bath of blood and mass ineffectual histrionics - the mound dies accumulates so fast that it's almost impressive <br /> <br /> In addition to all this, Kevin. Bacon makes a pretty useless work and his supporting cast is almost trying their best. Good moments can be tolerable score by Jerry Goldsmith (but not contest his best efforts), a very interesting use of thermal images and special effects. I really wanted to give the film three out of ten, but the consequences of pushing merit Hollow man one step higher. <br /> <br /> 4/10
