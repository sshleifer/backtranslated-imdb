I saw the first of the dwarf-movies, and sometimes I had little to pin him. There are many well-known TV / Comedyactors, appears in the first part and presented in fancy costumes, typical small episodes of Stand-Up-Program and this is the problem of the second film must contend with. Everything was already there .... nothing new to get. You are familiar with most often boring and stupid "joke" and you always feel like their goal was to put in each Comedylooser last decade, who wants to return to the stage. There's nothing important in history: the history of a typical fairy tale Rumpelstiltskin, without any value. I was expecting something like that, but it's nothing that I could complain about. I actually complaining lazy plot writers who had the whole background story; their only business was to get a lot of jokes and parodies inside, but they did not get it anyway. This shit is, except for a large occurrence of Helge Schneider, a total waste of time and money. (If you do not like it then delete 2 ochek my estimation) If you want to save your money and get bad jokes, you see shit, it's a cast every Friday evening at the RTL or SAT1 free. I'm sure you will learn some «laugthers» I saw the movie last night.
