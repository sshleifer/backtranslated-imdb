This is a terrible movie. And girls are cute, but not very good. Portion having a cowboy linked to Indian virgin would be interesting if the sex does not get in the way. Well, well it can be fun, but it's not because it went so bad and only partially worked. I can only imagine that similar plans are dancing tushes look like on the big screen, probably more ridiculous, they do on television. (I will not even mention topless knife fight between two women who are related to each other and hold the entire thing chest to chest. Never read that in the old west) It is a film that requires the liberal use of fast forward. <, Br /> <br /> I like schlock movies, but this is ridiculous. There is a reason why I do not go for this kind of movie, and they are usually not very good, the plot takes a back seat to his chest. Original Nudie cuties as they were originally called nudist films or movies where there was touching, but as an adult industry began to grow some filmmakers tried to be clever or trying to use something else to put butts in the seats. This clever were very few who had just left the oddities that have been limited talent. In comedies often came off best with humor approaching first-class level, the infantile but harmless fun. Something that could rarely be said about any other genre of cross-dressed as a naked actress. <br /> <br /> Ramrodder looks good and has some good parts, but it's done in the future nor Western, neither sex movie. <, Br /> <br /> I do not need to look at it again. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that, probably more than one, rapist and murderer in the film played by Bobby Beausoleil, the Manson family member who had been arrested for the murder of a school teacher shortly after filming wrapped. <br /> <br /> Obviously, these kind of things to destroy some people's lives.
