It's pretty simple. Friends is a comedy very simple humor is aimed at teenagers and young adults, with the untrained sense of humor. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is painfully obvious that the closer to the end, they are desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons, most likely, so they can say that they beat the 9 season run of Seinfeld. The problem with this, Seinfeld was amazing 9 seasons with great writing, friends had (and I've been very generous here) no more than 5 or 6 seasons OK, and then bottomless 4 seasons. <br /> <br /> He became a soap opera with a refined sense of humor and processed traits that were not that good to begin well, then it got worse at the 100th time you've seen them. I find it so hard to understand why people appreciate it. This is really terrible.
