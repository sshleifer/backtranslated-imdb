Six glass collected is sent home and discharged, to drink and to get into a cult meeting in Asia. Among hooded figures, the two dancer pretends to fight. Behind them, on the altar, woven baskets are opened and the figure is colored appears and begins to imitate the snake finally bites one of the dancers on the neck. Imitation snake dressed in a leotard ScaleY looking body. (This, of course, women imitation snake.) The cult member who carries them in a secret meeting warned six people repeatedly that the ceremony should not be interrupted and, certainly, no photos to be taken, or else they will hunt and scored. Naturally, Glass shot with flash, a member of the cult moved in an angry fit, steal basket with "snake" and run with it to the Asian night. <br /> <br /> One of the guys in the most insulting and elegant, dying from the bite of a cobra around his neck, although no one can explain how the snake got into his hospital room. <br /> <br /> New York, it all seems rather old news discharged men settle in their civilian life, while maintaining their connection with each other. Their work ranges from bowling the manager (David Janssen), to complete a graduate student (Richard Long). James Dobson, Jack Kelly, and Marshall Thompson is also a part of the city. Richard Long has a nice blonde girlfriend. Kelly few reckless womanizer. But all of them are fairly good, and they all seem happy. <br /> <br /> Then the dark, which runs views, a mysterious woman (Faith Domergue) shows and Marshall Thompson takes a liking to her and insinuates it into the group. <br /> <br /> Guess what happens. First Janssen frightened shadows in the back seat and dies in a car crash. Then Kelly gets Domergue visit. Something scared him so much that he falls through a window and dies in the fall to the pavement. Long Dobson and begins to suspect that the audience already knows - that Domergue has something to do with death. They also believe that perhaps it is converted into a cobra that takes place. Dobson confronts her with his suspicions, and she proves his point. <br /> <br /> So far, Long Thompson and thoroughly exhausted, particularly Thompson, who is in love with Domergue and found that it attracts to it, too, although he had to explain to her that "love." Whatever. The final reckless attack cobra woman with friend Long - not one of the six original criminals - and Thompson should throw the snake out of the window. On the bridge, the body is changing, and that Domergue. End. <br /> <br /> I think I'm going to miss most of the questions that are raised plot. I will mention only one of the more prosaic of their passing. Who paid the fare Domergue from Asia, in New York City? Who pays your bills for utility services in the hotel? Who paid for her spectacular wardrobe? As she speaks American English so well? What the hell is going on? The writers and director clearly seen some modest Lewton horror movies and, although not a lot of efforts have been in this production, they shamelessly stolen a few tricks with Lewton. In Lewton «The Cat People», for example, a woman turns into a black leopard, but with one tiny exception, the threat always remains in the shadows and becoming more like a ghost to him. Most of the changes are to use a shadow, too, but unlike Lewton-x, shadow clumsy and ambiguous. <br /> <br Lewton /> from time to time to use what he called. "buses" first "bus» Lewton was a literal one. The potential victim is in a hurry to own only the sound of footsteps on the dark tunnel of Central Park. Something or someone behind her. She freezes with fear under the lamp. something rustles in the branches above the bushes. She looks up. There is a loud, wheezing squeal that makes your hair stand on end. This bus, using their air brakes to stop it. Manufacturers using at least two "bus" in the film, and they to anything. The guy is distracted through the intersection, for example, and there is a sudden roar of a truck that nearly hits him. There will be no not set up the shot. It is stuck with a shoe horn. <br /> <br /> I do not much care films that perpetuate the stereotype of the serpent as a slimy, ugly, poisonous, and phallic. in fact, no snakes Sun slippery, most of them are harmless, and many of them are very beautiful. in addition, they are more feminine than men, they have a winding movements and snake approach to the target. You want reptile symbol of courage? Try six lining racerunner. It is very fast lizard. If he sees something, he seeks up and eats it. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you want to see some lovely, low-budget scary movies, do not bother with it. Find «The Cat People» or one of the other minor masterpieces in Lewton, from what is a clear copy.
