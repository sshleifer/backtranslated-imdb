I rarely write a negative review for this site, but this time it felt complied to .. Night Listener, without a doubt, one of the most boring films I've ever seen <br /> <br /> There was nothing that happens in this movie what so ever - I do not care for any of the characters, do not buy the whole scene type of mystery, not all the same as it was over .... nothing. <br /> <br /> There's no comedy, no action, no thrills, entirely unknown, nothing. Highlights do not include (no spoilers - do not have to spoil anything). Man climbing through the window, the dog barking outside the hotel room, the car was going over some rough terrain and truck horn beep it <br /> <br /> I really liked Â«One Hour Photo" and hoped for the same terrible role from Williams but, unfortunately, I was very later. What's more frustrating is that I'm sure there's a good movie in there somewhere - the idea was interesting, and I had sympathy for the character, but it just does not work for me <br /> <br />. I might even give him 1/10, but that assessment is reserved for alterations manufacturers
