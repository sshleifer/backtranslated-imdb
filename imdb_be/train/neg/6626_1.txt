I saw the movie and I was screwed, because the movie was stupid and boring. I thought that Ram Gopal Varma justify their work, but, unfortunately, he failed, and the entire film was spoiled, and they spoiled «Sholay». the cast and crew was bad. the whole theater was asleep while watching a movie, some people ran away in the middle. amithab Bachan acting leaves much to be desired, I thought that this film will be the biggest hit of the year, but this film will be the greatest failure of the year, of course. no one has done justice of their work, including Ajay devagan. this film does not deserve any audience. I bet that this film would be a flop. <br /> <br /> «FINALLY This movie sucks"
