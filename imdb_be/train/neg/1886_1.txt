I once promised never to get out of any film (personal politics that made me suffer from various kinds of dreck, such as Rambo 3, Fuck me, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was really a terrible experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that the Austrians pathetic, pitiful bunch of morons. It shows a world where love and humanity does not exist, a world in which people humiliate each other for one reason only - to distract from their own miserable existence. Choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like straight out of a fantasy Austrian shock cartoonist Deix) director Seidl would have us believe that this is real life in Austria (European? Western?) Suburbs, the audience faced with the image of sexual orgies, violence against women and people with disabilities, madness and degradation. But this is not a social critic. It's just pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead, you get a bad actions, bad cinematography, bad filmmaking. If someone needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society, this person must be who walk through life with your eyes closed. This pseudo-social criticism with a sledgehammer. And he looks at people in a shockingly condescending. This shows ugly people - this is not the reason why I hate it. But it reflects the average man in the ugly, man-way. And that's why this film is really despicable.
