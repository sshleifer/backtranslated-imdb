I have read comments about this as the best Chinese film ever. Maybe if only Chinese movies that you have seen do not contain dialogue, long stretched far looks and silence, and hack editing, then you are on the spot. <br /> <br /> A complex storyline? Hardly. Try juvenile and amateurish. Excellent mood and intrusive memories? Hardly. Try flat out sad and banal. <br /> <br /> It was awful. I could not wait for it to end. Especially when the best lines in the film consists of "How are you? I'm fine. Are you sure? Yes. "Wow! What is the depth of character. I believe that the continuous cigarette smoking had to speak for them. <br /> <br /> As a huge fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean movies, I was totally disappointed in this. Even Zhang sentimental juicy "The Road Home" was better than that.
