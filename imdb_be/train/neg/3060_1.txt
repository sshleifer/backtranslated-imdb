It must be awful, most twisted holiday movie that I've ever clapped eyes, and that says something. I know that the Mexican people has some amazing ideas about religion, blending the ancient Aztec beliefs with traditional Christian theology. But their Day of the Dead is not half as scary as they take on Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> So..Santa not some cheerful, thick red suitable alcohol (note the red cheeks once!). Most likely, it is a thin sociopathic pedophile lives in heaven (or sky, whichever), with a bunch of kids working harder than ITS in sweat shops Kathie Lee Gifford. They sing about so cute traditional songs of their homeland while wearing so stereotypical that I was surprised that there was not a little African-American boy in "Mammy" black face singing. This Santa is a radar pervert who watches and listens to everything that everyone does "eye in the sky" from it. This is so that he can say who was naughty or nice (with an emphasis on those who are disobedient, I would bet). <br /> <br /> There's no Mrs. Claus, no elves (elves that he needs if he has a child labor?) and deer mechanical wind-up toy! It floats on a cloud hovers freak show, presumably holding a silver lining. <br /> <br /> Santa's nemesis ... the Devil! What is Santa our Lord and Savior? Weird. Anyhoo, Satan sent one of his henchmen, in crushing and gallop devil called the Pitch, to try to spoil Christmas. Let me get this straight, pure evil forces trying to destroy completely driven by holiday sales and greed? It seems kind of redundant, is not it? <br /> <br /> Pitch completely ineffective. He tries to talk some children to be bad, but no luck. I was very surprised by the story line of a righteous young girl Lupe, that family is very poor. All she wants is a doll for Christmas, but parents can not afford to buy her one (they have spent all their money on cardboard that they built their house). So Pitch tries to cheer her up to steal the doll. In fact, this is the only way that girl that the poor ever doll, because, being a saint and to pray to God and the holy Santa does not really work. But Lupe resists the temptation and said step to get you behind it, and so rewarded by being given the doll so looking slider that you just know it's sister in Chucky. <br /> <br /> On the way Pitch manages to get Santa paused on a tree (Hugo), where he saved Merlin! Merlin? You must be joking! So when the Druids mythical figures appear in the Christmas tale, or have anything to do with the Christian religion? And God does not approve of magic? They would be burned at the stake Merlot few hundred years ago, did not ask him to come to the aid of one of the aspects of God (or that is what I believe that Santa has to be to go against Satan). This film is one long huh? from beginning to end, and it will make you wonder if that eggnog you drank entirely spikes or something. This was probably because this film as one long giant DT.
