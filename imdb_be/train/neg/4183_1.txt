If it were not for «Oh So Gourgous,» Natassia Malthe, the B- movie would not be worthy of one sector of my disk space Tivo! In a low-rent, back a lot part of an imaginary space port filmed in? "The continuity of the people!" This is the main principle of the real film! At night, the space port and the estimated date (day and night on the space station?) Ingredients! ??!? People, please! The only thing I paid him for this film, is a cabinet department. for continuous, keeping Natassia then harshly revealing outfits! Even the women who saw the bomb had to assess the outfits that she obviously spent some time getting to, each day of filming! Sci-channel would be better to show Spaceballs! At least, it would be a real sense of humor to watch something so incredible. <br /> <br /> P.S. Michael Ironside, please, Fire your agent as soon as possible! You are so much better actor to even be associated with this level of filmmaking.
