This is the version that the author, even hated, because it's so corny. They gave him a "happy ending" and changed a lot of dialogue, and it's just a big pile of saccharin. "Director" pretty good, I think he originated the role, but still falls into this acting style 40s, which is really just a pose. One great feature- music. This is one of the best results in history, and it is to be found in the music store. Overall, I think the 1989 Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller version is much higher.
