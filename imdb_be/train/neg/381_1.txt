This film is a traditional Bollywood fare, how much star power, sentimentality and love triangle of emotions. What really bothers me about this film was the absurd notion of the founders of the surrogate mother. Whore, who conceives a child with someone after having sex with a man (family wanting a child) is not a surrogate mother. Nor is it a good candidate for the surrogate mother. I have seen Indian films and television shows that have made 10 to 15 years, because this issue has been addressed more intelligently. The whole concept of the film is funny and absolutely implausible. I understand that most Bollywood movies are not meant to be believable, but they do not pretend to be. This film wants to replay, along with the characters, but it can not be done with such a ridiculous, far-fetched conflict. I would expect better from Abbas and Mustan.
