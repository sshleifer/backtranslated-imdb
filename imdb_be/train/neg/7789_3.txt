While not exactly the offensive version of "danger of Pauline" 1967 definitely stupid. The name might lead you to wait a tribute to Pearl White (original Pauline in episode 1914 silent 20), but for that you would be better off in 1947 version starring Betty Hutton. This version of the 1967 resembles a mixture of "Casino Royale" and the weakest of Elvis movies. Worst of all it is not a mixture of them, but more like someone with tape-glued segments from each other, so that it jumps back and forth between the two styles. <br /> <br /> What unity is in production comes from the pairing of Pamela Austin (Pauline) and Pat Boone (George Stedmanom), a good match, because it lacks even the most basic of acting (think Mandy Moore playing opposite Dan Quayle ). <br /> <br /> Austin later to play with John Aston in "Evil Roy Slade», with the talent disparity between the two is actually painful to watch. In the mid-60s it was «Dodge Rebellion» girl, as such, it has been shown in a series of similar dangerous situations, imagine Sandra Dee in dark blue overalls. If the advertising agency the automaker to replace it with «Dodge Fever» Girls someone got the bright idea to show it in the film. <br /> <br /> What's the story here is, begins with Pauline grows in Baskerville foster homes headed actress who played Mrs. Chatsworth Osborne-older on "Dobie Gillis". George falls in love with her (Pauline-Niya Mrs. Osborne) and sabotaging several opportunities it has to be accepted. George leaves to seek his fortune, and 19-year-old Pauline gets the job done, students with young oil-rich Middle Eastern prince. If he tries to add an attractive blonde in his harem, she escapes and goes on the danger to jeopardize. These include the African pygmies, 99½-year-old millionaire who wants to freeze it until his friend-year-old grandson old enough for marriage, the film industry, and the Russian space program. <br /> <br /> All of this is meant to be silly and charming, but manages only stupid part. There is some effort to activate the silent movie to watch in sequence, simulating the under-cranking the camera (which accelerates the action). Unfortunately, all the rest (of films, design production, assembly) is woefully 1960. Nothing here is not even approaching Pearl White images tied to the log, moving to the buzz of a saw or tied to a railway track in anticipation of the approaching train. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
