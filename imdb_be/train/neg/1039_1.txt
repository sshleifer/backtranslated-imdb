This "film" is one of the scariest things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Please, buy yourself a favor and avoid this incompetent broth. <br /> <br /> camera shake and having his actors take frown is not listed in the "direction" that this film is necessary in droves. Not that the letter was all excellent, and we were left with a pile entirely artificial character, directed that the most artificial way (pseudo-documentary "style" is appreciated by those who do not know how to direct). <, Br /> <br /> This film gives the impression that it was made a cynical appeal to critics who do not know the first thing about the film industry (which is most of them). <br /> <br /> Just awful. He says a lot about the Sundance, and it was that Victor Vargas was exhibited there.
