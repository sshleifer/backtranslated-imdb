I can not say that Aag worst Bollywood movie ever made, because I have not seen every film of Bollywood, but my imagination tells me that it can be. <br /> <br /> This film seems like an attempt of artistic suicide in the name of the director, and I for one beam assume that he was successful in his mission. Many list actor outside of the film will not risk sharing the same billing as he is for all the indignities, this film is bound to carry with it. <br /> <br /> But let's not just blame the director here, has a filmmaker who looks like he is rehearsing for amateur home movie maker of the Year award. There is excessive dramatic score that he hopes will take you to the next stage. Lighting man who was holding a cigarette in one hand and a light bulb on a pole in the other, and in the hope that by burning the flame of a cigarette to add to this much-needed light in each scene. And, of course, the actors! Some of them are not newcomers, otherwise everything can be forgiven here. The ensemble cast in Aag were combined to promote a new beginning and measurement to re-brand the most favorite movie of all time in India «Sholay». We must not forget that these actors were not forced into this film, they list and willing participants to something that, let's face it, no doubt, had a high public expectations and impatient ??? So the question arises, Amitabh aside (for the moment), and other actors really feel that their performances even tried better than the original? Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believe that people will remember his dialogue in this comedy film filth? Do not be stupid, of course, he did not, it was a public demonstration of how much money talks, so can make actors walk. <br /> <br /> I really hope that all participants are happy with what is really a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film that succeeds only in polluting the minds when they look original.
