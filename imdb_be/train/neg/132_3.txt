"In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in the Peruvian Amazon. A year later, he came out of the jungle ... naked. It took 45 years to get back. "As expected," Keep the river on your right "is" a modern cannibal tale. " Actually, who are looking for some idea of ​​cannibalism would be bored disappointed. The first half of the film is more like a travel journal New Ginuea, mainly advertises native art. The second half belongs to the still photos of the Peruvian tribe of cannibals, but really that's about it. Of course, if you are not interested in home movies of Jewish weddings, or the introduction of Schneerbaum his former male lovers. I give up. Big disappointment and not really "modern cannibal tale.» - MERK
