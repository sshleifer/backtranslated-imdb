I should have listened. I had been warned, and still, I paid money for it, read all the reviews, after knowing that the original "so bad it's good", and that Part 2 does not fit into this category in general, still even then, I could not resist. That is what happened here? The first part was fun, it was so much politically incorrect and other Crazy, Fat entertainment, and this one, there simply could not be worse than a continuation on God's green earth, rather than Basket Case 2, hell, not even Troll 2. it really is the worst sequel ever, and that's really saying something considering innovative, bins of the original. Criminally Insane Part 2 just a completely different brand of bad. Captured on video, zero points, zero entertainment value, 1/3 consists of flashbacks of the original, and on top of all that, wisely, Ethel fat lost some of its girth. I mean, honestly, it's some kind of sick joke?!? Thanks a lot, Nick Billion. 1/1
