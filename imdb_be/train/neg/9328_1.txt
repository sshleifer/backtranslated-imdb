I was lucky! I got a sneak peak at this miserable movie-in-Texas shot horrified "by Artisan Entertainment for the week before the hit video shelves and let me tell you ... I have rarely laughed so hard in my life as I watched this brutal megabomb fly off the track and steal the title of "worst killer clown movie ever made" by intolerably stupid Full Moon fiasco grumbler (I'm sure many of us horror fans have suffered because of this one!) Apparently, it was shot on the DV, and it do not really "see" all that bad quality wise for digital and e boy does it ever failed miserably in any other place where it matters! <br /> <br /> story (small and clich√©s like this) is as follows ... Executive (Ken Hebert, who is also the script and co-produced with the director) takes a skeptical Tracy Officer (Amanda Watson) and a horny couple and Mark Susan (of Hank Fields and Chris Buck), as well as on the weekend to the (yawn) `lonely cabin 12 miles from the nearest town. Along the way, they pick Bitchy / slutty hitchhiking (Melissa Bale) in the bar and eventually to their destination, where every evening around the campfire tale of a murderous clown chasing the same wooded area comes true, when each of the profanity-yackin, sweat -Smokin ?? friends disappear one-on-one, with only a mutilated doll parts remained behind to talk about their lives. <br /> <br /> killer clown does not even appear in the film until near the end, and it does not look like a demonic image it on the video box (apart from morbid obesity). It basically spends an hour jumping around in the forest to chop wood and chatting nursery rhymes. I can not say enough bad things about the cast, especially the two guys and hitchhiking chick who either bring their fresh dialogue with a minimal amount of enthusiasm or to replay the most inopportune moments. Is there really does not help that the script is entirely devoid of suspense, originality, intelligence, humor and overall coherence. I could go on for several days, as the inept this film, as mistakes have continuity and as an amateur, all products, but I just nod from showing the whole package is quite a riot in this boy-this- sucks sort of way. <br /> <br /> Also noting that the film was released here in the US as SICK (Serial Killer Insane Clown). It is now cataloged under his (original title) Grimm WEEKEND <br /> <br /> Evaluation :. 1 in 10
