After a car accident, a mad scientist (Jason Evers) holding the head of his bride (Virgina Leith) is alive. Then he goes on the prowl in search of the perfect body, to make it fully again. Pretty lame all the way around, nothing redeeming here. Also in the cast are Leslie Daniels Bonnie Sharie and Bruce Brighton. Someone had to help put one of his suffering. Let it die.
