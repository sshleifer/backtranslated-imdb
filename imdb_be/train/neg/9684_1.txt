Stilted, unnatural, strange and opaque, if visually amazing ... wannabe erotic fantasy. In fact, a sad, too much male nudity (including the father-son incest), and only a kind of shameless meaninglessness. I confess, however, that some passages of dialogue, taken on its own terms, does have a lull, which is the quality.
