There was not a single original idea in this story. Threads pulled from a variety of sources; Few ninth gate at the mouth of madness (another Carpenter film), and a ring. He even went as far as the same damn lights around the ring and use it as a namesake film. Soundtrack Cody Carpenter was nearly removed from Suspiria. Hopefully, no one will oppose this comment to erupt around the word tribute. Yes, I saw that the theater played Argento's Deep Red. Claiming to be a tribute to garbage excuses. It was a bottom-of-the barrel. Throwing Gore and "disturbing" imagery in the bank does not make a good horror film. Carpenter used to know. It should disappear into obscurity or buy a time machine.
