Youth Victor Vargas simply a bad film. No amount of denial or advert-supported advertising dollar to change this sad fact. <br /> <br /> Maybe Peter Sollett saw he did not have the money to make the film he wanted to do, and decided to take the easy way out a way to make a bad movie that cynically Apes postulates of this "acute filmmaking." Maybe he just did not know better. It is hard to say. <br /> <br /> What is not hard to say, it is the result. for several audiences who will intellectualize poor shooting in an attempt to pseudo-realism Additionally, few people will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I know that I did not. <br /> <br /> Do yourself favor and pass this film.
