I saw this movie at the Film Festival of Toronto with a fairly rigid expectations. the film has a great cast and closed at the festival, so it must be good, right? how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> I knew we were in trouble, if before the film director said that when he sends a wiseguy episode he met an unknown actor named Kevin Spacey (director / writer wiseguy makes it debut feature = blah) ... well, the director / author Edison must have some incriminating photos Kevin Spacey murder of a homeless person, because I can not see how it is (together with the other actors in the movie) ever agree to be in this natural disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely horrible! a mixture of each hard-boiled cop clich√© ever. There is nothing new with Edison. acting was bad, and the direction was even worse. it seemed that the aforementioned episode wiseguy. this was the best cast directly on the video film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> just a few examples of bad stupid moments in Edison ... Morgan Freeman dancing around my apartment without a reason to rock 'n' roll ... Justin Timberlake getting creative criticism from its beauty while it the apartment is surrounded by candles ... llcoolj driving vintage ... 3 firebird guys shot in the head ... <br /> <br /> this film is the opposite of good. <br /> <br /> Stay away from EDISON!
