What's left to say? <br /> <br /> I read all the reviews here and most of them are right on. , However, one person even went so far as to call this film is evil and Satan corrupted it (or something along those lines). Evil! Wow, what a shocker. I mean, basically TBN made this film. Open your eyes, please. <br /> <br /> Anway, it was the lowest grade propoghanda nonsense that come together for many years. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Omega Code, how much money they spent to do it. If this film can be made, there are no restrictions, and thus, we have no other choice but to prepare for "Yentl 2" and "Ernest Loses Codes Omega". <br /> <br /> For those of you that are Bible stories, new movie Dogma will pickup where Omega Code has not started.
