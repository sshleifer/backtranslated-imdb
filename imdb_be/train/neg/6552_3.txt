Cash (now playing Kristyn Hajj for Angelina Jolie) roamed the post apocalypse void (after her protector died of old age, said defender played by Elias Koteas, actual decent actor), and now she believes that people wander through the rubble looking for a cyborg to sell for scrap and cash. She is leading a group of burned cyborgs (This includes William Cathy, Evan Lurie and human scientist plays Gelligan) against the bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes screen time as employer Lynch. Cyborg 3 actually manages to be better than the other two records, but it is still largely a dim feature. The problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used good action sequences are common name cast such as McDowell, Katt Galligan and give little in common. Haje really whiny character and Lynch is too over the top (as usual), and the film lacks inspiration or aspiration to be a fun bad as it is hilarious predecessor. (The one with Van Damme, the second is simply boring.) Also disappointing science fiction angle, which is almost aggressively resisting any good idea he has. As the swing action is routine and the number of B-movie stuff and well done, this is the only positive I can say about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 with 4 (Poor)
