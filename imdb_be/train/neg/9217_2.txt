So, the only thing this film memorable is that he starred youthful Tom Hanks, who only a few years later, would be the actual star in Hollywood. Here, although it is not a film that is going to demonstrate their talent much at all, and the only other thing that could be considered somewhat entertaining about this film there is a scene where he thinks he sees a monster and runs through the guy. Yes, this film is about the evils of playing the game, which makes a group of people to use their imagination and try to come up with interesting scenarios. Basically, after the type of school a special evil game Dungeons and Dragons cleverly renamed here Mazes and Monsters. Apparently, the makers of this film thought that idiots should not enjoy any kind, if they were not going to go out and do underage drinking, drugs, having a lot of unprotected sex and oppress other weak child, as well as all the popular kids are doing. No, these poor people have played the game, which actually sought to use there brains, Heavens no! Not that, if they have a brain, they may actually be able to think about themselves and not the brains of certain groups there. Yes, I think this movie is completely stupid and a waste of time. Of course, it could be a film against drugs, but there are far fewer people who have died, taking the Dungeons and Dragons away throughout its existence than, than to say that drunk driving claims in a month.
