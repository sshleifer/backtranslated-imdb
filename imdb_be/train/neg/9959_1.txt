Cheap and manipulative. This film does not have a heart. <br /> <br /> He also received a pathetic dialogue, unconvincing character and absurd, or rather, does not exist, a story. It's just rocking from bad to worse in a cynical attempt to turn some of the emotions and insincere unengaging hysterion-afest! <br /> <br /> A hedgehog !!!! How many cheap shots the film can be taken? Hedgehog, by the way, gave the most compelling and watchable performance in the ninety minutes to crawl Athos. <br /> <br /> If you have considered watching this film, it is not necessary. I'm sorry, but I can not find any mitigating this film. He scored big, fat ZERO with me. Strictly for the sub-dogma knicker-wetting. Yawneroony! <br /> <br /> However, if you liked Dancing In The Dark ... <br /> <br />
