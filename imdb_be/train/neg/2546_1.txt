This film is a stupid attempt of a thriller. Excursion by bus to Las Vegas attacked by a group of white trash thieves driving dune gods. They drive them into the wilderness, and then steal all your valuables. The plot is constantly changing. One minute they want to steal the rich daughter of the breeder, they are looking for the next stamp collection cost of $ 90,000. Dialogue terrible. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie.
