There are some good things about the film. Music and movie is great. Alex Wilson is hot and gives a great performance. Ryan Bauer is also hot. The production was very fortunate to have cast them, because they really give the value of production in the cinema. Johnny Vincent (Sean) and a lot of the boys in the film, who do not speak too cute. Why not an actress, who plays Amy is listed in the credits? Brandon Alexander gives a great comic performance as Clitarissa pink. <br /> <br /> The worse case of a movie, probably a star, James Townsend. He can not act. He is also very thin, not nice to look at all. His hands are like spaghetti. It's disgusting. They have no muscle tone at all. It is not surprising that he has to make his own film and throw it. No one will throw it at anything. <br /> <br /> James Townsend entirely believable as someone who would even have a girlfriend because he acts so much fun. They had to cast someone else, like lead, if they want what's best for the movie. Then again, maybe he just wanted to use the film as a vehicle to begin a career in the soft core porn is definitely not real acting, because it would take some acting lessons. In addition, anyone who makes porn blacklisted in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The funny thing about the movie is likely to cast a tan-skinned Latina mother Devon. Sonja Fischer seems the actress at all. In general, this film is a soft-core porn, and no better than what you would see on Skinemax. I think even Alex Wilson is probably the best thing about this film, confused by this and does not want to be associated with him. There are no photos on his page on IMDb, and anything else on the list, so that the Alex Wilson is probably the name of the single stage. In addition, I ran into him in West Hollywood once in recent years, and when I mentioned this film, he just turned and walked away. I understand. If I worked on this film, I would be embarrassed and do not want to be associated with him either.
