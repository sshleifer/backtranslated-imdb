They built this one as a kind man with imagination Snowy River met Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and just for a romantic touch Ned and Joe get to play off with the high quality talents, boring young wives of rich older men. Well, there are many myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also many well-documented facts, leaving room for artistic creativity in the production of a good historical dramaticisation. I mean, this is not the story of Robin Hood, not Arthur legend, Sun Beowulf, not someone whose life is shrouded in fog so many centuries ago that any rest of his life and time is 99% of assumptions. These are just a few lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already at school age, when Ned was hanged. <br /> <br /> So stupid of me fantastically presenting this film is a serious attempt to tell the story of Kelly. Recently read a wonderful novel by Peter Carey's "The True Story of the Kelly Gang" I would expect it to be in the same spirit. But no, the fact is that a lot of fun of Mick Jagger in 1970 Kelly is probably much closer to reality, but rather the film as a whole, which does not say a whole lot for him. <br /> <br /> We are glad it only cost me two bucks to hire a DVD! I'll give it a 3/10, and it is only because of some good shots Australian bush makes me feel generous.
