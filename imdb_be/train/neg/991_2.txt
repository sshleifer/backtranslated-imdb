If you want to watch a good movie on how a woman can fight against sexual violence, then this movie is not a movie you want to see. It was a social commentary about the woman who was the victim and fights back. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson turns the tables on her attacker. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim is drawn to the use of vigilance. It essentially negates the judiciary. "The accused," the film was much better than the movie, because the victim is using the judicial system and wins. That "Descent" does not speak to victims of the attack that they have to resort to violence? There are victims better, that the prosecutor? No !!!
