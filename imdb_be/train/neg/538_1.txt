Wow, what a waste of acting talent. My husband and I sat thinking how it should be better, the actress is too good to waste your time on this crap. Ugly characters hackneyed script and sluggish Shagan do for a long two hours. I really could not hack it and left to do grocery shopping (cat litter to be more attractive than the film). Husband stayed and confirmed that he was not getting any better - until Buddy was killed, you would like all of them would get hit by a car and end their miserable lives. It would be much more interesting. Beautiful scenery and costumes can not keep this alive.
