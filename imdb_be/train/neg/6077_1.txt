Will anyone really this abomination, if it contains no small children running around nude? From a cinematic point of view, this is probably one of the worst movies I have encountered quite disappointing. Some pervert woke up one day and thought I was going to do a movie with young girls in and call it art, stick them in the countryside, and there is no need for a story, or an explanation of how they got there and why they are not live anywhere in or from their parents, because p * rn anything like that do not need films. I would like to comment on the rest of the film, but I have not ticked spoilers, so I'll just tell you to avoid avoid avoid and find a proper movie to watch
