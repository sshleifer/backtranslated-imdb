This movie is not funny. It just takes a nerd stereotypes of D & D and amplifies them. All the main characters are less than 30k a year, all of them live with their parents, they are socially retarded and they have no luck with women. Jokes terrible and prose, for example, two of the players getting beaten black dwarf, because one of them was looking KKK hood (it was his master suit), and the other guy was on John Rocker to warm up (about how ridiculous it is nerd, so he does not know about the sport). You may have to be a children's high school students to find any of these things are funny. Well done poorly mockmuntaries so painful to watch, but it is obviously very cheap to make. I sympathize Lebrok and Beverly D'Angelo. I believe that these are the only options available for Hotties past their prime.
