Well ... it seems so far, only the bartender supporters commented on this film - time for counterpoint. Beware, this is a review * LONG * <br /> <br /> For those who do not know (non-Belgians, mostly). Tom Barman, the director of this film, is the frontman of Deus, one of the most famous rock bands of the late '90s here in Belgium. Basically, they've done some very enterprising and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on a national scale. Then the ego started to hurt, and the band broke up basically from bartender and a few others were to go to the creation of albums under Deus-nickname. As it always happens in such cases, after the breakdown of Deus it was much tamer and less interesting than the original. They tried to go into the international break with their "Ideal Crash" in 1999, representing a diluted form many of their early style of songwriting. They did not quite make it. However, the ego is still quite large, it seems :. Large enough for the barman to consider myself an artist enough to try a movie <br /> <br /> Most often, this kind of thing is a very big mistake, and this film does not make an exception. And the bartender went clearly on the * art * this, another very big mistake. On the one hand, he is a musician, not a filmmaker. On the other hand, of Deus at it's best ridicule and provocative music, but never anything close to what I would consider a * art *. It shows. <br /> <br /> So what's this movie about? Basically, it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people, doing the same things are not interesting for quite uninteresting Friday in Antwerp, and even more uninteresting things happening to them in the act to be uninteresting. Shallow characters, the plot makes no sense and the movie just does not have any other qualities to buy, to make up for these shortcomings. Humor? The whole movie made me smile (a little) about 3 times, and in fact turned out to provoke a 5-second laugh (not very loud). Mood? The film just does not seem to show any emotions or feelings in general. Mystery? Well, (* Small SPOILER *) the idea of ​​"human wind", inspiring the name of the film as exciting as the banana pepper pizza - not much has been done a thousand times before (anyone remember Johny Destiny - one of the worst performances of Tarantino on film to date) (* END small SPOILER *). And well, it * Art *, so do not expect any real action to make up for all the previous ones. In other words, a few smiles, except, it bothers me from my shorts. <br /> <br /> So what's left? Well, the soundtrack is pretty good, although it suffers from some of the same problems that other OST's shown in recent years: firstly, it makes the film seem like nothing more than a promotional video for the CD. Secondly, it creates the impression that the bartender is trying to conceal weakness and lack of emotional content in the film quality of content of songs that just do not work. In the end, it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration of the songs. And, unfortunately, it Barmans own contribution to the soundtrack that gets the most attention, although it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack, as far as I'm concerned. In general, it is just necessary to show that the bartender knows more about music than movies. The camera work okay as well, but not all, what would you shout with joy. <br /> <br /> The only thing in this film that kept me watching was the sight factor. After all, I come from Antwerp, it was fun to play a game "Guess-The-space." I would hardly see this as a quality, though. <br /> <br /> In general, another chance is lost to Flemmish film. I continue to notice that lately, the best Belgian films came from the French part of the country. This is mainly because, at least they have something to say, and manage to say it in a way that is both dramatic and emotional (Daerden brothers come to mind). Maybe, Flemmish art-house filmmakers should try it too.
