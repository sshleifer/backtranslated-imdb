I caught it on IFC yesterday, and I can not believe the positive reviews! I'm the only one who thought that these "ladies" were not at all? Kate says she could Jed fired because she must support the society, but to put to him! Then they suddenly decide that they love each other? And she was so devastated over death, it does not go to his funeral, much less tell his family "good news"! By the way, how do you get an American to be the headmistress of a very proper English school? Janine was kicked off the force for its inexcusable abuse of power, but nothing happens! She completed boffing Conan is brought in for questioning! And the less said about Molly, the better! <br /> <br /> As for the guilt Janine and Molly feel of the Jedi, please! It is own damn fault punk, it was converted into Roadkill! Where guilt for poor Gerald, who gets puked on? If only I could do the same with the profane of this "film"!
