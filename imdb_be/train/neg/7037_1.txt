It's really awful movie and spend 2:00 of your life. It is both soft and abusive, nudity and lots and lots of violence. However, nudity is not that interesting, and the violence is repeated and sad. In addition, the story unconvincing at best, unrealistic characters and undeveloped, and the effect of some of the worst I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I have heard that this film has to be funny, but it is not. I did not laugh once during his show, and I did not even smile. The makers of this film attempted to combine comedy movie with a fighter, and they are not on both counts. <br /> <br /> Some poorly made movies funny because they are so bad, but this is not one of them.
