The first of them is different and funny. This attempt should not have left the studio. This film will make you laugh. This is a weak attempt of rough humor. The film selects the current and old movies on plagiarism. At this time, the jokes seem to be used and exaggerated. The audience, which I've only seen him once again delivered a Hannibal dining scene and another was asleep.
