Well, they say that nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. I do not know when Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she, of course, have sex with men. She is still studying, trying to find a "more data" so that she could see what she wants from life and the people in it, although it seems that at her age she should be a very good idea right now. (I can not agree, however, with those who say Young is too old for the role. If it is, we must all ages as well.) For the most part this film left me cold, though it is by no means the worst it is not type you will ever see. And in contrast to the recent Â«Eyes Wide Shut", at least something is happening in this.
