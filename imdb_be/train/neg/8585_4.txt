Well, I think I should be the one to say, "The Emperor has no clothes" When I saw the show, listed in PBS, and I had hopes and fears last night.. I loved the "Morse" (even so far as to buy a full set of DVD) and felt that, while I have always loved Sergeant Kevin Whately in. Lewis character, show John Thaw, period! After watching the new "Inspector Lewis" (as it is by here), I am more convinced than ever that I was right ... Whately excellent (although it looks awful (as bad age and too thick), but it just does not has the charisma to carry the show as the thaw. <br /> <br /> as for his "sidekick" Fox, well ... maybe the reviewers here from England could understand what he was saying, but I for one primarily could not. <br /> <br /> respect to Ms. Innocent ... all I can say is that I miss James Grout. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say that they should others have left "Morse in the world.
