Like most people I like "A Christmas Carol." I've never even heard about this film, and perhaps for good reason - it's awful. The same locale, the same narrator, the same director, but the warm fuzziness of the original was not. Grodin was a bad choice to replace Darrin McGavin, but I can not imagine who could replace him. The story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original. Interaction with neighbors, the Bumpuses, funny. In "Christmas Stories" obsession Ralphie with a gun BB seems cute, but his obsession with this film sad. Scud Farcus, the original area of ​​the bully, is replaced in this film another child with curly and amazing hat, but with a slightly menacing call Scud Farcus. It It would be pretty hard to be original, even if the film was made with the original team.
