Steven Seagal movies have never been Oscar material, but with every release they are becoming worse and worse. <br /> <br /> This one begins with Seagal getting picked up by the FBI because he had killed several people "in self-defense," he active military so escape from the prison to rescue kidnapped Stealth aircraft that cliche "evil villain English will be used "Hollywood is so obsessed with including these days. <br /> <br /> It is enough to say that the film has a terrible dialogue, which almost always comes with a hefty cheese topping and the lack of acting talent. The story is not interesting and there are segments of it, which makes absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story, the characters of the film as a whole, such as "lesbian" interaction between the two main women in the cast, which is there purely for titilation, to get the viewer and more even titilating just confusing, because it makes no sense, why it happened, when it is not needed. <br /> <br /> In short terrible scenario with bad dialogue, delivered subpar actors, boring and sometimes poorly choreographed scenes and unusual pieces that serve only to achieve the almost impossible and make the movie worse. <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes of your life and give this a miss, even if you are the most ardent supporter in Segal.
