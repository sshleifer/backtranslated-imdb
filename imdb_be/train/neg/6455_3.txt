Truly awful film. This is to be expected, though. It is obvious that a low budget: anything all that innovative, actress (if you can call it what it is "valid"), which always has a role with nudity in the shower scene, a man in a reptile suit almost along the lines of a predator, a hut in the forest and etc. But there are some redeeming point. Although the story is not new, for the most part, there are some parts that are not as spat. On the one hand, a black man dies when he attacked (the first time), and it is not even one of the first pair to die. But this is minor. More importantly, there is a very interesting twist on experiments Kat and Wes & Steve, I did not see coming. If Steve Kat said he knew what she had done, I believed what he said and that Kat answers. But if the creature showed who he really was, I was pleasantly surprised by the novelty of discovery. This may be due to my lack of experience with the genre, and it's a really clever twist. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is very bad and does not see if there is anything better ... If you're not in the mood for a cheap SCIFI clicks.
