I'm not a big fan of Star Trek, but I'm looking forward to it. I was intrigued by the descriptions of the pre-hype the company, its compressed-submarine design and rough-edged technology as compared to the Treks we are accustomed to. <br /> <br /> I do not see anything interesting in this pilot. I found the site to be complicated and confusing <br /> <br /> I will admit that I did like some of the character development. - the figures of these people as "teen" types are ready to outgrow their Britches was interesting. <br /> <br /> And that Vulcan baby was fucking incredible rack. <br /> <br /> But I do not think I'm going to get hooked on this series. <br /> <br /> 3/10
