For several months prior to the release of this film you've seen it advertised in all types of print media, so I waited patiently for its video release to see what all the hype was about. After it was over, I must apologize to my roommate for KVM sessions for the last hour and a half to see such an awful movie. It is in fact can not, because it is based on the film of the character is not redeemable characters. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only repaid quality is that she Amanda Peet), you can not stand any of them. The film is based on a dialogue that talk, imbecile, and crude. Just a little funny character, Eric, whose image of a single group of friends a married member's dead on. The final twist, designed to make you laugh at the three main characters, but instead causes the same resentment towards Pete. In general, only the rent, if you are desperate or have a dark sense of humor.
