I went to see him in the hope of some good old Alice Entertainment.Once I realized that I will not get that I watched him pretty well-made film (in terms of shooting, and it was yeah..that) .But away from it, having a good film quality, bearing in mind that I watched the grainy film the whole day, there was nothing good about this movie. <br /> <br /> He was killed 42.Why Tweedle Dee and Dum plays Mudler and Scully? Serisouly, who can answer this question for me? who can answer nothing terrible in this movie for me. <br /> <br /> I agree with those who said that it was just one big joke for a long staff.That that's all it would seem. <br /> <br /> Poor Mr.Carroll.I'm so sorry that someone has made his wonderful stories.
