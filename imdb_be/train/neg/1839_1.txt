I could not wait to put this movie on my DVD-player, when I shot him. Then, after I started, I could not wait to get it out of my DVD-player. In fact, I watched all the movies. My wife and I have been waiting and waiting for something funny to happen, but nothing ridiculous never does. Reading box, as it would be very funny. The premise of the movie sounds good. Ben Stiller's funny. Jack Black funny. How could miss this film? Well .... it's not miss it! It unfunniest Â«Comedy" I've never seen. No one I talked to did not think it was even a little funny. It's just a very lame movie. Trust me. Avoide it .... AVOIDE IT !!
