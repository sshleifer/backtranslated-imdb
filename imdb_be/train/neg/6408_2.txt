UPA film surprisingly well appreciated on IMDb, despite the fact that the animation quality of light years behind the Looney Toons, Disney and MGM in the prime of life. Unfortunately, due to rising costs in making coolest cartoons carcass with high rates and excellent background, style UPA (about 1 to debut 950) became predominant in the late 50s and 60s year. In the end, the films were cheap, so that they are received several Oscars, to "prove" that the cartoons were now mainstream. So as a result, lousy animation is becoming the norm, and this trend was not reversed until the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This film UPA is one of the earliest. Characters very simply treated (any easier, and they would use the stick figures) and the backgrounds were ugly - simple line drawings with color added to the very manner of the knee (often with a sponge and is rarely completely filling detail). <br /> <br /> As for the history, the history of this jive with a strong attitude jazz style. Some will love it, others just find it very, very loud. This is the traditional "Frankie and Johnny" history and because of the shooting and everything, it's probably not a great film for children. Heck, because of the animation and jazz, this is not a particularly good film for me too! Some will read my review and, without a doubt, I think, I crank (which I have, to an extent). Nevertheless, I love cartoons and some of the minimalist style of the UPA is a very, very long way, and you can not seriously consider their great works of art - just very, very quickly made cartoons. Ignore the Oscars and try to watch some classic cartoons or something - anything else!
