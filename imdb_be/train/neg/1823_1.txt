character Jack Black, Tim Dingman «Dreamer» in the Envy, is wealth and success «Vapoorize» aerosol ideas, which when sprayed on a dog's litter makes pee disappear into thin air. <br /> <br /> At this point I was hoping Vapoorize was a real product, so that I could dispel it at this "bitch" from the movie and make it disappear in the air as well. <br /> <br /> Although Envy not the worst film I've seen in the last 12 months (that honor goes to the Cat in the Hat), you get the honor of second place. <br /> <br /> not funny, not boring, not anything. Real "Stinkeroo" !!!!! <br /> <br /> 0.2 out of 10 !!
