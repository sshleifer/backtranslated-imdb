My friend once brought about zombies Chronicles for us to see how a joke. Little did we realize that the joke was on her to pay Â£ 1 for it. While watching this film I started to invent things that I want to do than watch Chronicles of zombies. These include: <br /> <br /> 1) Drinking bleach 2) Grinding sand in my eyes 3) Writing letters to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Re-adoption of the American Civil War, 5) tax returns 6) GCSE in mathematics 7) sex with an old lady. <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy, or Sgt. Ben Draper wrote that? The guy could not even dig a hole right. Best Tin he did kick the door down (the best part of the film). It was the worst movie I have ever seen, and I saw a white noise: Peace. Never film so many errors in it. My girlfriend left him here, so now I live with the shame of ownership of this piece of shit <br /> <br /> News only :. Owen Wilson watched the film and tried to kill himself. Fact. <br /> <br /> Do not look
