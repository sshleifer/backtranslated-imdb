SPOILERS FOR !!!! <br /> <br /> I read the book "1st to Die", and would like to see when the film was for the book, so I watched it. For the most part it was done. There were some minor differences (the place of the last violent scene, for example), but not so much, and for the most part of the film remains true to the book more, most of the films. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was a mistake-although the film was very solid with pollen and furs, especially, I was not impressed with that book. Or let me take it back. I started very impressed, gradually became more disillusioned, and until the end there are very unsatisfied and felt almost gypped. There is no difference with the film. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There's no "win" in a book or a movie. Rarely have I read, who made this thriller that has created such a disappointment to its final resolution and I hope that the film will change a little bit. <br /> <br /> of-government (he did it, NO she did it, NO they both did it) -It entirely interesting, entirely mesmerizing i more confusing, annoying and depressing then anything else. Add to this, that the love of the life of Lindsay dies at the end (after her illness cleares and she was crying on his grave) .. and then cut back to where she was contemplating suicide .... then suddenly she was in the fight for her life with a real villain, who was cleared after the arrest .. but it appears that he and his wife were in it together .... HELLO !!! This whole thing has become a "common house" instead of good old-fashioned thriller. I felt cheated and ripped off the books and watch the movies (I have to admit that I held the attention of well--The action is very nice for the TV film) hoped it would not follow the book, which she wound up doing. <, Br /> <br /> I still think that the film is watchable and for some reason does not come out as a bad taste in the mouth, like a book (or maybe it's just that I knew would happen) but I have to say, as the story unraveled was not well done at all.
