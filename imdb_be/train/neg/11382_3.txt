Any notice that Tommy has only 3 facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. Angry eyes look he gives to each enemy. 2. Holding hands to his face, his mouth open and frightened eyes. 3. smiles Tommy Turnbull. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I very much hate that show, I do not watch it, but it's like Code Lyoko, we all watched, at least, I should say that this show is Edge racist uninteresting and meaningless. <br /> <br /> Each episode ends Robotboy victory, except one, except if Robotboy basically let it fly too geeky Freakazoid on the pack. <br /> <br /> rather crude joke and I think it's mostly people say the word "suck" or farting, I think bullies show quite shocking too. <br /> <br /> There is no or one that hides a bowling ball under his hatred, and the other uses a chain, for God's sake, what kind of school he was going. Not to mention his older brother, who is borderline psychotic and has no other character traits. <br /> <br /> In general, the show I feel like tearing the XLR Megas, and cultivate. How could you say a trio of chicken coop, Jay and Kiva, and Robotboy be similar to Megas, where he beats everyone, no matter what kind of chance, and it is free vigorously, even though the robot. <br /> <br /> There is simply no appeal to this show, I'm not surprised that it still works.
