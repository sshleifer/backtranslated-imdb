There's nothing I hate more than the self-congratulating pretentiousness. Kevin Smith deserves to hang his toenails, inspiring each white middle-class whiners to make a movie about why they can not get laid. I do not mind the inexperience and low-budget productions, but when the writing is clearly unfortunate and it really burns my potatoes. The money invested in it could have gone to a real filmmaker fighting, which actually has a chance, as John Gallager. If you watch Project Greenlight you immediately recognize a talented visionary, who is fighting against the system. Anyone could grab a camera and take a snapshot of a talker, that did not have to say anything really, at all. If we are saved from Smithonites and Whedonettes world? The revolution can not come quickly enough. Go watch a real first-time effort, buying or looking for Desperado each use. Thank you and good day.
