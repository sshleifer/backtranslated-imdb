When I was shooting the film, I had very low expectations ...... but when I saw him, I realized that the film was less (much less) than I expected. The actors were bad (the doctor's wife was one of the worst), the story was so stupid ... it could work for the Disney movie (except murder), but this one is not a comedy, it's ridiculously masterpiece of stupidity. The name is well chosen except for one thing: they could add a silly movie after Dead Husbands! To give 0 and half of 5.
