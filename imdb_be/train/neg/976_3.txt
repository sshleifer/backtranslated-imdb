I'm usually more willing to be open about the rum Lump than a lot, but it's just not a good attempt. Its got nothing to do with comparisons with the English original - not seen, and I doubt that I will. It has a whole lot to do with the winding plot, the lack of chemistry between the leads and godawful performance / character from his alleged male lead (Jimmy Fallon). <br /> <br /> Fallon goes to a screen that wears clothes and hairstyle 15 years and is valid for ten years younger than that. It should be a teacher, you see, and, of course, it is well known that school districts all over the world love to work less than people older than children, they mean to teach. The character is so very concerned about, and irrationally, that I have my doubts as to whether any actor, made it attractive, but the old reliables, like John Cusack or Adam Sandler might have been able to give him a chance. Nya to Fallon, who is neither funny, nor an actor, but seems to think that he is at the same time. Not once during the entire course of the film you either believe Fallon in his role, or believe that there is any way to these two people must have been to together. Toward the end of the film there is a scene where Barrymore (who was lovely, as usual, but I could not carry this alone - it is difficult to have one person romance a) Fallon says that again, too much has happened, and it moves on. And instead of feeling bad about the scene, or sorry to Fallon, you actively cheering her on - finally she is doing what she had to do a few months ago. But, of course, the mechanics of the plot will not let that be the end of it (the end that really could have made a statement of this mess), and instead we see a rational career woman throws it all away to chase it childish idiot and encourage him delirious. His, of course, meant to be tacky and fun, but it actually made me more disgust than anything else.
