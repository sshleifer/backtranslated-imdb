I've seen enough like Little Richard in an interview and performances and rather poor Leon classified in the 50's / 60's music bio photos to see what Levon was not the right actor for the role. Leon was right, as David Ruffin temptations, but can not fully capture the essence of Little Richard in the film. <br /> <br /> The actor Miguel Nunez, who played in the Little Richard "Why do fools fall in love?" was much more appropriate choice, having escaped from the musician's powerful, yet feminine persona. <br /> <br /> If unconvincing performances, the film will be as well. And that's what happened here. Ignored or missed completely LR are forays into homosexuality and voyeurism. That "Temptation" did so well in capturing the lifting group, warts and all, this film misses a wide mark. <br /> <br /> What's going on with director Robert Townsend, who started so well with "The Hollywood Shuffle"? He's talented, funny guy, but did not bring anything close to this first attempt.
