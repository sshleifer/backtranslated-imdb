Pet Sematary, although a good 80-horror film with a good director and atmosphere, is a copy of the Italian film Zeder by Pupi Avati. It is clear that Stephen King rewrote almost all the ideas of this director (film Zeder was made before the King wrote a book) <br /> <br /> cat, earth, everything has been copied, it is a case of plagiarism, but being known Steven Kind American writer, it is quite normal that he can get away with this, it's obviously because of the huge difference between this kind of Italian films without -budget (and in part, that in itself is crap ...), but the original idea, I repeat, this Italian director Avati <br /> <br /> Let the world know,
