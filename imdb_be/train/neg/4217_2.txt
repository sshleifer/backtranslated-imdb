It has recently been on the bright classic films AMC, and I had to laugh. I had high hopes for this adventure, which stands in the spirit of "Voyage to the core of the Earth" and "The Mysterious Island". I was very disappointed not only in the existing credentials, and a stupid story line that reads from the five-year comics. Be sure to see the wires that hold the wings Pterdactyl, when they grasp "Ogarev" half idiot advance modern man, who befriends the lost adventurers. The ending is left open for further rehashing the same effects in the "people who have forgotten time." Do not waste your time.
