It was a cute movie for the final. The ending was just a vile effort to emasculate men's and women's empowerment at their expense. She refused to listen to reason and logic and use it a passive / aggressive nature to control and impose their will on the guy who ultimately lost its power and control over to her. It is no coincidence that it sits behind the wheel of the driver in the car when they drove off in the end, after he had to ask her and beg her to take him back. This film is a victory for all women who think they should be responsible for all male and in control of their relationship with them. It was a vile film for this reason.
