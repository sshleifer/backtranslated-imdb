I usually read reviews before I watch the movie. Guess what I did not do that before watching the TLB, and I must say I was very surprised to see above-average rating on IMDb. I found it to be a complete lack of history. You just dropped in it (and, unfortunately, not as Saving Private Ryan dropped us off in the movie), and also has an abrupt end, which was very satisfactory to me. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me, especially with low budget in mind. But get ready to laugh ... Some guys are now planted in the air after the explosion, as if they were Olympic gymnasts. In mid-air spin or tumble during the First World War, it was too much for me, especially if it's done countless times throughout the film ... <br /> <br /> But the parts that actually made me laugh, until I almost cried were the scene containing the melee. Shouting and screaming German voices ... incredibly funny. It seems as if they are saying the same actor / voice performers, because they all sound exactly the same, and it sounds like a "typical" German voice. <br /> <br /> I absolutely do not recommend this movie to anyone but people who just want to have some laughs out of the boring and banal quality.
