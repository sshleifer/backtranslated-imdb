"Show me your boobies!" Do not be ridiculous, and certainly not on the channel, which shows cartoons, if you know where I'm going with. I do not want my 6 and 7 years old daughter to think like this or heard it. I find it sad that Nick swollen shit that much, then this is what we get, stupid little kids act as stupid adults. I know what it meant to be humorous, but we believe there's a sweet little innocent girls in K and 1st grade, who can not wait to see it. I had to comment on how I was disappointed when I saw him. My daughter will not look. I would like to block Nick, but not the heart at this moment, but if Nick continues to put out this kind of crap I have to.
