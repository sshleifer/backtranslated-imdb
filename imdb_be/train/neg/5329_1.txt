As a true Elvis fan, this movie is a complete embarrasment and a disaster scenario. The film begins with a wonderful son «Stay Away» and scenery of the Grand Canyon gives the viewer hope for something special. Elvis gets in the picture, and his talent wasted a great time, especially on the rest of the major songs. I sat through the film twice, just to make sure that this piece of garbage !!! 1 out of 10 !!!
