As the summary you just did the most ignorant comment I have ever heard in the RPG. You seriously thought they were gay? Are you retarded? If you went to go save his best friend, and someone decides at its mercy, to help you, you are in serious debt to this man. Lavitz was a good man, and every time they helped each other, which makes them closer as friends. They were not funny lovers, as your whine about. And let you know that the game is set in the medieval period. Then the women really only cook the food while the men were at war. Do you even know her story? You know how long it took for women to be accepted in the army now? This game contains a lot of realism, even if your too damn slow, apparently to catch it, and you really need to spit some hard evidence instead of ignorant assumptions based misinform their act, to interpret the story.
