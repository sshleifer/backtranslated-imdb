I love movies. I love independent efforts and major studio productions. I like films with stars, and I love this difference is unknown. I love drama, comedy, action, adventure, science fiction, mysteries, westerns, any genre, but horror. I love foreign films, as well as those in English. I love good movies and I even like the bad, because almost none of the film would never be able to please or entertain on some level. Except for "Even Cowgirls get bored." <br /> <br /> When I attended a late night show «Cowgirls," I joined the audience of about 10. Less than half of it, I was left alone. Soon, even I could not bear disturbing mess that is unfolding before my eyes, and I left as well. On this day, «Cowgirls» can only film I ever walked out of. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to describe this awkward, empty, bad, pointless film, or as adequately convey his lack of sacrificial value. Suffice it to say that it is one of the worst films of all time top, ridiculous and inexcusable at every level. He's trying to be clever, but his concept of feminism, it seems hopelessly anachronistic. He's trying to be funny, but the humor is crude and crawl worthy. This is one of the few films that manage to defile his ideal, drawing the characters in such a confused way, that you rebel against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, watch «Waterworld», «Ishtar" anything but that. for a new, except for "Alexander." If you choose between that and this, read a book instead.
