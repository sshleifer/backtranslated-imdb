I begin this review with a big giant spoiler about the movie. Do not read further ... here it is, turn away! The main character, a girl who always survives in other horror films, are killed. There, I just saved you 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> This is one of those cheap movies that are thrown together in the middle of the chopper era of the 80s. Despite the murder of the heroine away, it's just a low-quality junk. <br /> <br /> And the priests and the students get a bad rap here. They are depicted as hypersexuality, sociopathic morons who have too many internal problems to deal with what looks like a junior college campus life and students ... come off worse. <br /> <br /> Â«Splatter University" just trash put in the machine if you do not have anything better, although I suggest watch your head cleaner tape, it would be more interesting. <br /> <br /> This is the ranking (R) for a strong physical violence, gore, profanity, very short female nudity and sexual references. <br /> <br />
