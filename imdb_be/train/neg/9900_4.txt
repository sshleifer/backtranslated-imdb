I believe that any novel, it's such a big downer as Moby Dick would not have found much favor with Depression-era audiences who have had enough of their own problems. But any resemblance to the classic Herman Melville novel is a pure coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact, half of the film is a prequel to the main story, as we know, is not that too much of the film was kept. We met for the first time Ahab Creely (he got a name and a brother) as a relaxing shower with two legs and intention to marry Joan Bennett, who is the daughter of his father's grave in. This brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes also wants to marry Bennett. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore Ahab in excessive peak performance. Barrymore is not quite mastered the sound of the movie, and he gave all of the mute theatrical stage plus voice that shook the rafters to any theater, the film played. <br /> <br /> We see Ahab lost his leg a large whale Moby Dick, and I must say that the amputation scene was pretty terrible. Of course, this was before the Code. Nevertheless, I am sure that in 1930 the audience started. <br /> <br /> After that the story of Ahab's whale hunt, that he thinks he made it unattractive in the eyes of Joan Bennett. It's not quite the motivation Melville, in fact there are no female characters Moby Dick, he wrote. <br /> <br /> One of the things that Melville did was invest crew of Ahab's Pequod persons. Other than Kvikek cannibal harpooner name is, but not the individual. Starbuck and Stubbs can also be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I see this version of Moby Dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else.
