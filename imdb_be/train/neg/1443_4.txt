Start with a good bit: some times Swayze says Zulu with their friends, or that language is heard among the nations. It's not a big plus, as is usually the US and UK audiences a movie I think that all people on this planet speak English (only if you are one of them: no, they do not do) <br /> <br /> However, the acting. «Tenenkrommend», as we say in the Netherlands (this makes your toes curl, and not in a good way). Like Swayze, but in this he is terrible. The muscles in his jaw do overtime, and he frowns entire movie -Some one must have told him that it looks like a butcher. A lot of Patrick: it looks silly and compensation for the lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) has selected the style of acting, which is not consistent with the style of its employees. Her acting is so relaxed that this film could be set in the current days. And it is not so. Your dress was prompt, Alison. <br /> <br /> best acting came from people from the African continent and other Onyulo, like Umbopa I liked best. Clearly, warmth and character, his performance a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Overall: it mwah-entertainment for a rainy day. Sorry. It could be better. Dismiss the director.
