First things first: I am not a conservative. And although I would never refer to themselves as a liberal or a Democrat, I was against the war in Iraq from the very first day. I think it's safe to say, John Cusack, and I would probably see about politics alone, in fact, I am sure that we are drinking buddies if we ever talked about how great Adam Curtis BBC documents there. My point is not to discredit this review, thinking that I am not a part of the choir preaching Cusack in War, Inc. There's no doubt Veit policy specially adapted to appeal to my demographic, but the problem is, low-quality tailoring and Cusack movie co-writer, producer and star in, fit worse than a cheap suit. <br /> <br /> As the saying goes, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." Cusack, his co-authors, directed by Joshua Seftel and even actors who are involved, no doubt, had every intention to make an anti-war film did not bite and funny as M * a Robert Altman * S * H, unfortunately, to the viewer, they eventually one as unfunny and unreasonable as Michael Moore Canadian Bacon. <br /> <br /> Now the state of American politics, foreign policy and the war "effort" is already absurd and, as a consequence, tragic, miserable, and unfortunately, comic -. just watch The Daily Show and see for yourself The key is you can not write stuff as funny as what the Bush administration gives us on a daily basis, so why try to compete <br /> <br /> the main problem with the WI is that he feels that it was ? put together in a hurry. to do this, Cusack mostly disassembled Grosse Pointe Blank (one of his best films), change in settings and killed in the shopping list of ideas raised by the collected works of Naomi Klein. Most of these ideas rammed down your throat in the first twenty minutes of the film, and what makes them so bad none of jokes or gags or intentionally obvious links to Halliburton, the neo-conservatives and the American occupation Iraq, are imaginative, clever or funny. the authors are so blinded? s own dogma, they felt that a reference to these questions, the film is funny and subversive. The trouble is ... it is not. To date, these ideas are yesterday's news, and if you have been living under a rock or are so blinded by ignorance, denial and apparent stupidity (read: right wing Christian). These jokes are insulting just <br /> <br /> Perhaps, WI will work, if it was more subtle, subversive, offensive and fattened up with detailed research / penetration into the occupation. As it is, the jokes and gags all surfaces and is so bad, so little grace, sophistication or satirical evil, they are little more than make me moan. Homer Simpson once said, "It's funny because it's true" and The Daily Show proves it every night; War, Inc., however, proves that just because it's true does not make it funny. The bottom line: the hyperbole is not required when it comes to lampooning US / Neo-conservative policy ... this is a big enough joke <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/.
