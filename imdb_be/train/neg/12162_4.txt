It's not fear, because the first part was: this ( "campy") light and humorous entertainment. Like many sequels, the action starts right away without any explanation. But there are boobs, so I'm not complaining. And the real boobs, that is. If I understand correctly, these are rare among teenage girls in the US of A. That brings to my mind, the fact that the main actress is "Sister Bruce" Pamela Springsteen. <br /> <br /> It can not be thought without the first film, so I compare it with him. Again, there is too little clothing (mainly trousers) and a funny hair, it is not difficult to say that this film is made in ten years. Again, there is a really strange symbols, this time even more visibly "pathological" ones. Particularly the camp staff. It's like a mental rehabilitation summer camp. People over: Most of the actors should be at least 25, but I think that they must be 16 or something. Some of the "methods" used Dyck Evil is very unpleasant. In fact, this film does not have a lot in common with the first part, and it is worse than in all respects.
