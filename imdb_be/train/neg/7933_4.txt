I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, but this film is bad. All this is canned, fake, sound feel to it, with really awful rear projection screen. He has a good idea of ​​what the plot screenwriter successfully buried in worthlessness script, which makes it impossible for the audience to dive into the action and truly care about any of the characters. The guide is a pedestrian, and only emphasizes how bad the script rather than to help improve it. I have seen many a thoroughly enjoyable "production SoundStage» before, but this is not one of them. All this makes you a rough estimate the Scott / Boetticher movies more. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott tanned, taut and shiny, that million-dollar smile throughout. He's always fun ... even in the worst of his films. In addition to Scott, the other main reason I wanted to make this film was because of how much I enjoyed Wymore Mrs. Errol Flynn in the film, «Rocky Mountian». In "Men of a gun," she is just as beautiful, and you can tell that she is a good actress, but she was forced to say some pretty stupid lines, and blocking it was given to the director was really awful. I just saw Phil Carey in "Operation Pacific" and it plays exactly the same character is ... arrogant pain in the butt, you want to win in a swoon. I believe that this proves that he is a good actor ... he made me hate him. There are some unsuccessful attempts comic that only detract from the film, in my opinion. Although there are many elements to knock, I must say that I found that to truly enjoy the two Spanish songs sung in the musical numbers ... but it's not something we're going to see Randolph Scott movie, though ? <br /> <br /> there are definitely worse than Scott's films there, and this one is certainly not unbearable, but also, of course, can not be anything but ordinary.
