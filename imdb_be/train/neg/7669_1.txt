This film is a success is one of the most unique films that you have seen. However, this comes from the fact that you can not make heads or tails of this mess. It seems almost like a series of problems created, to determine whether you're really ready to get out of the film and give up the money you just paid. If you do not want to feel wronged you sit through that awful film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, all of them have seen better days, but then realize that they are actually paid quite a bit of money to do it, and you you will lose compassion for him as well as you have done for the film. I can not go on enough about this terrible film, it is almost something that Ed Wood would have done in this case, of course, would have been his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> To start, you have to sit through a dialogue, the like of which you've never seen / heard this thing should be five minutes long. In addition, she is told to assume that your audience can not read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and a barrage of terrible lines are realized, it is as if he is working solely to the risks to the slogan of the film poster. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, I usually use), and it is doing everything possible in order not to drown in it, but eventually it does. Then comes the final insult, Tara Reid plays the role of the intellectual, for help! Tara Reid is not very talented actress and somehow she always gets a role in a movie, in my opinion, although it must adhere to the american pie movies. <br /> <br /> In general, you just can see this for yourself when it comes out on video, I know that I got a kick out of this, I mean lets all be honest, sometimes it's comforting to revel in the shortcomings of others.
