It was one of the worst I've seen WrestleMania years. He just did not stand out at all, actually. Map wise, I thought it would be very good, but every game just did not seem to hold out. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit vs. MVP One of the best matches. Benoit wore it. I just do not think that MVP was so great, but Benoit saved this match. <br /> <br /> Kane vs. Khali Wow, these two guys are not mixed. Or maybe it's Hali and any other living person do not mix. A terrible game. <br /> <br /> Melina vs. Ashley I am not a supporter of women's wrestling. <br /> <br /> ECW Originals vs. New Breed I was excited about this game until I saw him, in fact, really disappointing. <br /> <br /> Edge vs. CM Punk vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Finlay vs. Randy Orton match MITB Absolutely the worst so far. Only major let down, for many people in the ring, at the same time. He just did not live up to. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley vs. Umaga approaches are not very impressive, but not the worst night. <br /> <br /> Batista vs. undertaker This was perhaps the best match of the night. Very, very, very nice to see something good for a change. <br /> <br /> John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels I really feel that this game deserves to be the last. People make a case for Batista vs. undertaker, but this match was just as well. I'm starting to get tired of seeing Cena to win every game, though. It gets a little old. Now, I must say that I feel this is the best match of the night, but I'm a big fan of Shawn Michaels, so I'm a little biased. Batista vs. Â«Taker, it might be better, but I'm biased, so ... sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best match of the night, and almost everything else really came up short.
