I have not seen the first two - only this one, which is called Primal Species in England. I do not think I will bother to look at them yet. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible movie. Terrible acts of bad dialogue, cheap rubber monsters. Everything about this so disgusting. The most sympathetic characters die very quickly and leave you with annoying those, especially one called Polchak, which is an incredible jerk. No-one like that would survive 5 minutes in the army. He went on for centuries, but I was glad when he finally got his head got chewed off - I have nightmares, he's going to survive. The colonel was rubbish too - all surly and ignorant angry cry. And Specky doctor looked and acted as if they were from the porn. I waited for her to take her glasses, shake your hair and turn into a vampire, but she did not. It is a pity that, as it would be revived before the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Do not Roger Corman used to make a half decent movie once?
