I watched this video in the home of a friend. I'm glad I did not spend money to buy it. Videos cover a scene from the movie 1975 Capricorn One. The film begins with a few clips missile bloated, most of them are not connected with the manned flight. hot gun Sibrel is short video clip astronauts preparing a video stream. He edits his own voice-over rather than to allow us to listen to what the crew had to say. Video curiously ends show the Zapruder film. His statement about the radiation shielding, star photos, and other lead me to believe he is a very undeveloped and has some selfish against NASA, astronauts, or Americans in general. His science is bad and so is the video.
