The terrible death scenes to guns that fire without sound character called Fiend. This is all tiring, moving slowly, prosaic nonsense. It was good to see a guy with a cape and a hunchback lurking around. Visually, it was awful and probably takes moviegoers time, but even in 1936 one would think that it would be a little more imagination and credibility that even a film like this. I'm just waiting for something to happen any value, as people stood around speeches and act as they pose in the office picnic. And then there are the bullets, as mentioned previous commentator. Perhaps the best clue to would look for a place on the water than a pants pocket.
