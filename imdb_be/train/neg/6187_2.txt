It was in short a terrible disappointment. Until now, the worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. Dialogue was terribly awkward; I do not feel any sense of the words pronounced. The lines were delivered too quickly and felt rather out of place. They could have just been named statues. The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York was non-existent and watch American Rochester felt strange. He could have at least tried to do a British accent. I like George C. Scott, as an actor, but it just does not work. I felt like I was watching highlights from Jane Eyre, where the main part of the story were randomly put together, without paying attention to the flow of history. Decorations and music were all very well, but I felt none of the passion and love that should be between Jane and Rochester and the film left me completely indifferent. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good version of Jane Eyre I suggest you look at the 1983 BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or 1997 version with Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now these two brilliant adaptation.
