Many of the stories or the same as that in Sierra Leone, the other part felt like any other movie, I do not know what, but it is a familiar feeling throughout the film. It was kind of nice to look at, but it would be great! when the story would have been more original. The theme of a little girl, a bad assassin of Leon, just a little altered. The initial stage is very good :-) It is strange that people love to fight in the kitchen, in a movie :-) My biggest problem is to remember which parts were from Leon, Nikita, and if they are where the French or the American version, If you have not seen Leon, it's a good movie. If you liked this film, I can recommend Leon. <br /> <br /> Regards / Rick
