This is another depressing and sad film about AIDS and tragedy. It starts very smoothly and predictably, and continues throughout the film. I kept waiting, it's pick-up, but unfortunately, he never did. But to do justly, but the script needs a lot of work. And if you are looking for nudity, do not waste your time with this not very hot actors. Because of the poor audio quality and the absence of a signature, I missed 1/8 of the film. If you've never seen more than five gay movies, or have recently come to terms with being gay, you can find this film interesting, anyway this is your ordinary low-budget film. He is considered one of the worst gay films I've ever seen.
