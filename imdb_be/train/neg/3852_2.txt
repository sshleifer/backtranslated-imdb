It was one of the saddest movies I've ever seen ?? I do not know why ?? All your mediocre story about a guy who is going to get married, and start a fantasy someone else instead. The story has been told a thousand times. Nothing new or innovative about it at all. Or not <br /> <br /> I do not know that with this film. Most of the time, when these kinds of actors / actresses come together to make a film that has already done a million times before, it's really interesting. There is usually little clever things in them that are not actually in any other. For some reason, this one just does not hold your attention. You can choose some funny parts, or clever ideas in it, but for some reason, they're just not funny or clever way ?? I wish I new how to explain it, but I do not ?? Just do not waste your time on this ??
