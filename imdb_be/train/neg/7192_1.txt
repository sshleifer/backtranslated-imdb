5 minutes in this film, I was hyperventilating, shaking and writhing in pain. And not in a good way. The story of the corpse stupid children making prank phone calls on a psycho, which is always a good idea. It turns out, not like crazy prank phone calls, because in 2 minutes, he kills their doors Williams poor mom and dad. Well, skip forward 15 years and I think that? Nevertheless prank phone calling people. Yes, you would have thought that a terrible murder would scare them to do something again, but no. Thus, after about two hours later, i too much Crick ripped, I realized that this film gave me nothing but horrible taste in my mouth and a heavy desire to take his own life. This piece of shit is not even worth laughing at poor production, "action", or Rutger haurs depleted career. I love bad horror movies, but this is the most unsatisfactory part I've ever seen. Just no.
