I believe that if you want endless dialogue that does not forward the story and ostentatious camera effects such as scene transitions in the TV show _Angel_, you will enjoy the movie. Me? All I wanted was a nice, tight little story, and he was not there. Walk almost back story were buried under the sea unnecessary dialogue, and there was absolutely no sense of fear or stress or anything. <br /> <br /> Is it trash? Is this a Wendigo? No, this is a cameraman at speed. It's not scary. It does not create a single note, or an atmosphere of tension, if you are not afraid of MTV. Like those reviewers to me, I also noticed that before the end of the film is an ironic laughter in the audience. <br /> <br /> The Last Movie.
