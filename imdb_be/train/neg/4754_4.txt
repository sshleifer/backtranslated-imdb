I loved the original. It was great, and always will be. Oddly enough, though, I'm really looking forward to see the remake. I'm usually a bit against repeat grades because it is too much, but for some reason it intrigued me. I really enjoy it, to begin with. Caine brilliant, as usual, and Jude Law, managing to keep the characteristic beside him. It was pretty smart as it has been modernized and worked. What stops it from, it is really good the last seven minutes. He goes all the way from the original, so far that it ceases to be reasonable and just boring. The end of the original was fantastic! So much tension has been built, and it was incredibly reasonable! This? It grows not in suspense, but in desperation as it seemed, that they decided to make the character of Cain gay. It was when they were trying to hard to be far different. And then ... bam! The law is dead. Roll credits. This movie is worth watching just for appearances, but these last seven minutes really drag it down. Sorry ....
