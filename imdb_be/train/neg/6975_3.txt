Oh God, what a stupid movie! Incredibly cheap with fake special effects (being played by a guy in a suit lame) and blunt plot.All incredibly bad dialogue, and the actors (HA! HA! HA!) ... they 're just ludicrous.For example, I never never seen so annoying character in this stuff (these stupid children or pregnant women with her husband and many others) .Vsom as a whole, it is great entertainment if you drunk.Avoid it as plague.Am I'm drunk? I do not think so ...
