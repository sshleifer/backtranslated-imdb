I saw him on the loud drum festival UCSB was * shocked *, that he had won the award the golden drums. I was not the only one taking into account the audience had mixed reactions to the piece. I thought that there were many other better flick there, but then I learned that the judges were deeply rooted in the theory of cinema and other artsy shit. While the cinematography and editing are on a par with many other shorts there, speaking history is nothing more than the average student a piece. It seems as if "serious" student films must include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle, and ultimately suicide - Nick and Kate cops, and includes all three. Please be original! <br /> <br /> Yes, and this may be my opinion of an outsider, but the guy with the Montecito sounds a bit fake. Anybody else that so?
