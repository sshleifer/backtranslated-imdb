The bad news is that still really awful. I gave it a 2 because from time to time some of these kitchy slapstick parody actually seems ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It should be better than "Mallow, Zombie Ass KickerÂ», and progress should be rewarded. Or, maybe I drank when I was watching it and feeling generous. Whatever, "2" is. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about this film is that it's more than fast enough. It takes elements from most of the key themes Kill Bill I & II, and the action scenes, cut them, dumbs them down, dirtying the dialog box, and squelching the whole mess in about an hour really terrible amateur video. <br /> <br /> you would be better to smoke a lot of that powerful, if you want to enjoy it. And get this DVD back to the video store at the time! Do you really hate yourself if you have to pay a late fee.
