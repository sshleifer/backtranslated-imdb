This is the most absurd and ridiculous thriller I've ever seen. Oh .... where to start .... <br /> <br /> The story (which is good): Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), a young billionaire with a bad heart in desperate need of a transplant. Clay was secretly engaged to his mother, PA, Samantha, played by Jessica Alba. On the night that the two secretly married, just so happens that the donor heart with the same rare blood type found. Come and find out the odds that one! Once on the operating table, Clay discovers anesthesia does not work, and he could feel everything and hear everything. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Clay is, seems to be able to filter out the razor sharp pain sharp scalpel to open his chest, just concentrating on his memories of Samantha, that we are told that he is doing through the annoying announcer who never seems stop. <br /> <br /> If you do not laugh yet, you will definitely start, if you see the surgical scene. <br /> <br /> How can a young billionaire settle for a heart transplant, performed by a single surgeon, a nurse, doctor and anesthesiologist drunk? There were more people in the room when my wisdom teeth got pulled. Not to mention the health behavior, which is very silly to be seriously ... not even the operating room sterile kept ... people are practically able to just walk in and out of the room without even washing their ... during the operation the viewer gets to hear the views of Clay, none of which are too fascinating. Ah ... but that's what it's all about ... the doctors are trying to kill him to take his money. Believing him to be unconscious, villains speak freely. Gosh! What will happen? <br /> <br /> Well ... at least, there is no interference from anyone else in the hospital, while an incompetent physician who has received four of abuse of official position lawsuits that work against him perform basic operations heart. Even Clay's not overly mother seems to be able to check its status. Only one interested in maintaining updated about Samantha ... but no ... can be sweet Sam on it .... You will quickly find out through some dialogue Scooby Doo ... <br /> <br /> in the end it was not even important whether passed or not Clay anesthesia awareness, because the end would have been the same way in both cases. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the feeling that the director / author tries to make fun of patients who are victims of anesthesia awareness, maybe there is some dumb it was interesting to be ... <br /> <br /> Enjoy by ...
