Grammar bad. <br /> <br /> The film makes a lot of noise, which is not really music, and a lot of people screaming. To make a bad film the racial stereotype. Why come every movie with a black hero has a drug addict? Why the hero must always dance to be successful? Why come to a well-known rapper should always be in the dance movie? Why get letters «s» can not be in the title? <br /> <br /> Hollywood should stop dumb down the audience and make a film that there are people with brains who know how to speak proper English. <br /> <br /> Are you certain to not go see it.
