I'm at a disadvantage here. I have not seen the first two films in the series, although I have seen a lot of Larry Cohen movies. Fans of the series seems to think it's a good movie. Judging from his own, it was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> You'll never get a good look at (Robert ZDara) face maniac cop, but what I saw was pretty grim. Death scene seems set to eat a great film, so as not to give any thrills. Maybe if I saw Cut the NC-17 director, I can be more impressed. <br /> <br /> car chase ending with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany and Robert Davi was pretty intense. the best part of the film.
