I used an avid spectator, while I personally do not spent many cold hours helping to build a house for the White family, only to be sick, to see the house in a year. All the beautiful mountain landscape gardening has been removed, a beautiful rock pavement and the front fountain were removed, all the pine and pecan tree in the front cut, a sprinkler system has been taken out. It now looks a disaster area. They do not even live there anymore ... they live "in" and get off on the weekends. It sickens me to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma are donated to these people and see the result. The story that we've all seen on television is not quite true ... I do not believe everything you see and hear.
