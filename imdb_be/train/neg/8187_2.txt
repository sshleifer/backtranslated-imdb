I went into this movie expecting it to be really god-awful. And it was. I really felt sorry for the star building Welded Kathy Bates was a great actress ... before she did this film, Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti was disappointing, as usual, but Miranda Richardson could not put in one of the fabulous performances and I know He loves her. Fred's father, played by Trevor Peacock (Vicar of Dibley fame, among others), was about the same line. <br /> <br /> The plot was predictable and everywhere, and humor ... no. (However, there is one part of the movie where Santa enters the house of a Jewish family ... that made me laugh because their expressions were classic) Nha see this movie, if your only other alternative is not having the full armor collision with a train (actually- perhaps the train would be better ...)
