I love books, "Jane Eyre" and saw a lot of versions. They all have their strengths and their weaknesses. However, it was one of the worst I've seen. I do not care about Jane and Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerable and certainly looked the easiest part, but she did not have any emotions, none of its lines. I could not imagine what Mr. Rochester has seen in it. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt was even less emotion than Jane, if it were possible. As two of tasteless people could fall in love is a mystery, but it certainly did not hold my attention. Maybe the director (Zeffrelli) fell asleep during production. <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton (too beautiful for Mr. Rochester!) version is a much more accurate book, but Ciar√°n Hinds plays the perfect Mr. Rochester in the 1997 version / E (not all of which is true for the book) < br /> <br /> Trying to find something positive about this film :. Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in his role.
