The script for this TV soap opera is so bad that even A. Hopkins at some point had to play as an undergraduate student-drama way to bring some life into his dead character scripts. I do not know whether the appointment of the director, but Hopkins Ciano is not carrying nothing but vanity, fear and lack of self-esteem. Real Ciano possible had it all, but then, why a film about it? Mussolini was a little more convincing, and its a long way down, as if the closer to the truth. Edda Mussolini was ridiculous (not for Sarandon, but because of the powerless scenario), while it was to be the protagonist of this supposed family drama. Watch it only if you like a Venezuelan soap opera.
