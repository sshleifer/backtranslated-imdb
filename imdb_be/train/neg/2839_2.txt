This film is one of my favorites. This is not exactly anything good, but it's great to laugh. Dialogue can be incredibly absurd and functioned poorly (eg, "Manji, can we ask you a few questions?" "Of course." "We think that you can help us with the answers.") Any fight more or less surreal. Make sure to watch the BRKI in oafy white guy that attacks the protagonist. He has only two lines, but he's one of the best guys in the movies!
