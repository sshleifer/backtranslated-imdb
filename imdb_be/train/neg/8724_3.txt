OK - Against One: Mandatory "70-alligator (all right, correction - Cayman) with an immobile limb made worse for the large-scale miniature underwater shots (full length reptile boats of comparable size) using a toy alligator that swirled around in a toy boat well-lit water - even for night shots <br /> <br /> Unlike most primitive-killing-exploiting-Western films, superstitious natives gather bits **** and start the massacre of tourists seems unnecessary at this time. Nobody abused native - exploited, yes, but far from ill-treatment. In the end, he was one of the natives (canoodling with a supermodel spoiled during a full moon taboo), which brought a curse Demon River on them, right? <br /> <br /> Holidaymakers easily irritated (with the notable exception of the markers of old soul / soft-blasphemous little-girl-who-takes-a-glitter-for-heroes that you often see in the 70-Euroflicks), but far from deserving of violent death - if only they were not your next door neighbors, mind you. A pair of really heroic to kill time - is remarkable that none of them will fill the role of sidekick. There are only two lines in the whole movie villains, so demises feel more arbitrary than a laxative. <br /> <br /> The sequence in which a giant Cayman crunches down and scarves thirty tourists for five minutes, probably will seem unintentionally. cheerful <br /> <br /> point where the locals have decided not to destroy the surviving residents of the West, and virtually saying, "hey, you're not so bad, it is a pity that fuss last night" - because they blew monster lizard - have you shaking your head like a banal music kicks in, you know, the local military dictatorship will destroy the village to **** ING with a tourist trade after the credits roll ... <br /> <. br /> Pros: Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. You all know why you're interested in this movie in the first place, is not it? I thought so. If you Completist Baha, get the DVD movie NoShame reprinted earlier this year (digitally remastered with no real extras to speak, except the director lamented the current state of the international box office). <br /> <br /> good character, being far from an idiot (always a plus in B movies) and a cynical little child provides much of the comic. <br /> <br /> worth a look, but get it cheaper!
