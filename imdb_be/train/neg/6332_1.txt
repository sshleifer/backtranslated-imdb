I looked forward to see this movie when it came out, because I was a huge fan of SNL. When my friend and I went to see it, people coming out of the show started screaming, "Do not waste your money!" But, of course, we had to find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> While there were a few funny bits (Laser Bra 2000, Root Boy Slim), the majority of them felt that this could seriously edited down to 1:00 funny show. It was very bad. <br /> <br /> If an opera singer came to a lot of people got up and left. It made me laugh, because I realized that people O'Donoghue simply pressing a button on the goal with this film. Or whether it was just crazy. Whatever - you do not need to waste your time watching it, it's so bad.
