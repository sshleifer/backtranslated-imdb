I am surprised that many of the women voters, who even give the film score higher. My opinion about this film was the fact that the target audience of adults and men. Whipped and tortured women, ruthless revenge and a high amount of body typical ingredients introduced into the history of cinema subgenre of spaghetti. Opening and manual breaking Django is a rip-off. The shooter, but lacks style, for example, DJANGO. Score, acting and cinematography are mediocre at best, but if you look at the ingredients listed above, you are in the right place here. And the actors do not have an Italian accent. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
