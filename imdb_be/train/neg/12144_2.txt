Although nothing can compare with the vampires Vs. Zombies ... I'll try to tell this movie in every area of ​​filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the special effects are breathtaking. When there was an explosion on the TV screen I thought my whole house will explode, and when automatic machine guns were fired, I thought that the shells landed on the floor beside me. Simply amazing my friends. <br /> <br /> But the scene when Jack Black sound-a-like monologue gives the worst I have ever heard, I almost killed myself, but do not worry, because he got burned in the film, he can transfer his terrible acting out to "I must be high." Seriously, he has seen himself mindlessly chatting about non-congruent thoughts that have absolutely no meaning and only added that it must be "high" to justify its terrible effects. Well, if you can say that's just awful acting when you were talking to the writers, directors, executive producers, sponsors, you will probably get the same answer ... seriously. <br /> <br /> With a production team called "shock-o-Rama» I was in shock, I have no bleed in my mouth, and ended his life after this terrible shockingly basis for the movie has been played. <br / > <br /> If you want to see this movie, you should be killed <br /> <br /> Regards, <br /> <br /> General
