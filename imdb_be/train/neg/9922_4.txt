Growing up, Joe Strummer was my hero, but even I was cold this film. For better and worse, Unwritten future is not just "For MusicÂ» in a documentary style. Rather, it is a biographical feature film, is full interviews, performance footage, home movies, and basically meaningless animation sketches raised with "Animal." The film is coherent, but about half an hour long. <br /> <br /> The format of the fires, referring to the idea, in fact, is very annoying in the performance. Firstly, without a name, it is difficult to even know who half of these respondents. Second, who really needs to hear people such as Bono, Johnny Depp and John Cusack butt licking mouth praises of the man? They are not related to Strummer lives and their views do not add anything to its history. <br /> <br /> This pattern is at it's best, if Strummer, by recording interviews and conversations, touches the edge of his life, most people do not know about: the suicide of his elder brother, coming to terms with the death of their parents, the joy paternity. For me it was the most moving, because it showed Joe Strummer no longer as a punk icon we all know and love, but as an ordinary person who has had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life, we all have to face. <br /> <br /> There have been a better, more simple documentaries on Strummer and The Clash. (Tells MTV documentary Westway, VH1 Legends and Kurt Loder from the early 90's comes to mind.) Joe Strummer: The Future is Unwritten only bison.
