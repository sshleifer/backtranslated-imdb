The family moved to an old house in Japan. But there is a catch that's haunted (BOO !!!). Oh, I do not want you to jump. This is only a check-up. Settle back down. Um, now in any case, it is visited by an old samurai who killed his wife & her lover in slow motion. This naturally makes the scene 3 minutes stretch to about 7 or 8. Horrid action. A terrible story. But how bad can it be, you ask? Well, it was so bad, my mind began to melt and flow through my nose drips thoughtful. It was so bad, when Doug McClure came on the screen, I prayed that I had the memory of the small Wonder (Yes, I know, Dougie was in the "Out of this world" and not "a small miracle", but it's pretty much the same features show, and I can sing, "a small miracle" theme better) There are movies that are so bad they're good. this is not one of those, <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Beyond <br /> <br /> My rating: F- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Mako Hattori gets topless Susan George gets 2 love scenes (one nude, topless once) <br /> <br />
