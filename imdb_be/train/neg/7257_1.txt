I expected that the musical B-Movie French. In the end, Dhéry, Blanche, DeFunès superstars were low-budget French films of the time. And it's in color! But I have hallucinations in this incredible one o'clock 30 pure mediocrity. Musical numbers are terrible, and the comedy is absolutely boring and stupid. And the songs? What songs? It's just a bad sequence of numbers, one after the other. Only a very rare thing that the thing is the nakedness of women. He did not know at the time. In fact, some of the rooms are only there to show us the naked woman. This adds to the mediocrity! And try to find a young Michel Serres, the future great actor of French cinema, in a cameo role as a musician, in his first film. Good luck!
