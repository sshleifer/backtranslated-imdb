For example, Southern Star has a pretty catchy name melodies performed by this heavy set of singer Matt Monro. That pretty much set the tone for this bloated and rather lackluster features, fucking with George Segal miscast and Ursula Andress as the adventurous couple in search of a large diamond. Add to Harry Andrews (with a strange accent, no less) chasing the ostrich, tons of footage of wild animals, and poorly composed and faded photos with Raoul Coutard, and you end up with a thoroughly uninteresting romp through the jungle of Senegal.
