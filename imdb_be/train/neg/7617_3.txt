This is one I've ever seen the worst films, but Hostel, certainly much more worse. This film is more ridiculous and absurd than frightening. I was laughing most of the time, when I watched it. Low quality effects (unless you are going to watch it, you will understand what I mean, and how low the quality is that), bad actors (I've heard about them for the first time), and it seems that this is a blow amateur camcorder (so it's more like a TV show than a movie). But at least I had the patience to see it through. As a comedy? Careful. Would you like horror movies? Go Ju-On Watch :. Dissatisfaction or any other good horror <br /> <br /> When I'm talking about The Legend of Diab, I do not even know if I can take it to the Horror genre. Just some low-budget crap. <br /> <br /> I rate this 3 out of 10
