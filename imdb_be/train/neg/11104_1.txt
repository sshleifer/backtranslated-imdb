I'm not one of those people who simply go online after I see a movie, and decided to call it the worst film ever made. If you doubt me, please take a look at my other reviews. However, for the first time ever, I saw a movie so bad that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even more. <br /> <br /> I love bad films. For me, Ed Wood genius, I thought, Bloody Murder, Jeepers Creepers, and the most horrible horror movies were good. However, this is not the only good thing I can say about this film. <br /> <br /> The plot basically does not exist. If someone reads my review spending their money to see that they can distinguish themselves for what could be the story, but I advise you that nickel is worth more than watching this film. <br /> <br /> special effects are bad. <br /> <br /> bad actions. <br /> <br /> two wires are attractive, but it's all there. <br /> <br /> I'm not the type to spoil the movie for everyone, but I INVITE anyone email me at foxbarking@yahoo.com ask my opinion about this film before they spend a dime on him. I'll tell you something. <br /> <br /> I love bad films and I love horror, and I love the new inventive films. I even love the horror porn stuff like Hostel (which some reviewers claimed it was like, but obviously, they only thought so cause Roger Bart in this Hostel and 2). But it may be the number one most worthless and stupid, moron movie ever made. <br /> <br /> And, before you ignore this review, this is coming from someone who not only sat through the premiere of House of the Dead, but actually bought a copy.
