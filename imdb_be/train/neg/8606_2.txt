I love Insect killer movies are great fun to watch, I had to watch this film, as it was one of my favorite horror books by Shaun Hutson. <br /> <br /> I met him, and I wish I was listening to him how this movie was terrible, he said, after he said that I'm still dying to see how bad it was <br /> <br /> plot :. People are dying mysteriously and disgusting, and no one has the slightest idea what the reason. <br /> <br /> Only health worker Mike Brady has a possible solution, but his theory of killer snails is laughed at by the authorities. /> It is only when the body begins countdown <br /> <br up and snail expert from England starts snooping around is starting to look like Mike had the right idea after all. <br /> <br /> This film, like most replays you ever see the movie! The bullets in this movie quickly (if normal), and it looks like they are fast forwarding scene! <br /> <br /> This film has nothing to do with the book at all, the book was ten times worse, ten times bloody and has a lot more history of it! <br /> <br /> I do not like this movie at all! Since I am a big fan of the books and Slugs second book called breeding ground! Both books are great <br /> <br /> Read the book and then watch the movie, you might prefer that I lost 2 of 10
