(AKA: TRINITY STILL MY NAME) This sequel looks like it was done to benefit from the great European box-office success of They Call Me Trinity, only this time, Joseph E. Levine and Avco-Embassy wanted to make a picture on it America too. It is a pity that they are not very far away, as they were Hill / Spencer photos only had a little success here in the US, and this is largely a sad stretched film does not help him any. <br /> <br /> Trinity and Bambino swear by his dying father (Harry Carey Jr.), they will become successful criminals and care for each other. Later, they get involved with arms-dealers who smuggle weapons from the monastery, and who mistakenly believe that they are a pair of federal agents. All wind fall flat, despite a couple of funny scenes, especially one where the Trinity and Bambino are unusual French restaurant and did not know how to behave. A scene with sharks cards were slightly humorous as well. <br /> <br /> called the opening of the music played by Gene Roman is like a fair Bobby Goldsboro-how in the early '70s pop song, while the music signals permeate the film are pretty good. Not sure if I would buy this CD soundtrack, but some others may. <br /> <br /> The film could have half an hour tormented him, and he would not have lasted so long, it looks like a lot of time chewing the scenery here. In fact, I lost interest in it about 2 / 3rds the way through. The DVD also terrible, with a constant hum in the soundtrack and poor print quality, which looks like it should have been sent in this great pile of scrap metal in the sky. <br /> <br /> A big step down from the previous film. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
