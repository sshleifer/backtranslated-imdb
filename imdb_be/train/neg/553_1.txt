After looking forward to the end, I must say that I wish I would not have joined a series in the first place. The final episode was all against the previous seven years. He blew it. The journey was 23 years old, but the captain Zheynuey has the right to reduce it ... let's say, seven years only. Why seven? Why not just one? Or anything? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crewmemebers all died on the way. Why does she want to retain only seven of the nine? The rest do not count, or what? The funny thing is, when a part of the crew says that getting the house is not really the most important thing for them. As they say, "the journey is more important than the destination." Incredible. And in the final scene is surrounded by other courts of the Federation and the Earth is in sight. Nothing about the landing, returning to normal life. <br /> <br /> The worst final ever.
