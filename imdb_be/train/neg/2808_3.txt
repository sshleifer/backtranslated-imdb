Throw 1980s TV movie and television series guest stars (Misty His Pamela Hemsley, Cleavon Little, Seymour Cassel among several others) in the history of photography, which is my dream about the murder of their models. Of course, models and other people are starting to turn the dead causing a variety of complications. <br /> <br /> For not done a very good thriller enough nudity and violence in order to get the rating R, but not good enough material to generate any real interest. It is best described as a kind of film that gave the cable channel Cinemax alternative name Skinamax. I really do not see the sense to watch it if you do not see every running thriller there. (I also have to comment that this film is filled with smoking, to ensure that it becomes funny when someone lights up)
