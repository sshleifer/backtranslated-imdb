Which is a fantastic premise: A film about the Berlin Airlift. He must have it all. Tragedy. Exciting. Company. Opponents. Berliner Frauleins and tight US pilots. love and tears. The fact that we have, this is a film with any of the above. Hein Ferch trying to impersonate John Wayne or so, but he fails miserably. He acts as wood, that at any moment he must crack. He's trying to play the tough guy, instead of being a tough guy! Why character Bettina Zimmermann fall in love with him? Because they were throwing stones in a lake? Because he brings her a coal brick? SFX is very, very well done. Too much, though. Hundreds of whether the aircraft over Berlin, look like an attack fighter squadron, a formation, not organized transfer ?? as it was in reality. It is interesting to note that the White House, the Kremlin, and General Lucius D. Clay's office, everything seems to be one and the same set of dark and dusty. Pay attention to the same curtains hanging in the back window, like a protective shield against the fallout. Why is almost every scene inside a dark and dusty? By the way, General Lucius D. Clay, comes across as a little time, unsecured, loose general who creates the trust in your noble idea airlift. He was a very contrary. So you combine all these individual errors and the result is a film with the building side is not passion, not uncertainty and no historical accuracy. Sadly, he began so promisingly ??
