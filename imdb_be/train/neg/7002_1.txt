I saw this film, and the second. Trinity is my name, and I think that is one worse than the first. I have no idea why they even made another film that was stupid and pointless sorry to say that I have all of them. I sat through them a few times, and it still makes me to prevent it from 5 minutes to the cinema. I like Terence Hill movies and I like Bud Spencer, but this film just drove me up the wall. If it was a different story line, or at least more of the plot and a comedy it might be funner and costs $ 5 I spent buying all the films. But you make mistakes, so I would say save your money and bye this film or any of them that go with it, trust me on this.
