I really love sex militants and fantastic sixties and because of the actress, appearing in them. They found the sexiest woman be in those films, and it does not matter if they could act (remember "Candy"?). So I was disappointed with this film because it was not enough nostalgia. History here has a European science-fiction movie called "Dragonfly", which are introduced and directed by burns. Thus, the producers decided to allow young aspiring director (Jeremy Davies), to complete the picture. They have a real beautiful woman in the film, which plays Dragonfly, but it is barely in it. The film is written and directed by Roman Coppola, which uses some of the parents use since the early days, and puts it in the script. I want the film could be a tribute to those early films. They may have a lot of cameos from actors who appeared in them. There is one actor in this film, which was popular in the sixties and John Philip right (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Jeannine and Dean Stockwell look as well. I believe that I will have to continue to wait for the director to make a good memory of films of the sixties. If any reading is, "To make it as sexy as you can!" I'll be waiting!
