It's pretty funny, I hope that many people are Muslims living around the U.S, the UK and worldwide. Religion has more than one billion followers. I was born and bread in America and my religious training and exercises, I was taught to protect their country and work to contribute to society. I am very loyal to the subscription and the teachings of my religion was emphasized through out life, to teach and prepare yourself for success through education in order to contribute back to the world. I know many Muslims from all over, and I have traveled to countries such as Pakistan..I yet to meet one person who believes that we have to hurt someone or not to accept any other religion except from people in the media ... I wonder why ... And it's sad that these extremists are the ones using the media to represent the entire religion. His religion than one billion people, and it's less than one percent, I'm sure other people of other religions, would not want to be represented by KKK, il and many others that are just a small percentage of extremists who use outdated and not literally quotes from reputable books in order to pursue their own revenge, personal or business issues through the so-called religions
