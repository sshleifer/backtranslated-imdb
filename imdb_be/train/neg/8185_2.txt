Oh, my. I decided to go to the cinema with some friends, wanting to see one of those soft, and I'm out a disgusting, feel-good Christmas movie. The film failed. Full stop. Paul Giamatti, which I think is a good actor played his character and roll just horrible, with Vince Vaughn, who has always been a personal favorite of mine. They are trying to turn a Christmas movie at some new style. Grade bad mixed with the good, but it was not so. The first ten minutes or so, it was not too bad, but as soon as we saw Santa, it was over. It does not get any better, the rate remained the same, there was no development of character, and definitely one of the worst Christmas movies ever invented. Do not see what you're doing.
