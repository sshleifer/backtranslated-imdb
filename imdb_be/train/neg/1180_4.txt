Notorious for more than a quarter century (and often prohibited), this uncertainty has been his biggest asset, it seems. Hey, it's often better to be talked about, but not actually seen, if you can not maintain a "legend" with substance. <br /> <br /> The film played in Los Angeles a few times in recent years, and is available on video, so that the curtain is slowly rising. Although there is still much to affect the masses, it is likely to wear them than to cause a lot of real passion. for grant and protracted XXX sex scene between a pair of horses ( "Nature Documentary" Does anyone?) Except as follows for nearly an hour a dull marriage melodrama. <br /> <br /> As soon as the sex and poverty, it is non-stop sequence involving masturbation and looooooooong reminiscence to allegedly "Beauty and the Beast 'meeting, and a naked woman running around the house (no one, even its alleged protective aunt seems even think about putting clothes on her!). In the video, I think, you can fast forward through the banality, but it's really not worth the effort. Nudity does not go beyond what can be seen in something much more substantial, such as Bertolucci's The Dreamers. <br /> <br /> Try as you might find some "moral" or "symbolism" in lust, I doubt that it is worthy of whose effort. Unfortunately for LA Bethe, now you can easily see the film, fame something once "prohibited" was canceled. And the beast was tamed.
