As an ardent supporter of Kerry Grant, I've been waiting to see this movie and howl with laughter, and the AMC it as a comedy of payment. I've never been more disappointed with the film! usually the charm of Kerry and light comedy is AWOL from the whole of the film; he comes across as intense, dull, and not just himself. Mississip character is among one of the worst stereotypes I've ever seen - his accent is very exaggerated (and wrong, according to which part of the Mississippi, he argues that hails from), and every time he put the line, it a few decibels higher than any other cast member. Mississip trying to force yourself to stand out in the film as an attractive, country-bumpkin Goofball, but in the end, he manages only to divert attention from the already weak sector. Mansfield looks like a bloated obscene doll than sex kitten in Hollywood, and while it has never been known in Hollywood for her acting skills, this film screams that she never had the ability to start with. character Ray Walston was frustrating and ultimately unnatural. For four people on the shore leave, it was tamest vacation I've ever seen. I watched this nightmare until the very end, and while I will not spoil that for anyone, I will tell you that this is the most absurd you'll ever see. The film tries to rekindle patriotism and sense of duty to the fighting, but the film misses the point entirely because of its weak storyline and weak throw. Unfortunately, Kerry!
