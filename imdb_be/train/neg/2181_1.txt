I saw this film, thinking that it will be one of those old B movies that are fun to watch. I was so wrong! This movie was boring and obviously aimed at men, how to look at fat women. The story was so ridiculous and implausible, he had lost interest in the whole. It seemed that in the same genre as the Ed Wood film - bins.
