This film is one of the worst films of comedy I have ever seen. I hate these Napoleon Dynamite rip-off. Just look the truth in the eyes of the people it humor was already mastered. Do something new this time. All these new comedy simply awful. And coming out of the SNL Andy Samberg is not ready for a leading role again. I hope that he can recover from this terrible movie. And whether Arnetts character will simply bad. Hey Will, you read the script. The plot is really the worst ever written. Now you tell me if it's weird. (This film) Rod Kimble's stepfather Frank dies and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay for heart surgery since Rod plans to this huge jump to raise money for Frank. The only way that the rod can beat Frank in battle and prove his manhood. Yes, that's a movie, you tell me that we spend $ 7.00 to see that piece of crap! <br /> <br /> 3/10 awful <br /> <br /> -Adam
