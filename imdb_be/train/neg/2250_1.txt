Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) turns hall singer, Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) overnight singing star. Esther star rises while John is in decline due to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John makes a suicide-red-converible-160-MPH-crack-up-on-desert-highway thing. The best thing about this film is the music, especially the song, «Evergreen». Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can not take it seriously as a promising star, when she was already a star *. The first time she is singing in the back alley of a bar, it looks like a well-established singing star who slums at night, not as struggling unknown, who is trying to start her singing career. She too confident, too professional. Her apartment looks like a page with «Apartment Living," is not some flat benches, where the real singer struggling to live. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson handles selfish, is -control rock star role as .. . well, as a singer, who is trying to be an actor, but does not have much acting talent. The direction of a cool, slow and sad story. <br /> <br /> but the worst thing about this film is not acting or direction of chromium, or slow history. This hair! After looking at Kristofferson's and 70's hairstyles terrible Streisand 2+ Gaddi us, your eyes hurt.
