I had high expectations for this indie those scanned many big thumbs-up reviews. Then .... <br /> <br /> Here are my additional "two cents" to have written, great "lost in translation" The premise of the review:. Morgan 'stuck' in a dusty small town, where he meets the gorgeous Scarlett, who working at a local supermarket. Maybe Morgan help raise great Scarlett from her trailer trash life? <br /> <br /> realistic dialogue? NO. How about that shop at target. Firstly, Freeman looks at the interior of the target as though he went into Harrods. Then he struck a T-shirt rack confirm he had never been visited by any store other than C Carlet. Morgan is separated from any and all aspects of reality and shows how Scarlett rejoiced in his ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlett's life. <br /> <br /> One reviewer used the Scarlett and the ex-wife of the fight scene where her survival, Vehicles this case, it requires physically attack his former hubbie. Does Freeman to her defense .... Naw ... he made sure of that, and completely unable to cope with such a blunt aspect of her very real, sorry lot in life. <br /> <br /> character Freeman said the new car wash and very revealing, tight-fitting blouse is the key to a job interview, Scarlett. Another sign that Freeman ignorant. endless "talking stage" Freeman, where all aspects of reality Scarlett reduced to one stage or another, related to Freeman experience was irritable. <br /> <br /> Freeman rights, to emphasize that the young Scarlet her future ahead of her, and then conveniently ignores the brick wall it faces vis: uneducated, not the white collar skills or experience, very poor, no family support and life of low self-esteem. Scarlett finds such life lessons with Freeman as some people pay $ 100 for a T-shirt and revealing blouse could open the door instead of her lack of education and white-collar skills. Eventually Freeman Scarlet offers little more than the odd distraction with the "star" did not even pay for the gas for the Scarlet dead of night to return to her life in the same city, the name of which Freeman cares not know.
