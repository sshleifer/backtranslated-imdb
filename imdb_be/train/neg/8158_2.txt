What is the point of creating sequels that have absolutely no relation to the original film? It makes no sense. That's why Prom Night for so amazingly bad. <br /> <br /> Initially, the film led to a group of children hides a dark secret that will eventually get them all killed, bar one, in a tough act of revenge. Can someone please explain to me what a dead Prom Queen-to-be, rising from the grave steel crown should do with the first film then? Prom Night 2 have continuous plot holes, which left the audience constantly wondering how it happened and why it should happen? But in the end, I guess you could call it one of those movies that are so bad, you'll end up laughing myself through it.
