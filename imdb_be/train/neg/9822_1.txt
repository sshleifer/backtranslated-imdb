There were times during the movie I wish I was beat to death. The only reason I moved the fullness of the film, because I could not believe how bad it really was, and I thought that it should be better. It really was a horror movie. I was terrified that I was nothing, it seemed, 4 hours of my life that I will never go back. The rest of the two hours I spent in mourning over the death. Please recommend this film to anyone who you want to torture and tell them, uncertainty will kill them.
