I do not say, because the production values ​​were so low, but because it was filmed terrible. This is a shot girl washes her hair in the stream? Do we really have to sit there for a shot, and too long to watch her do it for 5 minutes in the same place? It was terrible, the lighting was just bad. You could hardly see anything, and when the characters say, you could only hear what they say. And I watch the whole movie? Of course, I have not missed by most of them, and I do not want to hear anyone say I need to see all of the first to try it. This movie was so poorly done and executed, even by the standards of independent and low-budget it's just awful. Terrible movie ... do not waste time on it if you do not want to laugh, but even then it's not because of the actors "funny" lines, it's because of how thoroughly bad production.
