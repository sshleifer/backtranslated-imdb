It was a strange kind of film on the low lives in New York and centering around the main character (the name of the title, played by Brad Pitt), who thinks he''sa Ricky Nelson musician type, except that it has no real talent, <br /> <br /> It's pretty fun to watch as blasphemy tough New York City such as a woman with a terrible accent does not enter into the picture and takes over. It ruined the film for me. It should be, Catherine Keener, who usually plays hard and debris neck women. <br /> <br /> hairstyle Pete - Pompadour exaggerated - it was interesting to see. I can imagine Johnny Depp plays the role better. One last note: it is strange to hear a film made in 1992 (except for Woody Allen) with only monaural sound.
