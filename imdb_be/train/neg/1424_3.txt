The film has a good start, which shows an interesting and powerful Shannon Lee and introduce two very simpathetic side characters through the first half. But then something happens, and the entire Shannon sudden turns into the straight edge, a second bad girl hand and the film gets lost in its own context. The second half has some charisma and full of clichés, bad acting, terrible story, and even worse coordination trick. Not to mention the terrible actors they chose for the Chechen mafia gang. <br /> <br /> «Game of Death 2" was bad and clownified Bruce, but his daughter top it makes it even more embarrassed than himself who played a double while Bruce Lee. I truly believe that it can do much better than this, and I hope that it is involved in the production better next time. <br /> <br /> If you are a hard core fan of action and do not care about the quality go ahead and see this movie. I am personally looking forward to it, but it just got very disappointed.
