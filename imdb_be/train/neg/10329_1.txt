I try to imagine a field for Dark Angel. "I think, the Matrix, I mean BladeRunner, I mean, that chick that plays a belief in angels, wearing shiny black skin - or some chick just like it, leave this one to us only -. This is a get - we will do it without any plot, dialogue, character, decent action or budget, just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather riding a big bike throbbing. Fanboys dig loud applause and hot chick in shiny black leather straddling large pulsating bike, is not it? "<br /> <br /> Flashy, shallow, dreary, stereotyped, indifferent, tedious, dull, silent, humorless, haphazard, almost competent. Live action anime without any action, or indeed any life. Only the SF Joe path Fanboy loved him, really. :(
