Within 15 minutes, my whole family rooted for character Goldie Hawn, to die, or at least for the character of Steve Martin to leave her. After 40 minutes, we excluded it. There are only a few movies of the year, we try that out so annoying that we can not even digest it long enough to establish the story. <br /> <br /> Usually, I like both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, and I remember enjoying the original Neil Simon. So I blame Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Combine the director of "What's the worst that can happen," and author of "Miss Congeniality 2", and I think that's what we ended up with.
