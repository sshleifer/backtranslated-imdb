We saw it on the shelf at your local video store, see "Coppola" in the credits, and got excited. It was the one and only time when this film raised any interest. I could never work when it was an attempt to humor the film, which was failed miserably, or attempt a serious film, which failed miserably in general, all products seemed incredibly amatuerish Sound, in particular, was absolutely awful, especially in the scenes shot in a small bar;.. Conversation was so commonplace in parts it was incredible . Very disappointing.
