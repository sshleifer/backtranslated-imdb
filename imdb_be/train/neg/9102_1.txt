I was ready to go with the original _Cruel Intentions._ He went along with the story and stayed true to the characters of one of my favorite stories. However, this film was, in my view, lousy rehash with virtually the same story line and no clear signs of choice. I honestly do not care what happened to any of them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, Sun CI) is the characters and their interactions, rather than the events themselves. I'm not clear until I read the IMDB that this film was supposed to be a prequel, the more that the name includes the number "2," I was expecting a sequel, but then decided that it should be a companion piece. Overall, I must say that this film is to be read, for me at least, like a soft porn version of Les Liasons. I was not impressed.
