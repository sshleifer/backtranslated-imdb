Bride die at the altar, and their corpses disappear. No one knows why or who, but investigative journalism (Luana the Walters) said that every bride wore a strange orchid, and it goes to interview its creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now Dr. Lorenz mad scientist with some strange habits, including sleep in coffins and injecting his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) with young brides fluid to keep her young. <br /> <br /> The disappearance of the corpse has an interesting premise and a relatively short time, that he should not be able to get boring. Unfortunately, while it starts pretty good, it really starts to pull to the point in the middle, and it becomes quite boring with its clich√©s and predictable plot. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about it, Bela Lugosi's evil magic, and performs brilliantly; Elizabeth Russell also handsome, suave, aloof and very terrible or carafe, and I was always a supporter of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters also convincing as a reporter here. <br /> <br /> It supports slightly gothic atmosphere and plenty of decent. <br /> <br /> But in general, he just did not have time to keep my interest through the whole picture, and for this I have to evaluate his bad.
