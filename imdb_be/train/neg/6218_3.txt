My thoughts about the film, 9 <br /> <br /> It was not good, is not suitable. Visually, it was great. I was pleased with the pacing, camera angles, etc. Nevertheless, the characters? Oh, kind of bland. The plot? It sucks. <br /> <br /> This film seemed more new age crap, than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and fear. Science did not draw better. This creates a monster weapon that kills everything ... but the "soul" has the right to destroy the monster and bring life? Really? <br /> <br /> This is what bites my ass a little bit, too. Here we have a CGI movie ... created with science ... and they use it to make us understand that science to destroy the world, promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least, they had to have the decency to ask one of the characters, <br /> <br /> Â«Okay, so now what?" (Or something similar). I could not hear him very well from the crowd immediately stand up and make a break for the exit. It was "good ... it was just entertaining enough to stay here for the entire film, but now let's get out of here as soon as possible!" Output Type. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where you can not think, if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the visuals and nod magical. Any thought that, "what's the point?" I'll suck you out of unbelief and make you exit sign eyes sadly. <br /> <br /> Well ... SPOILERS follow. <br /> <br /> So, basically, a scientist creates a "machine" that can generate another intelligent, robotic life. Evil people use it as a weapon. However, the scientist realizes that he too is guilty. He gave the car its own intelligence, but did not give him her heart. <br /> <br /> The car goes Skynet collective ass of humanity and erase all life on earth, finally, eliminating slow. However, the scientist was able to survive and create walking sock puppet. Each of them containing a part of the soul of the scientist. <br /> <br /> Last, # 9 awakens something about the world, not knowing. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets another like himself, # 2. <br /> <br /> Well, # 2 gets captured by the last surviving robot machines. # 9 finds more ANDS as he sets off to save # 2 <br /> <br /> They are successful. <br /> <br /> # 9 says that there is a matching hole that fits the device perfectly. He inserts it and the machine comes back to life ... Pulling # 2 soul in the process. <br /> <br /> The film then continues with the number 9 scenes, trying to save his soul-jerk compatriots. <br /> <br /> In the end they succeed and destroy the machine. They release the souls of their dead friends, who go into the cloud. Then comes the rain, and we see that life goes back to the planet. <br /> <br /> Hunh?!? <br /> <br /> It does not make any sense. Not at all. Why the hell do scientists want to split his soul in 9 homunculus? What is it done? Whether they were created to stop the car? Everything is dead! The car was dead! Why?!? <br /> <br /> Why he waited nine little creatures, in order to succeed, if it does not? Why not create a second intelligent machines, but with the "soul" to deal with the first .. at least, it would seem that it would have a real chance of success. <br /> <br /> why they have their souls sucked into the device using the machine, and then destroy the machine, and then release the soul in order to bring life back to earth? Why not just wait for power down the machine and bring life back without all the other crazy moves?
