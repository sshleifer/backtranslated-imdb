Once in a while a movie comes along Indian movies like Sholay, it changes the way the audience perceives a good movie. And den once in a while (hopefully) we have ki AAG RGV, which violates all standards and create one of their own. The standard is so low, it can never be broken. Ram Gopal Varma was able to take the melting pot of talent and create a dish so stale and can smell it from a distance. To take a classic, Sholay and kill it completely inexcusable, and I can not believe he almost called the movie RGV ki Sholay. Although Sholay was a lot of folk elements in it, the film managed to build on the site, simply by defining the characters so well that they lived forever. Aag that does take these characters and mess them up so much u'll need a contest to choose the worst. An element of realism is completely absent and the fact that the film ends is secured by a bunch of "actors" parade along the area is smaller and seemingly unrelated set of events. One star of this movie ridiculous waste of a vote. its time for RGV, to wake up to the reality of its failure and to conjure up another "other" story, which can be classified under the film.
