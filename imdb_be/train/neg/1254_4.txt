I saw and liked the original film, and expected more of a remake than <br /> <br /> GOOD :. Effects and makeup are good. No complaints about the visual points and, they are not adequate, and the performances were okay (Tim Roth was very rich, the other leaders were in order, and a handful of "support supporting actors" has done very well with very limited roles). The scenes were exciting and fun <br /> <br /> BAD :. Escape from Monkey was awful. Symbols are in a circle, and then suddenly somewhere there is a tunnel to escape in the city center. In addition, the fact that the escape route leads through the universal bedroom? <br /> <br /> The story was trimmed to include as many activities as possible. I like the scene, but the original film was more meat to it and deserves more respect. <br /> <br /> Finally, the ending was completely pointless, as shown. Not seeing the inevitable follow-up, there is no reason for this. <br /> <br />
