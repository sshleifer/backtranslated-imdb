This film is so unbearable. The main character looks like he's 35, and I saw a skinny beanpoles with more balls than this guy. The plot twists are predictable so it is not even worth looking at the factor of humor. <br /> <br /> In addition, some of the worst dialogue I've heard in 3 years, "lets go find a small animal torture." <, Br /> <br /> Uh ..... I can not even go on, do not watch this garbage heap, it was done in 8 days. <br /> <br /> One highlight of the drunk man call protagonist fag drawing. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10, unwatchable
