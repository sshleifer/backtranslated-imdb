I joined this site to see what comments people have about this absolute disaster movie. I was not involved for even seconds. The characters were one-dimensional. They threw every topic they could think of in hopes that something will follow. I would put (and hope) that everyone involved in the Masters looks embarrassed. There are some great actors here, but you would never know it. Thank God, do not destroy the career of Morgan Freeman and Judd Hirsch something or Nick Nolte and Laura Dern-ies. There was no vision, no labor of love here, just a terrible effort went wrong. By the way, I do not think that the writer never set foot in a real school.
