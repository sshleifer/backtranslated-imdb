The authors probably had no experience in the military, and probably never looked at the history books, but I still give it a cheap Made war film some credit for taking a long time need to look at the role of black soldiers during World War II. <, Br /> <br /> action confused and unbelievable - every episode of the battle! It has the best performance of the production, but the cast is interesting. Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer costs a dollar I paid for it. Art Direction fifth course - men wear a Korean form of war, and it was pretty lousy weather until the US Army reached Germany in 1944 and not sunny as they are shown here, and I do not think that the area resembled Northern California the script does not make clear why the black support troops used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows some of the men who carried rifles instead Springfield M-1s, which forces the second course, likely to have been fired from. <br /> <br /> This is the main idea of ​​the story (the racist southern commander Blacks) have been expanded in a big production budget back then, and it is not too late to try it now. You have to take it for what it is, and I admire the creators of this film to create effort. <br /> <br /> I remember that a while ago and thinking it was established in Italy, which would make more sense, because there were black combat forces operating there in 1944.
