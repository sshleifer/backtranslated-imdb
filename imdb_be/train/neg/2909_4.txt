Watching Tom Hanks as a hitman for the Irish mafia bit like Jimmy Stewart sees as a serial rapist, he just does not work. I had a very hard time accepting this.Not, I do not think that Tom can not act, he can I followed his career since the Mazes and Monsters, but for some reason, this has fallen to me. Maybe because I'm such a fan of the graphic novel and the risk of both Fanboy (the only form of life lower than a cockroach Fanboy) film as a whole fails for me.The additions Jude Law, and subtracting everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little disappointed. I expected a lot more crime movie in the spirit of Bonnie and Clyde Mendes took all the heart of history and left us with nothing but bare bones. There are things in this film, but the cinematography is breathtaking filling the screen with beautiful pictures of Paul Newman, as usual excellent and I really enjoyed the bill, but how the "angel of death" Sullivan was perfectly flat.
