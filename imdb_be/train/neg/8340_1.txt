One of the worst movies I have ever seen. There are so sad that I turned it off halfway through to watch the news. When I turned it back, I fell asleep. The film begins with a dream, the dream continues, and ends with a dream. Then a few more dreams in between. Well, that's supposed to keep me interested in this? The film should have a reason to be interesting. Minutes you feel the film was only a dream, when any reasonable moviegoer excluded. Always had someone insists on telling you their dreams, and what does it mean for them? This is it !!! <br /> <br /> Absolutely horrible.
