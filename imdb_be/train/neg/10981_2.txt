Or listen to, for that matter. Even the soundtrack bore. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this is not the worst gay film I saw (what would the Bill), but there is very close to the bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> This thing pulls and pulls and pulls. It is not that the story meaningless - in the hands of a good writer this could work. ,, This, of course, would be much more interesting. There is not one point of the story, you can not see coming ten miles down the road. Dialogue is flat. Old jokes. To add insult to injury, it is full of one-dimensional, stereotypical gay. <br /> <br /> Currently, this film is not convinced me that the situation and relations between the two findings was probably considerably less real. There was no chemistry, no dynamic, since no evidence as to why the findings in love. ,, We were just told that they are in love. It is difficult to understand, if they have nothing in common and are not compatible sexually. They like the same book? Yes? <br /> <br /> action is not entirely bad, but Shagan painfully slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch- slowly but without quality Jarmusch. In fact, it would be a good barometer for you. If you love movies Jarmusch, avoid this one.
