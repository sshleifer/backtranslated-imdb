First of all, I would like to tell you that I'm in a comic book, anime, animation and things like that. It is true that each has its advantages, but you can trust me in this film. I'll be objective. To start with the story - this is normal. It follows the storyline from the comics, as far as I know them. But animation is ... Well, it's actually not terrible, but it's certainly cheap and mediocre. It would be much better if they did not try to imitate the style of anime and stick to the original comic book style drawings. When we pretend not to see the rare gnarled effects like fire and lightning, you could say that the movie was made about 10 years ago and even more. It looks a bit like the original Vampire Hunter D since 1985. Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for example - 4 years ago, they made a movie that looks a hell of a lot better! In addition, the voice talent does not do anything special, music is nothing special. So all in all - it lacks atmosphere. I watched it, but I can not say that I really enjoyed it. He just does not catch you. There's plenty of blood and violence, but it does not impress me. Maybe it would be shocking for someone who has never watched a more mature-oriented animation and see the blood animation for the first time (there anyone around?), But I do not think this is the audience for this film. Thus, they could add a bit of nudity and spices to it. Chicks around Lucifer were quite tasty, and hell, we ourselves Lady Death! There are a few looks sexy, but that's not enough. Instead, the music of Bill Brown, I think it will look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. In general - the film is not so bad, but if you want something better to take the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 Fire and Ice Wizards or may be in Bakshi. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
