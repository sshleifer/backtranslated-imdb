I wanted to give blood collection in favor of the original question. Opening times, with a naked woman collapsed and artist, Diana, on her paint, and then suck her blood to flow, so that she could use it to her art, creating the impression that it might be a kick-ass artsy- vampire flick. It turns out that this first impression is false. Oh, Troma, a sign of some lack of quality: sometimes they offer something that is garbage, but it is ridiculous, and at least some competence to junk food craft (or sometimes not). This is the case when it is not all a lot of fun to watch, as his attempt at humor (ie, the father of the main character is an old vaudeville, which makes Jimmy DURANTE impression?) Is weak at best, and any unintentional laughter are blown Sergio Lapel's discounted direction. <br /> <br /> And it's not without trying, oh no. He does try a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had the money to light, of course, but the way they are used in the film I did, the former director of student and aspiring director, sulking in his place, if I saw it in the theater, I would dazzle my eyes in many cases, and whether or not understood Interestingly, his DP really basic 3-point lighting set of parameters. While this, together with a very dull sound design (or just a lot of random loud buzz in the art gallery scene), should not be something that comes to the attention during the release of the three, it should be something that * mostly *, that the filmmaker can decide even if the script is not very funny or scary (and is not), or if the flap does a wonderful mixture of songs that are in strange times. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie by any stretch, and perhaps if you are a die-hard vampire (vampire or just a period) may have some appeal as an alternative to low-rent discount Near Dark, or as a small improvement in the current, for example, 1972 in Blood Freak. Do you have better ways to spend my time as a whole.
