I do not know anything about the Iliad, so I can not comment on the accuracy in this story. However, as an independent film that I found it very sad. The fight scenes were trying to be big and impressive, but they were just obvious CGI. <br /> <br /> Proceed poor and without a doubt, Brad Pitt was cast only to attract the ladies. But it does not make a good warrior, I am also very afraid. <br /> <br /> The good point is the design. This film does not look good with the terrain and fortifications / wall are impressive. I like the film, which is at least trying to get the right accent characters, but this film just seems to completely ignore it. we hear American, Scottish English is nothing but what you would expect for a film about the ancient oriental civilization. <br /> <br /> In general, I do not recommend this movie for the family to sit down. It's too long, and the young get tired. <br /> <br /> For adults, it's okay if you do not care about the lack of realism.
