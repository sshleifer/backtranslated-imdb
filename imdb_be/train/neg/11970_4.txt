... for Litas, choosing this. Firstly, the movie was not terrible, it was just Hollywood. In the worst case, I-need-is-to-occur, or-we-no-no-script of the film, if Willis' mission was to rescue a doctor, but she was adamant that her "people" doing it with a missionary, he would put it in the first chopper and gone are the refugees at the border without her. He would not be a threat to his pack for refugees. This is not how it works. But, as I pointed out, it's Hollywood, we have to have drama. That's why we make films, because the reality is not quite so complicated. However, I do not think the good doctor and Willis were workable chemistry. However, there are some well-made battle scenes in the film. It's not a waste of time, "Tears of the Sun" stands DVD rental fee. Check it out on a rainy day, and you will be satisfied.
