I rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on DVD without having to read any reviews about it. So after 15 minutes of viewing I noticed that something was wrong with this film; This is terrible! I mean, in the trailer, it looked scary and serious! <br /> <br /> I think Eli Roth (Mr. Director) believes that if all the characters are silly, the film in this film would have been funny ... (Yes, silly, it's funny ... wrong ?!) He has to watch and learn from the best horror-comedy, such as: «Fright Night», «The Lost Boys" and "The Return of the living dead"! This is ridiculous! <br /> <br /> «Fever" is the reason why I registered to www.imdb.com, so that I can let go of your thoughts of discontent about this. <br /> <br /> I decided to watch the film a second time> Aaargh! <And take notes for my partial "survey" to show how stupid movie. «Resident Evil» (terror) and "Dude, Where's My Car?" (Comedy) I can watch again and again, and still use! But this is ...! <br /> <br /> How bad can the script and the director to be ??? This is bad. That's terrible scenes in chronological order: <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the scene, we see Henry, who does not understand his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of his mouth and glazed eyes dead is dead! <br /> <br /> film says nothing about the blonde long-haired guy who likes to bite people. <br /> <br /> And my answer to a question without an answer Marcy ( "What happened to explain the forest?") "personal." The script that bearded warn them of the woods only "unknown". <br /> <br /> Then the "smart" with a 5-pack, Berta, almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire, he meets are now infected with Henry, who prays for help, and from here on the film wants to break the record in the use «F-word." Burt begins to worry because Henry looks very bad. Bert: «Do not make me shoot you!" (He forgets to add: "... with my BB gun») <br /> <br /> Bert is sent back to the cabin, but how about this and he meets Marcy? Jeff, who are having sex, but now suddenly decided to go for a walk! Mars wisely takes an unprotected fire Bert started earlier (moment of clarity for a change?) Bert does not mention a word about Henry, because the fool thinks he killed him with a BB gun. <br /> <br /> Later when five Estupidos sitting around their campfire, another eccentric is with his dog. (Maybe that's what prevented e forest at all? It is filled with eccentrics ... and their dog!) They let him sit with them only because he has a big bag of cannabis. (Their brain is completely intoxicated! Not surprisingly, ! why are they all so DUMB) this is the last time we see this forgotten character ... alive <br /> <br /> Henry appears in the cabin (Note: He was lying all the time, just a few meters from the cabins !!!) looks worse, almost like a zombie, covered with slime! He says that he needs a doctor. But the young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker. It gets into their unlocked truck, which, of course, also has its own key in the ignition. Henry almost seems smart enough to manage the hell out of there, but instead begins to vomit blood all over the dashboard, seats and windows. Fantastic Five quit working, armed: in BB Gun, knife, baseball bat (* yes ever tried to play baseball in the middle of the woods ????), poker and spray (insecticide?) Maybe it is ready to fight one, unarmed and terribly sick man. (Clever script!) Bert manages to kill a machine with a single shot of his BB Gun, which is possible only in the mind of director Eli Roth. "What else should I do?» Bert yells in his defense. Jeff and Paul try to knock down Henry with their bat and poker, but miss the accident and the truck window instead. Henry comes to stupid girls who say: "He comes to us" (Thanks for the information, stupid women, I can see it, but I do not think he wants to do you any harm!) Marcy spray in his eyes that Henry makes a bark! And our "hero" Paul comes to the hands of Henry with the magazine combustion from the fire, they hastily left to burn until they were in the cabin! (Where did all that wisdom? I believe that cannabis is beginning to affect :-) Henry becomes the Human Torch and runs away screaming. <br /> <br /> The next day, the head of Bert and Jeff for a mechanic. And Marcy decides "to go to the aid of" still in the woods, as Paul stays behind with Karen ... Does not that sound idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul, because Geoff and Bert have "to go to the rescue!" <br /> <br /> I miss your comments now as we suddenly see Mars in a canoe on a huge coffin and winding river! As she canoe? Does she even know where she was going? Anyway, she goes to the river and is very large and seemingly abandoned hut and, like most horror movies, walks in the cabin, saying: "? anyone hi there "Bert suddenly jumps out of furniture and scares her (and me at first). And Jeff swims as well. How did they get here? Did they swim across the river ??? You can see how brainless script? <br /> <br /> Deputy Winston meets Paul in the cabin. For some reason he did not notice the blood on their truck. This occurs about 35 minutes of viewing, and I decided to stop torturing yourself over and popped a DVD. (Before you take my own eyes! ... So, it's funny!) <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, do yourself a favor and watch «Fright Night», «The Lost Boys», or "Return of the living dead." Then you will see that they are more interesting than this ... thing. Even "The Toxic Avenger Part 2", which is also a lousy film is way more ridiculous than "Cabin Fever".
