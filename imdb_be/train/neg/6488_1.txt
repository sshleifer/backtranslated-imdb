So, the topic is a direct quote from the movie, and I think it's pretty accurate. I was so bored with this dead meaningless effort. All flash, etc. It does not make any sense after the first 20 minutes of a bad film making + If you have epilepsy, you would have died, at least five times already. Of course, all the fans of David Lynch set up an ensign for this kind of turkey to be "the best movie ever made", because it does not make any sense, and if it does not make any sense, it must be an art, and the art of film is always good . Right? I say wrong. This type of artificial art capture only a pathetic way to try to show that you are a good filmmaker. Anthony Hopkins as a wonderful actor should just stay acting.
