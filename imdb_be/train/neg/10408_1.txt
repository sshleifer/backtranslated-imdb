If Fassbinder made worse the movie, I'm sure I do not want to see him! Anyone who complains that his movies too Talky and claustrophobia should be forced to look at it, to learn to appreciate more free style he chose the great films as "The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant". This film bogs down so many artistic, quasi-symbolic images it looks like a parody of the "art film." The scene of the massacre, and the scene where a prostitute each channel Surfs Elvira for what seems like ten minutes, only two of the best examples of what makes this film a real test of endurance viewer. But what really disturbs me about this are a few scenes that show only Elvira and her ex-wife and / or her daughter. These are the only things that reflect real human emotion, and prove that the basis of this terrible film, it was a great movie with all the forces trying to break free. What a waste.
