As always it is inaccurate picture of the homeless. TV said a lot of lies about the poor in the early 1990s and made things look bad, and claimed we made more than $ 100 a day if the $ 20-40 a day were much closer to reality. if someone drove past where I picked up a sign with a proposal work, and invited me to work, I actually went and got a job when I was physically able.and, if I'd been offered $ 100,000 ID damn sure I invested in square prepayment, at least 2 years, and is still in the bank, and left himself $ 10-20,000 for NL $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 cash games in the casino. I usually always win and can win a decent, I just bankroll. instead I won about $ 1,000 a month all played in the minimum purchase is always due to not wanting to risk losing everything. I was the only homeless, because I do not want to risk spending all your money and go broke, sometimes I was more than $ 1000-2000 in my toe while I was sleeping on the street. Who wants to talk contact sevencard2003 on Yahoo messenger.i admit I was different than the majority of homeless people, although, due to the fact that I never saw smoke or take drugs. they are no longer homeless, not in GOVT housing for $ 177 per month and receive SSI and spend most of their time in winning online poker. Mom and sunflower diversified worked hard to get SSI me. happy my days hiding under the stage in the casino conference center at night time sleep, worrying about security will fall, finally ended. was the TV crew took me longer was Theyd much earlier. it's a shame they are not better choose who they choose.
