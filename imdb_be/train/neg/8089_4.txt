I do not know what it's like acting style, Donald Sutherland, and vocal style, but he always seems to be valid because of the massive lump of damp napkins. He's just ... I do not know, fat? Somnambulistic? On medication? Weird. <br /> <br /> However, I just saw the movie again for the first time since its original release, and frankly, I do not remember that the end of such a thing. Bad end, too, because nothing is tied. How about a dead husband? Annoying child (and the child dubbed?)? Scotland Yard and military pursuers? I would like something to wrap things and gives a dramatic closure to it all, and not only the involvement of a large panoramic away. <br /> <br /> A woman is sleeping with a man she knows just killed her husband? Even if she tries to dispel the suspicion of an ear, in order to protect her child, she could have always been a headache. This is the last meeting made me feel very itchy and uncomfortable ...
