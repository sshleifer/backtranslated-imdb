The film is a collection of clich√©s on anything there. It does not make any attention at all, no purpose, no real communication. Symbolism is coming from the top and stereotypes are abundant and challenging. This film can not resist the temptation to make a drama, which does not exist. Each small exchange of words at once transformed into a long, unwarranted dialogue, which is so typical for the class action rehearsal. Where there is no substance to such an exchange, the actors (no matter how good they are, as a rule) can not help but compensate with exaggerated emotions, or "raising the stakes." For actions, to put it simply. The guide does not help here. Nothing can save this non-story. She is forced to fake, and sad to tears. Inaccuracies in portaraying punk rock with The Who, piercings and flashy 90-outfits. Characters wander without a role, details and motives. Arbitrary. It Boogie Nights diploma Good Fellas sperm Saturday Night Fever, pulled out with a sense of art and. <br /> <br /> Well DP. I'll give him that. <br /> <br /> Some films have drawbacks. This film is a disadvantage Lee. He sold out, just like everyone else. It has become irrelevant. It does not have anything interesting to say the least. <br /> <br /> I have no desire to see anything from this guy again (which I will refrain from naming is now).
