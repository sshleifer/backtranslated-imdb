William Hurt diving scientist ??? US agents working abroad investigation? Sick man of polluted legs butt after falling 20 feet on his back and run away? Sniper is not killing and not Hurt (only wounding him), but the second is to "kill" shot dead? A waste of time. To compare it to fall down, as did other reviewers funny. Oh, and by the end of the film they decided to start wearing gloves on their hands for the "evil" agent and Hurt but decides to kill him, allowing him to "shake the virus." What? By the way ... when the IMDb requires 10 lines of text? I just hung out here. Is not it just dillute detention reviews when you should have, and the number of lines?
