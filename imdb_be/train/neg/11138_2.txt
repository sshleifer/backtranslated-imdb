Let me start by saying that I read a few reviews before you rent this movie and kind of knew what to expect. Nevertheless, I was amazed at how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the werewolf, and was used to forgive a lot when watching one. Most of them have unsatisfactory effects, poor actions and poor storylines (at best warm up from the earlier films). So far, except for some of the later "howling" series of films, this is the worst of all. <br /> <br /> First of all, history. It has been quoted several times in the reviews on this site, so I will not go into details. Nevertheless, it is clear that the author (s) had absolutely no resemblance to lycanthropic monsters. As often happens when a horror film are a writer who considers himself "above" this rate, they tried to come up with a new spin on the werewolf myth. This is good, but the fan nya horror trying to do it in the general case the neglect of intelligence and the search for a horror audience and ends up writing them. The plot feels like a parody of a werewolf movies, and events depicted only ring so wrong that I felt that my mind was seriously offended. TV news footage, for example, never scrolled by a reporter to shut up at someone in the crowd behind them. Give the character and the audience credit for being able to identify the bad guy in the scene without the use of a flashing neon sign. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> As for the effects, I have never seen, less believable werewolf. I would be happy with Lon Chaney Jr. strengthens hair. They used an animal looks a lot like ... well, like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with some hair glued and some really terrible animatronics. And I know that many people have criticized the CG, but my God, it was awful. One scene shows a woman changes, and starts with a full CG version of the actress, nude but for some reason without nipples. My first thought was, "Hey, why one of the characters from the" Reboot "turns into a werewolf looking stupid?» <br /> <br /> In any case, I like to look for the positives in any film, and there were a few. Cinematography was passable (the film was shot entirely digitally, which is interesting), and some of the performances were not scared. It was also interesting to see Hedren, as the world's most well-fictional homeless woman, and Kane Hodder as the name of the bad guy. In addition, the yellow Power Ranger got all growed and ... well, damn. And if you are looking for the skin, there are some pretty delicious examples. This ends the segment of the male pigs in the review. <br /> <br /> In general, if you want a good werewolf film, try to "An American Werewolf in London", the original «The Howling", "Dog Soldiers», or "Wolf" (although this one was more than a wolf, than they were). If you complete a werewolf, and then take a fool. Otherwise, give it a miss.
