The film is written and directed by Neil Young, "Greendale" little more than a 87-minute music video for doxen or so works songwriter. Instead of dialogue, the film is based solely on the Young texts, which are largely permeated journalism to tell the "story" while actors perform a scene. <br /> <br /> Given Hammy performance and poor grainy picture, the effect is the equivalent Young undermine some of his own home movies and releasing them for public consumption. Although there are supposedly "history" passes through the film, we did not really have any idea of ​​what is happening mainly due to the raw look of the film mean absence of dialogue and amateurish incompetence in action. All we get for eighty-seven minutes a bunch of aging hippies sport silently through incoherent story while Yang songs play endlessly on the soundtrack. All this turns into a tedious exercise in pampering. «Greendale» gives Hollywood, low-budget film, making a bad name.
