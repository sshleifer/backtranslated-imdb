Before I watched this movie, I read a review here that this film could be one of the best movies ever! haha scene backstage tension grows well ... from annoying characters in this film. With the little girl says, and gibberish trying to drown a little boy, the killer just run around without any posts (and who was the guy on the beach talking to a little boy !?) .. things just seem to happen and then not answered in this film. As I watched, it seemed that the film goes in one direction and then just will not do, but in a new direction ... and so on ... <br /> <br /> The current big but got a letter. Each character in each scene, says or does something so incredibly unreal and reaction pair plaster / addition simply amazing. There is no resolution to the problems developed throughout the film, which makes it confusing and ultimately, a big waste of time.
