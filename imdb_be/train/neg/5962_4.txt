Our Paul made a large number of horror films. In terms of quality, they usually range from pretty good unwatchable garbage; and, unfortunately, Death comes from the grave closer to the latter. The plot is just an average story of witches, wizards, or (as in this case) a sorcerer, who put to death - but not before swearing revenge on those who did it ... etc. etc. Then we get a s√©ance and one thing leads to another, and quickly executed warlock up to no good again. The plot is slow, painful and sad film constantly feels pointless. string of characters bales diatribe and it never serves the film in any form. Our Paul wrote the script, and if you ask me, he should stick to acting because dialogue is banal in the extreme, and only serves to make the film even sadder than it already is. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy in the blue eyes of the broken doll and a curse devil gives a vague direction here who loves dialogue does nothing to help the film. Sometimes shit movies, as it has a certain charm about them; But death comes out of the grave is not even that. It is painfully boring movie that has little or nothing in the form of interest.
