In addition, all technical mistakes .... <br /> <br /> How about a female flight attendant, who can kill, all by itself, 4 of 7 terrorists (including former Marines), 2 of which are not even using a gun . She then landed the plane perfectly. We are not talking about Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton; we are talking about a regular, scared, but very well prepared stewardess. : D What about the leader responsible for the team's attack / rescue, which have complete proof (in accordance with the logic of the script) plan gassing all sleep with someone from his crew to fly the plane. Once he decides on the spur of the moment to change plans and instead to conduct offensive against terrorists, guns, not knowing where the terrorists are, or how much, rather than providing an advantageous position, so that his entire team gets easily rubbed off. So, with the help of an old head. Only then will decide one way or another use sleeping gas. And it is useless for all intensive purposes. <br /> <br /> bad as this movie was, though, I could not stop myself from watching and wondering what's next? : D I can not help but imagine all the wonderful, unemployed screenwriter thinking to myself, this is not fair. lol! : D
