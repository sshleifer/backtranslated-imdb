1999 will go down in history as the year the film critic lead the public astray. First they sent us to squint. Then they hyped the Blair Witch Project, and now magnolia, which is by far the worst film of the year. What is it? Who the hell knows. Its total self-indulgence and is loaded with bad acting. I always wanted to stay and watch the credits, but if this thing was over, I could not get out of the theater quickly. Most of the audience that was present at the show, I was feeling pretty much the same. Dates quarrel with each other, as well as foreign. It's ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful.
