Last weekend I bought this "zombie film" from the transaction bin and watched it with some friends, thinking that's going to be a budget version of "Land of the Dead." <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems as if they have spent most of their budget on the concealment of art, which is very misleading zombie genre fans. <br /> <br /> We have seen up until the point where the zombie chicks alive and get into the car with some yuppie, who in the middle of nowhere to talk business on a cellphone. They actually talk to the guy, before one of the girls killed him; but as soon as they started driving, I could not suspend my disbelief more. <br /> <br /> Some people think it is "so bad it's good" movie, they are liars. I have not finished the film, but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the film, which makes me glad not watched all the way through. <br /> <br /> This is even worse than the «Zombiez» DO NOT LOOK!
