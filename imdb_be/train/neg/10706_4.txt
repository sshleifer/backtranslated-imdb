Wow, and I thought that any Steven Seagal movie was bad. Every time I thought that the film can not get worse proved me wrong. The story was good, but the actors could not bear it. In addition, they made a lot of mistakes, how to actually Archaeological excavations are made. For example, you can not handle the artifacts until they catologed and accounted for. A terrible crime in the casting was archiologist girl. It is weak actress, and I felt that her actions really made the film less realistic, then it already was. The whole concept of the Templars buried all these years, it seemed a bit silly to me. I like the idea that they disappeared, and things, so that it almost seemed depressing. I thought that wern't characters explained well enough. You have not found a lot of the background, and it made it more difficult to treat them.
