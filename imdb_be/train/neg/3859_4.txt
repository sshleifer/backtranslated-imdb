Jason Lee is doing everything possible to bring satisfaction in a silly situation, but the film just can not make a connection. <br /> <br /> Maybe because Julia Stiles character seems clunky as conniving and sexy soon to be a relative. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because she and Selma Blair characters have been cast in the opposite direction. (Selma Blair seems more insidious than Julia will). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is another Hollywood trivialization possible the real situation in the world (that being caught with pants on your stag sun bending your cousin), who, having promised not to deliver. <br /> <br /> There are some laughs to be sure and cast (even if miscast) doing everything with the sub high quality material which does not go beyond his bawdy topic, therefore, instead of successfully tasteless Festival (ie the Animal House and American Pie), we were left with the average over part of the humor and stupidity (ala meatballs 2 or something).
