There's a good movie lurking here, but it is not. The basic idea is good: to explore the moral issues confronting a group of young survivors of the apocalypse. But the logic is so complicated that it is impossible to take part. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes (for obvious reasons) paranoid mysterious air to catch the infection, which destroyed almost all of humanity. However, they wear a surgical mask several times, but not others. Several times they were fanatically rubs with bleach every area touched by an infected person. Other times, they seem quite indifferent. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, after apparently survive a few weeks or months in this new-kill or be killed world, these people are always behave like total newbs. They are not concerned about the accumulation of the necessary equipment, or food. They always run out of fuel in the middle of nowhere. They do not take elementary precautions when meeting with strangers. And after wading through the rotten corpses of the entire human race, they are just as dismissive as covered debutantes. You have to constantly wonder how they could have survived for so long ... and even if they did, why someone would like to make a film about them. <br /> <br /> So when these Dweebs stop agonizing over the moral dimensions of their activities, it is impossible to take them serious introspection. Their actions will have to first make a minimum sense. <br /> <br /> In addition to all this, we have to fight with questionable acting abilities of Chris Pine. His portrayal of a proud young James T Kirk might seem a shrewd, if considered in isolation. But the media he plays exactly the same note: arrogant and boneheaded. It is impossible not to suspect that it is all their dramatic choices. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the movie * * looks fine. It got more acute, intense look that really suits in the US southwest locale. But it can not save the really weak to write, no paper thin (and annoying) characters. Even if you're a fan of the genre of the late-in-the world, you have to save yourself the agony of watching Carriers.
