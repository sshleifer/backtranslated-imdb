Large throw. Great performances. Unpredictable plot for the first half <br /> <br /> hour or so. I really wanted to know what would be <br /> <br /> happen with each of these unredeeming characters and their <br /> <br /> seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined. But if <br /> <br /> writers learned glue to start connecting players, they <br /> <br /> mistakenly used super glue and brought the film to a dead end <br /> <br /> for the past two hours . I always thought it would be better, but it is only <br /> <br /> deteriorated. Do not believe the reviews. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think about it - Tom Cruise has made ugly - why? Gorgeous <br /> <br /> hunky bartender wearing braces - why? I know that this was due to <br /> <br /> plot, but without them, at least, it would be one <br /> <br /> attractive member of the cast in mind.
