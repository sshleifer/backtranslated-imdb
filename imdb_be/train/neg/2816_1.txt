This is one of those movies that you see in the video store, you just have to get it because it just looks so terribly bad. And in fact, we could not take most of them. There was a lot going on fast forward. <br /> <br /> But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces a female protagonist (her name somehow slips my mind at the time). Cripes. I never watched any scene from the movie so many times (I estimate forty or so). And I've never laughed so hard in my life. You see, Englund has this thing for showing off his loins. The last time I saw the movie a couple of months ago, but I can not help laughing when I type. In any case, the scene assembling shots-- Englund tearing underwear girl Englund riding a horse bare, and some mysterious woman fellating head of the snake. This is an absolute genius. You have to see it for yourself.
