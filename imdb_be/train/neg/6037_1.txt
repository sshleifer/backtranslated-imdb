Moron and a friend hold a ritual to resurrect the dead, in an attempt to prove that the dead can not be brought back to life. Not surprisingly, what they are doing to revive the dead soul, which starts cutting it with an ax, and the next day some college aged people tell stories around the campfire. The guy with the ax turns and starts breaking up of idiots that tell a story. Group calls the police, the police see the blood splattered around and thinks it's a mountain lion (!?), And soon after fired a deformed killer, who may or may not be a ghost. <br /> <br /> moronic little splatter film, which was shot in broad daylight, but where several characters are flashlights and talk as if it was in the middle of the night, and wants to send up a flare to attract attention. One guy has a gun in one hand and a bullet in the other, but do not bother to download it, after it finally loads it, it has a few opportunities to shoot the killer, but not annoying, because over the film too early. Then he drops the gun! Also harmful there are characters that do not show any emotions and do not look even slightly concerned after their friends are cut into pieces and lousy effects (human heart looks like a piece of chicken, a car exploded at the end was clearly a model car) and terrible dialogue and a really ugly woman's naked body does not help. And in the end, he tries to get away from his inconsistency, saying that it was the invention of the same college seniors, which tell the history of breeding a fire at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Then the killer is on the real in the last scene, chopping them into pieces. Again. <br /> <br /> Satisfactory of its kind, is only good for some unintentional laughter. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 to ****
