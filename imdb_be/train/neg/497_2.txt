It really is a silent film. It can be fun with cool looking alien and field, but it's just not the case. <br /> <br /> Some foreigners hear the broadcast of World War II, when a small country station playing it on Halloween. They came to Earth to kill people, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and act goofy. The front cover of the film shows these aliens top surfers in space ... is not really what they're doing. This is not a party of the aliens, they are stupid idiots cartoon with an annoying high-pitched voice modulated. The newcomer to the most moderate voice, too, is alien plagiarism Jack Nicholson, who always wears sunglasses. Besides aliens acting scared. Addition, obviously intended for children, because each character is written as a child <br /> <br /> This is a silent film that only children will appreciate, perhaps, <br /> <br /> My rating ..: 1/2 with ****. 100 min. PG for mild language.
