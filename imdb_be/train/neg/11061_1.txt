Curiosity led me to this "masterpiece." Unfortunately, I did not rent it, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this film is that it is not so alarming. For reasons known only to them, the creators of this film set out to show the human side of Dahmer. Are you kidding? The man gave a new meaning to the term "finger lick good"! And with all the flash-backs and flash-forward I had trouble following the story. All in all the performance of Jeremy Renner is not so bad. You can catch it in the «S.W.A.T.», in which he plays a dissatisfied former policeman. Anyway, I would rate it as 1/10. He received only 1, because it is so-so performance Renner. There are many books and television documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering Dahmer's crimes. Avoid this one.
