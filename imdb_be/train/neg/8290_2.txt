Alan Rudolph directed so so, without that special touch. As an example, there was one shot in the Hereafter dentists in the dental office, which could express all the relations between husband and wife. Rudolph squandered it. The camera is located in the hallway, looking through doorways, two dental offices, with Dana and Dave each only in their rooms. You get an idea of ​​their devastation and isolation, but not much more. Lighting, color, body language, facial expression might all have been greatly improved. If I was directing, I would have spent the whole day, if necessary, to get it right shot. This is the beauty and strength of the film: it can express so much whole life in seconds <br /> <br /> Shot with a small stepping into a puddle of vomit could be improved. The child had to show more enthusiasm puddles must be stamped and mixed her legs had her head bent down to look at the mess with all her attention. <br /> <br /> Sun Campbell delivered. He plays unsociable man, however, but instead to convey his inner turmoil in his voice, gesture, body movement, the film relies on voice-over and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter ego, played by Denis Leary.
