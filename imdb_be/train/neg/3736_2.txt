This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Robin Williams fit into the part, like a rhino will fit in a pack, even so his performance was still sorry. Kurt Russell was more plausible, but still it was terrible. Plot leaves much to be desired, and the rest of the action, too scary. The only thing this movie has going for it was a trailer that caught me in wasting 90 minutes of my life that could have been spent trying to lick the back of the head. <br /> <br /> Do yourself and contribute to record the movie, if you have. If not, then just be happy that you do not.
