I watched this movie last night with expectation, but really was not very impressed. <br /> <br /> Except for the «Combo», I thought acting was poor, and the story has been limited. He came across as "TV" drama. <br /> <br /> I felt that the film was very unnatural. The entire set of forging in the context of the early (yes, we get that it is 80 years United Kingdom - you can stop now!) Was tiring, and gave a very one-sided view on what life was like in the 80s Britain - poverty, war side by side with the royal, Margaret Thatcher, but nothing in between? It was actually the middle classes that existed then - just ordinary working people with decent wages and mortgages. Falkland clips, too, seemed to be randomly added to the end, for "a dramatic effect", I suppose. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events, felt a bit disjointed, as the characters are moved one share to one another without, we see how their thinking may have changed so fast. <br /> <br /> relations "by Shaun" and "smell" was toe-curling. I could not even look at kissing scenes. I believe that it is very hard to believe that she was attracted to a boy, who was not only much younger, but looked much younger. I know it was only four years between them, but nothing in four years, as soon as you reach your twenties, but it's a huge difference in their teens! In my experience, such a difference adolescence occurs only when a girl under the age of one, as girls mature much faster, and more at a wavelength of boys a few years older. Sorry, but I did not buy it - unnecessary items section, designed to shock <br /> <br /> The ending is somewhat abrupt and, again, unnatural .. If the flag-throwing incident was to be signed, he fell somewhat less in my eyes. <br /> <br /> It bugs me that British films only concern themselves or in high school or poor. Do not get me wrong, I like a needle, and a wedding Four has its charms, but we can not Brits think of something else? Why our films are always so hung up on the class system? I was born in 1973, so different in age «Shaun» would not be strong in 1983, I grew up in a single parent family for quite trodden down council estate in England. However, my experience of childhood was significantly different from those depicted in the film - I do not even remember, racism is a problem (although I'm not saying that it does not exist). "This is England"? Not in my experience. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I felt that the film lacked substance, and I was completely bored and not impressed overall.
