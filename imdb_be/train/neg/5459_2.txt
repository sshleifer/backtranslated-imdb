It was a very short episode, which appeared in one of the «Night Gallery» show in 1971 an episode filmed Sue Lyon (Lolita movie fame) and Joseph Campanella, who play a nanny and baby vampire, respectively. Vampire hires a babysitter to watch your child (which seems to be some werewolf or monster) while he goes on blood at night. Nanny completely oblivious to the appearance of a vampire, when she first sees him and is just beginning to be two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror is an odd collection of books in the library of the occult, and hears strange noises , while a vampire is going to talk with the child. She realizes that the man who hired her is not that she thought it was originally. She rushes to the door, the vampire goes puzzled and the episode ended. I do not know what purpose it was to make such a cut the episode, which lasted only 5 minutes. They have just expanded the previous episode of the same 5 minutes and missed this. In total, the effort.
