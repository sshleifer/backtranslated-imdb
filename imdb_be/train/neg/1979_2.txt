Hmm, hip-hop music in the period of Western. Modern phrases as "cold" and too many others to follow. "In sistahs in Tha House" !? French manicured nails on hard riding girls. microphone packages are clearly visible on the back li'l Kim. I just can not with a litany of errors made by the director and editors. <br /> <br /> To act not as bad as I've ever seen. Women do well with a bad script. <br /> <br /> It was amazing, hearing Louis Mandylor speaking in his native accent. <br /> <br /> The girls are beautiful. fabulous costumes though totally wrong. I just can not believe that they would be dumb down what could be a great story. I take offense to believe that this film has been loaded with such attributes, it would be good to play in the city center. <br /> <br />
