Danish film «Slim Slam Slum" surprised me to be the worst movie I've seen on this date. I do not think it was possible to fill up your list of bad bad B-movies, but this one deserves the gold. This is not funny. This is a bad game, it's bad shot and bad plot. The only positive thing I can say about this movie, he has three girls in it. I really believe that this movie has the potential to bring down another Danish film "Star Uden hjerner» as the badest Danish film ever made! And that's really something. Congratulations in advance!
