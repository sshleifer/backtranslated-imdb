This is a film that takes some digesting. On the one hand, we have proposed a hard outer shell, a story that not only outputs the Catholic Church, but they do it in a silly, and ignorance. On the inner layer, we proposed to the Orthodox history of orthopraxis, and what happens when people go blindly to believe that they do not understand. <br /> <br /> At first glance, it looked like it was supposed to be a comedy. If so, then Mr. Durang need to open a dictionary, because he obviously does not know the meaning of the word. Jokes pale; humor uncomfortable and poorly delivered. In particular, the performance of Ms. Keaton is unstable and over the top, it is much lower quality and Annie Hall Sleeper days. Jennifer Tilly again stridence model, with its high-pitched voice greeting and whining style. All of this could be forgiven if it were not for the last 20 minutes of this film, which, obviously, was a controversial game made in 1981. <br /> <br /> *** Warning, spoilers ahead *** <br / > <br /> all begins with the appearance of four former students of sister Mary Ignatius (Ignatius, by the way, it's a man's name, and the nun did not take it after its promise under any circumstances, simply because of the fact that the show ,, you as a tireless research went into the project to begin with.) If they recognize that they do not live the teachings of the church, sister perahodits become irrational and abuse them in this way, the viewer has to believe that she did way back when in the cliché, all too cliché sepia tone of retrospection. If one admits that two abortions, a nun becomes more aggressive, while the student is not pulls out a gun. After fighting him away from her, the nun kills student, allegedly in self-defense. Then she goes on screaming excitement, killing a gay former student because of their sins. The last shot of a dead female pupil lying in a Christlike pose as the shadow of the cross looming over her. Can you say, `heavy-handed? I knew that you could! <br /> <br /> I know that the nuns were abusive in the past and I know that many people have been emotionally affected by, but this image seems to be down our throats almost every other shot in the train crash movie. I heard from a writer and director, this is a movie about the hysteria and why one should not follow the orthodox so relentlessly, the sun pun. This explanation hard to swallow, though, simply because we never gave an authoritative opinion that does not discriminate against the Catholic faith in some form or another. This film is simply anti-Catholic scar, which in the name of justice and equality, is the average of the spirit and hate. <br /> <br /> This is a film that I would recommend for a Catholic, namely, to wake him or her to the realities of cynicism and ignorance they face today. If it was `Rabbi Ray explains it all 'or' Imam Muhammad explains everything", it would be riots in the streets and Showtime to lose all of its subscription. But, unfortunately, because it's a movie that ties into what is perceived by the majority, accepted and even applauded those who share the same evil view. <br /> <br /> Of course, I hope that every member of the cast was a practicing Catholic, so it was not just the ignorance that led them to make this film. <br /> <br /> I give it 1.5 stars out of 5 and not because of its offensive, but because it was poorly written, poorly directed and a bad movie as a whole. Do not even waste your time.
