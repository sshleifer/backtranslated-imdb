I want to start by saying that I am a Republican, even if I disagree with a lot of things done in the bush office. And I love the show and the daily report on Colbert. They have to be two of my favorite shows on television. I enjoy the bush jokes on Conan, Letterman, Lena, because I recognize that W is not the smartest guy to ever walk the earth (I believe he is not stupid, too.) But it comes to the point where enough and it's actually not funny anymore. I can see where it might be fun, and it (hey, he mocks our authority figure he's funny.). Comedy Central, although it is difficult just trying to mock him. I mean, maybe one special episode, and a number just dumb. It seems, CC just tell the same jokes bush that we have heard many times WAY. I really can not see this show walking past 1 season.
