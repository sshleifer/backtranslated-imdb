Jean-Claude Van Damme is trying to save his career, making the continuation of the universal soldier. But, you know, the film saved him? I think he is going to hell after he dies. <br /> <br /> In the first moment we see inside the building, where you can see the villain of the film. Scary, huh? But it is not as scary as the action (see details below). <br /> <br /> Then we see Van Damme with a black woman (can not remember the name of .... well, it does not matter, anyway), trying to escape from some male muscles. Of course, they are the new Universal Soldier. More muscels, less brain (the same as in the film). After a while, Van Damme fights Goldberg, but then the "mission" gets interrupted. It was just a test (Is this film a test for our nerves?). It turns out that Van Damme is working for the government on a new project of Universal Soldier (Who has seen the first film, it may seem that this is the most unlogical thing that yould Van Dammes character might do). But it continued. And "history" should come up. Oh, I forgot. He has a daughter. It is very important for the "history". <br /> <br /> Well, after about 20 minutes, the supercomputer hears talk of closing it and he quit smoking project. Of course cube angry and activates all the soldiers to kill everyone. Van Damme runs away from the object, but the computer sends more troops to hunt him (He wants to Van Damme as a soldier - because he is the best (really)). And guess what Goldberg, one of the hunters, who always was a silly offer to the public, before it gets asskicked. Funny? Yes, just like the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> After some "history", Van Damme is trying to save his daughter (his wife - a reporter in the first film). It comes down to the final show, where Van Damme fights Bad Guy, and you can see the most expensive stage the film (see for myself. It's just too funny to say). <br /> <br /> You see that this film is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> So do not look. But if you do, keep Sixpack with you!
