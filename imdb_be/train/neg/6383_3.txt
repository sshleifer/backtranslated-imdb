Gaia-nigga from outer space short foreign film about black, gay foreigners who explore the galaxy, until they stumbled upon the Earth. Being gay, their goal is to have male only universe in which all men are gay. So when they find a woman or a "female creature" living on the Earth, they are first in horror, in the end, they decided to eliminate all women on the planet and free the male population <br /> <br /> offensive title with racist, homophobic. and sexist storyline, though perhaps intended as a satire, give this film a certain value a shock, however, there is little substance beneath it like another reviewer said, there are a few jokes, except the names of characters (for example, ArmInAss.);.. I think, I laughed once at one little jokes. I think What I got the point of the film quickly, satire, bad science fiction, but after that I had enough, I still wanted the film to end already (and it's a short film!) Nha brilliant or particularly well written..
