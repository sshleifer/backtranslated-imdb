Investigative reporter Darren McGavin (Carl Kolchak) returns; This time, he was after «The Night Strangler." Once again, fellow journalists or do not believe the police and, or you want to cover up, the supernatural angle. Producer-director Dan Curtis is the same basic story as his previous "Night", with the clear little success. <br /> <br /> Mr. Curtis collects supporting cast pleasure included in the «Dark Shadows» graduates George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (like Louise Harper) headed sexy collection of belly dance. And, although I have never seen it mentioned anywhere that needs to be Roger Davies as a dining companion to Mr. McGavin in the early stage, pretending disbelief in the existence of vampires! <br /> <br /> **** Night Strangler (1/16/73) ~ Dan Curtis Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
