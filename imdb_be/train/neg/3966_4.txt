Of course, I'm not a connoisseur of horror d'my partner, but well together, intelligent film is worth the time. My quibbles, in brief: <br /> <br /> - The dialogue is often weak and sometimes incredibly based on this character <br /> <br /> - unconvincing action <br /> <br /> - Storyline .. never caught fire . <br /> <br /> writers picked up choice bits of half a dozen major films thrown into the boiler, over low heat is not enough, and we tried to feed the poor as a result of the machinations of a mess, al'dente. <, Br /> <br /> Long and short, while not absolutely horrible, it was definitely not worthy of absorbing one of my rental Netflix.
