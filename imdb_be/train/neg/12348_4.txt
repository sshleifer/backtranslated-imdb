This film is very similar to «Flashdance», you know that the dance movie with Jennifer Beals. This film is probably the most boring film I've ever seen, because it is not even bad enough to be funny. "GI Jane," is much better than the movie, but that's not saying much. Moore Day here sweats a lot and there is a high music, and we get to see her fight and everything, but it certainly is not very attractive. I do think that the idea of ​​the film is quite interesting, but the script is too formulaic and Ridley Scott can not do anything about it. Well, as I said ... It's better than «Flashdance» ... (4/10)
