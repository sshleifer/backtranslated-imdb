Before seeing this movie, please check the reviews available on the internet about the falsification of the events of the film, in particular the delays in relation to the generally accepted fact that 7-8,000 Muslim men from Srebrenica transported and shot by Serb paramilitaries. Documentary also belongs to various pro-Serbian American organizations. Please see this film critically and read reviews beforehand. Most reviews say that the documentary takes its arguments too far, even if it raises questions that focus on conventional war against. Inspection in the NYTimes Stephen Holden argues that it would be "inaccurate to label this film about a Serbian", but there is a question as a statement of facts, many of which are taken from reliable sources, as well as the omission of the facts incriminating the Serb forces. I do not advise against seeing this film, but I caution you to consider it with a particularly critical eye (as should be done at any time, in any case).
