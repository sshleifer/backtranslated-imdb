"Fungicides" quite possibly the most incompetent, shameful, pitiful "film" I've ever seen. Acting Crime to almost non-existent, and the special effects are likely to put together, unleashing a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenseless laptop computer. <br /> <br /> I am far from me to stifle creativity, but I actually think things like this should not be done. I am sure that "Movie» -makers would say that, yes, the "film" was restrained by low (anything) budget - but in this case they are simply not worth the worry. As it is, they offered the world something so deplorable, so disgusting that only imbeciles could get the smallest nuance of pleasure from it. <br /> <br /> Starting the "film" it was not as if I was waiting for "Citizen Kane" or anything. I was expecting a little low budget horror perhaps with a bit of ingenuity, a hint of fun, and even some energy. What I got was the cinematic equivalent of the used handkerchief. <br /> <br /> The plot? Well, our carnivorous antihero scientist working in the basement of his parents, apparently manic stirring some thicker in the cup. Apparently, such a high level of science is the end result of years of research. His parents then sent him to a strange hotel-type place in the countryside to relax. There are some other people who are just too awful to write. In any case, the scientist down the tube on some fungi - and soon the mushrooms grow and kill people. (Wow, I get to write a suicide plot summary). Our heroes save the day undermined the barrel of balsamic vinegar (by attaching a "fuse" - in fact, part of the line - for her). Trunk inexplicably explodes with the force of a small nuclear weapon, destroying all the mushrooms. End. (Thank God). <br /> <br /> This is a summary as well as the "film" gets (and actually makes the sound much more interesting than it actually is). It really never have passed this stage of development (I mean the plot diagram sketched on the back of an envelope with a pencil). Someone should really stepped in and gave someone a vigorous shaking and said "NO". <br /> <br /> These "special" effects. Well, they are "special" all right. This CGI crazy. And it makes the person who I can only assume that he believes that the bicycle pump to be the pinnacle of modern technology. And if the mushrooms monsters are not in the style of 1984 home computer graphic package, they are represented by actors shuffling coated sheet (I kid you not). <br /> <br /> One of the most unforgivable things about the film is its laziness. It can be summarized in a scene in which the hero weaves his weapon (a la Clint Eastwood), and then fails miserably to get them in their pockets. I mean come on, a couple of repulsed, and he could have pulled it off, and just leave it as is. - very weak <br /> <br /> I can not believe that the money has been spent on this camcorder debris shot. The "film» -makers should hang their heads in shame and will be prohibited to walk fifty meters from any film-making equipment. <br /> <br /> I also think it is wrong that the friends and relatives of the founders come on IMDb and post false reviews and give stupidly high user ratings, which give a completely false picture of the "movie." "fungicide" with ' It is an absolute travesty of cinema. Mr. Wascavage or very, very stupid or very, very cynical.
