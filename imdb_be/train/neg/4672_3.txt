This film has some beautiful sets and Albert Finney does a great job as a ruthless father. The film fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh too nervous, like a daughter and will not reimburse for the much more subtle rendering became Olivia De Havilland in the heiress (1949). feminist incident conclusion of the film, too, goes against the harsh conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, angry feminism parodied in several other of his novels. As a supporter of the old Hollywood and great literature, I found this movie very disappointing.
