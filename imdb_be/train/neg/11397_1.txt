It was really awful! It was a terrible plot, bad acting, and was similar to the evil amateur remake of the dead, but not so good. <br /> <br /> It took all my perseverance to make it through this, it's a good job that I do not have to visit the toilet more I doubt I would go back! This one makes the Hammer House of Horror look like big screen Hollywood epic. <br /> <br /> The only value for this film was an endless supply of beautiful women. Not a bad one! <br /> <br /> If you want Letch with friends after a night on the beer, then this one is for you ... even avoid like the plague!
