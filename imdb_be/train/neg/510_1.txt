This is definitely one of the worst movies ever made and issued by the major Hollywood studios. The plot is just stupid. Conversation is recorded in the cliche; You can finish a lot of offers in the script because of this. It is acting ridiculously bad, especially Rod Cameron. "Choreography" stupid and completely unerotic. One can only pity the reviewer who saw the dance of 23-year-old Yvonne as sexual; it's just too bad choreography. Ballet scene early in the film is particularly inappropriate. If you are in bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of the turkey Hollywood, this is for you. I bought a painted version on VHS, which makes the movie even worse. Yvonne heavy makeup when color is her look like a clown all the time. And it is the best part of this film. What a way to start a career.
