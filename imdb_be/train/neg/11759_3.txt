For those who are looking to continue the fine South African miniseries of the 1980s, it is not. And this is not a historical drama. Most likely, it's a chore a little imagination, which has nothing to do with the historical Shakom and only uses his name to give a definite distinguishing mark in idiot Sinclair story about African superhero, which is a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman, and Nelson Mandela. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are a few laugh out loud moments, and if Shaka breaks the cross, to which it is confined and begins a serious slave what kind of example. Do you know how Jesus would have done if he was not such a wimp. <br /> <br /> However, I have seen only a 98-minute version, but I can not imagine that twice as much of this shit would be better. <br /> <br /> And what is the name Mungo?
