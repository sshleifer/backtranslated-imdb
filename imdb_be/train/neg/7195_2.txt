Disney has done it again. The company that made "Mr. I" and "George of the Jungle" made another film that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based, and does not hold any of the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> »Inspector Gadget," it was one of my favorite cartoons when I was young, and his movie to exist, perhaps, a dream come true then. Now, when this film there, I was very disappointed, even angered. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have symbols. <br /> <br /> The gadget itself gadgets that have made it such a fun character in the original cartoon (with toasted special effects who accompanies them), and it even has a certain naivete of the original gadget, but now he is more competent and, expected to solve the crime themselves while Penny and brain just watch. <, Br /> <br /> Penny has little in common; while she played the title role in the animated film, revealing crimes and stopping him, and from time to time to obtain a captured agent crazy, now it is simply introduced and then forgotten, although it is, at least to penetrate the claw base. <br /> <br /> foot is a version of the movie Dr. No., which was quite ominous, raspy voice of a man who wore a metal glove, and sat in his chair, his face was hidden from the eyes as he stroked the cat and was in charge of the various crime. Now he's just a man with a claw hand, without the mystery behind the character. <br /> <br /> The brain and the Mad Cat exist in the film, but very little to him. <br /> <br /> Even small part of the cartoon entirely spared in this cutting. Famous phrase «Wowsers!» I was mysteriously changed to "militant teetotaler" and Gadgetmobile Gadget now looks differently and says. <br /> <br /> There is even a product approvals worldwide. Why «Yahoo!» advertised on the sign? Why Gadgetmobile have buttons for M & M'S or Skittles? <br /> <br /> The proponents of the cartoon will hate it, others may probably find the film below par, and when all is said and done, this film is one more attempt to make some quick money from another old show.
