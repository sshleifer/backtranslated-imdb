**** Nha read this review, if you want a shocking conclusion «The Crater Lake Monster" to be a complete surprise **** <br /> <br /> A claymation plesiosaur rises from the depths of Crater Lake to harm the local group livestock, not to mention the fast forward button. To call «The Monster Crater Lake» amateurish is to overstate the obvious. If you are not a fan of low budget drive in movies, you probably will not go here in the first place. <br /> <br /> The problem of the film is that, if there is a monster no action takes place, it really sucks and is not going anywhere. The script is very Ed Wood-ish, that is a completely contrived in the way it sets the basic sequence of actions. Nothing too unusual for «The Crater Lake Monster." This explains his dinosaur with a meteor crashing into the crater lake, "" water overheated to the point where she hatches a dinosaur egg, which appears to have been buried at the bottom of the lake for thousands of years. Even if we could take that egg could lie so long and remained uncovered and viable, not "overheating" of the water to such a high temperature, because a large part of the lake evaporates? In addition to a symbolic mist in one or two scenes, we see no signs of water not being hot, except for a few lines in the script. <br /> <br /> The script is complemented by pretty obvious in a few sequences, and he will do anything to get the symbols of the lake, so that they may be under threat in the claymation Dean. Several times the car went through the experience of problems and while their car serviced, they decided to rent a boat and go to Crater Lake. Hmmm ... What do you think, in the history of these strangers could be there, so that they will work in our title ugliness? In the sequence, it is just amazing, drunk robs liquor store and decides to kill the cashier and walk instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of booze. Car chase begins, and I know it ... they end up right on the lake. snack time for Cratey! Yes, it is not difficult to understand, and you're still ahead of the script that you are annoyed when it takes ten minutes for these scenes unfold. <br /> <br /> shamelessness of this all is endearing, and I really want to as «The Crater Lake Monster." I just can not do it. There's not enough here to go further, and it is more than a movie to put on during a party, because you can talk directly over it, and it does not matter. <br /> <br /> The film has a thin list of things going for it, the most important of which is itself a dinosaur that appears in three forms: the shadow puppet, a large model of the head, which is pulling wood through the water and fully understood claymation insert that actually looks pretty good. There are also a couple of cute provincials in it, and they carry most of the intentional humor in the film. Grim finale left us mourning the death as a monster, and one of our favorite provincials, so every good thing about this film is dead until the end of this. Why did I suffer from this conclusion? Whether it was a sad song played over the closing credits? Or am I just cried internally for the time I wasted watching movies like this?
