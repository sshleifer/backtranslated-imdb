This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I take it as a joke, expecting to get a chuckle out of the first scenes, and let me say that I have never laughed so hard in my life. The first scene where Ninja accidentally pop out of the air and start a huge fire and funny battle is one of the most incredible moments of funny silly action movie of my life. This is not a dinosaur movie, but more than a movie that mocks (and it is not all) of the genre action. I have not seen the first two, but judging by the complexity of the plot, I do not think there are that I missed. If you want to watch a movie, which is a large six-pack or any herbal remedies, which I urge you to make this film, and sit back and watch 100 years of progress in the movies throw in the trash and get shit on by carnosours
