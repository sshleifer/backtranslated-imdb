This is one of those movies where I want to, I just stayed at the bar. <br /> <br /> The film is quite frankly boring. What history is very shaky, and you pretty much have to guess it. Film pamper yourself with pretentious camera techniques that seem intent on causing migraines and make him look like a student film. I said that it was sad already? If all the characters died suddenly at the end of the movie, I would not care less, because I had no emotional attachment to any of them. <br /> <br /> There are about 4 minutes of good in this movie, but it was about that. This is the first time I considered leaving the theater, during the performance, but I held on, believing that it was supposed to be better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> kind of film you could threaten naughty children.
