Do not waste 90 minutes of your time to Â«Fast Food, Fast Women." It's a shame episodic script with three subjects fixed together ridiculously bad for predictable letter, hardcore action, and even bad music. I found anorexia protagonist upset watch every time it was on the screen. It needs fast food. <br /> <br /> Spend 90 minutes you devote to this turkey to do something more ... like cutting the nails on your feet. You have more entertainment value. <br /> <br /> The single redeeming thing about this film Lasser, but it deserves much better than this tired script. It is as impotent as the older guy she courts in the film. <br /> <br /> VIEWER BEWARE!
