I did not like it and frosty returns. Both movies are absurd with poorly written characters and bad voices. Voices could be done, but frosty return was worse than it is because of unalike they drew a snowman. winterwonder ground frost was great and so was the original touching drama. The only good thing about this film was frosty the snowman was equally classic 60s and funny lines, like when they were talking about things that are not real, and then walk frosty window buzzing, whistling, which he did, but everything else was poorly written and poorly animated, and I barely got the land. I saw the DVD cover in the library of about 2 or 3 years ago, and art look so lousy I did not pick it up until this year, because the pictures on the back looked a little touch, but I played the movie. It was a bad concern symbols of art as well as on DVD, and it was just awful what is happening. I watched it at night, and found it boring that I fell asleep on it all (Wait, I always do that when I look at something when I go to sleep), but the film was generally sad <br /> < br /> Overall score: score -C <br /> <br /> It's like another holiday special bad plagiarism in frost and return it. This one is a bad fourth sequel at home alone 4 well I thought the movie was ok, but it alone was a great 3 houses. But this is a bad home alone 3 or 4 people hate like this. My sister did not look that much because when she came into my room to look at the 2 and a half, she was gone, like, "I hate the animation!" I agree with her as well as the third one frosty returns. Plain awful!
