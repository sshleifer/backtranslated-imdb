I do not know ... sometimes you try try and try to be compassionate towards all B through Z class of films out there, but once in a while a particular movie just feels your patience as you do not want to slam all the participants. «Bat People» (which I have seen under the title "He lives Night») is such a film. You can not look at it without thinking that it actually was an episode in the «Night Gallery», and not one of them better, either. <br /> <br /> The film has something to do with the doctor who gets bitten by a bat, and thus, is becoming a Were-BAT, who drinks human blood. (In fact, you might think that if he turns into a real bat, he will eat the mosquito-gallon bucket, but because it's cheap, sinister horror movie, the blood is the word.) Despite the fact that he has a face -prypadki on level ground, and dense episodes almost every night, his friend and fellow physician, Dr. Mustache Aspen Extreme, insists that he is just being "allergic reaction" to rabies shots. at the same time, the most unpleasant and stereotypically the world's County sheriff's Office suspects the document to be responsible for the brutal murder and obeskr infusion of a few local girls (and one drunk). In addition, at the time, the doctor's wife decides that the denial of a river in Egypt, and in turn protects him and nags him to distraction. <br /> <br /> This is not so much that acting is bad - you can tell that the actors do a professional level of choice, and try to bring the juice and the life of the script, even the guy who plays the sheriff, (Well, that's too bad, but it's bad cliché, wooden, professional) . It's just that everything about acting, how scenes marching, costumes, dialogue, script and story in general sets your teeth on edge, and makes you want to, well, slam all participants. <br /> <br /> I think that the film was a small chance for a while frightening, alarming little cult, BUT: <br /> <br /> 1) the director had to beat Michael Pataki experienced character actor, with a chair until molasses has not agreed to act rather than simply a channel by Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> 2) It also had to find a script that made a little more sense in relation to the entire "Bata human bites, which is then converted in Bath" scenario. <br /> <br /> 3) It also needed an actor who played a doctor to find a bit more physically plausible bit of stage business "episodes" for him, instead of reaching out to the "fit man" page with golden pattern book Little perform the function of affectation. <br /> <br /> 4) He must process all "wife" character, to make it as a smarter, less shrill and waaaaay more observant. <br /> <br /> I would never again volunteered to watch this movie, except with the help of Mike and boots. This is bad, but it's not bad in the silly, humorous or interesting way. Even better than «Battlefield Earth» or «Waterworld», though.
