One of the previous reviewers wrote that there seemed to be no middle for Love Story opinions; one loves him or hates him. But it seems an excellent distribution of opinions across the scale from 1 to 10. For me, this film is an opinion 4. There are some beautiful scenes and places, and Ray Milland is transformed into a fabulous job as a father, Oliver. But the film did not particularly convincing job of telling their story, and the story was not so unique to warrant a few viewings, at least not for me. Maybe I'm a little snob, but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Neal - I still have not seen Barry Lyndon - because most of them, but not all, destroy me with your presence. The only exception is what it is, Doc, in which the straight performance is ideal for underlining Goofball hero Barbra Streisand - and not by chance, he takes a shot at Love Story for good measure! McGraw and O'Neill, as a rule, their circle line, rather than acting them <br /> <br /> The film is notable for the beginning of a fine career :. It was the first film of Tommy Lee Jones.
