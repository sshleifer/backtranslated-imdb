Pasolini or Pee-wee, as I prefer to call him (because of his love of male genitalia showing) is perhaps the most over-priced European director Marxists - and they are thick on the ground. As you can see, the "art" in this dirty, cheap sex-Romp brew for me. Some of the "stories" here could have come straight out of a soft core porn, and I'm not so much with reference to the nakedness, but simplified and banal, often nonsensical stories. Anyone who enjoyed this relatively watchable, but dumb fad must exactly one `s teeth into soft porn series of the German 70s movie« Der Schulmaedchenreport », because it is what" The Decameron, "I think. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is sloppy at almost all levels, from beginning to end: <br /> <br /> 1. Editing. Example: 1 hour: 15 minutes: 45 seconds there chasing scene that refers quite clearly in the wrong place. He had to be placed in about a minute, but I believe that Pasolini should hire Kutilo up editor, who have little time for the "small details" movie-making. Pee-wee fans would probably oppose this, saying that it was placed there deliberately - I very much doubt. Furthermore, even if this were true, it would be even worse, because the story gets absolutely nothing, making it more difficult to follow. (This is not exactly «Eraserhead» or one of a torn form Tarantino movie ...) <br /> <br /> 2. Acting. Vey messy. Three fans pee in (all 8 of them) is proud to announce that as 3P-O uses the "real people, not actors." (Do not cast people? Or are they the Martians? Of course, many actors poor IQs, but it does mean that we should treat them with contempt? ...) Other filmmakers have used a fan and failed (such as Alan Parker or De Niro ), why lovers PNP so completely terrible in his films? The answer again is terrifying untidiness. Pasolini slovenly in everything, and that includes trying to get as much of his toothless fans as he can. He is a lazy director, IMperfectionist, if you like. Anti-Kubrick, I guess ... The main purpose of Pee Wee, when the casting had to find so many toothless old men, as much as possible (and young people who are on your taste). In the world of Pasolini has a simple formula: absence of teeth + strange face = realism. This is all well and good to have them toothless, but at least try to make up for some, at least in part a decent performance of these inexperienced neo-thespians, otherwise you're a fan yourself - amateur director, in the case of Pasolini. Whether 3P-0 was not able to exploit it or simply do not care, nothing will change. (Who knows ... maybe he did not even notice the terrible role?) <br /> <br /> 3. Audio. Synchronization. If 3P-0 felt that microphones too much trouble during the filming, he should have at least made a concerted effort in post-production, that is, to receive all those bum actors say their lines on cue in the studio, so that we, the audience will not see their mouths move while elusive dialogue floats in another place in the movie. <br /> <br /> 4. Lack of vision. We have close to a dozen stories that are not related in any significant way. Some of them are anti-clerical (more on this later), and some of them just sex that thread cheap men (sometimes gay) fantasy, directed not tickle and nothing else. Stories and characters are not funny (if at all) on an intellectual level, but also at the low level. 10-year-olds can laugh here ... And there's nothing wrong with that, but do not call it the sublime intellectual art! <br /> <br /> 5. As a result, paragraph 4, there is also a lack of logic in the order history. It goes without saying. Pee-wee could have placed an order in any other way, and we would have had the same film. It also means that you can feel free to start from the middle and then return to the top, etc. "Decameron", like a bowl of spaghetti this way: when you start to eat it, you can start with any stream you want, it makes no difference. <br /> <br /> 6. The senselessness stories resolutions. Most of the stories end with cheap vomiting / joke, that is some damn dumb pointe straight porn comics, while some stories do not even have a conclusion: they just come to an end. Finito. At best, these stories watchable half-jokes, hardly deeper meaning is - if you do not find "deep" value in porn. There is, of course, nothing is easier than to seek and find "meaning" where there is a lack of it. Thus, even any hardcore porn movie can be philosophized / pondered endlessly. It's easy and fun. Try it on you 8 PPP fans! < br /> <br /> regard to Church-bashing ... Some audiences get all excited about his attack on Catholicism and what-not, in principle, it's all well and good -. in the end, I'm an atheist myself - but then, these people ignore this simple but essential fact that Pasolini was a Marxist. it's like the pot calling hours .? Rny Kettle Marxists criticize the Church for hypocrisy and stupidity where he gets the nerve In addition, Pasolini was not an atheist, so his arrogant and smug attitude is not justified in the end, the Marxists are parishioners:. They just framed accepted god with the idea of ​​utopia, which is just another supernatural wishful thinking fantasy .. So I can not get excited about anti-religion antics IFR <br /> <br /> This babble humpdorama anthology ends with a rather pretentious Pasolini said: "It's interesting. .. Navosha and produce a work of art, if it's good just to dream about it? "He was not really referring to is silly cinema as an art, it was ...? If it was - a poor man makes a mistake - then I have to wonder why he did not just leave him to sleep, and do all those bad movies ... <br /> <br /> Do you want to read my changed subtitles Bergman movies?
