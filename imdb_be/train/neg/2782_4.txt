Just saw the movie last weekend, I'm upset, disappointed with him. In principle, the film tells the story of immigrants, those from the former Soviet Union, in particular, have come to this country, to bring whatever they can with them from the old country, and invade and take over what the Americans are working. It is very wrong to look at immigration, and much worse way to tell people about it. This is the most important thing. Another thing is a general letter, directing and filming at the level of rural lovers. Actors have done quite well, but it was not up to them to keep this pile of shit. A few jokes were funny, but most of them are bad and cheesy. I can not wait to get out of the theater, I want to get my money back.
