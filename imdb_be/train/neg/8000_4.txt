I already know that the critics and some viewers say it was a satire, there were many political and social messages, names make references to some other names, etc. It can be. I can not realize such things (I do not want to do anyway) because I'm not interested, I'm interested in "movies." As for the film itself, again say that the film is smart and much more powerful. I could not see anything that we have not seen in the films of monsters, except for a scene that takes place in the office during the second half. Yes, this scene says something about humanity, but that does not make the film brilliant. The film does not entertain (gently) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but nothing more. As for the lack of a large movie is visual effects. It was just a shock, I could not pull myself together for a while, because I was expecting a realistic monster, because it is not one of the old movie Gojira, it was done in 2006, but it was not. It's as if you do not believe that there is a monster, you can not take care of. If you agree with me about this, I strongly recommend you a monster, which is very realistic. Monster design is not interesting, but, at least, is planned, there is an effort. Radically powerful critique. Some critics say about it, as if it were a film of Kurosawa. Yes, it is rather a drama than a thriller or action, but this does not mean that it is much more powerful. I do not want to compare the host with other monster movies, but I try to keep in mind that the owner does not do something that the other monster movies do. By the way, maybe some people call the film a masterpiece because of their sympathy for Asian cinema. Yes, I love Asian cinema too, but it's a fact.
