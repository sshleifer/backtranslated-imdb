I must warn this by stating that I am a fan of Dolph Lundgren. The man turns out to be some of the funny action clich√© imaginable and detention, probably my personal favorite. * Spoiler * even if there is no such thing as a spoiler Dolph, because the script is so absurd to begin with: in the chase scene with a disabled child, carrying a gun against a guy on a Harley with a sub-machine gun, through the high school corridor and the child wins? Good game, Oscar goes to detention. Dolph, if you are reading this, thanks for the laugh, an old friend <br /> <br /> As a result :. Fine film that is a guaranteed laugh. I recommend to invite some friends to it and forces them to sit through it. Hilarious.
