Again and again you hear a radio DJ, inviting the listener to assign movies, the listener can not stand or never watched the whole way through. This is a film that I think ... days later. <br /> <br /> This is to do something from Shakespeare. Not sure, but I think I jumped into this movie about 20-plus minutes in his ... I think I realized that my toenails are not cut themselves, and they looked at me pleadingly to cut. <br /> <br /> this film just seemed sad and pretentious to me. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this is the first film that I have already given a low score to (I actually tried to watch), I would not want to put you to the other films on his English director Peter Greenaway. I remember thinking that he was "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover" was a truly great British film, although its content was sometimes stomach churning, brilliant film, but I can understand why people do not want to see. <br /> <br /> Another good movie Greenaway was "Zed and two noughts." Again, it was some content, pushed the boundaries of good taste, but it was intriguing, nonetheless. <br /> <br /> On the other film that I think is usually too late for such a radio show theme is "Brazil". I never have been able to watch all the way through or ennobled sleep! <br /> <br /> If you have a taste for the self-importance of films that really puttingly stylized, carefully paced and hard to follow, then steer clear of Prosero books.
