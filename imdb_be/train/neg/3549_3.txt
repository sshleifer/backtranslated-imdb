Do you stand up? Then stay away from this ... <br /> <br /> In the early rounds, it really is good comics, but if they did not get some nice qualities, they got a chance to snowball. Any controversial material, and you OUT! ... and I think that as painful as discarded comic books, when I see someone letting dishonest judge. <br /> <br /> 1 of my top 4 made it farther than qualifying. Half + 0 finalists gave me laughing. Some of them raised their material elsewhere, something the judge seems to have no problems with. <br /> <br /> This is more interesting than much more on television, but incredibly difficult to watch without contemplating what it might be. <br /> <br /> If the producers changed the name of the competition for "The Last Clown StandingÂ», all my criticism will lose validity. Maybe the idea?
