For many years, I remember reading about this show, "The Trouble with Tracy" in TV Guide. CCTS-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6 am! I lived about two hours drive north of Toronto, and we could not get TSFTY, but you know how it is -. We always want what we can not have <br /> <br /> Well, I knew what I wanted and what I wanted to see that this "problem with Tracy" was all about. Did he have a beautiful girl in the lead role? Is nudity was? It was unknown? Was it a comedy? It would be nice if there was some progress show. At least, I would know what I was missing. But no! The mystery drove me bonkers until C branch CK entirely rebuilt transmitter in Wiarton, Ontario and began broadcasting "The Trouble with Tracy" at the same time as the CCTS .... Saturday morning at 6:00 am !! One Saturday morning I got up and turned on the television at 5:59, and finally, I have to see that Â«The Trouble with Tracy" was. So, "The problem with Tracy" was the fact that he is Canadian content and stuck into harmless 6am place, so that no one will ever see, how terrible it was. <br /> <br /> A talented Canadian actor Steve Weston died a few years after this, but many will argue it is effectively "dead" for the first time he appeared on the show. When I saw him for the first time that a cold Saturday morning and fell depressed back on his bed, a part of me died too.
