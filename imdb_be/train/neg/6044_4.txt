Well put together an entry in the genre serial killer who, unfortunately, gets mired down in his pretentious to be truly satisfied. Willem Dafoe as beautiful as New York detective trying to track down what appears to be an imitator, using the same artistic techniques related deaths Renaissance, used a series of murders, he decided years earlier. Speedman is a junior partner Defoe, and they have very good chemistry (at least for a while). Other characters emerge convenient to link the two cases together. Duvall is a member of the early casualties and Peter Stormare is a kind of art-broker / teacher Defoe ... it's a little hard to take, even though Stormare is, of course, never a dull moment. The ending of the film is particularly disappointing. Look quickly, Debbie Harry as less than forthcoming in neighbor Defoe.
