I do not want to say that this film is terrible, because I've seen worse, but this is not even half-way decent. <br /> <br /> The plot is very intricate. I could not understand what was happening and where things are going. When the film was finished, I was left scratching my head. I watched until the end credits to see if they have something behind them, that can clean things up, but as soon as the credits are over, that was it. I felt that I was uncomfortable from one weak area location to another throughout the film, with little or no transition between them. <br /> <br /> The development of character is very shallow. I could not understand when someone was angry had a grudge against someone. I could not tell, when half of the characters simply has to be drunk, stoned, mentally retarded, or they just had a bad actor to reflect them. This film seems to be based around stereotypes (on a loan, it is difficult to avoid the use, if you make a film about the singer in a rock band), which should make the character development easier, as many other films have illustrated the suffering of an abused child, or tests heroin addict trying to clear. Stereotypes easily portray that might explain why so many bad movies are usually abused by stereotypical characters. This film, on the other hand, uses stereotypical characters left and right, and then tries to save them as incomprehensible as possible. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the characters that they seemed to be dismissed without any explanation. I think this is normal, because so much time was spent on character development, I do not really get a chance to know any of them, so I never missed a single one of them. <br /> <br /> Last but not least was singing Sadie. It's terrible. Music back she did not medal winner, but it is usually muted squeals released from the vocal cords Sadie. I swear that there is one point in the movie where she sings a song, at least 10 minutes. I seriously thought I was going to have to turn it off in this howl-a-Thon. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is confusing. Characters are not well developed, existing in Georgia wooden and stiff character Sadie will be pulled from one bad situation to another, without the history or explanation. The music was unbearable, and I can think of any good reasons to see this movie, if you have a thirst for cinematic pain.
