I've seen this movie years ago, and I was amazed ... but then again I was only 12 years old. I recently watched it again and I want time ago. This film is very bad. While I like Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (see My Bodyguard (1980), if you would like to see a good film, it was ... meatballs (also starring Bill Murray) for some laughs), and Burgess Meredith, this role does / did nothing for his career. <br /> <br /> In any case, Lee Majors character, Franklyn Hart, a former race car driver who plans driving his racing car (which he had in store) across the country California. One problem: The government outlawed all private transport. I thought the concept was okay (not the worst I've heard), but was not performed badly.
