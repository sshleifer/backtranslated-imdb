We all know that countless NRB decorated 80s slasher genre, and often do not deserve nothing but our deep disgust. Maybe it's a little hastey but damn when «Slaughter High» was not very unoriginal, even for a slasher flick. Pretty much, the plot involves a child who experienced the soul of Carrie-like humiliation in high school, and returns to seek revenge on the old group of ex-bullies, who are all to remember. As might be expected, they were killed permanently masked madman April 1, with an electric current, burning, hanging, and chemically modified beer. I have some problems with the plot details and settings of the film, but considering the end, I feel the need to drop my complaints and just say that it is a waste of time. Ignore any thought watching this film ...
