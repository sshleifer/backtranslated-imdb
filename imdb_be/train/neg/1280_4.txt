When I saw the title of this movie, I always thought that it was a musical. As "Harvey Girl." It's not. This pudding that overcooked, click on the kitchen ceiling and torn and repaired. No music, and no part of the period, but it is improbable. <br /> <br /> It begins with the patriarch of James Woods tells the eldest of his three daughters, a young child who grows up to be Barbara Stanwyck, that it should maintain the name and home. <br /> <br /> So, we think that this will be a historical intergenerational story. And that, in a short time. Then he turns to the story of the heartless struggle against lawyer Stanwyck George Brent. Why is she so determined against him? Well, why else? As we learn in a strange sequence retrospective narrated Stanwyck, she once thought she could do for the money (for my sisters and myself, of course) by marrying. She hit what she took to be a redneck, which was actually a promising lawyer Brent. <br /> <br /> To no one thinks that the child they had, the young man of the eight or so during the main plot - well, you know ... they had a hasty marriage, and within a very short period of time they were together, it was conceived <br /> <br /> One of her sisters in love with the artist by the name of Gig. Young, who plays Gig Young. Another sister is trying to pick it up. Etc., etc. <br /> <br /> This is a shrill, unengaging mess - worked well enough, but without a shred of logic or plausibility.
