When I heard that the Dukes of Hazzard had to be converted to current actors and the whole script, I was like, "OK, I'll give him a chance, it will not be better than the first, but we'll see what happens." Well, I saw what happened. I saw the large end of the 70/80's show, which was a classic, mostly understated Hollywood. It's so sad to see that Hollywood scriptwriters could not come up with something original these days. They seem to take a great show, which had a large audience, and try to "remake" the classic show. HEADS UP galiv Uda ... that's not Workin !!!! Anyway, more about the show. I think they could have cast a better actor than Seann William Scott (Stiffler from American Pie) to play Bo. I am convinced that John Schneider, of course, disappointed with the way his character was painted and used. in addition, to get a really, Johnny Knoxville as Luke Duke. how low can you go ?? shitty ass actor to play attractive, Luke. it sickens me. In addition, I will give Jessica Simpson beautiful woman, but her action sucks. Catherine Bach who played Daisy in the original, was a smart, sexy, strong, stubborn and good Southern girl il. It was every little girl role models growing! (I owned a doll and Jeep - thank you very much !!!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a smart ass, 2-bit whore as Daisy Duke. Daisy has never been a blonde. Why should they throw it. Jessica Alba would have played a great Daisy Duke. She can talk with great southern accent, and she's gorgeous, and would have done an excellent job. Anyway, I would like to say that this film is undermined, February. I feel like I was ripped off, paying $ 8.50 for the tickets, and they should get their money back. If you want to Dukes Hazzard (original series) does not see this movie. It will just frustrate you. CMT (Country Music Television) is playing reruns of the Dukes later all the time at night. So set your TIVO and go with the real thing, not an imitation on the big screen in Hollywood.
