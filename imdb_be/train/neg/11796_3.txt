nothing else on TV? You really boring? Well, then look Phat Beach. However, do not rent it out and, of course, do not buy it. That would be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I watched it on television and found myself in laughter at certain points. I have not laughed for a long time, and I did not laugh hard. Nevertheless, there were subtle jokes and comments that I laughed. If you are looking for a very funny "cap" then watch a movie on Friday. If you are looking for a powerful emotional film (something that this film tries to at..kind) look something like hoop dreams or Lyric Jason. If you, for whatever looks good Black "booty" is watching a porn movie Dominic Simone, because she was already in this film almost does not exist. However, if you have nothing better to do, and it's on cable, go ahead and watch it. You'll be a little amused. <br /> <br /> *** *** 3 of 10
