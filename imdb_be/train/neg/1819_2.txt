I was looking for this movie for one reason - Al Adamson. He is one of the worst director of all time - right up there, Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and terrible pantheon. However, I was a little disappointed, because despite the fact that the movie was really bad, he never approached the terrible levels of some of his earlier films schlocky. Due to the fact that this film was not particularly interesting to watch us bad movie buff. <br /> <br /> Now I was cautious about watching this film, as the title of "Naughty Stewardesses" make the sound of the film as pornographic film - something I would not consider to IMDb. However, this film was this from time to time - especially in the first 10 minutes. But you could say that the script has undergone many changes, as well as for most of the film there is no tickling at all, and at the end of the film there is a story that comes out of no where, that hard and is certainly not sexy! The result of all this is a complete mess. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the many pieces are not even good. For example, as the porn video, it shows surprisingly little, and it is unclear why they would put a 71-year-old guy in some of the love scenes. Of course, for the 71-year-old Mr. Livingston he looked pretty good - but it was still the old, and no one would like to see that he gets it with a young nymphet! Then, when the last 20 minutes are very strong, like Livingstone became Rambo as a guy! It is about a strange and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> In general, there is little to recommend this boring film. It's not so bad or sexy enough to take care of, and the film manages to be pretty boring, even with such a crazy name like "naughty stewardesses".
