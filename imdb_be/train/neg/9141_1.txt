About the people that was Sam Mraavich thinking? That someone who was involved in this "film" to think? Mraovich is the leader with almost all "Ben and Arthur": director, screenwriter, producer (! Also executive producer) Caster whether you will be called in a star, he did it. And he (Mraovich) sucks more than anyone ever sucked in every department of cinema. <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with this movie? All. The film about two gay lovers, Ben (Jamie Brett tapestry) and Arthur (Mraovich- * groan *). Ben Arthur and want to get married in a world where all basically hate gay. To make things worse, crazy "ex-wife" Ben (they did not divorce), Tammy (Julie Belknap) will evaporate with the mind that Ben had left her for another man, and requires Ben that they get back together (say it can be gay, too!) and Arthur Christian faithful, too hypocritical, just as moved as Tammy's brother, Victor, is passionately make Arthur to turn right, and then try to kill him after he gets kicked out of his church. <br /> <br. /> The film is absolutely chock-a block with so many inconsistencies (ie, Ben and Arthur fly to Vermont to get married- they go on Alaska Airlines and Vermont have the palm, they fly back to the FedEx cargo plane I hope that they were comfortable in wood box, as well as much, much more) and the opening portion to load (Victor calls the murder of Arthur "final plan", which was later changed to «the final Deed», Arthur and private (trainee) detective drive the same car, the blockade blah blah). "Actors" everything is very bad, and way, way over the top; scenario ridiculously awful (one such example: "I am does not make sense, you have no sense I have a sense, this is who makes sense"), and there is a lot more wrong with "cinema", I can 't write them all down . <br /> <br /> However, even the most ridiculous thing about the incredible "Ben and Arthur" is that Sam Mraavich thinks he has created something that is really fantastic (see his fake reviews for "Ben Arthur" and his explicit comments on YouTube.). Mraovich is a narcissist and his arrogance blinds him to see how badly anything with his name actually. <br /> <br /> So, to conclude, to forget all the bad movie, in your opinion, is the worst movie Forever "Ben and Arthur" knock them right the title, even Paris Hilton look like a movie "the Dark Of Knight "as compared to the monster known as" Ben and Arthur.
