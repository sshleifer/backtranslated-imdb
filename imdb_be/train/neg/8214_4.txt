This is not exactly plumb the depths of Creepshow 3, but it is coming. It also uses the same technique of using the same actors in different roles throughout the anthology, which distracts attention, to say the least. <br /> <br /> also very irritating Gloomy tear zone (s bookstore be compared with later Night Gallery Serling). Unfortunately, the producers and writers have forgotten that Serling would create sympathy for his characters, before you indulge in them. None of the characters are not particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment <br /> <br /> cropping history :. Adam West ... well, himself. He is not Bruce Wayne / Batman 60s mannered route, but it rarely does. He just plays-especially-the mysterious "J" (there is a sinister terrible name for a comparison with a similar Dr. Terror, Eramus, and Cryptkeeper), and makes some slightly awkward / awful statement. <br /> <br /> Abernathy: Seen Rod Serling's "Stop at Willoughby"? Then you have seen this. Red Herring nutso wife introduced without purpose, but even one of the protagonist identifies him as a wimp. A well directed, as might be expected, but mostly incoherent <br /> <br Nex /> in Diner :. "Meeting of the Minds" Reminds different time Serling travel stories, mixed with Steve Allen Most of the actors are not so bad (Josh Chill like Cassius, who manages to walk, talk or even breathe uncomfortable with the exception), and the idea of ​​a moderately interesting. But Abernathy, he It does not go anywhere. the protagonist raises some relatively reasonable questions, errors with a few (who would not?), and for some reason he ends up exiled in a nuclear wasteland <br /> <br /> Life Replay :. not a bad little piece and controls precede both Click and Creepshow 3. I think that says something that the people of . Aravan magical properties remotes protagonist of cute little nothing inherently innovative here, but that's okay <br /> <br /> morale:. .. you see a turn for the mile, but, as the protagonist, he has a heart and it is a decent history of destruction and redemption <br /> <br /> Finale:? So ... why people end up in refrigerators in silver lame dress I do not know. It does not make sense. Yes ... all the characters went to a bookstore and became trapped in? Interesting undermines the happy ending with a boxer (thanks guys!), And the guy in the first segment of the dead. So how does he fall into the trap? He might visit a bookstore, before he died, and stuck ... not dead? What? And? I supposer is not expected, it makes sense, because it is supernatural. But still ... <br /> <br /> In general: basically no different from the two new series Twilight Zone, or some episodes of fairy tales from the Darkside or monsters. The last two floors and part of the second, probably worth your time. But there is nothing really spectacular here.
