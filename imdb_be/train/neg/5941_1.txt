As a supporter of Notorious B.I.G., I look forward to this film. I'm sad to see that this is a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not convincing enough or realistically portray Notorious B.I.G. A lot of history is a real son of Notorious B.I.G. in Christopher Jordan Wallace as the Notorious B.I.G. as a child. Unfortunately, it is not sufficiently convincing to pay tribute to his father. Derek Luke as unconvincing as Sean «Puffy» Combs. In a nutshell, no convincing enough to play a role here. The big problem with this, there are real people, they play. It was sad, and did not give any information about Notorious B.I.G. that supporters and non-amateurs did not already know. I was particularly disappointed with Angela Bassett, a very good actress unused here Voletta Wallace. Bullets movie and snails to think together, Notorious B.I.G. fans will be spending a lot of money on this. I'm sad to say that it happened. It is nowhere close to a good movie. I expected so much of him, but unfortunately I did not get what I wanted from it. I think you have to miss it.
