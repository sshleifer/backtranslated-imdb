For those who yearn for a remake in 1989. Slaves of New York. What is it, seven of you? Here it is ... it was. <br /> <br /> This film has a hard undercooked fresh characters (well, they are kids club, I'm a big jerk!), who are in the waiting area. The big question seems to be just how long a person can stay young juvenile? It took three people to write this "story"? My God, it was easier to come up with Citizen Kane. Instead, the audience back, this film is simply to confuse anyone who has been the scene-erased at the beginning of the 90s. <br /> <br /> The idea that fifty years a woman is jealous of a bunch of self-absorbed children from another era of peace, as the only self-centered, twentysomethings could imagine it. Odd Box is one of the library waiting for Sun podagovor equivalent of Parker Posey Breakin 2: Electric Bugaloo. Her "I'm serious about graduate school!" While the stripper grinds her hysterics. wisecrack Posey always fun, but there are projects that are under it. I was asleep before he crossed the 40-minute mark.
