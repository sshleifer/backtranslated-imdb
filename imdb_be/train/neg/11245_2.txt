I went to the theater on Sky Captain in 2004, expects a good movie. Almost every review of this film had positive effects look attractive, convincing previews. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the disappointment does not really describe the feeling I got from this film. It was anger. <br /> <br /> In addition, boring and poorly written, the reason this film gets 2 out of 10 stars because everything in the movie was stolen from another source. I understand the difference between respect and theft: the theft. More importantly, it seems that the filmmakers did not steal progress point or move the plot along. They stole, to show that they could. There, there is literally no point to show a clip from The Wizard of Oz in the theater at the beginning of the film, except to set another scene (I will not dwell on), who steals from the same film. Needless to say, every concept in the film was neither original nor even spin on an old concept: it was literally just a rehash of what we have seen, from the pulp era of robots, resembling the old Superman Cartoons and the recent film "The Iron Giant" , to the silent martial artist minion of the villain, which has been used in countless films, the best known in recent years as Darth Maul in "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace" <br /> <br /> on the subject of the actual film. most of the performances were completely wooden. Perhaps this is because in the entire film was made on a blue screen, filled PC images throughout the preserve of actors. To be honest, this is not an excuse for bad actions. If a person was ever a child, they understand that the lack of visual orientation is not a reason not to try. <br / > <br /> in the end, there is no humanity in this film. the main actors are the only real human beings here. Almost all of the antagonists of the robots, and the number of friendly characters that are shown during the film can be counted on the fingers of one hand. If robots are attacking the planet, we should not wait to see the mass of humanity, coming from them? Sub-par performance of the main characters does not allow us to connect to, in fact, anything here. <br /> <br /> The film would be the worst movie there, so I did not give him one. Most likely, the film was an example of everything that is wrong with modern fighters: the filmmakers tried to justify the film with special effects, but without the artistic vision or originality of any kind, it falls flat.
