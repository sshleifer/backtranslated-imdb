I was not expecting much from this telefilm. You must set the bar lower than you would for a midget suspended for any movie TBS starring Antonio Sabato Jr. However, he managed to upset, otherwise even be a good bad movie. <br /> <br /> Each scene mechanically, as if someone cut and paste scenes from dozens of movies and TV shows associated with big business plots in the script, he leaned back and said, "My work is done." It's all a cliché, all predictable, and, worse, the actors are forced to watch as they take it seriously, (even when the development of the plot ridiculous). <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Clock «The X-Files", if you're in the mood for paranoia. They work better. Also, let someone know that sitting through «Fatal Error» just.
