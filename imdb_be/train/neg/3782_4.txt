Here's the good news first. "Spirit" is the most visually incredible animated feature in the current version of your home theater. Works of art and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend you give this movie to see in effect only visually. <br /> <br /> And now the bad news. I really mean when I say that the animation is the only thing this movie has going for it. You may remember that the "Spirit" got a bad smash on "Lilo & Stitch" last summer. The first man, who claims that this is because Disney more stable and better advertising can write me a four-page essay titled "Why" Lilo and Stitch "in the script does not stink." <br /> <br /> For all the incredible new animation technology on the screen in the "Spirit", the story is almost * surprisingly boring. There is a lesson here, and (self-evident), this applies not only to the animated film. You can have the most stunning visuals ever adorn the eyes of death, but if your story is sad and, more importantly, we do not care about their characters, it's bad filmmaking. Simple as that. Animation is still strange; I just can not wait to see what someone with great imagination makes him.
