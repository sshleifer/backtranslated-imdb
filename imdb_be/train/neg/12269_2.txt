Japenese sense of pacing, editing and the score should be different from American tastes, but of course, this movie could have been so much more with a little more post-production workflow. <br /> <br /> Someone in Hollywood this film need to re-do, and I think it will be a great success. The history is interesting and terrible. There's something about the edges of the city, sandy police, earthquakes, sanatoriums and mysterious marine murder, which is enough to be exciting. However, this story has to do a bit of common sense and maybe about 40 minutes shorter. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the effect is "gut feeling" was in full force in this film, and it was obvious from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Today, fans of Japanese movies only die-hard should bother to see it on film so boring.
