First, let's get it out of the way. ,, Yes, this film steals LOT of «Darkness Falls» (2003). The plot for the «Darkness Falls» goes something like this: Tooth Fairy, killing a woman who hides her face due to injury kills the people who look at it from revenge. In the "Tooth Fairy" (2006), mutilated Tooth Fairy (which, yes, hides her face) unleashes her furious revenge on anyone just little too similar to be a coincidence <br /> <br /> But you need to ask that.: . If you are going to directly steal the exact plot of the movie, why choose something as mediocre as the «Darkness Falls»? of course, he made a few dollars at the box office, but it was strictly for pretty good theatrical experience of delivery of the film. Low-budget, straight to video movie will not have the same effect. this is not so. <br /> <br /> When I looked at the opening 15-20 minutes of the film but my expectations actually rose. There seemed to be at least some value products. History did not seem terrible, just blatantly ripped off. Past the first scene, we get a good throwing the characters, including the ex-doctor with secrets (in the performance of Man, that looks like Busey) and hot veterinary student (Jennifer Argento "Masters of horror: Jennifer.") After those few minutes, however, the film is just slow down the drain. It serves all the major terrible cliche, including, but not limited to :. Some crazy old man with unheeded warning, dumb amateur athlete, mental, and a stripper with a heart-of-gold <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems that the film had been his inability to follow the target audience. It's like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for any character was on the screen at the time. If adults on the screen, it was a more mature look. If a star (stripper) and whatshisface (Jock) was on the screen, the dialogue went down to a silly mistake immature level. If the child was on the screen, it was like an episode of "Afraid of the dark are you?". ,, only less scary. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the film overall. Visual range from fairly well the usual boring. Drawing up of irregularities, as acting for the most part. On the positive side, there is some excessive blood into parts (including pretty cool (yet painfully predictable)) garden shredder stage and quite vicious Nailgun scene. In addition, if you are looking for a little sexual material, there is a brief topless scene (but if you want to see this chick topless, there are better movies to do it). In addition, there is not much to worry about when it comes to this film. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of «Darkness Falls» (do they exist?) Maybe you can check it out to see history made in a different way. ,, But that's about the only reason that I can find to see this <br /> <br /> The verdict :. 3/10 -AP3-
