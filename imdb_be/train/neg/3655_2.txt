Oh, I think it may be the only Cheesiest film I've ever seen. I'm serious, this is one of the ultimate B-movie. The first proof that this is not a $ 5 DVD. Oh, no, it's too mainstream for it. I got it on VHS, with a hopper full of ex-rental videos at the local video store <br /> <br /> When I quote the annotation: ". In the 17th century lived in Japan Samurai, which would set the standard for centuries. His name was Mayeda. He goes on an epic journey around the world to acquire the 5000 Muscats from the King of Spain. while a violent storm on the sea swallows them precious gold, intended for the purchase of weapons and nearly takes his life. Mayeda have to fight all odds to survive and the fate of his beloved Japan ". Then he goes on to say "multi-million dollar epic action-adventure set on three continents» <br /> <br /> I must have seen another film. It was epic, and it is certainly not the millions of anything. No, «Shogun Mayeda" really just a crazy adventure Engrish-speaking Mayeda (Kosugi). he did not even Shogun actually, but that's not important. what is important is that it makes it really cool impression recharging John Cleese in one of the castle in "Monty Python and the Holy Grail ", and his ability to go from the serious scenes, to show off his samurai mind pavnamo tstvy. high. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this film Engrish accent Kosugi in. The film may lack almost everything that makes a good movie, but it makes up for it with some of the Cheesiest lines ever delivered cool Engrish accent ever. and to be honest, you really want anything else? you can fast forward «Shogun Mayeda" to the end, and repeat the last line Kosugi again and again. the tape is likely to be worn out before you are tired from this line. . High <br /> <br /> 2/10 - So very, very cheesy.
