This film proves that good acting comes from a good direction, and it will not happen in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell, as a rule, a great actor, but in this he is a minor. Donald Sutherland comes across as an amateur. Why? After a terrible scenario, adaptation and terrible actors seem tired and half of heart. The atmosphere of the film is bad - I could think of when it would end, and I turned it off halfway. The director has done a very poor job, and despite the fact that I have not read the novel, of course, missed the chance. The atmosphere of this film tries to call and message, and the story line never reaches the audience. In short, this is a terrible film.
