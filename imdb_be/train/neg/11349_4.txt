In fact, it's a lie, Shrek 3D was actually the first 3D animated film. I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago. Do not Bug life also do this? I think it was on a Disneyland in the tree, so I say, before they go and use it as it is a logo. Furthermore, Shrek was a 3d simulation of motion in Universal Studios. They should continue to treat it as a movie, as he appeared in the "theater", and you can buy it for DVD. The film has been nice, at least a little flyes were. I liked the IQ. I agree with Animaster, they made a god job with making a movie out of something that is simply because of back-and adventure. I recommend it to family and children.
