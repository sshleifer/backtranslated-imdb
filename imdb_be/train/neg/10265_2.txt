Kirstie Alley, looking a little slimmer, but only a little, in this mess together with the person who is MacGuyver double, white blond hair and all. The premise of the film about an old woman (50 !!!), who can not get her script, formed as a result of discrimination based on age, so she sends her younger nephew reflect the writer. Nya original idea and not a very good movie with lousy action, meaningless dialogue and ridiculous story. There is another section with respect to the writer with a crush or fad character Kirsten and why it comes in mystery. The actor, who draws a brother Kirsten is so wooden and miscast, is torture to watch their scene. What can I say about this movie. Avoid this.
