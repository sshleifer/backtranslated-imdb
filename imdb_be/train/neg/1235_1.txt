I'm really looking forward to see Planet of the Apes, but it was a huge dissapointment. <br /> <br /> The parameters and masks are great, but this is the only good aspect of the film. All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg does not work, it's only a movie, looking stupid. Other actors also not very good. <br /> <br /> But the worst point of all this history. That's ridiculous! For example, a monkey lying on the ground unconscious state, but people don `t attack them there, they wait until they are again! This is just one example of a silly story, but it would take too long to tell them all.
