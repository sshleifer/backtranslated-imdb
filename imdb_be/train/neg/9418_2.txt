This is a weak movie with a troubled history of cuts and re-name. It does not work. Firstly, the drama is all wrong. This is a very slow moving at first, and then quickly and satisfactorily coming to an end. But there are also (and this may have to do with cuts) awkward movement between genres. It starts with being a thriller to take at face value, and then degenerates into a farce, not a satire. ending may be funny, but it is also so stupid that I almost felt insulted my intelligence (what little there is). Thus, the film tries to be everything, but does not really excel at any level at all. You can also see that in a very unstable character development.You almost get the impression Connery plays three roles, not just one.
