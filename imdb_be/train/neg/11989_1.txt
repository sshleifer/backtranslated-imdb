This clunker film and sets new standards for a bad movie. Jared Rushton gives adequate performance very badly created character in the ill-fated film, thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie. The main thrust of the film as a temporary tour of the boy in the Canadian wilderness survived the crash Solo allows disgruntled teenager, having to deal with his longing for the revealing of illegitimate mother. Unfortunately, it turns into a bizarre collage of random "survival events" (including two especially sentimental scenes involving a bear fight) and the strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this child is not just sitting in an alley somewhere in the pot inventing it all film (and how awful it is!). In addition, despite the herald some reviewers family film appears to have some scenes are not suitable for very young children or family viewing, including the graphic scenes of the dead pilot under water with one of his eyes, seen disassembled. <, Br /> <br /> In general, a terrible movie that no one shall be subjected to much less innocent children.
