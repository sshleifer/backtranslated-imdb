By that time, as there was 3d technology (1950 I think) is the animation was made for him. I remember, in particular, Donald Duck cartoon Chip and Dale in it. I do not remember the name at the moment, but the plot was that Donald worked in a circus, was feeding the elephant nuts and Chip and Dale to steal nuts. This was done to see in 3D, probably 1960s. If you happen to watch Meet the Robinsons in 3D in theaters, they showed that this cartoon to the cinema and have explained part of his origin. There are probably somewhere around 100 cartoons made specifically for viewing through the 3D-glasses. This statement was a bad move, because it is not difficult to prove that they are wrong. In addition, it looks like a bad movie.
