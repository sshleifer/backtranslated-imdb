"Little Gray" is quite painful and wretched melodrama set of Jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of prison after a conviction on the probe related to drugs and struggling to stay clean, to find a place for themselves in life, and especially her love to play baby daughter, who are currently cared family of his brother. The only reason the movie to watch Maggie Zhillenhol, an actress at the top of his career, which is very well suited to the role and carries the entire film on his shoulders. This is not enough, however, as the storyline is too simplistic and expected, and emotional emphasis on the place - I kept asking myself all over the picture I supposed to be sorry for the former, and possibly future mothers of drug addicts as director and screenwriter wanted, or an innocent child who is in the middle. Even actor Maggie Zhillenhol can not convince me that I should no longer take care of the baby.
