Hello, can anybody hear me? I do not know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow watching this movie: join the fanclub! This movie was so incredibly bad, I could not help but laugh when I saw it. I think that it must be seen, it's bad in a good way. Each stencil ever invented for the horror film can be seen here. I'm afraid it's very difficult to get a copy of this film, but it must be in the top 10 worst films ever made.
