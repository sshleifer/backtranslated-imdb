First of all, I saw this movie when I was 7 years old in the Christian Scholl I attended. Needless to say, I was scared out of sight. Not because it was scary, but because content.Cmon ... I was 7. In any case, the cinematography was very bad, and the action was cheese. That's too bad, considering that I was only 7, and I remember that. The only thing that still bothers me that terrible song, "I want us all to be ready," where the chorus ends with "... you were." I would suggest seeing it. I probably would, just for nostalgic reasons. In addition, I am sure that the remake is much better. The best part of this film, though, should be, when all the "disappeared"; free cars to crash, lawnmowers, working at their own ... pretty hilarious.
