It was hard to watch this movie and be completely fair and objective, as I'm a big fan of the original film in 1944. This, for me and many others, is one of the greatest film noir ever made. Realizing that this is just a shortened made-for-TV movie, and that the majority of people smashed it, I was not expecting much, but you can not help but compare it to the 44 th film. Scene after scene, I found myself comparing what I was looking at her, and remembered how he played with MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson, and others. Now I have seen the well-known actors from the stage famous role is replaced by inclination, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. <br /> <br /> When it was over, I found that it was not as bad as I expected but it is not suitable for the 1944 original. The two main areas in which it has done for the television movie was not so good it was (1) the electricity between the two wires is not enough, and (2) is only 90 minutes, they rushed the story with little time to develop the story, the characters and the chemistry between the conclusions. Tilt and Eggar were flat and just not suitable for MacMurray and Stanwyck as "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis DietrichsonÂ» respectively. HN <br /> <br /> If it's held its own remake was in other characters, such as "the Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton." Cobb was terrific as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton, head of the insurance company. In addition, there were a few interesting to see the time frame has changed, so the houses, cars, telephones, tape recorders, etc., were all at the beginning of the 70s instead of the mid-40s. Otherwise, the story was very similar, only to rush. <br /> <br /> However, one view was enough, and I will happily return to the original version for the rest of my views of this classic stories and movies.
