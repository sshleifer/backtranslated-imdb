Dumb, cheap sci-fi thriller, made with almost complete absence of belief (control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decrypt messages from outer space controls only one person, and very poorly guarded at night) and full of mannerisms sound effects . Christopher Lee is not only wasted, but it also gives one of his few "I'm here strictly for the money" performances. (* 1/2)
