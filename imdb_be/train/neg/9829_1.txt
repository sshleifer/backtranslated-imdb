The premise was sucking me, but it was clear for about 30 seconds, it was a David Lynch or something is seriously scary. It is interesting to observe, just to run through a list of fundamentalist detergent. I may be a sucker for the spiritual part of the mixed (Romero comes to mind), but there was nothing spiritual about it at all. The message seems to be that we all have to pretend that there are 80 intelligence (or just get a lobotomy - Jennifer, what's wrong with ya) and blindly follow the Bible without any introspection Whatever it was, or we will run the second coming. It is this attitude that makes people buy Airbus 110 storey buildings (I work around the corner from the site of the former World Trade Center). I like to think that God is a little more than that.
