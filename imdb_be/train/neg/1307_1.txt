It was really a very bad movie. I'm a big fan of Italian horror, Argento, Mario Bova, Fulci and let even our good friend here Lambert sometimes goes with good. I found that the first two films, "Demons" be very interesting - they were so bad that they were great, but this one is just so bad that it is a very, very bad. This is very sad, the story never goes anywhere, and I hated the character - his wife slap husband and insinuating crybaby pain in the *** my wife drove me to the mind, it was not anywhere near enough history dedicated to Ogre, who was probably the best actor in the whole film. I turned it off for about three-quarters of the way through because I was very, very boring! Do not disturb.
