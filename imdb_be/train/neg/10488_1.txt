Elvis has left the building, and he was lucky because he did not have to watch it by a serious bitch. Scene after scene directed by Joel Zwick finds ways to make unfunny script even less funny. Filled unfunny death banal gay characteratures, and crack jokes, this film is more desperate than amusing. This kind of film that makes one hope Kim Basinger worth Doris Day in the early retirement. Let us remember her as she was (talented), not what it has become. David Leisure, delicious Dennis Richards, and the rest are wasted talent here. Nail finds a way to minimize their talents at every step. The guy plays more like Elvis than Homer King.The only really nice bit of casting is a young girl who plays Basinger as a preteen. She really looks like she's really very good. Just another reason to see this movie at all is to look for a cameo by Tom Hanks. Cameo is not all that funny, but at least it does not hurt. One has to wonder if the nail has incriminating photos Hanks or something that would get him to make this film.
