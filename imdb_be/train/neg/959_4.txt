I would give this movie 1 out of 10, if there were no ms. Claudine Barretto performance. and I will take this time to miss Kris Aquino here. and ... the end. <br /> <br /> I do not really watch Pinoy horror movies, because history is not lacking in originality, and I really think that (some of) the authors do not give enough attention to the characters (and their progression) in their history (Redundant ??) . it was as if they were "pushed" film of the year, when their story stinks. and has creative exhaustion led them to the plagiarism of other films. why ?? Why this film to get a good review ?? I would not give him a lot of good qualities. the film was a bit scary, but the film seemed more bizarre, as is the case with the Philippine folklore ... this is part of my list of "likely to take place" category. I just wish they spent more time improving the storylines and correct they do not flash back sequences, never mind if the lighting sucked, it does not really matter if the content will blow you away ..
