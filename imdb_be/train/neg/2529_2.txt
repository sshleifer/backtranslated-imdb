Bobby stupid child, smiling too much and wants sex. So he bought a van to help in this search. Acting lame, pathetic comedy and the script is nothing more than a slightly tensioned chain cliché and cheap thrills. The filmmakers clearly wanted to capture some of the madness out there other films of the time, but fell a long way short. They even resorted to Bobby slip on a banana skin, because it is supposed to add a comedic value. <br /> <br /> I'm struggling to find a softening of the film. If you want to DeVito, is another classic DeVito role - but he only actor and there is value cliché.
