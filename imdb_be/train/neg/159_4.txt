I've always admired Susan Sarandon its integrity and honesty in their personal life as well as her talents as an actor. I for this purpose found it surprising that it appears in the film, which is so distorted the facts. save her character from the South Pole was made by the Canadian charter company from Edmonton, Alberta volatile Canadian designed and built Twin Otter aircraft. The trip has been rejected by the US Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard as beyond their ability. The same company also organized a similar rescue in a few years to bring people from the base of the South Pole. I feel that the film was a very pretty fascinating subject and documented a very courageous woman is faced with a daunting task. I do not understand why the producers consider it necessary to ignore the courage to rescue pilots and show rescue aircraft as a USAF Hercules.
