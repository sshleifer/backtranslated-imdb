After just finishing a book on the same day I was watching the film, I knew that was going to happen. I had great expectations for the film, due to the rankings. The only reason I give this film 2 stars out of 10, it was in order to be trying to film. I have a few highlights that it is not like this movie. <br /> <br /> ********** ********** SPOILERS <br /> <br /> 1, Molding. Jack Nicholson barely fit into the character of Jack Torrance in. Besides, I would never have picked Shelley Duvall Wendy. I introduced Wendy quite differently. I can understand why they chose Jack Nicholson, though, teeth, pointy eyebrows, but it should not really look "evil". It should look fine, and he turns evil. In addition, they make one of the worst movies of pairs. Denis was good, he needs more life, though. He acted so booming. <br /> <br /> 2. The script of the film. They cut so many things that were in the book, and added things. Some of the things that were in the book that I'm looking forward to the film have either been removed, altered or handled incorrectly. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to see (the hedge animals, hammer Rock, elevator) were not in the movie, and it was 2 and a half hours !! I was very annoyed. <br /> <br /> 3. Ending. The ending was changed to complement, Halorann died, Jack froze, Wendy got hurt ... Overlook did not blow up. The ending was so cool in the book and the movie ruined it so badly, I apalled. Hallorann should never die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least, Jack used rock hammer. You've never seen Rock beater throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There are other things that I did not like about the movie, but there are things that have been all right. Camera Angels were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (not held in a book) was steep, but maybe I was too annoyed that the film did not go with the book to try to be scary at all. I recommend reading the book before seeing the movie. I applaud Stephen King actually agreed to sign a contract not Dis Kubrick more. I would never have done that, I would have taken all the right I could get to yell at him all day. I can not wait to see the 6-hour version, at least, it has a hedge animal <br /> <br /> Evaluation :. 2/10
