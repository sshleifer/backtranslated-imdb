I feel completely ripped off. Someone has to reimburse $ 4.95 I spent on the Blockbuster to rent this home clutter. This is not a musical, it is a waste of time, and my evening. What I do not get why this get spread in the first place ??? ... someone had to do some hard drugs, this deal was done overnight. I've seen better movies coming out of film school, and I was in film school, so I can say that as a fact. The quality of this work and just so very bad to see ... shot on DV ??? Nuff said. The songs are not songs, but just banter that sounds the same in each section. You want to see a good musical? THEN DO NOT RENT the movie.
