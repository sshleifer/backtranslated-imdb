This kind of film that wants to be good, but it sucks. First, what the hell those punk trying to do with the school? I think that children do not seem to realize the seriousness of the situation. Deker guy tell a girl that they are under their responsibility, if she asks why he wants to go after them, but immediately after that he gives a gun to a wheelchair man and wants him to go alone unrepaired phone line. Where responsibility is it? I understand the poor actors must pay their food, but why not just give them the money that is required to make a stupid movie like this, or to give the money to charity. Oh, and none of them knows how to aim. Dumb Punk guy shoots in the cafeteria of nowhere, like a madman. They all want to look professional, but they all suck. Another thing I do not believe that there is an emergency exit in the school kids trying several doors, but they are all closed. What happens if there is a fire and guard dumass dead? It is illegal to have an escape route in the school. Anyway, there's a lot more to say, but it would be too long. I spent some time in my life to see shit.
