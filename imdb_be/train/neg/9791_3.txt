Basically we are talking about a couple who want to adopt a second child. The adoption agency they meet the mouse (Stuart), and they decided to take it. If you think it's stupid, holding it, because it's getting worse. <br /> <br /> Stewart arrives at his new home, where it is seen as a human child. (Sorry!) The rest is pretty much the usual clichés about family problems, jealousy of the older "brother", and in the end all problems are solved, and all of them are "happy family." Sad and worn as it is, it also shows the very blunt and simple way. <br /> <br /> I do not know when the director thought that he is a creative by introducing mouse cliché, or he was just trying to fill in for a few minutes, but he had just upgraded from sad cliché abhorrent. <br /> <br /> So why I gave 3 or zero? Felines who likes Stuart as much as "brother". . And because of some funny shows where Stuart makes good use of its small size <br /> <br /> In general, I believe that the movie will work well if: a. Stewart was a pet and not a "related". b. He held in his funniest performances, Stewart tries to outsmart the cat and left of the unfortunate clichés that do not correspond with anything else.
