This film is funny. Anyone pronouncing the current large and beautiful casting never seen even a mediocre movie. Actions obviously scared in the first 5 characters that you meet. Lame. I feel like everybody else 'Vita' comments should be made by people associated with the directors. I was not very impressed with the storyline, but just wanted to see some beautiful Oregon countryside, and there were some decent cinematography - but the casting was anything but inspiring. I think that this film also makes a mockery generally noble assumption that there is something deep in the Indian culture has been ignored, and may have lost and that the revival makes sense and is possible. It contains jokes of others, and all too obvious place, and makes me think that it was written at the State Department, or something. Back to the drawing board. To even suggest that this film deserves a place in the same area of ​​the classics, like Harold and Maude completely backward, and on the same line, begging and artsy and "joke" as is rampant in this film.
