The film lacks the style, I mean the original style. everything looks copied including shares, first appearances in the film, songs, dialogue delivery, etc. etc. Yes, there is a goof windows were original, as well as at the beginning of the vehicle is displayed with the number of UP **** number and a few seconds later, he begins to fall down hill with MH **** number. It was one of many goof windows movie :) Anything good in the film? Yes, for fans of Karina, if any, Kareena in a bikini. For fans of Akshay, his dialogues and action stunts. It. nothing else. So watch it at your own risk and do not blame the director or the actors. The director already crazy and actors, I feel sorry for them.
