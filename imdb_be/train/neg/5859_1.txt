Turkish cinema has a big problem. Directors are not interested in the world of cinema. They are local and folk, but we want to be international. It brings the results of such kitsch, this film. <br /> <br /> The film is a joke translated into Spanish Turkish, and they have no meaning for non-Turkish audience. Even for Turkish audiences after 10 years. <br /> <br /> Players even Ferhan Sensei is the worst efficient than average. They act like puppets. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in Cuba, but did not include about Cuba. Cuba is therefore thought of as a banana republic. <br /> <br /> waste of money, a waste of time.
