I'm not a regular viewer Springer, but I watch his show in glimpses, and I think the show is a great guilty pleasure and a good way to kill time. So, naturally, I will watch this movie expecting to see "Jerry Springer Uncensored.Â» First of all, Jerry is about twenty minutes running time of the film. Another hour and twenty minutes expended creating this pseudo-farce of a trailer-trash, jealousy, incest and deceit. Presley (who looks hot as HELLLL) trailer trash whore who sleeps with his stepfather (very unusual appearance, who smoke, drunken Michael Dudikoff, who finally left his action hero persona). Mom finds out about the affair, they get into a fight, they want to take it on the show "Jerry" (which is not true, entirely Springer). And then we have a parallel story with the African-American couple. They take it to the show "Jerry". The characters face. Blah, blah, Freakin 'blah! Trash rarely had this BORRRINGG !!!! I was wondering why the hell Springer has millions of fans, but none of them had not checked his film. Well, now it is quite obvious !! Whether you love it or hate it, you'll hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a complete mess of motion pictures (if that's what you call it). It's so bad edited, with scenes that simply do not connect, and after a certain period of time, the story virtually disappeared, and it's just all over the map! Just imagine the predictable soap opera turns into a comic farce. With rare laughs. <br /> <br /> My only positive note is the hot girl-girl scenes. It is as risky as it gets. Do not get me wrong, quite risky, but if you look at the overall film, comparing it with the material of the program Springer scene - is catastrophically farce seems extremely sanitized <br /> <br /> My rating :. 3 (10)
