Because everything she does through all of this film, it is to undress without good reason.When Tarzan bitten by a snake, she suddenly lifts her clothes.Since, if it is poisonous boa? Tarzan poisoned, by the way? This whole movie is screwed up.They could not get the kinds of animals that film right.Whats Orangutang does stick out of the chimpanzees? He must have wandered off the set film.The much better group of people watching a cannibal tribe caucasin.Why? After all, and why her father painted if they were going to eat later? perhaps it was just an excuse to show off her breasts and curves again.Her dad while hunting, attitudes and acts stupid around an elephant, standing too close to it.Any real African elephant who was not a circus, it will be stamped butt. any intelligent hunter this idiot would have started shooting at that moment he saw it.and I can not help but wonder when the camera was on LSD, because he continued to show different scenes that went into slow motion, as neither good reason.It It did not make sense in all.The widow that Tarzan fought to Wad See, looks like one of those 12 Ft rubber snakes can be purchased at your local Spencer Gifts.Tarzan was strangly sp eechless in this film, maybe from the fact flashing themselves so much.I'm sorry, but it is a rip off classic black and white Tarzan movies, with a similar, but better story.Not mention drawing a scene .There is that I've seen that all forgot to mention. * (SPOILERS ALERT) * scene in which he tries to save Jane and her father, he was standing too close to a running spout.It water made it seem like he was urinating on someone underneath. Eww! In addition, he and Jane fooling around on the beach, with distorted monkeys jumping and clapping.She sure did accept the death of his father, really well. * (At the end of spoiler) * There should be a warning to the surgeon general on this film.That After seeing naked too much in this film will make you go blind.
