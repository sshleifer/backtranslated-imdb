I actually saw China O'Brien II, before I ever saw the original China O'Brien. And I must say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: less = more ridiculous! And funnier = better. If you are a bad movie fan like me, it's great stuff. However, if you are looking for a substantial plot, acting ability, skill or a movie-making, it is better to avoid. The best part, they filmed all the fighting sequences stuttering fast forward. Fun bad. See it on a laugh, see this mindless entertainment, but whatever you do, and see it for free on TV.
