If you are wondering, where many of the conspiracy, and paranoid ideas about the theories of the UN, Israel and international affairs come, look no further. <br /> <br /> This is not the supernatural Hollywood film based on some biblical passage. Instead, this film was made by the company (Cloud Ten Pictures) with political and religious agenda. In the film, the end result is many times more looks like clips from televangelism program (complete with family prayers and light to break through the church windows while playing the harp). <br /> <br /> For ordinary viewers, it may be hard to believe, but many people believe in this stuff literally, as presented in the film. And it may make an important film. You probably will not find a more succinct statement of strange looks significant number of your fellow citizens. Thus, if you are watching it, considering it as a social / cultural document. If you are at all a media savvy, you should not be aware of the unsubtle attempts at propaganda and manipulation in the film.
