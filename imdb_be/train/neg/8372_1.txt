I can catogoricaly and clearly say that in all my 51 years on this planet, it is worse (supposibly s) in the film I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> I got three great kids to see it, and even they struggled to raise a smile during the whole torturous 90 minutes. Sexual indendoes I'll leave for another day, but they were as bland as the film. They should pay you to watch it, you do not pay them. This is really really bad, there is no other way to describe it. The people who made this film should be brought to task for obtaining money under false pretenses. <br /> <br /> Aplogise has spelling mistakes, but I was so upset that he messed up the time I was with my grandchildren Yours, Steven
