What a waste of time! I tried to sit through «Sky Captain ..» about 6 times, and each time for about 3 minutes, I start doing something else - anything else This is a really boring film acting is terrible, write something boring and, obviously, the director of the first time, because it is hard. and I wanted to love him. I love science fiction, old climax, and I can appreciate the attempt nods to Flash Gordon and Metropolis, my God, that is a waste of money. I worked at Paramount Pictures, and I wrote Sherry Lansing in 1993 on the use of a blue screen for a screen test. She told me that they had no interest or need to do so. 10 years later, Paramount is releasing this piece of shit. Gray was right in 1993, but must have forgotten his own advice when it the green light this dog. Blue screen effect shots, but not the entire movie. Let us not forget, nor Judas nor Jolie great actors (but easy. In the eyes of) the performance Paltrow reminds me of high school effort too bad. - it might work, Ed, but only by an experienced director. The funny thing is, the director of Sky Captain will continue to get a job, even after this dreck. It is commerce, not art!
