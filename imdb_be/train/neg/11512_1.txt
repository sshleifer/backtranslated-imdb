*** WARNING! SPOILERS contained herein! *** <br /> <br /> This is a semi-autobiographical look at what can happen to Madonna if she was ever to be on a desert island. There is absolutely no call Madonna in this role, and it shows. She just plays Madonna Madonna, and she can not even get it right. I know what you say, you say, "How do you know that's what Madonna is really like, you've never met her," That's right, I have not, but we all remember the "Truth or Dare", is not it! ? I know that Kevin Costner does. <br /> <br /> One would have thought in 2002 that Madonna may have learned a few things, one way or another, from the "crossover" ladies who have also made their way through the silver screen. For God's sake, I was not seen Madonna "Glitter"? Mariah Carey showed the whole world the film AS IT BECOMES !!! Mariah kicked a bad example of the Madonna to the pavement in the beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, characteristics, you name it! All that we can see from this glimpse into the world of Madonna she is the only one in it. <br /> <br /> If there is one thing to say to Madonna is that she is consistent. When she was dear MTV, she placed the world of women's fashion 20 years ago. Now, in the film, it has established the role of women in cinema and society 20 years ago, rejuvenating all the most hateful, horrible, vicious, offensive quality women were famous already locked within them, the quality they so desperately trying to prove that they really are not possess. <br /> <br /> *** HERE spoilers !!! Do not read on if you DO NOT WANT TO KNOW ... *** <br /> <br /> That is one good thing I will say about this movie, and I was really amazed by this. They do not go to the «Hollywood Ending» - a symbol of the Madonna lives. In a typical, happy Hollywood ending, the nature of the Madonna would have died on the island, and its long-suffering, depressed, beaten her husband would be free to finally settle with a good, decent woman, a woman who would be the complete opposite of his late wife, and the two they live happily ever after. But this is very depressing conclusion that she was saved, and once again, this poor victim of her husband again saddled his demon wife, and his life will become hell again. <br /> <br /> *** HERE subsided spoilers ***
