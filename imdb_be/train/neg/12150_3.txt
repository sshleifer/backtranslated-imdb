Feeding the masses is just one of many recent movies with zombies to be after your hard-earned dollars. Offer? Keep your hard-earned dollars, and let's just say that the good old TheatreX took one for the team on it. Guess what stories about? Zombies capture. This time, though, for the sake of originality (?) This film takes place in Rhode Island, and to be honest, I'm not sure I've ever seen a zombie movie based on Rhode Island. The TV station, controlled by the government, ostensibly to keep up the "normal" broadcasting, so that the rest of the citizens will not have to think that there is any problem in the world, there are those who will never look or go outside anyway . I will say, however, that some of the commercials broadcast by the station, were probably the most fun part of this film. There is actually a few of the stories to this, but I do not touch this, because after a while you will or will not take care of or asleep. In any case, it has a lot of hardcore action, to throw on top of all the "seen it all before" stuff that gets trotted before the camera. Believe me, you can find plenty of other things to do with your time than watch it. 3 of 10.
