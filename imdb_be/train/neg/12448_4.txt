Clint Eastwood Bronco Billy, the leader of the Wild West troupe, one of the six permanent losers, which contain a struggling-to-break-even touring show. The seventh member of the bunch woman assistant Billy, but these women never last long, and the situation of chronically open. Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke ?? Eastwood's girlfriend at the time). It seems Miss Lily, as Doc (Scatman Crothers) calls it, is a potential heir to that property will only receive its long-dead father when she was married when she turns 30, so that on the eve of the birthday she gets to the trailer cartoon Geoffrey Lewis. <br /> <br /> Thus, the plot of this movie? It is hard to say. There's romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lily, but the problem is that in the first half of the film is so arrogant tasteless and disgusting, that if it suddenly becomes "one of the troupe" halfway through the film, it is not only incredible, but the audience far beyond the care of her. There's a chronic shortage of funds for the show of the Wild West, but this topic is not affected enough to really be the raison d'Ãªtre of the film. There's a difficult position to be Miss Lily stranded in the rural west, cut off from the means that nourish her spoiled life of luxury (it mistakenly believes the dead to his family and the press). But we really have to believe that she can not go back to New York and she will be happy when she gave him a little effort? <br /> <br /> No, the point of this film, it seems that Billy is the leader in the family, attractive bunch of losers who are hanging together through thick and thin. It's a warm, fuzzy movie ?? or at least trying to be. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Clint show us your skills with weapons, even robbing a bank failure in the shooting, which is grotesquely out of place in the otherwise relatively non-violent film. One of the gang arrested on the old draft evasion charge; Billy captivates local sheriff. show tent burns; Orphanage makes them a new one. But many secular pitfalls of not making the story. <br /> <br /> cast Complicating the problem, or lack thereof. Besides Scatman Crothers, the supporting cast is very amateurish. Eastwood entirely on top of his game, either, even though it looks better, simply because, surrounded by such a lackluster bunch. <br /> <br /> And all this, the film wanders for 116 minutes. At what point? Good question ?? <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
