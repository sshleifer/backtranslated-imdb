Propaganda film for the Palestinian "affairs." If you were expecting an unbiased documentary film about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you will need to look elsewhere. If you're an anti-Semite (or simply anti-Zionist --- nothing wrong in favor of the destruction of the country, is not it?) Or uncritically in favor of Palestinian targets (eg, mass murder, the destruction of Israel), this documentary for you. If we make an entertaining night on college campuses across the UK and the US. However, any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged by the sheer number of lies presented in this video. I just hope that those who are not really aware of the situation, not spoiled by this antisemitic bad.
