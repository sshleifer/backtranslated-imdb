Annie Potts is the only event in this really dumb movie. Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really upset that somebody stole the Corvette, he and his classmates turned into HotRod (quite possibly the ugliest looking for a car that will be shown in the film), and heads to Las Vegas with Annie to track down an evil genius, who stole his honor and joy. <br /> <br /> I would gouge out his eyes after seeing, if it was not for the pleasure of watching Annie Potts in the very early role, and it's too bad for Hamill that he did not take a few acting lessons from it. Denis Bonaduce also makes silly cameo.
