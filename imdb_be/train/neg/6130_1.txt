In the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was something of a hero in the United States. Inevitably, a man in his position to get offered a role in a movie, which exist solely for their benefit from it. I have no idea that Thomas had paid to make this film, but I would be paid a large pile of money to agree to make a fool in a national film. The film, obviously, comes from the «Enter The Dragon», like most martial arts pictures. Only instead of a real martial art, they come up with an absurd new martial art, accurately described by one critic as "a cross between kung fu and breakdancing." Gymnast (Thomas, of course) is hired to save some lady with an impenetrable fortress, but each room has propeller that is exactly what Thomas has to push assistant villains. Of course, he fights his way to the main villain, and, of course, they have a fancy dance battle, ending that will surprise only those who have never seen a martial arts movie. There are risks that the nostalgic types pleases, especially mullet hairstyle Thomas and many of their male colleagues have stars. But the only reason to watch this film if you have a grudge against Kurt Thomas, who now regrets that he never set foot on the set.
