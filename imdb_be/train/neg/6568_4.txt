It is interesting that the two stars were people were a couple of movie stars who have entered into a new medium of television and have become a great success and the two went into the production end of things and enjoy tycoon status on the small screen. Lucille Ball, however, was not a major star, which will come with a TV. As for Dick Powell, he desperately wanted to get out to do films like to meet the man and his career salvation will come in his next film. <br /> <br /> I think that the only reason for which Dick Powell made the film because a young player with MGM was cast in a number of specialty, and he had seen her in a while. His personal time from June Allyson was much better than what we see on the screen. Powell looks crashingly sad and can not cause any kind of emotion in general. <br /> <br /> He was probably tired of doing these musicals with silly plots, the kind he fled from Warner Brothers with. Original show Meet People did not have the book shows, it was a revue, and he ran into the 1940/41 season on Broadway of 160 performances. If MGM had bought, they harm all but name, and song title. The rest of the scores was glued together from various and all the songs, none of the songs are not memorable. Strange, considering some of the starting material with Burton Lane, E.Y. Harburg, Harold Arlen and Rodgers & Hart. These guys just have to empty the trunk of the material. <br /> <br /> The plot is even more stupid than most musical agitation time. Powell author revue titled Meet People and he shipyard worker who won the lottery date with movie star Lucille Ball. She wondered what he is interested, they are both interested in the revue, but creative differences do not keep them apart, of course, to the final. This is a film in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> MGM did give Powell and score some good musical acts, the major cause for the view to meet the people. Large band Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones here and the highlight of the film for me, Bert Lahr, dressed in a suit Commodore Lou Costello was in a dream sequence in the Navy. Heave Ho song written Arlen and Harburg, who wrote to Lar, the number of Courage from the Wizard of Oz. And like almost everyone in the world has not seen this movie, you have an idea how Heave Ho. <br /> <br /> The next film, Dick Powell was the murder of My tender, in which he finally bid farewell not so fond of musicals. And Lucy will have to wait for TV before the world needs to see what it can really do.
