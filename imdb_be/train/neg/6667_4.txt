I was sort of enjoying this film until the problem of hair on the face of Ed Norton. Without revealing any details of the plot - one night he was sporting a light beard, but in the same evening beard was gone, and a very thick mustache were in place. It was much better than the mustache, who went with a beard. Later, during a dark night under the open sky mustache disappeared, and he appeared clean shelter. This was the basis, where stop shaving is not an option. These differences continuity completely distracted me from the rest of the film and destroyed any credibility it had previously been. In addition, I found that only prolonged the scene in his bedroom cowboy was too reminiscent of DeNiro in Taxi Driver. Even if it had to be a tribute he was laid too thick for this viewer.
