Let's just say, I had to suspend my disbelief for Spiderman's less, than I did for Hooligans. That is to say, I have less trouble believing Toby McGuire may stick to the buildings than I Wood dropping with thugs in Manchester. I will not go into details, because I do not want to write a spoiler, but the idea of ​​grown, professional British men falling in the next cropping death every weekend, well ... funny. And this film is not. Fight, fight the idea is taken too seriously. The seriousness of fisticuffs, the awe with which the subject treated becomes irritable, as it is fixed by or conflict. It seems that the plot holes big enough to drive a truck Guinness later, was struck with a far-fetched "fish out of water" theme, so that the viewers can watch in the Woods watery eyes as he learns how to become a man, that is, , Hit by another young man, opposite football tastes with blunt objects, and then run as fast as he can. Cartoon characters, especially the Americans at Harvard. Character development and story line are wired viewer throughout the entire picture. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film does not reach its height until late that by the time you have spent almost two hours of your life, you will never get back. Meeting "The Football Factory" and "Fight Club" instead of the banal, disappointing and hopeless. . He did not waste time on empty melodrama, tired old "A Connecticut Yankee in King yard Aurthur, in" or sentimental, parables elderly Bullsh * t they just clean, dark, intelligent and fun, and as the violence should be.
