«Dutch Schultz», AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real person, and it is quite nasty life fairly well documented. This film, which is meant to reflect his life a fictional character to be used, because dramatize too much deviation from the facts and chronology. Moreover, it ignores some interesting details that other versions were included such as the failure of public relations in the state of New York and his religious conversion. It is true that he was punished Luciano, Lansky and others. et al. but this is as far as it goes. It explodes the scene plate representing Luciano holding execution After Weinberg in his own home, with the assistance of his own mother's ridiculous. In addition, there is a scene in which the Dutch close to his own mother, to pay protection Legs Diamond. It just does not work. The character of Mrs. Fleggenheimer not work. This film does not need a caring Jewish mother for comic. Chrome representation epic Diamond was quite funny. I am sure that the person turns in his grave. And by the way, the Dutch, and in fact personally kill people, but he was not a Rambo or 007. The scene in which he wipes the brewery is absurd. I do not know. Maybe she was supposed to be a comedy, and I just do not understand.
