I once thought that «Stoned Age» was the worst movie ever made ... I was wrong. "Hobgoblins" surpassed him in every way I could imagine, and some of them I could not. In "The Stoned Age" I hated character. The "houses" I hated actor ... and everyone else involved in the creation of this atrocity. I'm not a teaser for this film, I'm not that cruel. I could not put innocent people such as myself to such pain. In fact, any discussion of the subject, which this film is pointless and demeaning. Words I would use to describe this film as follows :. Fresh, a donkey, and unsophisticated <br /> <br /> In conclusion, please do not watch this movie. I ask you, from one film to another lover ... no, from one person to another, please. For their own common sense and intelligence do not look. Destroy all copies you come across.
