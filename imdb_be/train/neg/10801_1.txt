Now I'm the one to watch movies that got bad reviews, and say, "Hmm ... that's not so bad!" I loved cablemen, and thought my Big Fat Independent Movie was great. Keep in mind I did not start watching it with high hopes, but I thought that maybe ... just maybe ... it would be bad in some way I could make fun of him. I was wrong. At no point in the whole time of my suffering through this "film" (and I use that term often) I was even close to being entertained softly. To start, Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look Marlon Brando, when it comes to action. I hate rap, but as far as I could tell, the Amish priest probably do better rapper as he. The main character is just annoying, not the character, it is easy to love. Honestly, I like to eat fatty feces of bloody sores harlequin fetuses than to watch it again.
