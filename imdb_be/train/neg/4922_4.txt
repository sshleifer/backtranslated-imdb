DRACULA 2000 horror film, which is shown on the Sky Movies in the UK, and considering that, it seemed, screening about three times a week for a whole year, I do not know how I managed to miss it until it`s first broadcast network television today. In fact, seeing as I`m not a big fan of horror movies reason was probably down to my theory that this will be a scar. My theory has been proven for the most part <br /> <br /> !!!!! MINOR SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> What makes DRACULA 2000 a number of bad film dumb scripts that are involved. For example at the beginning of the movie bad guys fly Dracula`s coffin from London to the United States (in the double turbo engine propeller plane!) And one of the bad guys is one in the cargo compartment, where Dracula comes to life. A fight breaks out, there 'a lot of noise, but the bad guy in the cockpit Don` T to hear the sound, while the script is not required. He is also in this segment`s climax that Dracula can control the weather, but it seems to have forgotten about as the film progresses. Sloppy scripts, and also seems to be a problem with the structure, where many of the scenes where the characters' located at Mardi Gras in New Orleans, the characters that appear in a different location such as a police station in the next scene, they `back on the scene after Mardi Gras, which means no credibilty in the plot intensifies <br /> <br /> Tam` something else that yanked my chain - product placement. There`s countless scene where the logo for the recording / retailer a certain label in the field of view. I won`t dare to publish the company's brand (except to say that they also run a train company, which is a national joke in the UK), but I was under the impression that this type of advertising was up against the British and to get to us broadcast I`m I surprised the BBC showed the film, `s case <br /> <br /> There are some positives in Dracula 2000 as a visual example. It is actually good to watch a movie with good actors and promising boys were the vampire chicks hot, but it `s what we should expect from Hollywood over the last few years - very good looking film` s very stupid
