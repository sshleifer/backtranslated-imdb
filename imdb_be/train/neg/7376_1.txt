Stephen, what you did you got all the new low. This is strange, because the last movie shadow of a man, Stephen was sent the same director who made this trash. Shadow man was good it was diabolically bad so bad it's not even funny, Steven barely in the movie, and feels that he is in a cameo, and if he is in the film, he is dubbed half the time anyway. As for the action, and let's just say, The Wizard of Oz was more action than this garbage there is hardly any action in the film, and when he finally bored to come burdened with bad shot so-called scenes. Seagal is hardly anyone kills unlike their more movies, where he is one man army that is siege 1 and 2 and the exit wound. the story is so confused with so many plot holes, it does not make a scene time. Flight of Fury had better be good, that's a shame I spent 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten Better luck next time
