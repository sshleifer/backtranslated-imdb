Before I begin, let me say that my experience of this film, perhaps under the influence of dubbing, that will gather from other comments was the original, which is considered less certain. Thus, it is possible that the subtitles or apparently new DVD-version will have a value. In addition, I have not read relevant books; I only know one other Japanese manga and may be lacking the cultural context. <br /> <br /> Possible minor front spoilers. <br /> <br /> I used darker shades of science fiction (like Blade Runner, 12 monkeys, etc.), but I did not like this movie at all. While he started a bit intriguing, he was tiring by the time he was only half-finished. There are all kinds of problems; let's start with what is probably the most serious: the dialogue. The characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences; if they do not shout the names of each other on the n-th time, they tend to be monosyllabic grunting ( «Kanedaaa!», «Tetsuoooo!», «What?" "Hmm," etc.). This leaves most of the characters quite underdeveloped and two-dimensional. It does not help in the slightest degree, that many of them are only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say, that will develop them further away from the stereotypes of the proposed visual effects. <br /> <br /> grunting is supplemented by a random pseudo-philosophical technobabble that sounds vague and uninspired even by the standards of Star Trek. There's nothing deep and meaning here -. All this seems haphazard, thrown together at random from different pieces stock sci-fi ideas with no coherence at all <br /> <br /> What little story there is a clear no more than a pretext to start the final overlong sequence consisting of escalation scenes chaos and destruction. Not that there's anything wrong with a good bit of mayhem and destruction, of course; but in this case you will find yourself the question: "What is the meaning of all this, and how long until it is over." Character development in the last 30 minutes or so, consists of little more than Tetsuo becomes Pizza Hutt no reason at all easy <br /> <br /> The ending is reminiscent of one in 2001. - a bizarre string of images that, far from solving or explaining anything, leave the viewer feeling that he was just looking into a kaleidoscope for two hours. I'm sure some would argue that this kind of thing is an art; but for me it was just a lot of truth, the creative use of color and form. (Some of the music was also very interesting). Unfortunately, it's all style and no substance. <br /> <br /> Tired of Disney? Want to watch cartoons on a reasonable "adult" topics? I am sad to say that you're more likely to find this kind of thing in the «South Park».
