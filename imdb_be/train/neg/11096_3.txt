I had high hopes for this film because I thought it was Clean, Shaven (first feature Kerrigan) was absolutely stunning, very true cinematic low-budget film that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> But most CLAIRE Dolan's completely pointless and flat. Scene after scene, it seems, inadvertently tossed into the mix without much thought to the story or character. <br /> <br /> Claire tries to avoid being a prostitute or not? Hard to say. Why did she take a trick at the airport when she wants to avoid this life? Why she did not pick up a trick when she needed money in Seattle? Why do we have to see her to dye your hair to the point that almost exactly the same color? Why Claire takes some Johns, and not others? The director does not seem to know. <br /> <br /> It feels as if all the home-made (although I understand that it is not), and the filmmakers just held the camera at him, as if they did Verite documentary. <br /> <br /> After watching I saw Kerrigan defended its lack of narrative elections, denouncing the film as a story of the politically conservative. It sounded like a learned rhetoric. I think that's an excuse. <br /> <br /> I am disappointed that the creator of the film as exciting as the clean, shaved will continue to make such a lame movie like this, and then defend his tired old "political" clich√©.
