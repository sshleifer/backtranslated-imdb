The film was a nice discovery, I really believed that I was one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a while ... there was something special "foreign" about how the film was created, realistic still somewhat abstract and mystical. But the beginning of the storyline has become more and more unreal. To say that the ending was sweet and predictability is almost an understatement ... The most typical romantic ending where everything goes great for everyone "nice" character. The scene where the main character realizes that he made a mistake, and drives "the woman of his dreams," only to admit his love for her in front of a crowd pretty on- Lookers. Come on. In the end, the victory of the "good guys", the "bad guys" are free ... you get the picture. Waste of potentially interesting film.
