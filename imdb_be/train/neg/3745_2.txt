First of all; it is very amateurish, to try to describe the course of history only with the gun positions, germs and steel. The same thing was trying to do with Marxist economic positions. <br /> <br /> The reason for Western success can not just be dumb luck, the advantage of domesticated plants and animals. We can see that any benefits and bonuses complete useless in the world, if they are not reasonably manage. Japan has no vast natural resources, but Japan is one of the world's leading economies, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, a country with rich oil resources, there is only a low average success. Both of these people were, and still have access to Western technology and inventions, but why such a gap? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film Diamond said that it is very important to understand the factors guns, germs and steel, understand. Perhaps the world's main difference factor is geography, and people's ability to understand and use things? Mental capacity to understand. And in this case, geography is only subordinate.
