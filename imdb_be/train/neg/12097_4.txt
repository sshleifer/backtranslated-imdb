I'm not really hoping for much when I went to see it. After Mst3king bracket with JasonX with some friends, although I was hoping for such an experience here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film took itself too seriously. Should I take care of the problems of Jason? Sorry, no. There are legion Ft13th films that cover, in any case. As at the end of the day, he is undead serial killer, I'm just not going to that nice. <br /> <br /> Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the film with hallucinations and what is not, but, unfortunately, they were few and far between, and the end of the film, he degenerated into a bad episode of Celebrity Deathmatch. .. just not funny. <br /> <br />
