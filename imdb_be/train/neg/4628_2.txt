Misty Ayers was the body of smoke, and that is all that this movie was about. Pure exploitation flick. I started to play a game with yourself, counting how many times they are fixated on the stock orchestral music. And, of course, music has nothing to do with the scenes. Case in point: accidentally coming into the room and say, "Hello" was killed Chase music from the Roman epic. I would like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released. What I learned from this film: that women's low-rise panties existed in 1954. I'm talking about Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien movie shorts. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes Misty slowly removing and putting on the clothes (for a bra and panties, except unfortunately). Also it includes a horrible dubbing, which leads to the "Beware! Godzirra!Â» Effect.
