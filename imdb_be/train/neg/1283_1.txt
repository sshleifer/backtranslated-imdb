I must say that I first watched this movie was about 6 years ago and I really enjoyed it then. I bought a DVD recently, and after the second viewing, I wondered why I liked it. The acting was terrible, and as usual we have a stereo-typical tribesmen in their fake costumes. Action was horrible at best. Meanwhile Roth did work OK as Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what thinks Jessica Lange. <br /> <br /> The story line was good, but the execution is just poor. I'm tired of seeing Scotland painted like this in the movies. Braveheart was even worse, though, is that this movie only saving grace. But seriously, people did not talk like that in those days, why all the actors must have Glasgow accents? Another film, to try to capture the essence of the already tired and annoying stereotypes. I noticed that the only people on here who say that this movie is good are Americans, and to be honest, I can understand why they would want to, I know that they have a passion for men in skirts. However, if you are thinking about buying a DVD, I would say that spending money on something else, as the best film.
