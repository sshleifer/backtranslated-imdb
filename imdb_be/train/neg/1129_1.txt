I saw this movie, because I had to do (my job includes seeing movies of all kinds). I could not stop thinking, "who gave the money to do such a terrible movie, and submit it to the Cannes Film Festival!" It was not just boring, the actors were terrible as well. It was one of the worst films I have ever seen.
