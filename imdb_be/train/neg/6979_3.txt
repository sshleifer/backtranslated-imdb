I watched this movie also Altho it is very well done, I found it Heartbreaker and would not recommend it to women who have small children .. The horror on the face of the mother, when she sees her child about how to move the train to be really heartbreaking. And the saddest thing is - internally it dies. In the end, it goes back to Applacian mountains. All the money in the world, which it makes decisions dolls entirely concealing her grief she has. I remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of their clothes to try to make her child recovered. I am surprised that this film takes place in Detroit, because when I watched it, I was sure that people have come to Cincinnati, Ohio. It was also the route for the poor from the mountains.
