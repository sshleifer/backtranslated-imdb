I'm not sure if it was the language of action or poor, but everything about this film feels and looks cheap and fake. <br /> <br /> After watching Der Untergang is a huge disappointment. There's no connection between different scenes and the action is so incredibly poor, I could not believe people would do such a mess that had great potential. <br /> <br /> And, above all, everyone in Germany say in English, is a big mistake. The German language has a certain sound to it, and especially Hitler himself only sounds like Hitler when he says / yelling in German. <br /> <br /> By the way the story is told made me believe that was makeshift in place, the characters were empty, and the film seems to be a collection of random events that might occur. <br /> <br /> whether it is English or the fact that we have seen Der Untergang, everything about this film was a fake, and funny.
