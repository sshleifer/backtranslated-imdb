As a young black / latina I'm always looking for films that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course, when I saw this movie in the video store, I thought I would enjoy it; Unfortunately, I did not. Although these themes presented in the film interesting and relevant, the story just does not properly developed. The film just kept dragging on and on, and many of the characters that appear on the screen, just come and go without a large contribution to the overall film. If the director has done a better job, which connects the scene, perhaps I would have enjoyed it a little more. Frankly, I would recommend a film like "Raising Victor" for this one any day. I just was not too impressed.
