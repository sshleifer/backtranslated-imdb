This film is so bad, you can not imagine. Actions awful, even worse than in the third grade of soap operas. It's a shame that this film has been the most successful over the past 20 years in Switzerland. Interaction between the soldiers did not make any sense at all. The story could have been taken from Bravo photo-stories, dialogues were made of wood, like Treebeard and the plot holes were bigger than the black hole at the center of our galaxy. But now it does not need much to satisfy the audience. Actors were beautiful, for example, the former Miss Switzerland and the main character was even hung (in !!), and there certainly was a lot of drug abuse. This is a real cool man! In particular, for 12 and 13-year-olds. But the media have created an atmosphere in witch you are not allowed to refuse the film, because they manipulate the dynamics of peer groups, implicitly saying that you are a nerd if you do not go along with the other 'sheep' and say.yes, which is exactly what it is it was when I was in the army / that's exactly what I would do if I have to go to the army .. to every action cheese that had to do with drugs and coolness. And I do not think that I like in the army. I've been there, and I hated it, but this film is worse than cleaning toilets with sticky tooth brush (which I had to do because I have offended in the lieutenant) This is not necessarily a film to be difficult. Sometimes you just want to have fun for a few hours and forget about the problems, and I think it's not bad. But this kind of movies influence teenagers a lot by showing them a cool way of life, which in fact it is just stupid and turns them into mindless ignorant and selfish idiots. But as I am now, that my opinion is not very popular today will be quiet and would recommend to avoid this terrible Flick any price, and for this to keep your wits! <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad english)
