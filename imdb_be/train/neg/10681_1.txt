What a pity that so many of my "list" and a good "B" list of actors agreed to do the film, but they did, and that is what sucked me watch. I've never heard about this movie, but it was Cuba Gooding Jr. right on the DVD cover, and James Woods in the background, how bad can it be? It is a word! This film begins approach has several twists and turns, and then simply lays an egg. The ending was so weak, it was as if the writer was revoked and his 4-year-old son sat on a type writer and cut down the end. Paradoxically, and, for a movie called "The End Game" to be so poor. These types of movies that can be moved, "" list of actors in the "b" list in a hurry. I hope that Cuba Gooding Jr. and James Woods did not make a habit of it.
