6/10 duty, not great, but some good action. <br /> <br /> 4/10 director makes stupid decisions for this film. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Writer, the story does not make sense at all, and has a large number of drawbacks. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Overall this film. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this film, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this film, and it may be too much. Characters so much more exaggerated than they can ever in real life, and some pretty inexplicable stuff happens «storywise», and not in a good way. Due to the style of the movie was filmed tired after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow motion and camera shake and fast forward). It is always good that the film uses music to make the story go smoothly, but there are too many tracks in this. In the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogues and music
