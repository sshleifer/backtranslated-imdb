There is a book called "How to make a film with every" man versus nature "clich√© imaginable?" If not, the ants would be an excellent starting material for the manager in the killer insects. The ants are not one shred of originality can be found at any point in its 100-minute performance. I believe what is most surprising about the ants, they actually stretched film is 100 minutes. Installation, symbols, different sub-themes, the death scene, and how ants are presented have been made to how many times ?? and in most cases, much better. It is surprising that many of these insects on a rampage films were made in the 70s, because they are all basically the same movie. <br /> <br /> And can someone please tell me what in God's name Myrna Loy makes this monkey turd from the movie? The woman, as a talented and stylish as lye deserves better than ants, as one of her last films.
