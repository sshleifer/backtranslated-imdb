There's a lot of good that can be said for this cartoon; backgrounds rich outfits beautifully colored and full of beautifully crafted pieces of art deco. Animation to the usual standards of the studio at the time, which, of course, higher than today. Nevertheless, I find it tedious for a number of reasons <br /> <br /> Music :. It is definitely not up to the usual standards Scott Bradley. Although it is likely to be memorable setting of "The Great Gatsby", he ends up vomiting, sleepiness, repetitive and monotonous (repetitive and monotonous are not the same as the fifth symphony of Beethoven suggests). Since most people (myself included) tend to turn a blind eye when they yawn, there are lots of visual part of the cartoon, which is missing the average viewer <br /> <br /> Storyline :. I'm not giving away any secrets, which are no longer in a brief exposition of the plot - a good country, a city badly. This is a common theme in the movies as animated and live with this era. It is absurd nostalgia for a nonexistent rural idyll, which is now, is reflected in a similar nostalgia for the "values" that have never been.
