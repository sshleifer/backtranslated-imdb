Recently, they are trying to pick up the movie late at night on cable TV advertising. Do not believe the hype. I was one of the unfortunate people to see that bitch in theaters. This, in my opinion, the third worst movie of all time, only for Mac & Me (# 1 being the worst), and Jack Frost (# 2 worst), but I must admit that they are all similar and all scary! In fact, none of this movie is not funny, or anxiety, or anything else he says, so do not waste your money. The only thing that is good to give to your worst enemy. I'm not lying about this. Someone who you would want to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film. It's so awful. If you do not believe me, then you deserve to suffer through the pain, watching this, I'm sure you can finish. Two thumbs down admiringly.
