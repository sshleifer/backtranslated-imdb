"True," the story of three girls who go into the bowels of Connecticut and eventually maniac hunting in the forest. This kind of film that would play in the leading ins across America thirty years ago mixed recognition. Nha especially a lot of the film is working with a low budget to mixed results. watchable film, but not scary (to blame, as some of the percussion scene for this). Its the kind of film that you have probably forgotten about as soon as you are done with it. Chances are that you'll never think to see it, if you hand to someone and said, "Now watch this," which is what happened with me. If you are given a copy of give, the film is not worth the effort to see it, even if it's watchable.
