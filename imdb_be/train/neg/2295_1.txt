Pointless boring film with a charismatic Mercury completely wasted. Released for a moment on Thursday in perhaps a local cinema and avoid all Sydney people, except me and the other four project wilderness, seemingly established manufacturer is looking for a fee. Local actors such as John Paulson and Terry Serio deserve better (well, Paulson has become a director of thrillers like lame Swimfan and shelter) and Terry Serio, never seems to get Guernsey except gangster roles. But Paul Mercury was supposed to be one of Australia's largest export to the screen. Roles like this are the main disappointments and movies, as it is simply a waste of talent and time.
