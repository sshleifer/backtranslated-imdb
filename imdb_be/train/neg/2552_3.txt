It is listed as a documentary, it is not, it is removed such as a documentary, but I suspect, simply because then they get away with a shaking camera and fancy shooting. It has just been released on DVD in the UK as a "style of comedy American Pie" this does not mean that either. <br /> <br /> In general, it costs around a group of teenagers on spring break, as they go to Mexico for cheap booze and the quest to get there untouched friend finally put. Give it a couple of dwarfs, as well as on the same quests and you have a non-funny story about drunken teenagers who are trying to get some girls. <br /> <br /> Given the 18 rating it has very little nudity, and almost zero sex scene, mainly, I believe that the rating for the abuse of which there are many. <br /> <br /> If you like the behavior of crude Jackass without humor, then this might be your thing if you have any brain cells left, then I would probably avoid this!
