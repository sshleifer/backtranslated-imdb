Julia Roberts, obviously makes a concerted effort to shake off her cotton beauty person with this parasitic marital abuse thriller, but it's hard to imagine that she was eventually put in the performance, as a powerful and convincing (and Oscar winning) as she did in Erin Brockovich is based on the reverse side of this garbage. And do not be ashamed of this, it is nothing more than the car of Julia Roberts, but unfortunately, her performance is not the most dull thing about it. <br /> <br /> The story has all the hallmarks of made- to-late-night cable and not be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic violence, because it is not of the characters sketched enough to really care. <br /> <br /> In the end, frustration and poor, without a name above the title of Roberts, I'm sure he would have completely collapsed, deservedly so.
