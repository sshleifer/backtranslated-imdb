It's a great story, and it was only the beginning of equality in the United States. (We're still working on that, too.) However, despite the fact that it's true, it's still a movie and it's a movie site. I understand that independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but wow. Only one even mediocre is a great Ossie Davis. But even he could not do for all the participants (including the one playing with him as a young man) absolutely atrocious acting. Of course the script was very clich√©, but even then you have to get some decent actor! I would not recommend it to anyone, because it's so badly done in each category. Read some books on the true story of U.S.S Mason, because they give these people the respect they deserve.
