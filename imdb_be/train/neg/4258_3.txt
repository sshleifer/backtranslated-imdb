I would give this movie 5 instead of 3, if it is at least at the time ... When I saw him for the first time, it was exactly what you would expect from a work that is based entirely on the artistic abilities of directors but on idealistic or I would say, our idiotic habit (Kazakhstan) government ... it is a shame, because «Qazaqfil'm» was already shooting a good film if it had not been awarded the name of Shaken Aimanov, but it was not actually going to him. These films as "konec Ataman", "Kyz Zhibek" or even "Aldar Kose". But after the death of Mr. Ayman in the production of quality films has decreased almost dramatic in 10 years there were very few films are made. However, in the late 1980s, was filmed "Assa", it was a film about the first organized criminal groups in a large country, one year later, Mr. Rashid Nugmanov shot another film with co-staring the same actor / singer V.Tsoy, while he was a Soviet / Russian rock legend - a movie called "Eagle" (Eagle or something) it was completely new, someone called this period as a resurrection or a new wave of Kazakh film. Unfortunately, we currently do not have a high-quality films, our director picture movies in French and Japanese financial support, and thus the film is not for the public but also for the authors of professional critics, some of them take the price on the international festivals of author cinema, but there are very few of them become a business asset products ... And let's go back to our "nomads". These films are generally unpopular because of the broad aspects. The same effects were Nikita Mikhalkov's "Siberian Cyrilnik» of the Russian tsars, which was also filmed on parity with foreign partners, I think they were French or maybe the British. Nobdy liked, even the Russian public how it has become the main theme of comedians and comedy shows like "KVN". in my opinion
