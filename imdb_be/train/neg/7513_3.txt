What can I say? I think that I should write a "Spoiler alert" and then "open" they used the F-word a lot in this film - as in every two sentences. I do not like this film at all - too many allusions to sexual perversion, dodging and cheating. And that swearing was completely out of the window. I gave this film "3", and two of these points for sexual movements Mira Sorvino on the dance floor.
