Direction should be a problem here. Recently, I heard John Cleese said of the scene working to Fawlty Towers. He had to attack his car with a branch. The first branch was too far-fetched and ridiculous. The second branch was too hard to be funny. The third was just enough shaky to be funny. This attention to detail missing "Corky Romano". No matter how strikingly unfunny comic bit was, he was never fixed and not left on the floor of the room. One value can be found in this film as a study of a very flawed film, which somehow escaped the distribution is not repaired. <br /> <br /> I scanned dozens of other reviews here. Number of reviews praising it's an absolute waste of time reinforces my suspicion that some people get paid to promote the title. I can not understand how anyone over the age of 9 can appreciate this title more than 4, MAX. I mean, come on, 5 on average. I can not imagine anyone, even those who make money on this, his approval rating even as much as an average. <br /> <br /> This makes my list of the 10 worst movies of all time. And, hey, I really like Three Stooges and even tolerate Ed Wood!
