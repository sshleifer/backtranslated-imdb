Someone could probably make a great documentary on the Jerry Springer Show, but it's a fictional version of a well in drained anything authentic and fun of trash-TV phenomenon. There are dozens of great bad movies. (For example, Â«Manos: the hand of fate"), which shows more creativity and spirit than the dreary, stupid waste of the film <br /> <br /> Seriously, why not a documentary about Jerry springer Show, which would begin to answer some real questions as: Who are these people? What is happening in their lives after they appear on the show? As Cincinnati mayor to be here <br /> <br /> One good line: During the "orientation" session for the guests: "People, I can not stress this enough: no weapons!"
