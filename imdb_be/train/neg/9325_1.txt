S.I.C.K. actually it stands for is so incredibly Crappy I killed myself. Not there was absolutely no effective say. The best part of the entire production was artwork on the cover box.The budget of the film was enough. Shooting south of Sesame Street. Manufacturing seems that clandestine shot to hit the crowd. Props used in the film were stolen from a clothing store. The ending was so predictable, you must fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laughter. If there is a book out there for this film, I'm sure it's better. I would avoid it at all costs. I really enjoyed the intimate scenes, they made the whole movie worthwhile. kidding.
