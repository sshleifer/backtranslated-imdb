This is a (very) low-budget film in comparison with the great classic "Silent Night Deadly Night», as it is designated as Slasher Flick. First of all let me say that I think that even «Silent Night Part 2" is better than (that one was filled with flashbacks of the original more than half of the film). "Christmas Evil" tries to get psychological by introducing the main character, someone is going crazy, (strong word), slow (very slow). It irritates the people who do not get the true meaning of Christmas and on the job, he can not stand, as the fabricated toys are made with such a lack of quality and love. Dressed as Santa, he finally goes on killing spree. In addition, a strong word, as only 3 people were killed without any real need for special effects. A lot of tension, no thrills, no blood, no shots. With one exception, that is: Jeffrey Demanov it. He is best known for playing the side of Tom Hanks as one of the guards in the classic «The Green Mile». It should still be pushing yourself these days all taking part. He's really the only one who can really act, his supporting role rather than the main lead. (Which is also not so bad, but if you are a bit overshadowed by the supporting character, you're not great either.). And how about this amazing finale? (You have to see it to believe it). "Christmas Evil" downright sad, nothing happens, and the work is simply misleading. This is not a slasher. You want to see the real Christmas slasher, check the all-time greatest, "Silent Night, Deadly Night."
