Over the past year, Uwe Boll has shown a slight improvement as a filmmaker, scroll competent "In the Name of the King" (and "Lord of the Rings' clone) and proudly vulgar, after 9/11 satire" Postal. " But then "seed" and the counter has been reset to zero, while maintaining its application for the rule of law and the respect that much further out of reach. And I'm a fan of the guy ?? his films reflect a uniquely eccentric vision, and never boring. <br /> <br /> Spawned from his disappointment at the Savage says his early films have received, "Seed" is a colossal wrong attempt at social commentary, and even worse Jeb to create iconic slasher mythology (Boll often seems to take page from a successful restart with Rob Zombie's "Halloween"). Antagonist Maxwell Seed (Will Sanderson), dumb, awkward beast that killed 666 people and sits on death row, awaiting execution; after unsuccessfully frying beast, he rises from the grave to take revenge on those who put him there ... and so begins a string is completely gratuitous mayhem. <br /> <br /> Trying to create a new millennium in Vienna slasher Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees, Max Seed is too ugly and boring, to leave the impression, eventually resembling washed-do about The Wrestler «The Toolbox Murders» in the same sequence unfortunate victims. In addition, the nature of the Seed and the "message" Ball in conflict with each other: the death penalty is wrong, of course, but we are really waiting to sympathize heartless killer who left a couple of hundreds of corpses in its wake? I do not think that <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Michael Paré acts as a sluggish, long-lost brother of the character James Remar on «Dexter» :. Kopa, who sits at the table a lot of flipping through newspaper clippings, and watch meaningless stop-motion scenes decomposed animals and people trapped in the lair in Seed. By the time he and a bunch of cardboard cops storm den Seed, in sequence so stretched, ill-conceived (lighting virtually non-existent), and uninteresting (despite a healthy dose of gore) that almost put me. to sleep <br /> <br /> bad filmmaking is not limited to this sequence: a «Seed», was shot dead by a drunk filmmakers as rock chambers and weaves endlessly method that turn over the stomach than the baked blood; it takes very little lingering occurs only pay attention to the sinuous, almost non-existent story. On 90 minutes, the film is stretched enough to be considered a form of torture that may have been Ball's intention all along. <br /> <br /> Pure genius ... I think that joke on me.
