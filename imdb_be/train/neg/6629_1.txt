If you've seen Sholay 1975 Sun to watch this movie. If you have not seen Sholay 1975 Go look. But do not watch this movie. This film has all the ingredients that could go wrong with the creation of a remake of Sholay. <br /> <br /> Amitabh «Babban» Bachchan plays the role of a psycho villain for the better (probably only a 40-minute reel, which should not be burned). If you remove the rest of the film and just watch Amitabh to play with his character, it would still be worth a look. But as Insp. Narasimha, Mohanlal Sun to pay tribute to his talent. Ajay Devgan (Hiro) is extremely mundane and the only reason I think they throw Prashant Raj as Raj because he bears a striking resemblance to Amitabh his youth. September Sushmita keeps himself well, with grace and makeup. But the reward for "the worst performance of any role to date," you must go to niche Kotaro. She manages to impair the effect to such levels that even a high school drama would overshadow her performance. <br /> <br /> If you have a mortal enemy, take him on this film. :)
