I do not watch a lot of TV, and stumbled on this show. Reality show? I sure hope it's not real. If I was a man and had such a nag, and was married to someone so runny, it would be a reason for divorce. I think it sets a bad example of how people should relate to the person that they love. That is one thing that is currently wrong with our world, so many people are in a bad relationship, self-centered and do not know the meaning of what she truly loves another. This self sacrifice, and not something that should be on Merritt. This is not just a good feeling to see what should be in a private consultation. If his personality on the show for real, he deserves someone better, that would show the real true love and care about him and appreciate him for who he is. Is this show a reality or folded to assess ???? I would really like to know. Sincerely, GB
