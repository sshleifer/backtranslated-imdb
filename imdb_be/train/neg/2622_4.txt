102 Dalmatians (2000, dir. Kevin Lima) <br /> <br /> I think the cure, Cruella de Vil (Close) is released from prison and sets out to make a new start in life. Things are going well for Cruella, who are engaged in helping the homeless dogs from the street. When the clock strikes of Big Ben, and then regret it. Hypnotic treatment Cruella recovered and returned, and this time she is going to do this Spotted coat she always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close reprises her role as Cruella de Vil and again is a highlight of the film. Each scene is worth watching it in the dim during that feels more repetition of the previous film, and not a new story. <br /> <br /> It has changed. ?? Ken Shepherd (Ioan Gruffudd)
