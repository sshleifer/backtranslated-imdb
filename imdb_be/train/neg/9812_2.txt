Not only is the plot of this film has managed with ease, in which the two psychos are able to steal a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat, but it was awful rip-off "minuscule". However, the main reason I gave this film a low rating because it's absolutely disgusting to me. <br /> <br /> I'm not someone easily shocked that bends and filmmakers always had a love for the horror of clicks, but the film went too far purely from the point of view of violence and torture for the sake of getting points in the shock factor. <br /> <br /> I think that most people, when they look only to the first ten minutes of "show and Seek", you will find yourself reaching for the remote control.
