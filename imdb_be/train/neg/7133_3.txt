I felt like I was watching Fast and Furious again, but with different actors and a slightly different story. I'll talk cars in the film is very cool. So if you love fast cars, then you'll probably find this mildly entertaining film. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin, because I've seen it from the days of our life. She's a really good singer, but too bad, they gave her such lousy songs to sing in the film. I mean songs about cars; not exactly what you would be here on the radio. It's a Hollywood movie, you have to give the story a little downwind, but I do not think in real life that any average Joe come across such a hot girl like Nadia Bjorlin, who can drive a racing car, fix a car engine, and to be a soloist. It's just all very silly. <br /> <br /> Another note, anyone willing to bet 25 million on a racing nut. But it was kind of cool at the end, when Natasha stopped right in front of the finish line and screw Michael over. . Priceless <br /> <br /> The verdict: This is a film for car freaks. So if you love fast cars, I would recommend it.
