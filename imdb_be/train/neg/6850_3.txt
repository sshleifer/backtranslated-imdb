As a girl, Hinako moved away from their small village in Tokyo, leaving two of his best friends, and Fumiya Sayori. She returns as a young woman, I was surprised to find that Sayori died when she was a teenager. She reunites with Fumiya and they are horrified to learn that Sayori mysterious resurrection through the island of Shikoku. Oh boy. I rented it because I like Asian horror, and I think that Chiaki Kuriyama a great actress. Unfortunately, if I had to describe Shikoku one word, it would be "fruit." This movie is stupid, boring, poorly shot, prose, and most of all, unscary. Kuriyama has a minimum screen while the resurrected Sayori, and her character is given little to work with.
