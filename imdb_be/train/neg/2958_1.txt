This movie was awesome. It is for the brutal. I often get together with a group of friends and go to a movie store to find movies to watch terrible for their comedic value. My friend suggested this one, but as we have seen it, people began to leave. I really wanted to finish it, just so that I could say that I had, but I could not. It's so bad. Terrible running gags, lame action. Protagonists annoying dinosaur klutz and Whoopi Goldberg. I prefer to look at Costener Postman twelve times in a row than to see a part of this movie again. I think they are trying to deal with some issues of discrimination dinosaur, but part of the film that really stands out, dinosaur constantly knocking things with his tail, and then laughing about it. It hurts. See if you are new masochist, otherwise leave it alone.
