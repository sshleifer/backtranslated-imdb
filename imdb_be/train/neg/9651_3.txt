The film is a total crap. We have two good actors, and miscast grain head actor Salman Khan only to attract a female audience. The history of this shit. Symbols bad sketches. Speaking non-existent stories. No editing is not talking. Ajay Devgan as the Rock Star..that dream itself. The film is drawn to the point of decadence. The whole farce about Arjun that his Mann in London, let grope his girlfriend, and that he may not play at Wembley (Vimbley in the process of dubbing) is absurd. Salman Khan over the top action fake or too painful to watch. I remember a few good films that producer Vipul Shah, but this is not one of them. It seems that all the good directors are falling victim to Box Office mania..that media morons Mumbai created. This is another crap film «Wanted» lines with zany actor Salman Khan, who does not hold good in Hindi cinema. He is good in Indian cinema, like the Titanic was a winter cruise business. On a positive note, I love the character ASin dance Bharatanatyam when she goes to the western style of dance when the teacher is not looking.
