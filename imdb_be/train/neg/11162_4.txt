Jack Black character.This annoying is annoying indie film in 14 years olds.Do I have to write eight lines? Ana de l Reger is a dang fine watch as a Mexican nun who puts forward a rather rough and advances the film version of Jack Black.This PG 13 with indie film.I just like a movie that has the courage to explore the Mexican culture.This the film explores the Mexican culture, deeply. I am shocked by the brutality of its cultural: Jack Black is just so rude. White people like Jack Black is not my most valuable emissary to the Mexican culture, as culture were.Mexican Fighting is not the place to shine white guy like me could seek.I suspect Mexico is more culturally opaque than Jack Black is represented here. <br /> <br /> I think, I changed my IMDb review.Has someone else review it changed as well? Just a question.
