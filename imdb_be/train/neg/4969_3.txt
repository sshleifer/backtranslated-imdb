Firstly, it is no where as bad as some other garbage Sci-Fi Channel has produced; it is impossible to say that Grendel good film, in fact, this is very bad, but it certainly has the potential to be much better. Disadvantages of the film come from character design, character, absurd additions to the story, visuals, music, and for the most part :. Acting <br /> <br /> Speaking of characters design, of course, I mean, how our heroes and villains look. Beowulf and other Danes seem as funny Vikings, not warriors brute force - that sends our protagonist is it too silly. Grendel is similar to the Hulk, but with an amazing tentacle attachments to the elbow. <br /> <br /> The characters are very limited. Beowulf same from beginning to end, but the Finn - useless sidekick - has reached a two-dimensional, because thanks to its romantic plot and Unferth gets some idea, as well, as it becomes less vain <br /> <br. /> Like Finn, there are useless additions to the story, to make it your own, while still keeping the original material. Crossbow, which is endowed with Beowulf's so funny, I'm surprised the cast did not come on the set. In addition to supplements, there are gaps, such as the main theme of Christianity and paganism, and the consequences of the lie. <br /> <br /> The special effects are powerful terrible. Grendel and his mother Hag are poorly designed, and as such, they are drawing on the screen is less than plausible. <br /> <br /> music is overbearing, especially if the character dies. <br /> <br /> In general, this is not the worst film of the Sci-Fi today. No, it's actually one of the best films at the trash it yet, this is a good junk that makes it a guilty pleasure at best. The only thing that works is the dialogue, which is still wood here and there. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend you skip this movie and look to take on Robert Zemeckis Beowulf ancient history, simply because this film (Grendel) is only half the tale, not the whole thing, which collects this film three -zorkavy review.
