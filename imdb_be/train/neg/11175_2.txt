If someone does not enlighten me, I really have no idea what the film is about. It looks like a picture with the message, but winked away from him. This film tells the story of a meaningless press agent in New York and about his problems. And, that's basically all. If the agent is played by Pacino, I suppose, that it must be something important. But it takes not hard to think, to understand how meaningless and boring this movie. For one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, is the second film of the year (the other "Simon"), which deserves the title of "the saddest and most pointless film of the year". So, how it's going on, Al?
