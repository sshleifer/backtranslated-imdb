Allow class hours is in English was a bad idea. Movies that are serious and more education may have an effect, but it seems that this one does not have any influence on the class - each time when the teacher left, talks quickly began - and I have not heard the word "Shakespeare" or "Tempest" is used . at all, and when you look at it, it is easy to understand why action is nothing special -. all seem bored to bits, with read-only page without a care in the world Shakespeare always did prefer descriptive dialogue to action and death. but I just could not understand a word anyone says. Garni Culture is not no bad thing, and neither are the special effects - the class may not have liked the film, but they were not clearly p * ss take anything, but it's hard to make jokes on the film, which is devoid of any inspiration or joy scenes.. on the ship at the beginning of the film it was not made too bad - although rain looked a little unreal, everything else has been done well, but where they were cut off heads and blow up the mast where the death which inspired character Ariel would have been made much worse.??? if he was in the clothes - but as it was on the show, he was, etc. one hundred and one more reason for a joke. This film is not in any way appealing to either gender. Women and girls will not have any romance or comedy, to enjoy, and plenty of naked men and the lack of action or death will put most of the men and boys away. Tempest was not badly done, but it felt like something the producers should have done, and not what they wanted to do. In general, boredom and lack of inspiration the show. 3/10
