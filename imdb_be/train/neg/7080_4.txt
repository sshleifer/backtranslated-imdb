This film could be an interesting character study and may give some idea of ​​its subject, but the real problem with this film is that it does not have any of that in it. It makes no insight-, or solve this problem. It's just a picture of the "old" male addict and the problems it creates every day normal life and family for him. Why do you want to look at it? It's all so completely pointless and useless. <br /> <br /> In addition, the fact does not help that the protagonist of some wrinkled 50+ year old male. You'll have a hard time identifying yourself- and sympathize with him. He just seems like a dirty old playboy, who is a constant hunt for the woman and sex. He has all kinds of sexual intercourse in about 3 times a day with another woman, and not just with prostitutes. <br /> <br /> It is also not a bad visual style, but it all feels a bit forced. Nevertheless, it looks better than most other industries directly to the video. Who knows when the filmmakers were given better material to work with, the film would have deserved a better faith. <br /> <br /> The story really gets pokes fun at times. There are actually some pointless story lines, which are often more ridiculous than they were, obviously, should be. I'm talking about, for example, all Ordell storylines. Things get even worse when the film starts to move to the final. In addition, all the way to the story say a sharp back and forth between the events that occurred and the sessions of the protagonist with his psychiatrist feels a little cheap and easy. <br /> <br /> But how bad movies are concerned, it's just not one of them. It is actually no better or worse than any other casual film directly to video, with similar concepts. <br /> <br /> However, it seems strange, very strange, that they were able to throw Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley, Jr., in such a simple little small production, as this is. Guess what they were really desperate for work and money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
