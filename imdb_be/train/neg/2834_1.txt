I'm watching all four machines B Derek aimed at her husband, John; all pretty scary, of course, but it certainly pits. Showing a conventional flimsy plot, bad scenario ?? director, of course ?? and actions, not to mention the gifts nudity star, she has to deal with losing her much older husband, Anthony Quinn (she takes his shotgun suicide, saying that he had always admired Hemingway !!) but that continues to come and talk to her . In fact, he wants to return to the other, more youthful body ??, but actually doing it is only in the very last stage! Derek beautiful as ever, and still plays a naive (!) ?? especially during the middle of the chaotic, which has pursued its assassin in the spa. Quinn also tend to be larger than life (read: an unnatural) here, but it is easily its nadir; In addition, for most of the time, it works because of the shiny plastic piece (presumably believing that he was in some kind of limbo)! His "replacement", then, obviously, beautiful stallion that does not have a lick of talent or even individuals. Also located in the cast Hollywood veterans Don Murray (as Quinn's best friend and business consultant Bo) and Julie Newmar (as the guardian angel of Quinn in the afterlife) ?? plus the odd cameo appearance by billionaire Donald Trump (who presumably need this in your resume! ") In addition, it goes without saying that John Derek was his own cinematographer on the film, that the end credits are filled with useless (and banal) Tribute many people who lent a helping hand, and that ghosts can not do it swept the board in the 1990 Golden raspberry Awards!
