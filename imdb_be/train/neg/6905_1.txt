The clich√©d Polynesian men drink, quarrel and flow sexist, stupid and unfunny remarks. Real life Polynesians much funnier than the stereotypical, cardboard characters. Ostensibly Samoan girl does not look or act Samoan all, more like a warehouse white woman who has sex with someone on a whim. When weak as water plot line, you can not say anything about the acting - even the most brilliant actors could not do anything with this script. It's sad to see the Polynesian actor willing to play such sad stereotypes in the film with more than one good scene, and only two or three "joke". What a waste of taxpayers' money kiwi, than have lost the opportunity to make a great film about a living community. It is better not to make films if they are so bad and meaningless as it is.
