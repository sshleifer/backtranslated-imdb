It is simply cutting with an excellent history of Edwin Torres. This film does not follow the plot of the book. And there are so many inconsistencies with the original film, you have to wonder if the writer even seen the first film. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino (the original and still the best Carlito) is released from prison at the beginning of the original. Carlito goes here with the woman in paradise. <br /> <br /> What happened to Gail from Lorain, Ohio? In this game, it is not mentioned, and Carlito goes and, presumably, will marry some other girl. <br /> <br /> In addition, where Kleinfeld? I think he was in the first book. <br /> <br /> I would like Mr. Guzman plays a very different character in this film. It was in those days Pachanga Pacino. Now he Nacho Reyes, assassin from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes had a much larger role in the book. <br /> <br /> It's been a while since I read the book, but where the character of Sean combs come from? Also, I think this film really glossed over racial tensions in Harlem, Torres wrote. And the crowd is not getting the treatment that they did in the book. They also destroyed in this film. But the magic Pleasant Avenue bunch around the second film. <br /> <br /> The book tells a great story. This film could tell a great story. It's just a huge disappointment. Read a book. It is best to use your time.
