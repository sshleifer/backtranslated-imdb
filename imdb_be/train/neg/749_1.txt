Nu Image, UFO and other produce films for the SCI FI Channel that come in with a budget of about $ 2 millions. Some features of the broad effects of work, others have cognitive casts and still others have both -. For $ 2000000 <br /> <br /> Mr. Hines initially claimed that the film was budgeted at $ 20 million, but it is painfully obvious that it is probably made for $ 750,000, if not much less. Several sets are used, a series of scenes filmed on a green screen, and most of the effects seem to be incomplete and amateurish. <br /> <br /> It is painful to watch. Not so much because it is poorly directed, poorly executed and erroneous, but because many of us have followed the course of this production for quite some time, and had high hopes for this film, despite the relatively modest budget. <br /> <br /> those of us who believed in this film when it was announced joined the legions of those mentioned by the PT Barnum.
