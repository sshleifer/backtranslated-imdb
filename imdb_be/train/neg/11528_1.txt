Whoever wrote the "good" post about it, he must have been another one of these guys. This is bad even for backyard wrestling. In fact it's not even wrestling backyard in fact, it is a couple of guys hitting each other on a trampoline. Every guys about 45 pounds wet and there is not one ounce of entertainment value in this. These are just some bored kids who even give the yard tards bad name, if possible. If you want to see some entertaining fight in the backyard, pick Backyard Wrestling pleasure to pain. It plays a major role 2 biggest names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh ban. These guys are good. They actually went so hauling it and received training as a "real" of fighters. They went to the legitimate and become better. I recommend checking out these 2 guys. MDogg crazy and let off the hook. So do not waste their time and money on this crappy DVD, there is a "better" video back yard there.
