*** Comments contain spoilers *** I'm barely holding this show as the appointment of the TV when they started annoying music under every scene when Don Epps was an average of almost shot for each particular case, when so intranasal Diane Farr was obviously pregnant ( but we have not seen), and if Colby was af ***** g TRIPLE agent. But now, in today's episode, David captured with paranoid, nut work, which obviously an amateur with a gun, in the elevator, and .... He can not disarm. Qualified, experienced field agent who was first through the door many times and experienced in close combat, can not be removed NUT JOB. Not when said nut jobs flashes, turns, drops his head, closes his eyes; even when he looks at the wire twisting fiber around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then came a scene that let me know that as much as I like to study with a fat, old-fashioned, but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy sidekick / love interest Amit, my nights on Friday will be better spent otherwise engaged. Don gives David "distress word", that is the code Â«The s ** t going to go down"; David is ready, they kill the fire, falling elevators, fear of work and nut ...... <br /> <br /> David CAN NOT disarm / KILL / drive SUPPLY JOB nuts. Bad guy ends up with both GUNS, David ends SHOT. <br /> <br /> I did. Hope Numb3 fun.
