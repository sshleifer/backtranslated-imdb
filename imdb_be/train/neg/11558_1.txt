Extremely horrible story that I can hardly put into words. Much of the film was when one of the murder victims is at the end, are alive and well, only to be cut again. There is a possibility that I missed some important elements of the story, as I might have been in a coma for a little time this child was. The box that the film had to show scenes that never in the movie. I was lured into raw images bondage torture and promises of "Euro-trash, sexy horror flick. I get the feeling that this is a budget version and about one-quarter of the film was ousted. All good things are more than likely. I got a PG-13, except that made as much sense as the end of the new "Planet of the Apes" movie. Observe that with each other and the bottle of the solid material. You'll need it.
