I expected it to be much better. I love the work of Tim Burton, so I was really excited to see these short films online. Well, they're not quite what I thought. <br /> <br /> I do not know what I do not like. I think they're just sort of boring. Sound bothers me, and most of the characters, although I liked Roy Boy and toxic Stainboy. <br /> <br /> Match Girl Episode probably bugged me the most, even though it was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> I'm new he does not like how some of the characters die. For example, the match girl basically set the gas station on fire, or the girl who died Stares, in general. Roy's death was funny, surprisingly. Death by car freshener. Very original ;-) It made me laugh so much ... <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not appropriate for children. Just some of the language and blood. That's all I have to say! 3/10
