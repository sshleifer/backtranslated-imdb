The big throw to spend money on a useless script. Ten or so adults reunite at a summer camp they attended as minors. Could this ever happen in a million years? It's fantastic and sad in it. There they become teenagers again? There they play their pranks, games, good times? They can try, but ultimately, the answer is: No I have had the intrigue? Any uncertainty? Horror? Comedy? None of the above. How someone can be entertained me this nonsense. I wanted to love this film; I tried to like this movie, but my brain refused.
