We've all seen some endless epic of our time, but it does cover them all! The film is so long and slow that just put things in perspective, I felt much older than when I left the cinema, which I entered it. With a length of almost 4 hours, he could, and was made in the television series. <br /> <br /> What begins as a promising comedy is slowly losing its pace. Nikhil Advani spun a conspiracy around 6 love stories, and he can not do justice to any of them ... There's no relationship between them, to begin with, as well as the references cited in the last 20 minutes only, it seems, has to connect this story. <br /> <br /> The situation is exacerbated Silly dialogues (most of them repeated in Hindi cinema for many years) and the stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Priyanka does not realize that it actually needs to play its role, and not just looking for gley on the screen ... the destruction of the beauty of waste, not acting. <br /> <br /> and then there is a loud and humorous Govinda my face, twisted-better than Jim -carrey Akshay Khanna, who continue to belch at the top of their lungs, to annoy viewers are tired. <br /> <br /> only good part of the film, John & Vidya love story and good acting / comedy Sohail and Isha. But they are so good in their roles that these two couples could justify the film without jumbling it with a bunch of other characters. Their luster is lost among other substandard storylines <br /> <br /> My guess. - Director made two separate movies (maybe more!), And some aspiring assistant mixed up all the records for the point to sort them, so that the director left with no option to show all as one movie ... <br /> <br / > Look, only if you want to test your patience !!!
