I usually only write reviews of movies that I really hated or really loved. And as you can probably tell from the number of stars there, I do not like it. To date, I suggest that you read about the story, or perhaps even seen the movie, so I'm going to show a summary. Let's break it down, the pros and cons: <br /> <br /> Cons: Concept: The premise was set up to be interesting. Using the theory of chaos, as the theme was interesting. However, it was not done so well. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that chaos theory was a kind of distorted. The event, which took place in the film more like a contrived coincidence than anything. I believe that the butterfly effect has been presented as a whole, "God (s) leads to a tsunami, to bring back the statue." The presentation comes off as really ugly, though. Some people call it reasonable, but it just seems to be another blockbuster souped up <br /> <br /> Scene :. Is it just me, or does it seem that Kamal just threw this together to give him an excuse to play ten roles? The plot is very far-fetched; Govinda continued to lose the vial so many times in obscure incidents (his friend just happens to confuse the vial with the package he sent to India, the crazy old woman just happens to throw a vial into an idol, cast only half occurs unexpectedly found in the same hospital, and that's an idol just happened to be confused with the one that belonged to a famous singer) <br /> <br /> CGI :. O God, CGI. It was even worse than the special effects in Jaws 3-D, and those suck. Immediately, I could tell which parts were animated. Even my ten-year-old cousin knows that the underwater vehicles do not look. <br /> <br /> Tricks: Yes. I now Scenes in Tamil films are not realistic, but this one was terrible tricks and actually distracted me from my history <br /> <br /> Do to: I have to admit that they have done better than expected. I thought that Kamal will play a man with similar skin tones, so that the two white boys and fake fake Aikido Japanese guy took me by surprise. Nevertheless, it was still very bad, I could easily tell which of them were wearing masks <br /> <br /> song :. The music was distracting and out of place in many cases <br /> <br /. > Osin: Her character was probably the most annoying one in the film. She loudly, ditsy, irrational and obsessed with that idol. I actually found myself wishing she would die <br /> <br /> the Plot holes and a refrigerator Logic :. Let me get this straight: monkey lab was smart enough to get a password locked the door in, but not smart enough to tell the difference between chocolate and a bottle with a lethal virus in it. And then, a former CIA agent who hunts bottle figures with it's headed for India. Instead of immediately afterwards, he married dancer pole first. Famous Punjabi singer with cancer checks in small urban hospitals in the third world, where he could afford the best medical care available. In addition, he gets a bullet in the throat with a bullet. You would think that he would be killed, but instead, the magic bullet cleared the tumor. You read that right, the bullet knocked tumor. <br /> <br /> For Will Find ... The Character: Maybe just a nice part of the film was his comedy.
