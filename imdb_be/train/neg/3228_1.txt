I've seen the other films of the guinea pig, as a mermaid in the hole and he never dies, and while they are very ill, they are at least a little sense of humor to them (but dark). The experiment of the devil, though, is nothing more than a pile of pictures punks, representing a young girl many methods of torture and violence, and there is no plot and no redeeming value to it at all. It is not remotely scary as possibly mind, except for, but it is certainly disgusting, and I certainly would not call it entertainment. Now, I'm not a model of good taste in movies, and I like my junk and immorality, but it was too much for me, actually. I'm all for disturbing, in fact, I look for things that are troubling whenever possible, but it was a little bit more. Young woman kicking, beating, presented continuous noise through headphones while she drools, and then threw raw meat and viscera, and hanging in a hammock in the woods somewhere. If you think it sounds great, go for it, but it certainly put me off watching a Guinea Pig things. 1 out of 10, absolutely sickening.
