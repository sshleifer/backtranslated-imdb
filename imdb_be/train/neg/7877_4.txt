The creators of the film have created a future in which not only abortion and birth control illegal in every state, but women are brought to justice for the murder, and sent to serve long prison sentences.In In other words, this film each Liberals worst nightmare! political program is so heavy-handed here, and style of the film is so restrained that he just loses steam pretty quickly.Regardless which side of the fence you are, I recommend skipping it.
