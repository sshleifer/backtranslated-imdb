operated / manipulated documentary about one of the darkest places in Guatemala. portrayed as a fun, safe ... but boring place, had a lot of sex-workers get to play in a football team, gathered in what seems like no more than a week! The main focus of the documentary is to show that society pushes this kind of "workers", even if no solutions to these poor women is not always achieved, except for the fact that people who documented it, made them a sort of "stars" (as as the title says so) in exchange for the adoption of this exploit realityshowlike documentary. This, however, has its own documented reality ... but, unfortunately, that has nothing to do with the storyline. I would not have accepted to see him again; but I would recommend it only for general cultural purposes.
