While many people praise this film here, I must warn you. He has no logic at all. I think that Basinger does a decent job in the action, but you can not make a thriller, if there is a big lack of realism <br /> <br /> This scene shows a good picture for you from the movie :. While Besinzher pursued by bloodthirsty thugs, she decides to sit down and look at the picture, she is out of pocket. Picture with her daughter reading "We love you, Mommy." Who does something like that? What eff? And believe me when I say that this is not as silly as some of the other scenes from the movie. Someone said that this "hidden gem". Well, I have to strongly disagree, this film remained hidden for a reason. And it's not a gem. Yes, please, I do not even want to begin to comment on the red toolbox. It hurts my brain: D Usually, the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small quantities, but this film is mainly made possible only because of the lack of logic. But, I still give it a 4, because even if it is strikingly flaws in logic, it has a certain mood that kept me playing until the end. <br /> <br /> So if you want to look at it, you know, had been warned.
