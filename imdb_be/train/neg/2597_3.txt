Drew Barrymore is an actress who went through the bad times, not just in her career, but also in her personal life too. After gifted child actress she went into the unknown with mediocre poor quality films. While she recovered from this dark past, this film remains as a reminder of the terrible days Drew Barrymore <br /> <br /> The film begins with an interesting premise, very reminiscent of Brian De Palma's «Raising Cain». a work schedule with a split personality that sets this horror story / thriller. Barrymore stars as Holly Gooding, a young woman who is trying to start a new life in California after the traumatic events of his past, which seems to her other person killed her mother. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, her past comes back to haunt her, as her evil person has in their life wants to destroy her new found peace and her new found love. In the middle of the chaos of his new friend, Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern), will try to help Holly confront the demons of her past. <br /> <br /> Unlike undervalued De Palma thriller "The Double" is for the most part mediocre film that not only never meets its purpose, it also contains one of the worst endings movie history. While Barrymore, certainly not in its best, it manages to preserve his dignity with above-average performance. The rest of the cast, however, ranging from mediocre to bad pain over-the-top performances, although Leslie Hope manages to be among the best of them. <br /> <br /> The script full of cliches and the influence of De Palma is quite obvious. While the film tries to be original, making literary references in almost every line of dialogue dull and wooden steps, of course, do not do any good. He has a fair share of nudity and strange reason, as well as the excessive use of special effects. <br /> <br /> makeup effects KNB made an outstanding and truly among the few good things in the movie. However, surprisingly, the excessive use of effects in a completely out of context, reduces the effect of ending the work of the KNB and makes cheese that in another film, it would be strange. <br /> <br /> The fact that this B -movie is no excuse for its low quality and with more and more coherent scenario this can was an interesting movie. Unfortunately, all we have here is a mediocre film that is getting worse every second. Decent beauty Barrymore. 3/10
