All right. So I just got back. Before I begin my review, let me tell you one thing: I wanted to love this movie. I know that I was negative in the past, but I was hoping to be surprised and really get out like the movie. I did not. <br /> <br /> It is not only the fact that every horror cliche imaginable in this. And it's not just the fact that they do every little jump of fear (to go to a baseball bat left on the floor? Are you kidding me?). It just was not scary. One thing I was surprised there was more blood than I thought it would be .. who does not speak a lot <br /> <br /> The film begins with the bottom being dropped mom Lisa at her. house. It comes in .. goes upstairs. Camera for her father dead on the couch. Terrible. She goes upstairs, where the aforementioned baseball bat scene takes place. She finds her brother on the bed, apparently dead (how could she say? He did not have a blood stain on it). The killer comes, Donna is hiding under the bed, my mother was dying. It works out to shout for help. Killer behind her: "I did it for us." Cut to the therapy session. This confused a lot of man-all asked or actually died of her family, or if it is presented, and it is mentioned, as the nightmares began to return. Conversation stands filler. <br /> <br /> They cut hunting rather quickly. Several scenes in the cabin, they go to the hotel. Of course, the killer is already there (for some reason, he escaped three days ago, but the police / family were not informed until it is already there). Filling more worthwhile. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to go on about what is happening in the film, because I do not want to spoil it too much. If you want to know who dies, Horror_Fan made a post about it already. But the theme of death they were not that interested. People in the theater really laughing out loud (an experience that I never had before in the horror film, not even that, When a Stranger Calls) for several of them. One in particular: a bus boy guy who gives the most fun "scared" face I have ever seen. Only death with any blood was Lisa, and it was pretty small. Her throat slashed, blood (if you can even call it that-it was almost black) splashes on the curtain thing. Single blood was on Claire when we see her body. Apparently, Fenton decided to hit her several times after he strangled her to death. Hmm, okay? The film was one of the most clich√©d I've ever seen. Let's see here .. be sure to close the mirror shutter-BOOM! scene. Check. Twice, in fact, (you could say that they are struggling). Required backup-in-killers. Check. There's also a backup-to-light scene, but you have seen. Ah, you say that you want the birds flying away scared? Well, you got it! (Yes, they have managed to turn one of those here). And, of course, we-have-safety-at-all-out, no-he-has escaped the scene. Should I continue? I could. <br /> <br /> For those who say the characters were not stupid, are you kidding? "Oh, even though the massive signal rings, literally speaking, please vacate the building, and 3 of my friends is not enough, I'm going upstairs to get my wrap." These characters were some of the most imperfect and foolish characters ever. The only likeable character - Lisa - made one of the dumbest moves in the movie. "Oh, I just realized that the psycho-teacher here! I have to leave behind his tough guy to escape from himself, to warn her! Oh, shoot, elevator to slow down? I guess I'll take the stairs and run to the construction site! "Ugh. By the end of the movie, they all deserve to die. Only death who felt remorse was a boyfriend of Donna (I can not even remember his name-is it bad?) And by the time the audience was completely drained from this scareless, formulaic film. <br /> <br /> There were some positives- action was decent for the most part, and it was a good shot. But that's about it. <br /> <br /> I would give it a 1/5, and it is to be generous. Just for laughs (and believe me, the audience was a bit), and Brittany Snow. <br /> <br /> Yes, and the response was poor. Too bad. People boo-ing after the movie ended, and the buzz has since been very negative. Wait for this bad leg.
