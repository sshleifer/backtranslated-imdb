Helpless ... worse than a bad made-for-TV movie. I can not believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this movie. For some reason, Morgan Freeman's character is constantly talking about and says "pussy", referring to her friend NSync boy. Morgan Freeman challenge "pussy" Women just uncomfortable ... What the hell, the people behind this film thinking? Too many plot holes, to present in combination with a terrible effect, confusing angles lame script and cheap background music make this film absolutely unbearable. <br /> <br /> I rented this flop with low expectations .... but. .. well ... it really sucks.
