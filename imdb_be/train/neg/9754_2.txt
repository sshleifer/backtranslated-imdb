Posh Spice Victoria Beckham and her alleged new adventure after just moving to Los Angeles for work purposes (footballer hubby David is now the LA Galaxy player after his transfer from Real Madrid), originally intended to be a complete number, but fortunately cuts only one hour or so.But even in this form, he is still numbingly endless. <br /> <br /> as well as almost all the "reality" TV show, most of the incident comes as grossly tampered with the program, even assuming that the newly appointed Personal Assistant Chic is actress.An ugly Betsi- double, we hear some convincing written and performed banter in the early stages (with the obvious joke about an imaginary pampering Bex the previous one, but rather more glamorous oN Rebecca Loos, although her name is not mentioned) with the following sequences associated with fake inflated doll to deceive paparazzi and hopeless attempts to break baseball. <br /> <br /> it might be more interesting if everyone acknowledged that it is a piece of fluff, and had intercourse RESS or imitator among role.Talented impressionist Ronni Ancona would be perfect and be better than Posh Posh himself, and if it was made more reasonable solution, it is much more fun and entertainment have already ensued.Sadly, we are left with the real thing here (Ms Ancona may have rejected the script as too weak, anyway), and although there is the odd scattered attempts self-deprecation and irony, he never remotely works because preliminary information of considerable wealth La Beckham in advance and I ie incapacity to deliver potential jokes, despite the intention to send the image, Mrs Beckham comes across as a petty egoist, and its weak one-liners entirely convince us she has some humorous self. I suspect that if more realistic documentary approach a fly-on-the wall had been taken, namely Posh walking down any street in Los Angeles and being completely ignored (instead of obsessively staged scene soft hysteria on display here), and the partners making unprepared ridicule of th e previously mentioned Ms Loos, it has done little better TV, but being bland PR material, bony one themselves would never have allowed such events occur. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the later scene where she made a special appearance at the ballpark, where it was presented in front of indifferent crowds show this objective will be difficult times when she wants to make it big in Hollywood.Her colleague Scary Spice, (aka Mel Brown) also found that it is impossible to make it big, living in the movie capital, in spite of its merits (not finished) with a big name, Eddie Murphy. <br /> <br /> in the Spice Girls were certainly massively successful chewing pop band in the mid-1990s, especially in their native UK, but still popular short and in other countries, including US.They were, of course, having fun on the peak of fame (1997), when it seemed that the glorious period of optimism in the UK Cool Britannia and the government of new Labor that the Spice Girls, Ed seems to sum up better than anyone else at the time, even if it was somewhat manufactured.But they never were outstanding musical and singing talents and the United Kingdom of optimism, with Avalos quickly fade later in the same year (starting point was perhaps the tragic death of Princess Diana), as well as the presence of themselves.Their spice to the music and entertainment scene, it soon became obvious and repetitive, and if they all came quietly out of the public eye constantly with dignity to enjoy their states, then we would have all been pleasant memories are encrypted in our opinion, without any guilt.Unfortunately, hideous appearance "celebrity" culture in the UK before the beginning of the millennium has put an end to these forfeit ziyah, and we all suffered thousands, if not millions of stories about spices so, Posh is the worst offender, with the rest of their colleagues not too far behind.It was recently announced that there will be a tour in the near future that confuses, because they never happened, and they certainly do not need any additions thereto accounts.Maybe Bank swelling is because the two of them struggling single mother, perhaps? <br /> <br /> Well, it's time for a quick adventure Becks on revelatory documentary film there, I can not wait, ............. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: 2 of 10.
