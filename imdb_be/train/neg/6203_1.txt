I saw it at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was awful! Each template, strong, rich boy fantasy was on display, you only know how it's going to finish especially with all the staff chief's wife and rape the first girl. <br /> <br /> The worst part was the quality factor & a with director / writer and a writer / producer, they were trying to meet an intellectual, but you could say that they are the type of leave to the violence. I'll bet anything that they often brothels and drugs. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. I had to keep my boyfriend out of it.
