This film was long and boring. Strangely, he was elected to Cannes, although they tend to be fond of pretentiousness. The thing is, unlike other Dutch stars of the artistic genre as Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels completely empty. Especially because it has no cinematic quality in general. Long first shot does not mean cinematic depth, it's just a long boring shot. Story was interesting and the characters had problems, I could not identify with at all. The actors were not determined under her leadership, and seemed to have lost from time to time. Leopold tried to, but it is not a talent, I hoped it would be. Where Kerkhof and Kruishoop? They really made some waves in the Dutch cinema. Leopold just made one more attempt.
