"The 40 Year Old Virgin" there is in the world, I do not understand. A world in which an electronics store employee can tell your boss Â«F *** off" and broadcast the video of his naked ass throughout the store and did not get reprimanded. A world where it is really funny to go drunk driving and crashing into other people's cars. a world in which, it seems, is good for the boss to sexually molest her minions. the world is full raging and abusive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. and the world without any funny jokes! I'm absolutely shocked imaginary chorus of viewers who liked this movie. I thought, each scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch - not very funny to begin with, and extends beyond all rational thought Chest waxing scene last forever <br /> <br /> characters except Karel were completely one note A romantic elements were... completely far-fetched, especially the scene where Keener finds porn Karel flat. It was just lame. <br /> <br /> I also discovered that the sequence of "Aquarius" is completely annoying and excessive. I hated hated hated this movie!
