Last week, I decided to look at the weekly Nielsen ratings, and there was Veronica Mars, supposedly "the best show, you do not look." <br /> <br /> Well, they are right, that you do not watch. It aired twice and took the 147 and 145 to 147. <br /> <br /> Translation: this is the lowest rated show on any national broadcast network ... and deservedly so. I tried to watch it a few times because of all the media hyping it as a "big" show "realistic view" of life and all such nonsense. The reality is different. Veronica Mars is boredom. This is unrealistic as it gets, and he deserves to be canceled. <br /> <br /> The only mystery is why the CW has been forced to put on his first chart is the lowest rating in the memory, after two years of continued commercial and artistic failure.
