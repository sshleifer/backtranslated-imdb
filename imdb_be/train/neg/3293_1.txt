That snoring Festival. <br /> <br /> Of all the bits of nostalgia that Hollywood has decided to remake and update, it is certainly one of the most pointless. It did not make sense to show in the first place, and we really do not need a "modern" update. <br /> <br /> Nothing bigotry and sexism inherent in the system from the beginning, so many advances have been made, socially, as the show went on, that the whole point of the show (if it ever was one) has been lost. <br /> <br /> In addition, it makes sense to have a character named Boss Hogg, if he is not overweight?
