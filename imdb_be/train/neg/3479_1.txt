I went to see this movie in the theaters, and I was shocked when I entered the room. There was just me and my girlfriend! It shouted to me that this film is not very good. <br /> <br /> Not to my surprise, the film was difficult. Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys the family at Christmas. It is very predictable story with him falling in love with a girl who hates him. Its action is OKish, but for a comedy film aspect, he is not very good. The storyline of the poor and the comedy is practically non-existent. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. For example, the family is falling apart, and the mother is very funny. <br /> <br /> I hope this review stops other people spend their money. I was very confused when I walked out of the room !!!
