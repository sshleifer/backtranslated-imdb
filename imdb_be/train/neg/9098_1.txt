There is a reason why some films go straight to video and, of course, the obvious reason is that, if it is too naughty for the theater audience and then release the right on the video. Of course, it really would not be fair to the film, which is good, and yet they are also released directly to video. This one is no exception, although the film has good actors, or at least the actors, with the potential to: Amy Adams (I Oscar nominees and talented actress), Robin Dunne, who deserves the best, or at least better agent and Sarah Thompson, who deserves the role that a departure from the teenage melodramas. The film is also distorted: this film takes place before the Cruel so because this film is actually a prequel, and pretty stupid in this. It was a waste, and it's really a film that is at the same level as a soft core porn and masturbation pay-per-view movies. Fortunately for the actors, I hope they will be able to delete it from your resume. So if you want to see something naughty, but do not have the courage to buy porn then this film as a starter.
