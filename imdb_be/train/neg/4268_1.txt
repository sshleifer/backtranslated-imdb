I thought the show from when I was a kid. I can not remember too much about it, just a few minor things about the characters. For some reason I remembered it to be really intense. Also, he was actually very early in the morning up to the software. I finally examined on the Internet for a long time, found the episode. not the first episode at least. Criminey! This show was so awful. it was obviously just made to show the kids to play Lazer tag and having a great time. show opens bhodi Lee says his mother, "has not the names of Christopher, I bhodi lithium-Photon warriors !!!!!" then we have to watch the kids play Lazer Tag to the song "Legs." and not just a quick little bit, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhh my brain hurts just thinking about it. Oh, and as if I could not get worse, you can not even see the laser beams from the guns. its like they just run across the "Legs" songs. Later, after bhodi goes into space, or anywhere they have a poor laser gun fight songs Phil Collins «Su-Su-Sudio.» Oh, believe me, you do not want to know the rest. What can I say ...... light shines !!!!!!!!!!!
