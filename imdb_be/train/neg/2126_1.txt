Jason Alexander is a great actor, but it's funny to throw it as cozy romantic lead. The fact that he dances so well, sings so effectively, and rushes in part so completely somehow just made it seem all the more horrible. In his more cutesy moments (with the girl at the train station, in a finite number with Rosie), I could not take my eyes off him, he was so repulsive. You are all expected that it will release a good guy act and start to growl. Vanessa Williams was a real star, the only work that was better than in the 1963 film. By the way, if you see a production of the musical 1963 film, and this film in 1995, you will see three versions that have multiple revisions (different songs, the same songs associated with different characters and different situations) than any other music I ever seen.
