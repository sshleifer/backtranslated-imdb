I can not believe it! Clipped suggestions? Good grief! I know what? That's right! Real people never talk like this? I do not think so. Good girl! Stout fellow! Stiffens his upper lip! The only reason this film 2 instead of 0 Gary Cooper of the dishes. The film is a whole funny if you do not like to watch endless biplane dogfights. It seemed endless, anyway. Think of all the dialogue Franchot duplicate tonnes. If Crawford and Young make a special effort to sound British, they come as Irish. A handy tip - we Brits clip words, not sentences. And somehow we manage draaaaaaaawl simultaneously. But it is only when we were really good audience (this is up to you) school.
