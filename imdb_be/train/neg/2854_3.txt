Dreyfus plays a mafia boss who has lost his mind, but now it is "fixed." Lane is his girlfriend, who was messing around with his number one (Goldblum), who is supposed to be something going on with my sister Lane (Barkin). <br /> <br /> What someone might consider an all-star supporting cast (Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan, and even the appearance of Richard Pryor) can not help this area, as Dreyfus argues that he did not "fixed" and tries to kill almost everyone in sight. <br /> <br /> You know, it's not like you do not know what will come. The first ten minutes there was nothing but the guys are trying to say Goldblum, what was in store for him if Dreyfus goes, but I'll save you all the trouble: skip this movie <br /> <br /> The real reason I chose. this film because I was hit Diane Lane recently and try to see all her movies. The real let down for me was not just a terrible story, but the fact that it does not show up until the last fifteen minutes of the film (though we hear about it all through the movie). Even being a fan of more than half of the cast can not help me enjoy this film. The part where the unknown was supposed to mount found me laughing at what's really going on. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars.
