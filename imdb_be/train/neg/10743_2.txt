This movie is really bad, with a script full "memorable" lines and an incredibly poor performances. The special effects are too bad (not the worst ones I've seen, too), and the music is so bad that you have to hear it to believe. Just two short threads (30 seconds long or so) are repeated constantly throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In general, one of the worst films I have ever seen.
