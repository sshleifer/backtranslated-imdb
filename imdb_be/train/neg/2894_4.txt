I admit I have a problem with a lot of famous movies, Ealing, I've seen so far could be mine. For my taste, or they are black and rippingly funny, so if light in tone, to be poor in comedies, or history. This self-important way to say, I wanted to like "The Man in the White Suit," but found that struggled to sit through a short lead time. <br /> <br /> The employee textile Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) can be quietly in OK, but he worked hard to strive for progress in the form of his attempts to invent a strand of tissue that can not be broken or made contaminated Using factory laboratory for his latest experiment, he suffers from the limitations of material and human -. the latter backward bosses mills that do not understand that e Mr conceived, then understand it and become even more favorable to stop it <. br /> <br /> «This small minds like yours, who stand in the way of progress," complains Sidney, practicing in the mirror, he is struggling to said the man. <br /> <br /> One of the problems with the "man in the white suit" that vision Sydney progress is very small, and more even than the bosses or workers, who also resent their work . My problem is more elemental: For comedy, "The White Suit" not funny It's quite a serious scenario, which too often attempts to undermine their weak attempt at humor from the cash register takes, takes, double, triple takes, and dizziness doubles <Br /.. > <br /> The best jokes sound Sidney machines suffer on going "BEEP-BEEP-Blop-Bop» looks strange without end and extract every visitor, while Sidney either remove it or a miracle with his blows his efforts. As with any other stray bits of humor that functions adequately in this film, it seemed too long. <b r /> <br /> I've never seen Guinness less affecting in the movie, despite the fact that it looks incredibly young and earnest (though actually in his mid-30s). It seems so bloodless, even more than the wax face of all he played in "Doctor Zhivago", he is not warmer than the fish if it is not paying attention to the sad addiction affects mill girl who offers to give him all his savings if he loses his job (pan persons Vi hope as Bert) or hotter delights young Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood), his one real ally in the fight It is against "squalor and filth," as she put it, that makes these words sound like an incredibly sexy as he could Greenwood. <br /> <br /> Support for the players to make a "white suit" to work as well as it does. Ernest Thesinger with "Bride of Frankenstein" fame plays an extremely backward captain of industry, which looks like Nosferatu and makes laugh, like a death rattle. Howard Marion Crawford as another factory as a leader here memorable as he played blinders medical worker in "Lawrence of Arabia." Then there is an undeniable charm Mandy Miller as a little girl who steals her a few minutes to the camera right from under everyone else. <br /> <br /> But most of the scenes played so straight that one would not think the director Alexander Mackendrick ever worked on a comedy to (his previous Ealing comedy "Whiskey Galore» does not change this impression, unfortunately). Roger MacDougall play in postulates the notion of scientific progress as a potential catastrophe, but can not imagine a dim Sidney nothing but very softly pleasant lights. <br /> <br /> Ealing comedy stored capturing the human side of comedy. Nevertheless Ealings I've seen, it seems, never do this by working only when they play aggressively against our own sympathies. "Good heart and crown" and "Heartbreaker" (McKendrick figure go again) are a classic way. "The White Suit" on the other hand, it is meaningless to speak incoherently, that falls apart when she has to pull together, as well as the ill-fated suit.
