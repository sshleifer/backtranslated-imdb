I've a lot of classic films. Movies like Patton, Going My Way, How Green Was My Valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane, and gave birth to me. However, I would prefer to see any of these films, 3,469 times, being tied to a chair than watching American in Paris again at the most luxurious suites ever. If I did the last one, I probably would have been sleeping all the time. <br /> <br /> Direction color art and music as me, or failure to Gershwin Gershwin's not interested. Dancing and singing can help falling to sleep insomnia. Dialogue does not match the Singing rain. Basically, this film is boring. The only movie that I fell asleep while watching was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. But you can not blame me. I slept only 5 minutes at night. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (a pity that we can not give zero.)
