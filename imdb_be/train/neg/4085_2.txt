"Sir" John Gielgud was supposed to be old to star in the film a mess like this one.; <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies, I think, what is considered "art", but don "t be fooled ..... it's garbage. Adhere to the "art" you can admire in the picture, because the films that are labeled as such, tend to obscure fakes like this. <br /> <br /> In this masterpiece, Giegud reads Shakespeare's "The Tempest," while the camera pans away nudity. one of them a young child urinates in the pool. Wow, that inconsiderate material and the real "art" is not it ?? That's just one example. A large part of this story does not make sense, it is impossible to follow, and, therefore, is one that liberal critics are afraid to say that they do not "understand", so they give it a very high score to keep their egos phony. You want Shakespeare? Read his book.
