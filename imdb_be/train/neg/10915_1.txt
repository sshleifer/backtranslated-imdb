I believe that the war films should try to convey the horror of war, to avoid idealism and perform some basic military principles. Star just makes the first. Star to be Russian war film, I expected that patriotism, sentimentality different poetic images, great expense, Slavic cheekbones and hard Germans. The fact that I did not have a naive love, not a novel, it is unrealistic silly scenes of war and abuse of a dense soundtrack in the film, which carefully avoided all historical and political references (Stalinism, fascism, the Holocaust) only to end in fluent but nevertheless offensively to our sense of the history of the footnotes of the "liberation of Poland." Missed opportunity like a film, but not as propaganda, apparently.
