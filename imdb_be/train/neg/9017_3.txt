I caught this movie on Sci-Fi, before heading out to work. If you have any interest in the fact that Dean Cain dive and avoid in flames again, at least a dozen, this film is for you. If this is not peak your interest, well, I'm afraid that you'll be sorry that you were going to be one in flames, because this movie is very bad. Steps to start with, it's terrible, terrible, terrible. The characters are all quite unbearable, as dialogue is worse than your typical Z-class, Sci-Fi movies. Toward the end of the film began to remind me of «Hollow Man» (complete with escape through the elevator shaft), except with the Dragon, not naked invisible man. Unlike other similar films, but it was not even scary bad ... it was just bad.
