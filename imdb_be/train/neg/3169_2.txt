This film is one of the worst of the year. The main characters have no chemistry and the action hit. Paul Rudd is the only one that has any talent, and the only one that does not irritate. I never looked Desparte housewife, so I do not know how Eva Longoria on the show, but in this film, she was terrible. It's like she does not know anything about the action. Her character makes a whining throughout the film, and it can not be blown down to **** and still interesting. And the other girl, Lake Bell, shows little emotion, and that's how you look at the Key Card, as it reads them. <br /> <br /> As for the story, so cookie cutter. It goes from point A to point B with little surprise. Much more could be used with Kate, like a ghost. The site should revolve more around her and what she does in the spirit <br /> <br /> The verdict :. It is not worth watching.
