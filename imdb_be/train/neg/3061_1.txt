This movie is terrible. Give me a dentist at any time! Can you believe that one of the main television stations here in Arabia were it as a Christmas movie! I can only assume that they were waiting to entertain the crowd with Dudley Moore, and is not it. The last time I looked at my hot water bottle that had more action, better story, more drama and a lot more interest than this waste of celluloid. Do not even look when you're drunk!
