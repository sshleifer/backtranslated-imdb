I noticed that the majority of people who think that this film is telling the truth or not born before landing on the Moon (1969-1972), not old enough to appreciate them. I think it is much easier to question the historical event, if you did not live through it. <br /> <br /> I was a teenager at the time Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what is happening. The whole world was watching the moon landing. Our family gathered around the TV to watch the launch. Newspaper headlines screamed past habits every day, from launch to landing, from moonwalks to the start of the moon, until splashdown, in a variety of languages. In school, some classes were canceled so we could watch the main events on TV. During the Apollo 13 world I prayed and held their collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate. You could not go anywhere without someone asking what the latter was. The world was truly one community. <br /> <br /> Now, with a buffer of 30-odd years after the fact, it is easy to say fraud, because the worldwide enthusiasm and interest died down. We stayed with our books on the history, and who can argue that the story is wrong and attempt to "prove" this with a bunch of lies and fictional facts, while completely ignoring the benefits of evidence suggesting otherwise - not to mention that the proof resides in the hearts and memories of those who lived through those heady amazing and fantastic days.
