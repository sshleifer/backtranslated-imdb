Scary Movie 2, by far the worst of the 4 films, because it is not so much the plot, bad acting, it is difficult and some really bad jokes. But. And it is big, but there is a good actor, a good joke is repeated, and a good start. A good actor is Tim Curry, a good joke is repeated terrible, strange butler with the ugly side, which always makes cringey but laugh worthy things. And a good start is a parody Excorsist. <br /> <br /> The plot for Scary Movie 2 main characters from the original, and a host of new characters along the way invited to stay for the night in a terrible ancient building, but will they survive the night? This film is not very good, but if your bored, you can also look!
