Seeing the people of the sun, I guess I was hoping for an evolution in style and technique to match the larger scale of the film. I was also very interesting to see someone make a fictionalized account of the impartial facts on the basis of what happened during this most famous of Japanese atrocities, but it is not. It plays like a European Nazi exploitation film from the bottom to the middle tier of the 70-ies - e.g., SS Experiment Camp, etc. (Perhaps more deported, women often actually). Of course it has a greater volume and more people running, but it refers to the same cheap and cheerless device many accidents nya-actors fell limply to the sounds ridiculously fake shots, sometimes flavored with poorly executed "shock" sequence. Horrible truth documentary footage roughly spliced ​​between scenes, so beaten, that even the real image takes up most of his power. Watch Channel 4 «The Holocaust» (aired recently (still work?) As of 1 No 2006) for a truly disturbing documentary about the dangers of war (with the participation of remarkable use in context of the actual square footage). This type of treatment Nanjing horror deserves, it is not trite garbage operation (performed better exploitation of the film less disrespectful use of footage would have been nice, but again, it's not even a very good exploitation of the film). Rating: 3 (5 to operate, one as a treatment subject).
