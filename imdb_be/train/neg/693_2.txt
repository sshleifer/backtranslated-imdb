(! (NB: the spoiler warning, for example, is)) <br /> <br /> First of all, it is the teenage slasher film - Spam-In-A-cabin genre as Joe Bob Briggs pungently put it, you Roshambo looking for, it is not, and was not going to be. I was desperate to hit the shots on his film, directing and acting performances. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it was not the first film Zúñiga horror, it was her first screen appearance period, cinema, TV, whatever. For what it's worth; none Zuniga Susan Sarandon and Katherine Hepburn. <br /> <br /> Third, you have to give even a lame slasher flick props. Of course, it is worth deeply insulting message formular its genre :. Any young woman, or an interest in sex beef on the hoof, and at harvest time now <br /> <br /> In addition, one gives a chop sweet, virginal Hero, as well! Now death is a mediocre film teenager who has the courage of your convictions! Interestingly, it was said only ingenue role in the movie. Another One Hit Wonder, except that the term lass gives too much credit. <br /> <br /> (Again, this movie probably has one of the highest percentage of one-movie actors in history. Of the nineteen credited actors whopping thirteen never appeared in any other film. Three of ' appeared in a movie one and the same manufacturer. Only one other, except Zuniga has as many as six credits on the screen. That is, there was and there was no mutual aid society?) <br /> <br /> Of course, I've seen it a long time ago late night cable when I was bored and did not wait for that bored in my life again, but I see no reason to height yts all involved and throw them into the incinerator to Joanna. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
