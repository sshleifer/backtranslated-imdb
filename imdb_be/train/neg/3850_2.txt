I saw this film at SXSW with the director in attendance. A lot of people came, and the audience could hardly collect even polite applause at the end. With 60 or 70 films I saw at this festival, Frownland is one of the worst. <br /> <br /> In 106 minutes, for at least 95 minutes long. You get to watch and unsuccessful attempts of the hero is drawn to communicate in an extended real-time. The same faces, hands over mouth movements, kinetic and passionately repeating words and warehouses again and again and again - we get POINT <br /> <br /> One site actually compares this work before Mike Leigh .. What drugs you have to be to make this statement? Given that Frownland Captain Beefheart song, maybe you should be able to enjoy the Trout Mask Replica on rotation to rate this movie. Incredibly, it was awarded the jury at the festival. One can argue that this is not to win the Audience Award.
