"Gone with the Wind" is one of the most overrated films in history. This is a film like mothers, grandmothers and shut-ins, which go to the cinema once every five years. In the movie, a zombie, it explodes. There is no Shambling corpse in sight, and it is very easy to gore department. "Zombies 3" on the other hand, large in Shambling corpses and quite generous with his blood poured out - so it's better than "Gone with the Wind." It also does not oversell. Most reviewers do not have any errors, it is nonsense. This, however, is not boring rubbish. After the terrorist kidnaps the virus, he throws it at the same time pursuing the helicopter, as well as the chemicals seep into the ground. Terrorist who has been exposed to the opposite of cooking, hiding in the hotel room, where he slowly morpheme into flesh-eating zombies. One of his first victim is a cleaning lady. Once it bites, brand Fulci hell off. As usual for Fulci wave acting a brutal plot permeated plot holes, and blood in abundance. It turns out, the film was directed Fulci and Bruno Mattei, so that explains it quite schizophrenic in nature. He did not shoot too badly edited and the sound design of the apartment. However, he saves his triumphal joining goriest killings and his impatient pacing. Definitely worth picking up if you're undead completed. Or do not like "Gone With The WindÂ», undoubtedly, the worst zombie movie of all time.
