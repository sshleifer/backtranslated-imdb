I've seen a lot of shit in my day, but goodness, Hot Rod takes the cake. I saw a free show in New York that night. I can only hope that they show a funny version for paying customers. Big laughs were rare, the story was not interesting, and the characters were one-dimensional at best. One of the highlights is a lively dance scene with Adam Samberg. It was priceless, and was the only scene I was really hearty laughter. In addition, I can only recall the chaotic and dead air. Samberg and SNL fans may be disappointed. I know what I expected from him. But in short, I would definitely not recommend to attend a free screening or pay to watch this movie.
