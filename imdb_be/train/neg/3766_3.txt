I went to watch this movie, knowing he was not going to be great. but what I saw was terrible for words. I do not mean to be hard, it's just a movie was terrible. in general it was bad, I mean HORRIBLE special effects, acting is not too bad, but not very good either, and the snow itself was like .... well, not Snow. in my opinion, the best Sasquatch film Harry Henderson. He is not violent or horror, but he has the best image with a Sasquatch. at least his suit, and not some half-ass CGI plagiarism. Only see this movie if you are desperate, really appreciate anybody in the film. or go watch The Boondock Saints, it is much better.
