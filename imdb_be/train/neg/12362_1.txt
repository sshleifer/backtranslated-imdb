I saw this film in New York. I was waiting for the bus the next morning, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. The rain was falling, and did not want to wait in AUTHORTY port. So I went across the street and saw the worst film in my life. It was so bad that I decided to stay and watch the whole movie, I still have to see anything else that bad since. The year was 69, so call me crazy. I stayed only because I could not believe it .........
