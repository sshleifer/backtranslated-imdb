OK I'm not American, but in my humble opinion the Scottish Sun Steve Martin not, never was and never will be funny man, as long as our a posteriori are shown in a southerly direction. Phil Silvers, Sergeant Bilko was a funny man, no doubt, due to the experienced writers and directors and all other talented teams working in a series of characters that are perfectly promoted one of the funniest and unoccupied sitcom America ever produced. How can someone have the nerve to even try to repeat the character Phil Silvers me. For the connection of things the exercise was repeated in an attempt unfunny Martin to be Peter Seller Inspector Clouseau, another failed attempt, in my opinion, the Kindle is provable by a serious career. Some of your contributers say, "Steve Martin puts his imprint on the character," to what I would say, "nonsense", its images will be long forgotten when those Silver and Sellars will be treasured for generations
