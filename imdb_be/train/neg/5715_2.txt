"Say Yes" is one of those flicks that you keep hoping to be better, but he never does. It is a kind of "unmotivated psycho decides to threaten innocent couples» crapfest, so a favorite of filmmakers directly to video. <br /> <br /> clunky dialogue, and in several places, poorly translated. Actions are uniformly poor, especially from the villain of the piece, played by Jung-Hoon Park. he seems to think that, without blinking and trying to sound bass, it makes it nature seems threatening, when all it really does is make it seem tro and simple. <br /> <br /> The story deserves special mention, as it is idiotic beyond belief. "Heroes" did not think it too strange that their trip threatens to kill them. "heroine" manages not see double villain, if he is not more than a foot away from her. the villain gets past the police station (while wearing a shirt covered with blood, and bloody head bandage), indicating the cops charred corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving. Villain hit, batons with a shovel and strike out with a pitchfork, but never seem to prevent this, it is very serious, injury. And do not even get me started on that horrible "twist" ending. Sheesh. <br /> <br /> The only plus point in the film, for me, it Sang Mi Chu. Who are very beautiful, but in fact nothing more than an ordinary actress. <br /> <br /> In general, this film does not go as badly written, acted slowly and shockingly directed attempts to copy the "Sputnik" and «Spoorloos», but it is not at every step due to lack of talent in all parties.
