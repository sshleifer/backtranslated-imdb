Spoiler alert Well, I think that this film is probably the worst film ever made. Probably, in the style of Ed Wood (no heart). Lightning scary. Music is very bad (piano and orgue ... Come on!). Act ... well, there is no action! <br /> <br /> There's a guy who actually goes into the woods to find his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger. <br /> <br /> killer fat, unscary clown who could not overtake the tortoise! <br /> <br /> Each member of the troupe and director stupid clich√© shredders put any film in the film without effort. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's still the most stupid ever done. Think about this: A guy (Ken Hebert), the effect lasts about the same as his writing (he is the brain behind this flop) to invite the officer and two of his friends in his cabin for the weekend and kills them. .. on Monday morning he returns to the office as if nothing happened. <br /> <br /> tragedy that Mr.Hebert trying to make us believe that it is a family affair that lasts for generations (his uncle is the killer clown) <br /> <br /> So, certainly not the police are not going to interrogate him after his colleague was gone ... <br /> <br /> WHATEVER. <br /> <br />
