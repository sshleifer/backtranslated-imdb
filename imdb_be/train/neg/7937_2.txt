After 30 seconds, you already know that there was no real budget at this cheap knock-offs. History is taken from the great films as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "The Hills Have Eyes." I love these kinds of films, even if they are well-duplicated (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But «Side Sho» hard look: actors really bad, cheesy dialogue and music is stupid and ridiculous. You do not care at all what is going on with the characters. The so-called bad guys, too, is not interesting at all and rather stereotyped. So what about the blood and gore? Well, there are some, although it is quite cheap and action is performed very poorly. 2 points, only for gore and blood, but realizes that this is unlikely to worth seeing, even for Gore-hounds ..
