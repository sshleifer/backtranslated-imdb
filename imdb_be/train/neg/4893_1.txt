The film is really too slow. There are some good pictures, but it does not outweigh the fact that the film is really boring. You see, sexual intercourse many watermelons and sexual intercourse while eating melon, and perhaps a little more. It may seem even to someone interesting, but believe me, to see him for 2 hours is not fun. Although you laugh a few times, but it really is not enough, and it may be more out of desperation and does not believe, than pleasure. In order to disturb the director of anguish trying to put a few movies video clips in a movie. They are really colorful clips absurd songs, maybe from the 50s, but it's hard to say for sure, and they try to be funny so much, it's really sad. Several times you have the feeling that the site could turn into something that creates a powerful scene, but in the end, it's just somehow evaporates, and that's all. In addition to the clips almost no dialogue not to mention the music. The director tries to be original and artistic at all costs. Personally, I can not recommend this film. I believe that art is something that should not be boring. When designing was yawning all around a movie that simply confirms my overview.
