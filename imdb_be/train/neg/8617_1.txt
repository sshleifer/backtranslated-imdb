Watching 10 minutes of this movie, I was confused, watching 30 minutes of my toes were curling - I just could not believe it: The film really badly. In fact, it is so terrible that I had to watch it all just to make sure (!). During this, I came to the conclusion that it reminded me a lot of the so-called Danish comedies from the 60s and 70s. The scheme is as follows: Take a hugely popular comedian to do the script, putting the comedian as many grotesque situations as possible, add a bunch of jokes (especially the One-liners), and spice it up with a couple of beautiful young women - the movie that you is success! I do not know when this film was a success, but in contrast to the Danish tradition, died quietly (with a few great comedian), it seems that there is a market for this kind of film in the United States.
