Charles Bronson reached 80 slump that would be his worst film of the decade, if not forever. In it he plays a detective who goes to great lengths to find a pimp who stole the Asian girl and now sells it to the highest bidder. This is a shameful attempt to action and, quite possibly, the most depressing movie ever made. Many people believe a death wish to be the worst movie sequels Bronson. The Death Wish sequels were not great films, but in most cases were well-made and very watchable. Kinjite but it is very stupid action movie, which is punctuated by an energetic middle-racism and child molestation. It really rephrensible film and all this is compounded by the fact that he tries to preach the mentality of "Law and Justice", which is too excited to really say anything. Indeed, the film begins with a minor sex interrupted from Bronson then anal rape pedophile with a penis. Chicago Theater I watched it just choked with embarrassment this scene, only to exhale in embarrassment pimp rape of girls in this movie. It makes no sense, but to use and in fact, the film was not well written enough to rise above the level of exploitation and to put something that will work. Bronson seems to be more in things, but it is clear that it is too disgusting to save. I want to point out that I think that Charles Bronson is the coolest actor ever, but the effort ultimately it worse. Workflows are poor too. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * with 4- (terrible)
