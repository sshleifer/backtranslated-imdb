I love a good juicy love story (and I'm a guy), but when I shot «Love Story» I prayed for the end came quickly and painlessly as possible, and on the contrary to the character of Ali McGraw. <br /> <br /> Ali McGraw, Jenny alienated and irritated brackets with me for the first 15 minutes. If we learn that she has been diagnosed with, I could not have a life-threatening disease but wonder if her death would be such a terrible loss for the poor Oliver, or if someone is watching this film, does not even matter. If she died her face grille, probably Oliver pushed over the edge, and eventually landed them in divorce court. <br /> <br /> People love this movie, but it's one of the worst since the 70s.
