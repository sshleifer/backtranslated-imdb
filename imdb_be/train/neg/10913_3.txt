Marvin (Rob Schneider) does not have the ingredients to become a police officer, who is his ultimate dream. But his success is different when he has a crush car (very bad), and shown by your doctor. The physician should use animal organs to restore it. After that point, it begins to have wild behavior unconsciously and become the best cop could have been one. By the time he realizes that changing his animal instincts start to take their human side. At the same time, he finds a beautiful girl, and aims to be a gentleman, which means that he has to control himself and behave in a civilized manner. I'm not a big fun of Rob Schneider. In fact, this is his first film that I have seen. Nevertheless, I can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser (see. His role in Ally McBeal, pretty funny, actually) .There are some good parts in the movie, such as its courtship with goat. In such films, the biggest problem is that the script seems to make the audience feel stupid. I am sure that this movie is good to watch, until it too seriously. But it is very sad to see that such films are doing very well at the box office. The animal is not the worst film I've seen so far, but can not get more than *.
