and forget about it. Completely. If you really want to see Madonna act to remove the "body of evidence", at least, Willem Dafoe is. <br /> <br /> In this film, while the sets are beautiful, you can disable the dialog, you will not miss. Bruce Greenwood wasted Tripplehorn is a pillar, and Madonna is so awful, it becomes funny. Why did they have to kill the original film in this mess, I'll never know; I guess they thought it was "paid back". Madonna as an actress, of course, it is not. <br /> <br /> If you rent the original film from 1979, though, you will enjoy it, and the actors in it really can act. 1/10.
