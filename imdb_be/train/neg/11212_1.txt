The premise of the film was decent, but sub-par actions, it was just bland and boring. <br /> <br /> spoilers movie does not work because of the nature of death, it was random, so even though it was the murder was not how to set the guy to do it. Also in a few flashbacks it has a secret, which showed that kind of makes events like justice to some extent. There's no emotion in this film. The first 20 minutes or so just the woman called her sister and heard her message. It was dull and boring. <br /> <br /> With some polishing, and better effect it could have been very good.
