... and Ethel Merman buff will also love it loud, overbearing vocals, like an evil witch Mombi, but this cartoon sequel to "The Wizard of Oz" is deprived of real imagination, substituting imagination and excitement with noisy activities (and cheap repeating his shots, as a bad clip). Little Dorothy whisked back to Oz, who went to the death, and met old and new friends. Tasteless animation lingered somewhere between the weakest and less Disney-inspired show by Hanna-Barbera, but many of the songs are good, especially the sweet weeping Dorothy "It Away Land", superbly played by Liza Minelli. You can count on Minnelli for energy, so the film is animated, when Dorothy around. Much of this unmemorable, and I'm not even sure that the baby boomers get a charge from him, since he was out of circulation for so long. As curiosity element just not fair. ** from ****
