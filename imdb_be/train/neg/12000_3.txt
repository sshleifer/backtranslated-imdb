The only possible way to enjoy this flick to beat my head against the wall, let some internal bleeding of the brain, let a bunch of your brain cells die, and once you officially retarded, it is possible, then you * might * enjoy this film. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace was the story between Raj and Stephanie. Govinda was very rich in the role of a taxi driver and so was the Brit girl. Maybe if they had set up the entire film on his adventures in India, and how they eventually fall in love they would make it much more enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave it a 3 rating is because with Govida and his ability as an actor, when it comes to comedy. <br /> <br /> Chawla and Anil Kapoor have been wasted unnecessarily. Plus scene at Heathrow with reunification was too much to digest. As an international traveler in the post 9/11 world, Anil Kapoor would get himself shot a lot before he even reached the sky bridge to profess their true love :) But again the meaning of the film was to defy logic, gravity, physics, and throw an egg on his face * * ALL audiences. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk. At least, I know I was traumatized for life :(
