On this day, when you talk about Japanese cinema, most people will not talk about the Rashomon or seven Ronin, or wound. For the masses of Japanese cinema means that all those monsters we loved destroying Japanese cities over and over again many times in battles with each other. The first and largest of these Godzilla, who returned a dozen times or more, and in a few films faced three hydra as a monster from outer space, Ghidrah. <br /> <br /> Ironically, in step with the times, special effects got a little better. But part of the charm of old movies had seen the city sets the paper mache destroyed, they looked so phony, maybe three steps above Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Some visitors from the future have time traveled to Japan to urge that Godzilla be destroyed from when it was first discovered. And in fact, it was first discovered as a dinosaur preserved during the Second World War, when he defended the Japanese garrison on the island of the Pacific Ocean by the American troops. But then with atomic testing bikini Godzilla friendly dinosaur just like Barney became Kostolomov we have grown to know in the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, you are depriving Godzilla, you give Ghidrah exact field to destroy Japan, so it does not become an economic colossus it was before 1991, when the film came out. More I will not say, but we all know, Japan is doing quite well, as the 2010 <br /> <br /> Like all other Japanese monster movies, just sit back and enjoy the mayhem.
