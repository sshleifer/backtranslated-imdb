It makes the actors look like in the Hollyoaks Royal Shakespeare Company. This film is a jaw dropping how awful it is. Enabling disconnection DVD-player is not a sufficient course of action. I want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap them across the face. I will never get that time back. Never. How can you create such a banal, boring and soulless film? I could not think of a course of action that would alleviate boredom. Give the necessary ten lines extremely difficult for such a disgraceful piece of cinema. What more can you say than to confirm how truly awful acting. Please avoid.
