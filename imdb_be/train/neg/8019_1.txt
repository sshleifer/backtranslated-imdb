I read half a dozen other user comments on this board, and it seems that opinions vary widely. I agree with those who found the film horribly. It hurts me to write that, since I'd hoped it would be great, I would not bother to see it the other day. I like to support the indie film, especially if they are gay-themed, but this film is almost too much to tolerate. Those who came out, so I thought to do in about three minutes, probably will not mind shelling out $ 11.00, or just realized that is not going nowhere, fast, and is not going to improve. Maybe I'm a little more optimistic than they are..either, or that they do not pay to get in first. <br /> <br /> Logan boring. He is a simpleton. He is gay. I'm fine with it. The problem is that, as the protagonist in the film is boring does not necessarily mean that the movie about him, too, has to be boring! There are endless scenes of the baby just lay around like a load of laundry, restoring all that you have learned in the first stage and the second stage, etc, etc ... Nothing or no one goes anywhere. Nobody says anything even remotely funny or insightful or interesting. Probably the worst of all is that I did not feel the slightest sympathy to Logan. This in itself is a major achievement. He did not grow up, he has not changed, he did not recognize (not the one to teach him anything), he has done nothing, and neither did the movie! Scene after scene in the same movie does not. <br /> <br /> In addition, the name has no meaning. 1/10.
