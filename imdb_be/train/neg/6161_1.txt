This is probably the worst fencing, sword-fighting film ever made. This is not only because of the so-called sports fences are poor, but because the story, the characters are so weak that they have to throw in the nude sex scenes, and then, presumably a group of dancing around the stage fencing in the fencing club trying to, I guess, to maintain audience interest. Which is a waste of talent F. Murray Abraham. You are better served to removed hyped movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, all that Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a swordsman himself, I admit that it is almost impossible to capture fencing as a sport in the film, but if it ever happens, it has to have a fresher, better drawn characters and story with more depth.
