Well, I've heard and read all reviews and comments to choke on how this film could earn Oskara` so I went to see him today. What a big disappointment! 1) If you read other reviews you will learn from the US soldiers who served in Iraq, it is unlikely that the events of the film are. They reflect my own thoughts; I like the movie played - full civil - continued to think of himself, "to say that there's no way that would happen like this? .. "2) There is very little that is really going on in terms of plot. New guy disposal indicates to replace the one who was killed (death, which is actually not clearly explained). The new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work. His attitude endangers others. That's it! 3) This film is not suspenseful, as claimed. If you want to try one of the suspense of the Bourne movies. If you want to see War film that emotionally powerful, try to rent a Go Tell Spartan, which is about the Vietnam War, and stars Burt Lancaster (who told me personally at the happy meeting in a supermarket, it was a movie, he was very proud and one he regarded as some of his best works, and that he was still upset largely ignored after more bloated Apocalypse now), or the old second world war black and white classics to sink the Bismarck, which, especially for the English film, incredibly Painfully. Do not waste your time on the Hurt Locker.
