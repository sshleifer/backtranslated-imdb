Definitely a strange debut of Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, alcoholic family man whose life is collapsing all around him. Cecil missing phone book, the name of the preacher looks and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher's house and discuss their problems. Preacher teach Cecil respect the word of God and Jesus in his heart. It makes everything better. Ahh ... if only it were that simple in life. The fact that this "film" looks as if it was made with about $ 500, of course, does not help. 1/10
