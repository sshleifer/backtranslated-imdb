Except FAMILY, the new season less than one season. I can not imagine what they're thinking. As a supporter of terror, I can tolerate a lot of gore and senseless mayhem, but this series is getting worse with each outing. I can not imagine how upset it should be for the actors and crew to go to work every day, working in a lot of shit. LAD! It's too much to ask? CHARACTER! How can we give a damn about the fate of those who are in these stories? If we do not do, who cares where they get separated? Almost every episode ends pointless bloodletting following the coarse of the shock without any sense of revelation or imprisonment, or the reasons why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting. Even Dante's efforts were hardly sexist violence this season and made his way to a meaningless conclusion. Oddly enough, the value of production and presentation, as a rule, up to speed, while the content of shit. I have high hopes for Harris in Valarie Exec producer under the stairs, but we'll see.
