the only thing great about the film is its name. In this case, "Snakes on a Plane" is an example of not judging a book by its cover, the name does not say anything about the movie. When I went to the theater, I did not expect, Citizen Kane, I expected that the Independence Day, the film is pure popcorn fun, but instead, I got this horrible Roy Liotta film called "Turbulence" Yes, that's how bad SOAP It is only making SOAP better name. And it's not even apporiate name for the movie, it was not even a glimpse of the "snake" or "plane" 40 minutes in the movie! That false advertising! If it were not for the name, SOAP is just another memorable cheap B-grade film in the summer. And the rating R? He must be the most undeserved R rated movies of all time! The filmmakers only to add a few words of f to do this the R, all the violence persist PG-13 level. You know, that actually R rating? R Superstar Edge rating! Watch it at Summerslam, instead of spending money on a snake!
