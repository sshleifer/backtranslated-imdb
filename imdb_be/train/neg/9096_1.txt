I think this is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Trying to get "the same signs," with different people is * so * bad idea. If they can not get Sarah Michelle G. and P. Ryan in it, they should just cut their losses and said the hell with it. Instead, they get new actors are terrible, they did. I seriously felt like I was in high school, or (bad) College to play with the lever acting these people continued. <br /> <br /> Where do they get some of these people? Whether it was their first film? He sure seemed like it. <br /> <br /> This film also parallels the original speech in several rows. I just finished watching the first and jumped out # 2 I was excited to watch the other, and it ended up being the worst show I have seen in a while. I do not hardly ever * EVER * turn off the movie, but this one is definitely gone after about 30 - 40 minutes.
