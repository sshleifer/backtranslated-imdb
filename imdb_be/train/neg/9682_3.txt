In order to overcome the death of his wife, he is doing what someone in his position, of course, to do (at least in the film by Peter Greenaway): he and his son to occupy his house eight and a half (one has no legs) women and stand sexual odyssey. This time Greenaway film, there are many pretentious and uninteresting ranting and, of course, do not need a male nudity. In fact, the father and son share a bed to sleep in the nude. Gross. Besides, who wants to see an old guy full frontal? For those who are not in the homo-erotic scenes, one of the women he likes to do the nasty with horses. There's no story - just a random collection of boring scenes.
