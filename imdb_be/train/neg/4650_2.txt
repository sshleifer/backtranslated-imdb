With a cast of British actors of strong character and pleasant pictures 1950's Britain, I had hoped and expected to be more than entertained by this film. Unfortunately, I found that adhered to it for the wrong reasons - I could not believe how awful it was. I must have watched thousands of old movies, and I am always ready to make allowances for them to be products of their time, but it was very difficult to walk. <br /> <br /> As already noted, the main problem is that it doesn 'seem t know what he wants to be: a gentle romantic comedy, slapstick comedy or musical. I was a bit taken aback when Jeannie Carson suddenly started singing about 15 minutes! This is not true, at any level, whether it is the story itself or the fact that he would never have a Daisy ounce threats in it at any time. Other aspects which are challenged by the trust included casting polite Donald Cindy as a composer (author of the song for God's sake!) The fact that he has Diana Dors for fianc√©e and it seems that has not the slightest interest in it (I mean, Diana Dorsey! Come on!) and a ridiculous scene in the office of the publisher of the song. . All this is silly in the worst possible way <br /> <br /> If I had to pick a favorite scene, it will be one at the beginning of this wonderful actor Wilfred Lawson - then it all went under the mountain in a big way.
