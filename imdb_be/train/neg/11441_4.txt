After a promising first 25 minutes, which makes you feel all warm inside, you are very confident that this will be a great romantic comedy. Then the film takes a turn for the worse. <br /> <br /> warm feeling can still be, but like others he said: The story becomes so incredibly artificial and that it is almost unbearable to watch. <br /> <br /> The film gets accelerated, and you get the impression that you either fast forward through it, or that the producers decided to write it in less than 1h40m, and had to cut a lot of scenes. <br /> <br /> The realism is not the goal itself, but as a spectator, I am quite sure that this comedy entirely deliberately unrealistic, it just happens. <br /> <br /> on the plus side, this movie has some good interiors, and in spite of the bad script, I think that the actors performances mostly good. If I could only evaluate the first 25 minutes, I would probably give him eight. As it is now, it takes four. ... And it is to be good! <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of romantic comedies, you probably have a great time anyway. If not, then I would recommend you to watch something else.
