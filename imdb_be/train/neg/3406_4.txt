Space Camp, which was bad luck scheduled time the Challenger accident, deserves such luck. The "stars" makes a mockery of the action, Lea Thompson actually turns away when asked for more than her usual naive innocent smile seems to hide her ridiculous attempt. The film is sometimes funny, when he starts asking too much of you. Little boy holds a multi-million dollar robot in his closet, break if given too many teams hordes clich√© dorm mates. It is trite and unattractive car, "evil eye", is a major player in a funny premise of the film, which seems to be part of a short-circuit, of the 2001 aircraft team. I will not bore you with it, suffice to say that you can only laugh when confronted with it. Having said all that, it's nice to look at, in the SeaQuest, saved by the bell sort of way. Romance and technology, be careful, as incredible as each other. In addition, if you are a freak of the eighties, it is impossible to miss for fun performances Capshaw (Wiley from Temple of Doom) and, obviously, Leo Thompson. Moreover, Joaquin Phoenix puts in a bizarre turn as a kind of wannabe Goonie who befriends Jinx. Do not approach this film, if you do not like garbage.
