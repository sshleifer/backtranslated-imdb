Firstly, I do not actually advocate of all "things to eat meat in hideous new ways" genre movie, but I'm a bad film afficionado so that my neighbor said it was the worst movie ever. This one. Thus, we begin to look. In the first place - it is written on a tripod camcorder SANS! The second voice skinny white doctor sounded great black man! Third, none of the dialogue makes no sense. Fourth, the zombie scene, though unconvincing chockful bad makeup and tomato paste, leads me to believe the director (and my neighbor), in need of psychological help. Funny, for about 5 minutes, but it gets old fast. It is so amateurish that it is like watching a badly dubbed high school video yearbook .... zombie. Note to anyone involved with this film - I want 20 minutes of my life I spent watching it before I went to sleep again.
