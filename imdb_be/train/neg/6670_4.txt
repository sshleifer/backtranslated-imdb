This film really came to a great start. It had the potential to become a really heartbreaking, romantic love story with cinema, which recorded the love between "Harlan" and You in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. It really does not need anything more than this, and for a moment there I was excited that someone finally making a great film for its own sake, another timeless classic, modern myth, perhaps. Why, oh why, then mess it up in the middle, making the protagonist (Norton) other crazy? Maybe I'm missing the point, but we really need another film about the mentally ill? Or is it a requirement to Hollywood to portray the affected side of human nature, indicative of a more general malaise in the industry? For a moment, I was going to make a mental note of the name of the director; I now leave you indifferent. At least, it should be added to protect the film that all the actors seemed to put money into their roles. In addition, Evan Rachel Wood is really nice to look at and a good actress with great potential.
