If "My Deja Vu, my deja vu" was broadcast last season, I was satisfied. Bushes, I thought I was doing something clever and unique to show the video concept. Instead of replaying the footage, they overplaying the joke in a self-aware manner, and I really liked. <br /> <br /> I have found that it is actually a pity that I was wrong. One season later, they lost to the fact that almost all comedies inevitably do, the clip show ... and it looks like it was put together with the work experience kid. Shaved head Dr. Cox shows how lazy editors have put it together, as it does not appear again until "My Long Goodbye" some 4 episodes later. I can not imagine that the wig is too much effort when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well-built sitcom. Who knows why it was slit there, it just seemed lazy and absurd, reminding me (largely) episodes, which aired during the past year. <br /> <br /> The three-second clips stuck together with background music is a DVD in addition to a (very) rainy day, not an episode in primetime television.
