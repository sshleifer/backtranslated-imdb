I watched this movie last night and I'm struggling to remember a lot about it. The story of a group of criminals who escape from a space colony. They fly to the moon in a trash media space age; if they terrorize Dustbin people working on Moonbase. <br /> <br /> It amazes me that garbage low-budget science fiction movies often include a desert planet, or as this film, the criminals escape from prison, Why is it I have no idea. But I can say with some confidence say that such films are always the devil. This one is not really an exception. It starts well enough with decent credit sequence and halfway in the manner of dance music soundtrack. It then degenerates into a boring sci-fi thriller. So little consequence actually happens in this film that I literally struggling to write a useful review, so if you're reading this, I apologize for not being able to enlighten you to the subtleties and nuances of the film. For the record, I remember the tedious bunch of villains to a heavy pile of sweets, some nuclear warheads, and a hologram of a naked woman. In addition, I was struggling. <br /> <br /> If you feel that you might be interested in the activities of the moon people, dump, I would not hesitate to recommend this film. I would also recommend it to those of you who want to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets.
