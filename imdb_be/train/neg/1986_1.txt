I must disagree with the other reviewer. This must be the worst film, not to mention Western I've ever seen. Terrible action, dialogue, which was mundane and miserable (not to mention the completely inappropriate for allegedly being in the 1800s), and oh, did I mention the battery pack is prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters? I was expecting a boom microphone lodge in the middle of the scene. And the ending? Least I can say that this is consistent with the rest of the movie ... just awful. And yes, it does contain all the clich√©s in the book from a slow walk down the empty dusty road to the ridiculous "let us remember, when" shots when dying protagonist. Fortunately, I saw it on free TV. Do not waste your time.
