Previously enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action films, and I expected a lot more, even with a score of 5.8 IMDb, the film is not in a position to entertain and although the story is thin and unoriginal, acting most unfortunately, is thinner and comes to simulate A " worst case scenario "to play a" strong "feeling accompanied by some bad actions ... nya waist then this film Isnt entertaining, if you want to cry may be sufficient, though, even if your tears are crying because of the meeting Wesley Snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy ... <br /> <br /> I give it 2/10 it was really horrible, if you want to see a decent movie to go see the shooter or rent it, it's all the good things this film is not.
