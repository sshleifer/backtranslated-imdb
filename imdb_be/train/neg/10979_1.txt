Words can not begin to describe how awful this film obsequiously. I wish it was "so bad it's good", but it is not. It's just boring, lifeless and boring. It's so bad that I could not even laugh at him. <br /> <br /> In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon Sun highlight of the film. The only person less charismatic is director Brett Kelly, who is currently the assertion of pride, cast himself Actor. They both look like inbreeds, sister and brother. <br /> <br /> Gal, Sherry Thurig, is a looker. The exact opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and slim, and can act. Although you may say that it constrains. <br /> <br /> All the actors seem to be holding back, especially with the support of men, Mark. I've seen less wood in the rainforest, but it is still better than Kelly. Why Kelly actor to keep his act? Is he really such a bad director? All other story summed up perfectly - there is not one. Children were abducted and Kelly steps to urinate, to solve the crime. I know how he felt stepping in poo, how I felt after watching his movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I tried to get my money back from the store for rent. It is better to leave a home movie to be seen by friends of Directors (and if you look for them, you will see the same friends were the one who gave the film a positive sign).
