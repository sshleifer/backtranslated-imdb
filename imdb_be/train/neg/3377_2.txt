Broadway musical, "chorus" is probably the best musical in the theater. We are talking about the experiences of people living in the dance; they feel joy, and the sacrifices they make. Each dancer to audition for parts in the chorus Broadway, but what comes out of each of these stories about how their lives led them to find the dance as a respite. <br /> <br /> version of the film, however, does not reflect any of the passion and the beauty of the stage show, and perhaps the worst film adaptation of the Broadway musical, as lifeless and devoid of any attachment to dance, whatever. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake has been made in giving the job of director Sir Richard Attenborough, the direction of which only offered the right touch and everything goes on "Gandhi". Why would anyone in his or her mind to ask the director to direct an epic musical that takes place in a rather constricted site? <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the next problem. "A Chorus Line" comes to the stage in the theater without any real sets and limited costume changes. This is the least flashy of the Broadway musicals, and its simplicity was his fame. However, this does not translate very well to the film, and no one thought it would be. For this reason, the film was supposed to take us into the lives of these dancers, and had to leave the theater and audition process. Singers could offer their songs in other environments and even offered flashbacks of their first ballet, jazz and tap class. Heck, they could dance on Broadway in their lively imagination. However, not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film as indifference Attenborough for the dance and the show itself is manifested in his careless way. <br /> <br /> Many scenes are downright embarrassing, as the dancers tell their story with the director (Michael Douglas) if he wants to hear them or not. Douglas capricious character of the elections, which he runs a sympathetic ear, and to which he has no patience. <br /> <br /> While the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play, some heretical changes were made. Very nice "Hello Twelve Hello Thirteen Hello Love" - ​​a crushing stage number that received the dancers back to adolescence - was removed and replaced with an eerie, "Surprise", a song so badly that he was nominated for an Oscar. Adding insult to injury, "Surprise" simply retell the same story as "Hello, love," but without the wit or pathos. <br /> <br /> There's no reason to see this movie, if you do not want a lesson in what not to do when moving a Broadway show in the film. If you want to see the film version of the show, Bob Fosse next closest thing to a genius "All That Jazz". While Voss daughter is in «A Chorus Line», he is Voss, who was supposed to participate as director. He would know what to do with this material, which deserves much more respect than this sad effort.
