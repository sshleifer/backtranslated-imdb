Bad plot, bad dialogue, bad acting, directing idiotic, annoying porn groove soundtrack, which ran continuously over the beat script and crappy VHS copy may not be redeemed by the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Believe me because I stuck the turkey until the end. It was so touching bad in all that I had to understand that this is the fourth year a parody Springtime for Hitler. <br /> <br /> The girl who played Janis Joplin was only a weak spark interest, and it was only because she could sing better than the original. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something like that, but a thousand times better, and then watch outside dolls Valley.
