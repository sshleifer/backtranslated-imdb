It was almost inconceivable to me that this film will be a bust, but I was really disappointed. Being a connoisseur Pekinpah cinema for many years, I found this DVD, is drastically reduced, for sale and thought it was worth a shot. Opening several credit emblematic Pekinpah supporters have sharp interconnectedness between humans and animals, but here we are, entirely diegetic ambient noise of children playing in the schoolyard while the bomb is planted. Fantastic unknown. Then, when the criminals, Caan and Duval, a trip to their next mission, Duval loses bomb on Cann, the date it was last night, STD, found only tracking in your purse, and Cann was to be close to her. The ensuing laughter is fantastic, and obviously gave in Brian DePalma's Dressed to Kill, on the expense of short-lived Dickenson angle. The problem with The Killer Elite is that after the opening credits, the film falls flat. Even Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia has a strong emphasis on production, a great challenge for those who know what I'm saying. I use Pekinpah loans as supplementary material lectures, but as soon as they are finished, turn off The Killer Elite.
