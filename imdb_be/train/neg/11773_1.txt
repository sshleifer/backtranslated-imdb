I came up with several years of hiding on these boards because of the obvious lack of intelligence that communicates through surveys that periodically appear on IMDb space of the film. I saw this film gently New York Film Festival subway in Asian movie (which is otherwise a great selection of films this year, see hovering snake June CHA NO AJI, Survive Style) and regret it every day, that scene from the movie disengorges themselves from the back of my mind, and becomes bright memory. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you can read a nice review of the film off the underground movie, so I think I made a mistake to drag my friend to the film. Description built kind of a horror movie, I longed for some time, one that relies on the sheer terror and panic are not cheap. P was actually another. It relied on cheap laughs. <br /> <br /> incredibly annoying announcer described the film as "Lesbians team to fight monsters." It's not true. There podagovor built in this film to make it seem like the relationship between a girl and Pookie is really going somewhere. More lies. This film seems like a short made for "You're afraid of the dark?" The story is ridiculous, and only failed to cause confusion and laughter from the audience after they finally canceled his attempt to watch this film with any semblance of seriousness and try to forget $ 9, they are wasted on the door. I almost want to Sperrier Paul was in the audience, so that I could laugh at him and ask him why he spent 5 years in Thailand to make a bad erotic horror-cum-porn-owned spice channel, which only managed to get actress separated from her family and caused a small sensation at the festival Belgium film. Just stir it caused was bubbling in the lower part of the intestine, because it can not get yourself to w * ter what it is. Anyway, I hope to be able to dissaude any of making a serious mistake to see this movie, it really was one of my top 3 worst events of the film, knocking Soul Plane for the number 2.
