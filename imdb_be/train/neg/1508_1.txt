I saw this movie last night (about 102 minutes) and do not know what kept me in the chair. I think I was just waiting for a movie with Gere will have some value in it in the end, but nothing of value did not come out on the screen. History silly excuse to pounce on shot after shot of slavery and torture. There is no character in the film, which makes anything like real life. Cutter "style" is based on the reduction of the jump, mini retrospective and overlays to give the weight of the fresh plant gang of sadists obviously works for free for many years and surprise leader is a "victim" punish the killers. I do not see how Gere, a Buddhist, got involved in these violent, sexist trash.
