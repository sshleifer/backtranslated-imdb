A childless couple (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) go to the doctor (James Karen), to try to get pregnant. It works, but Adams is slowly becoming known that there is something seriously wrong with the baby ... <br /> <br /> Quite an interesting idea carefully done for a lousy script - the basic idea right, but becomes surprisingly predictable in the direction until the end. I've seen every "turn" comes. Direction poor - he seems to have no idea about how to remove the main stage. Production values ​​are - to be a good - lousy. Too bad. And gore scene is too unpleasant (I almost expelled him when the pregnant woman started stabbing himself in the stomach) with lousy special effects. The film completely breaks at the end, when it becomes very clear that they did not have any idea about how to finish this film. <br /> <br /> Some good action make it more moderate. Adams, Hayenga and Karen are all well their role and made me watch, but that was about it. This film was barely released in 1991 and still remains unknown - it is easy to see why. I give it a 4.
