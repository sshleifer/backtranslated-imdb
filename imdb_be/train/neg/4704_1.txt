Very bad attempt at a young lumbar puncture. At least, the music in the spinal tap was good. <br /> <br /> This is a really sad case of Hollywood nepotism in the worst. A bunch of Hollywood Execs, bad musicians and producers create some «poopie» show, so that their children can be the center of attention. Oh please !!! Potty humor was even bad. I hate this stuff, if there really is incredibly talented children (musicians, actors and artists) there is too much of their examples, to be a success and that shit comes. <br /> <br /> Help you all !!!! Why it was not Gene Simmons in it ??? Ameriac taste in entertainment going down the toilet.
