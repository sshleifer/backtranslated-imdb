While the 2001 film, the direction is a kind of art-house style of the 90s, which was considered "old" and outdated a few years ago. Cheese cuts and effects are painful to watch. The scenario is quite decent, and a few scenes, pretended to fascinate me (for example, if the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). But the detective storyline that sister committed suicide, and he was obsessed with suicide was just awful. Speech of the actor, who plays a married boyfriend Selma Blair seriously bothers me. I sat through the whole thing, but that is rare for the species at random what-is-this is a film that you simply find on TV and decided to see.
