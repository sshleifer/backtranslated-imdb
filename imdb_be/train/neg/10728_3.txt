Worst film I've seen in quite a while. Interesting first half with some attractive, concise dialogue between the dubious characters in the night bar. The film then degenerates into a formless sequence of scenes for the purpose of visual shock (read disgust) without any redeeming human observations or lessons, or anything else. <br /> <br /> I wanted to go out, but the director was present at this figure and my politeness prevented me to show him disrespect. However, time is precious (like the director himself said in his intro), and I really envy the time I spent in the second half of this one. <br /> <br /> Saving Graces were three main characters in the first half of the film, especially the female lead.
