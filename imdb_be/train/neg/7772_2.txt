This is one unpretentious film. It has no real plot. We've never done involved in motivation, in addition to wealth. Symbols are one of the worst actors ever put on film. The threat seems weird, but then it is under the control of the three seniors. Why do they do what they do; in order to strike fear into the other team members? I do not know. There is some fog from a fog machine, which rolls around in the halls, and all seem to be scared of it. There is something to do? I do not know. There's some nudity for the sake of it. I am always surprised to see it in the movies is old. Things really settled in this regard these days. Anyway, people are running around like chickens ready for the ax. They have no plan; no resources; nothing. There are about five foolish culminating in the film. Who are these people, and "it" is a ghost or a demon. What happened to the others? I challenge anyone to tell me this with certainty. That mess.
