This is one very miserable production. The general opinion has always been that while the Princess Margaret may have been spoiled and pampered and may rejoice in the abundance of luxury at its disposal, it was a very beautiful young woman. It was the weakest point in the production, the actress could not get across. In addition, it was found that the production budget can not stretch to the barber shop - from the outset, the hair on the character of Princess Margaret had a permanent bird's nest in a mess look and looked as if it had been dragged along often. The actor played the Duke of Edinburgh, seemed prepared for her role by watching Rory Bremner emulate Prince Charles and has been a farce. <br /> <br /> production was the lack of driving, cliche ridden, awkward load of garbage. I think that all the Daily Mail readers deserve a free copy of the DVD-Christmas!
