I have nothing against religious films. Religious people have something to watch on a Saturday night, I think. But what really ticks me off when it is impossible to record on DVD box does not indicate this fact the potential viewer. Passing by religious propaganda as entertainment is not cool, bro. <br /> <br /> And even if I were a religious man, I'd have to agree with most of the other posters here, this film was a mess. Poorly directed, acted badly, poorly edited, and an attempt was cheerful soundtrack. Fake accents were terrible, the characters were mostly stereotypes, and continuity was out the window. The only reason we sat through this lame waste of time was that it was too late to watch another movie instead. If only I went to bed. HN <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no redeeming quality this film if you have not the religious type, which will immediately approve anything that will preach their beliefs of unbelievers, even if it is a bunch of garbage, If not, avoid it at all costs. Do not be deceived box reviews.
