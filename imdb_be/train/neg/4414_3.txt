Christopher Durango had taught unforgettably horrible nun, because he just can not let go of the concept. The play "Sister Mary Ignatius says It All For YouÂ», was presented - at least in Hollywood - in exactly the same tone as the lecture scene Diane Keaton here. Sister Mary was an exaggeration, satire, bitter satire serenely confident doctrinaire and very deliberate nun - and how to play Lynn Redgrave, it was fun. But the film insists that we take it completely seriously exaggerated - while, as noted above, keeping the same tone, "explains everything" stage. These two approaches clash with the head and in the last twenty minutes, the film goes off the track plunges into ravine, and explode. There is not among the dead. It could work if the tone of the scene with four former students, and their meeting with her sister, Mary, had pitched the same as the scenes of Sister Mary. Or, if the scene's sister Mary was represented more realistically. Thus, simply does not work.
