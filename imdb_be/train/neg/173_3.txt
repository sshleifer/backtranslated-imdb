Decent sequel, but not the original strike package. Slaughter writer (Judd Nelson) takes a new identity in order to direct his new cabin lake. Nevertheless, the merciless killing, but the film seems very disingenuous. Any kind of humor is not funny. The joint project, it seems, substandard quality and the time of Nelson on top of the path. This film is about the script is rewritten before going on the screen ... it was bound to happen with this scenario.
