Proceedings, especially in the era of computers, multifunction copiers, e-mail, voice mail, regular mail and `Temps» is an area ripe with satirical features, Vienna earlier knocked on films like `Clockwatchers' and` Office Space», and very successful. This latest addition to the TEMP / humor basin, however, `Haiku Tunnel», director Josh Kornbluta kornblutom and Jacob, can not live up to its predecessors, and leaves laugh somewhere behind the door, waiting for a chance to get in. unfortunately for the spectators that chance never comes; so what you get is a good attempt, but as a man once said, no cigar. <br /> <br /> As the narrator / star of the film, Josh Kornblut (played by Josh Kornblut), does not indicate the frame opening (in the monologue directly into the camera), this story is pure fiction, and takes place in the fictional town of San ` Franc'l'isco. It is an innovative, if not very imaginatively presented a disclaimer, but not all that funny. It is, however, a harbinger of what is to follow, all which-- how disclaimer-- just not all that funny. <br /> <br /> Kornbluth plays Kornbluth, an aspiring novelist who supported himself working as a 'temp. It's a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on a novel from time to time. But when he goes to work lawyer, Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), he makes a very good job on the first day, and Shelby sends a head secretary Marlina D'Amore (Helen Shumaker) for Kornbluth, to convince him to 'perm'. The idea of ​​working full-time in the same company, although, initially strikes fear in the heart of Kornbluth, but it bends and signs for the position. He was nervous, but at least for now, the other secretaries to recognize his presence (which, of course, they would never do with the tempo), and if things get too rough, he was seventeen important letters he typed up--, now just They must be sent by mail out-- fall back (he held them back, because distribution is the easy part, and he needs that `something easy to do" in reserve, in case it all gets too much for him), `This is important," the letter, however, until the end of the week, Kornbluth still have them in reserve for me on the table. And you need not be a genius to understand that if Shelby finds out about this, Kornbluth days as a blond boy will be more. And quickly. <br /> <br /> Brothers Kornbluth, which aim not only, but with John Bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film, had to take a page from the Ben Stiller comedy book, where he says: 'If you play right, they will laugh. But they did not, and the audience will not. Because in comedy, even looking at it as objectively as possible, when the main character (like most of the supporting characters, in this case) is playing `funny-- as on` knows that he is a funny- - it will never happen. And that's exactly what makes here Kornbluth; so that instead of being 'ridiculous', he comes across as insincere and pretentious, serious error in judgment of the Kornbluths, because by permitting, they sabotaged their own movie. <br /> <br /> Trying to see why this film does not work, it boils down to two main reasons: uncut, which-- if not necessarily 'bad' - is at least inadvertently; and secondly, performances starting with Josh Kornblut scale. Simply put, Kornbluth just seems to be too impressed with yourself, to be effective here. Unlike Stiller, or even Steve Martin-- both of which use self-deprecating humor is very effectively-- Kornbluth apparently has ego that simply will not allow to put himself in this world, he seems to have a need s to his audience know that he is a true Kornbluth, it is actually much smarter than Kornbluth character. And not being able to pass on, which makes it, as well as the film. Instead give millions of office workers who can see this film someone to whom they can relate and with whom they can identify, Kornbluth affects condescending, which only serves to alienate the people he is trying to achieve. So it all boils down to is a case of bad direction and inconclusive action, and if we take into account that the script itself was slabli to start with, with the inexplicable narrow focus (considering the potential of the rich subject matter), it is easy to understand why this one just does not fly. <br /> <br /> One rescue the grace of the film is the performance of Warren Kate like Shelby, whose subtle persuasive delivery, and which-- itself - it's pretty funny. The effectiveness of this decrease, however, as Keith had to share his stage with Kornbluth, that few will nullify their positive contribution to the project. <br /> <br /> Shumaker Overman and Sarah (Julie Faustino) also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective views that flattering, if not memorable; they, at least, make them watchable scene Overman and even manages to improve productivity Kornbluth, even for a moment. But it's still not enough to save the day, or a movie. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Amy Resnick (Mindy), Brian Torstensson (Clifford), June Lomena (DaVonne), Joe Bellan (Jimmy mail clerk), with the appearance of cameo in looking disheveled Harry Shearer, as orientation Leader-- role that begs for an answer to the question, 'what does he think when he agreed to it? In any work environment, there will always be situations that arise that one way or another, will inevitably become food for someone's comic pieces, and films that show the situation said, will always be with us; good (see point one) could even become a classic in its own right. `Haiku Tunnel", however, will remain in disbelief for a long time among them, because it is the fate of elsewhere-- in an area known only as:. `Confusion I appreciate this one 1/10 <br /> <br /> <. br /> <br />
