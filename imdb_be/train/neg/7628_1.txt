Black-and-white film. Good photo. Believable characters. <br /> <br /> Just awful. <br /> <br /> I spent one perfect night to watch a movie, and the other is evaluated as "worthy" and "very good". There are a few good performances here and rear system for a plot of land well (more should be done with it), but it is very slow growing and ever evolving. It relies entirely on the floor without any romance with a big UN required nudity. More could be done with the main characters. If you are looking for something to watch with your family, this is not a movie, and if you do not have a problem sitting through it. Although this film for a long time its only about 1 inch deep!
