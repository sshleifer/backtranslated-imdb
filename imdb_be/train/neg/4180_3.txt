I chose this film, to replace the grim choice of daytime TV and go with my thirst for Fatal Beauty. Well, the previous, it is better than daytime television .... although I do not know how much. <br /> <br /> It has its moments, but after a work out and comes on the first 20-30 minutes, well point to the conclusion that they are looking for a TV movie that has been put together with not much time to do something that will keep together. In short, the worst type of Sci Fi Channel movie. <br /> <br /> It has its moments, such as the future of polluted as "Blade Runner," showed ..... of course, is not a "Blade Runner". Captain looks like feels like the actor Robert Forster, the kind of person one would want to be around. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, it soon ends up feeling like a bad "Andromeda" rehash where muscle crew consists of poor copies of smart artillery "Strangers", a mystic vampire Willow sexually activated, and a new master may also be a Jan-Michael Vincent bustle on "Danger island" in the "banana split"; he only put on his uniform with epaulets; it has very little rights to it. All of them run one version of the strength of the lance inside the ship, which looks very similar to the "Eureka Maru", as they are fighting a class of "people", which occupy the world, and are divided into several different tribes or sects of various evolutionary quality ....... as well as Nietzcheans in "Andromeda". <br /> <br /> This may be softening with Michael Ironside, but after a while, one gets the feeling that he attended as a whistle! Perhaps he had the pleasure of doing it, but it does not help the film a lot. <br /> <br /> It ..... "good." Okay, so that one could look at the DVD one time without turning it off; if they watch it with advertising, they are likely to change the channel. One would look once .......... but after a few hours, will be wondering what it was that made them watch it all. <br /> <br /> It was fatal for me. ............ when she struggled.
