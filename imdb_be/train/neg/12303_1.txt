This movie is so bad it's good - in unintentionally amusing way. I could not stop looking, I was laughing so much! It's like a parody of the romantic thriller, except that this is not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexander Paul plays Emily Wendell, oppressed wife of a preacher who falls hard for Luke (Corey Sevier), a hard worker and a mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison; only Sevier is guilty, though, it's a bad game! Keep in mind that it is not worse than the other actors. You get the feeling that the actors do not * no * idea they are actually a terrible film; they play it straight. Everything about the film is bad: acting, script, love scenes, Shagan, plot twists, the choice of music. The climatic scene just ridiculous - the first skirmish in the church, the last words of Luke to Emily - I howled with laughter. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Luke did a lot of weights and ab crunches in prison, and we will see many of his naked torso. This is probably the highlight of the film.
