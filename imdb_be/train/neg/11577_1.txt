The director tries to be Quentin Tarantino, the writers are trying to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger is trying to be Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker is trying to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore is trying to be Faye Dunaway (old version), Cameron Diaz is trying get out of the frame as fast as it can (hopefully) do not ask about Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader trying to hide his embarrassment, with this crappy thing. It provides an endless, meaningless dialogue and very little action. <br /> <br /> Tulsa city with beautiful elevator lobbies, art deco church Bruce Goff and beautiful, sprawling Frank Lloyd Wright house. Visit Tulsa, do not watch this movie. He does not do the location justice.
