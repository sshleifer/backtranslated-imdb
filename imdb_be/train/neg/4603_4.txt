I was p *** ed, when I could not see this one when it was screened at the Philly Film Fest last year, so when I saw that he had to be on cable today, I put it on to remind as soon as I could. So was it worth the wait? Well, let's go back a little, I still give you the plot. Sean Crowley young man who does not know that his path in life. Enter the Duke (George Wendt), who introduces him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night, Ray asks Sean is completely clogged from a guy who they had Sean the next round. And it goes from there. This leads me to the question posed. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no, the buildup was pretty good, and George Wendt stole the movie for me. He just took the ball and ran with it. But this is not nearly as violent as I was led to believe and work somewhere while the ball is not only down to the cinema, but felt and accepted in the other direction. I know where this point is really happened, but I can not say without spoiling the film. But needless to say, it happened. The ending of the film does not save anything. Poor Stuart Gordon nothing can be good, as the "Re-animator" or "Castle FreakÂ» <br /> <br /> My Rank: C. <br /> <br /> Where have I seen: Showtime Extreme <br / > <br /> eye Candy: Kari Wuhrer shows her then-TASS in a fantasy, and then into the next ta-Tass and pans down and ...
