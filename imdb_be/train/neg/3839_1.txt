Some movies are so bad they're good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story, this film was about how true to history as a chance to become a real boy Pinocchio. The acting was terrible, the direction was poor, and he was traveling too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to get it and do with and go home. <br /> <br /> Neither Melissa Joan Hart never strikes me as a talented actress, but every movie that she made was rather low budget anyway. Like most of his films, it lowers their characters, their grimace too much, talk too fast, like speeding up its words are going to make it more dramatic. It really makes sense that there is a team in front of her, and she talks to the camera when it has to be involved in her character the viewer. It's pretty much lets down the whole film, and any leg, that he may have left to stand, spoiled. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only good thing about the film, when she got nailed in the end. But even this did not satisfy enough to conquer my aversion to such a bad film. <br /> <br /> See if your taste in film is softer than a piece of dry toast.
