This film is flawed on many fronts. Like many before him, he reflects a mythology Alam than history. Production of a poor overall welfare of the project creates the impression for many actors who would otherwise have had to work on Hollywood Squares. It was the biggest drawback for me - I know that the age and general real heroes of the Alamo and geriatric individuals ensemble television actors chosen to reflect their never let any hint of plausibility to invade <br /> <br /> As a native. Texan, I grew up with the mythology. Later, I learned more about the history. I can take a decent production from any point of view (although I prefer the more historical authenticity), but it never gave me a chance to enjoy it. Even John Wayne or Fess Parker's version was more to life than this phlegmatic disorder, and only slightly less accurate <br /> <br /> It is very disappointing. - avoid.
