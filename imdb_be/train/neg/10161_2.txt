I really did not expect much from this film, seeing as it is the people of Parkersburg WV, who was I who live, acting in it. This city is dull and so this film. There were a few decent scened in the movie, but I was distracted by all the bad sites that they have made a point to show. This film can be good if it was actually operating it, but there was not. If you are not from Parkersburg and are interested in what you see every day, then stay away from this movie. The dialogue will put you to sleep, the action will bore you to tears and Steven Soderbergh have to lose some confidence after taking shit like this. Its predictable film without any surprises. What you see is what you get, and this 73-minute tour of the Parkersburg West Virginia and Ohio Belpre without a narrator.
