In reviewing this film, I can go only my experience as a weekend warrior makes my basic training in July, August and September 1971 in the garden of the land, Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take the High Ground nothing, as I recall, the basic training. <br /> <br /> But remember, at that time it was after Korea, which ended in a deadlock, but it was a conventional war, as we know them. It was not a Vietnam jungle guerrilla warfare, where we continued to pour into the endless conscript him. The project at the time was an unwelcome, but accepted as still necessary for protection. <br /> <br /> country Widmark veteran of Korea is currently assigned to the state, to train troops to go abroad. The film is about one of their training cycles and a platoon of men he had trained. They are usually the type you find in almost any war film from the previous decade. <br /> <br /> One thing I will praise take the high ground of the fact that MGM has recognized our army is now integrated into one of the dangers of the presence of William as a black inductee in the platoon. It is in accordance with the spirit of the times, which were changeable. <br /> <br /> But I will say that the recruit as Tamblyn could cure his smart mouth from the first day. Widmark would risk death or become a eunuch, to give Jerome Courtland trust with weapons. And no, he worried so much about Robert Arthur desertion. He had just allowed the deputies to deal with it. <br /> <br /> Of course, shooting in and around Fort Bliss and El Paso, Texas did give uplands Take a good authenticity. But to consider it as an army recruiting film, and you can certainly understand why the government is so willing to give cooperation back on the same day. <br /> <br /> I remember the sergeant, who have their little conflicts that you might pick if you were not worried about them getting on your case that was 95% of the time. But there is no way in which Karl Malden would hit WIDMARK to open during a training session in the presence of several witnesses among recruits. And I have realized that would undermine the authority of, the military simply does not allow to happen. <br /> <br /> I wish I could say something better about Take The High Ground, because I, of course, as well as its talented actors, this talented director Richard Brooks, even a stupid topic Dmitry Tiomkin and Ned Washington fresh from their Oscar the year before high noon. The film is actually received an Oscar nomination for best screenplay and story Millard Kaufman. It must be for brilliant presentation Kaufman.
