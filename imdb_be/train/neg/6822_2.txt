Drones, ethnic drums, synthesizer bad edge, the children sing. Most patronizing "world music", you can imagine. This is a tourist film, and a lousy one. What really kills this incoherent sequence. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc., etc. A lot of transitions, there is no visual explanation of why we suddenly ten thousand miles, no ideas do not appear in the images. Just a bunch of footage of third worlders with "baskets on their heads," as another reviewer said. Walk on endlessly, as if it were some kind of deeper meaning. If these guys wanted to do a third world music videos, all they had to do, head a few hundred miles south of where were taken the best part of the rest, and the movie in Mexico. It would be much better setting for "life in transformation". <br /> <br /> But no. What they decided was scrambled tourist route covers half the globe and mind deadeningly overcranked filter arrows. The only thing to recommend this film is that it does not suck quite as well as naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> RstJ
