I went to see this with great anticipation. Quite unfortunately, the dialogue is completely stupid and the film as a whole is far from inspiring awe or interest. Even a child can see the lack of logic in the behavior of the character. Today's children need creative stories that will inspire them, which would make their "dreams" of the events. This is exactly what happened with movies like ET and Star Wars a decade ago. (How many children have imagined of becoming a Jedi Knight and igniting their swords?) Seriously, do not waste your time & money on this.
