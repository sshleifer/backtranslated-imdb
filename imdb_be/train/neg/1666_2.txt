can any film becomes more naive than that? you can not believe, part of this scenario. and ssooooo predictable that you can tell the story and the ending of the first 10 minutes. leading actress, it seems that she wants to be a Barbie (but it does not make it, the doll has more acting). <br /> <br /> ease that the character goes and stays in aa music school makes Phantom Opera novel, it seems as a historical biography. I will not even comment on the superficiality of the characters, but one good thing from the film performance Madsen, who was able to give life to Melo, as the one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> the movie is so bad that it sticks to the teeth. I think about 13-year-old Britney obsessed girls screaming, "Oh, do not give us a break! If we want to always have a book tales of the Brothers Grimm is hidden somewhere in the attic. " I gave it a 2 instead of one only Virginia Madsen.
