(Possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> Someone once asked Dr. Seuss, if they can provide the right adaptation of his 1957 Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas. He turned them down, insisting that no one could do better than a wonderful Chuck Jones TV Special 1966 (also in mind, perhaps it was a bitter experience of writing a script to 1953's 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T). If the good doctor died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still stubbornly refused to sell the film rights. But with the ordinary use of CGI effects, is becoming a reality, Mrs. Geisel was a change of heart. Universal made her generous offer she accepted; she also took the casting Jim Carrey in the title role. It is believed that she was satisfied with the end result. Well, Mrs. Geisel, that makes one of us. <br /> <br /> The film was given a budget of $ 123 million (which is even more than the cost of Heaven's Gate, including adjusted for inflation), which obviously went to a very complicated makeup, set design and special effects (which undermine <br /> <br /> somewhat vaguely cinema). Unfortunately, it seems that none of this money has been set aside to get a better scenario than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Sima (Scribes Who Framed Roger Rabbit, who did much better <br /> <br /> use of high budget) has turned into. while the TV special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials, the film tries to fill time of 105 minutes with a lot of background information about the Grinch. It turns out that, as a child, he was the butt of jokes, including a particularly humiliating experience each Christmas at the age of eight years. So it turns out that all of what ails our poor Mr. Grinch directly because of the Whos. The problem seems to be quite a long 105 minutes, too much dead wood clogging up the story. It may not seem so bad, if the Grinch had a little more ... well, Grinchy. Character, Dr. Seuss and Chuck Jones wrote later had animated sly fox, whose slippery attempt to hijack the holiday season were blown up by his sudden change (and the exponential growth) of the heart. Grinch Kerry loud, hyperactive block and, sometimes, a thug who, when he made the holiday `Cheermeister» Thunder Whoville town square in anger <br /> <br /> (I hope decoration tastes as good as it looked). This undermines the attempt to script to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all the Whos down in Whoville so bad (at least, in this interpretation). <br /> <br /> Whoville of Dr. Seuss was a small town inhabited by honest people who know in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. Whoville film is quite noisy and crowded space populated by corrupt, selfish, materialistic ninnies; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism. It's insulting <br /> <br /> hypocritical, because the film industry greatly benefited from American consumerism and how this film helped him with great merchandising <br /> <br /> company. <br /> <br /> in the film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but decisive character in the original. Innocent two-year-old homeless children who went on this parasitic Santa is now older and wiser, constantly questioning the false values ​​of the Whos and try to understand the point of view of the Grinch (it is one of the main scenes of the original is lost, making it seem out of character). It <br /> <br /> it seems the only one who will know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, which makes it a completely different and more annoying character. <br /> <br /> Those who celebrate Christmas early should take a lump of coal in their <br /> <br /> stockings morning of December 25 than copy it, replayed too long, excruciatingly tedious, clumsy, crude attempts to turn the children classic into a feature film. This proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity, <br /> <br /> manipulation and heavy inadequate substitutes charm, wit, sincerity and heart. Users in Universal must kneel collective and thank God, it's really gall $ 123000000 stink bomb has earned $ 260 million domestically, or they would not be here today. In addition, he made Mike Myers Cat in the Hat is possible!
