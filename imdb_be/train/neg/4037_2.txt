I have no idea that the producers were trying to make a shield, but the result speaks for itself :. Shield virtually unwatchable <br /> <br /> Presumably, speaking at the panel More ... <br /> <br /> In fact, the show so badly put together that you can not even really see the performances. For example, cuts editing is far from reaction shots before they had their full impact. <br /> <br /> I do not know that there is an intellectual justification for this, but it deprives the show all the emotional impact. <br /> <br /> I will give one point for Shield ambitions in its subject matter, but it's pretty much all I can give. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see a number of talented artist litter gift for something so odd bad shot.
