I do not really have anything new to add, but I just felt I had to comment on this bag. So: <br /> <br /> brutal. I ran through my collection of MST3K DVD again, and I just watched the house near 10th times. It's really, really hurt, but it was next on the list ... You can see that there is a tiny kernel of the actual movie buried under all the shit that "Hobgoblins," but he just could not get out. Everything about this film is the fourth speed. The history of acting, effects, women in the "scene", and ... Ahh forget. I can see a piece of shit like «The Bloodwaters Dr. Z» (aka «Zaat») again and again and again with almost no ill effects (I like BTW on the facts, it will be on TCM later this month-October 2009) but "Hobgoblins" whole "nother ball game. <br /> <br /> The worst part of all this may be that it is currently about 12 hours after the film was over, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my medication, and yet ersatz "New wave" of dance music, Amy, red shorts and Laraine Newman frolicking in the living room is still running in my head. This torture will last for several days. <br /> <br /> Good luck, is not it?
