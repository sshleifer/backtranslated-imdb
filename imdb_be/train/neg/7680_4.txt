Snow White in my opinion a bad film on the artistic point of view. The plot is largely predictable, the characters stereotypes editing too exaggerated. In any case, the film does not seem a lot of artistic ambition. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think that this is a direct commercial thing. Including the character of the French part of Switzerland (the actor is the leader of the group, he toured with in the film - the group 's called SENS UNIK), seems to aspire to a wider audience. Direct German-Swiss film would not be sold in the French part - and vice versa. What really got on my nerves were the product placement throughout the film. Sometines scene remembered commercials! <br /> <br /> I also believe that the subject of "Young people taking the drug without any other in my life goals" is a widespread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it must be designed with great care. I hope that Samir got enough money with Snow White, for his next film is going to show his true artistic skills.
