- Let me say that I understand that the invasion of the creatures star was supposed to be a parody of '50s sci-fi movies. I realize that none of them should not be taken lightly. The problem I have is that none of them does not work. Parody supposed to be funny, and it's the only one there. Not once during the entire execution time did I so much as crack a smile. In general, I'm just having fun, but I could not find a shard of entertainment anywhere in the invasion of the creatures of the stars <br /> <br /> -. I knew I was in trouble from the start. The two "stars" make their appearance with one of Lamest jokes imaginable screen - water hose they can not control that receives them as wet. These two come off as imitators Bowery Boys. Why would someone want to MIM act and the person with the Bowery boys for me. After a less than glorious beginning, the movie goes on to show the comic chase sequence, Indian dance, vegetable men decoder rings and other various unfunny bit. It's just a waste of time <br /> <br /> -. I bought it on a double feature DVD of Invasion Bee Girls. This film is the Oscar winning material in comparison with the invasion of the stars of the creatures.
