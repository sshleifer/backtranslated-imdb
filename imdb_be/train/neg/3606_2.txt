This movie is the worst film, but it takes very high for me. This is as it should be a slasher film. It takes place at the university, which seems to be only a few students. Master dumber bag hammers. It is filled with a good Catholic priest sexually repressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. Dialogue as a template, it's hard to believe that I was able to predict the string in quotes. In slashings is creativity and seems to revolve around stabbing people in the genitals. The lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve to die, because they are so bad, I would recommend this movie to have fun. Get a case of cheap beer and some friends, watch and laugh.
