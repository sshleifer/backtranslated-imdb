I'm annoyed with modern adaptations of Shakespeare, when the director can not make up your mind to that, to use the original or update it. If he uses the original words in the upgraded environment, it is especially difficult if set in the 20th or 21st century, although it can work normally in the styles of the period, such as Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night set late Victorian is very effective. It can work with the installation of the 30's, when there were just a lot less singing and dancing, and much more Shakespeare's text. Unfortunately, this only ends up being quite trivial, but very enjoyable show. <br /> <br /> Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree that he is too old to play one of the students, but more importantly, he is an experienced Shakespearean actor who, despite all his efforts to be just another student who shows his strength of acting all the time. Of course, he was not supposed to play the King - not a problem in the mature student of the king, surrounded by young students. Instead we had a pleasant but nondescript actor on the king, therefore, the so-called ugly king, sun king attributes. <br /> <br /> The amount of song and dance, which I found tedious, despite the good songs and dances quite nice, unfortunately, is a great Shakespearean dialogue should be cut down sharply. Thus, it all ends with the trivial and soft sweet, and I got very sad, including with comic twists, and was glad when it ended. Wrestle not done Shakespeare justice in this production. <br /> <br /> Richard pochesteya but thistles and Geraldine McEwan, absolutely gorgeous, as the elderly couple.
