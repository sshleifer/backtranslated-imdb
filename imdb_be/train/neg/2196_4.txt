The brain (or head) that would not have died is one of the most thoughtful low-budget exploitation films in the early 1960s. It is very difficult to imagine how the scenario, it's disgusting sexist could have been written without the intention of self-parody. And the topics are expressed repeatedly female role Gina Leith - detached head supported by machines, I-V and clamps - seem to confirm that the film had to be used simultaneously and the critical analysis of gender stereotypes. Shades under-rated boxing Helena. <br /> <br /> genderisms many, and about as annoying as the evil army of ants. Dialogue is hyperbolic, overly dramatic and unbelievable, and the acting is just OK (but adequate). Why I gave this movie 4? Because some thought obviously went into it. I'm really not sure that the point of the film is really trying to do, but it is clear that it is committed to an unusually sharp and raw kind of horror (without the blood and guts of today's viewers are waiting). <br /> <br /> Another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there is really no heroes in this film, and none of the characters are not particularly likeable. <br /> <br /> All considered, it was a painful and anxious look in the early 1960s American pop sexuality from the perspective of women continue to live, in spite of her body disappeared after what was supposed to be fatal car accident. Her lover is threatening to sew on fresh, high quality, body on her and force her to continue to live with him. It is, for obvious reasons, not all of these plussed and forced to make friends being almost as bad as her boyfriend. Oh, there are some vague references to the 1950s / 60s clich√©s about the evils of science run amok. <br /> <br /> It is recommended for B Sci Fi buffs and graduate students in the field of gender studies. O / W is not recommended.
