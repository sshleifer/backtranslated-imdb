In fact, these young men were so uncomfortable that I could not wait until all the Â«Em, to get slaughtered, and that includes Clarissa (Joanna Canton), because I thought she was the most annoying of the bunch. <br /> <br /> But I knew it would be a mess from the opening minutes, when a teenager Christine opened fire on the priest and nuns with Lesley Gore music plays in the background. This was not the way to go but down. <br /> <br /> Even prosthetics looked fake and "blood" suspiciously looked like Hawaiian punch, although later she took on Red Day-Glo look to match silly Halloween makeup they wore. I am sure that all the morons out there Prep will appreciate this Bullsh-t, as it will apply to this bundle. He sure did not appeal to me. Blah ... <br /> <br /> Not even my toddler's favorite horror Barbie can save this stupid teen horror movie by himself. She still looks hot though. I am glad that it takes care of itself, because we do not get to see too much of it at the moment. <br /> <br /> However, it is a step of winding HORROR Dante Tomaselli (2002) in that it has several coherent story, so I'll give him that much. This little Boston Terrier named Boozer also brings it up a notch. I like what makes Boozer to Clarissa in the end. That was the only good scene in the otherwise silly movie. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate Films sure must have been desperate, when they picked this up. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
