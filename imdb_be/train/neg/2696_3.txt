I know what a smart guy John Singleton 'coz he did Boyz N The Hood, as he wrote, and to send it? It's like a bad pilot "go to college for the first time" a teenage soap hits boring stereotypes and clich√©s with some violence and false one, to make him an offer, I think. Who would have guessed a date rape victim is to blame sausage seafood? Angry loner be hunted neo-Nazi group (and be One up with the black and Jewish - Just For Laughs) Even a terrible reaction history Professor Laurence Fishburne just annoyed me and I love the guy, it's like everything associated with this movie just lost the plot. In addition to Busta Rhymes, of course. Large windows.
