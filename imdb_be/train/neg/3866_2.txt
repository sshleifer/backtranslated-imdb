I thought that this film had absolutely no moral. I mean, how would you feel if your fianc√© left you on your wedding day to your cousin ??? I would be heartbroken !! It is classified as a comedy, but I did not find it funny. I thought it was just basically found a cheap laugh, and took them. I usually like Julia Stiles movies, but this is an exception. Jason Lee stars in another shameful show, which once again proves that the class and decent morality is irrelevant in today's society. It was a complete lack of taste, and I despise films like this. I understand that people will defend the film, and the morality because it is "just a movie", but I still stand by my assessment that bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I'm not trying to say that if you liked the movie, you're a bad person, because everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and part of this movie was nice, I'm just saying that in real life people act like the characters in this film have been doing it is shameful.
