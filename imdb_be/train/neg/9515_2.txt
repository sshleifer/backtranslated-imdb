Well, I watched the original French version. But I can not imagine it to be better with subtitles. <br /> <br /> All I have to say that this is the most boring film I've seen in a long time. There are almost no redeeming qualities in this film. That's why I can not understand all the positive reviews. It may be realistic in a sense, but some real stories better left untold. <br /> <br /> I usually like slow paced films as long as it is used for the film. Solaris Tarkovsky extremely slow pace, but it allows introspection and sets the mood of the film, for example. But in this case, the film simply serves meaningless dialogues that manage to tell us a little about the characters. None of which I could identify with or care. In many scenes I found myself thinking: "If they are going to shut up?" The action was very bad. Not replay an obvious kind of way. But it seems none of the actors did not care about their characters, and they all looked like they wanted to be anywhere else in most scenes. This may be due to the uninspired dialogue, they have been given. In addition, the entire flow of the film felt mechanically. The transition from one scene to another. It seems that this film was just written (bad), but never sent. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that I can not say no emotional response generated by any of the scenes. A lot of suspense, no fear, no waiting, no sorrow, no introspection, no intellectual stimulation, no interest what so ever. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what I call the anti-film.
