I happened on this movie on a rainy Tuesday, intending to tune into something else. Out of curiosity, I got access to the comments here, and found that watching it to the end. I really did not do it on purpose - it's one of those movies where you are "charmed" and watch it "even a couple of minutes," until you finally just did not look up to the end and the charge it in most of these comments have made him more. . fun to see one comment where people really liked it, it seems, only by sympathy Ladd and Spano, as well as their earlier role but is no longer anywhere to be found somewhere here -. the history, performance, and especially absurd courtroom jokes. We all know that Perry Mason (Raymond Burr to exceed in the mark of 300 lbs.), and Ben Matlock, given some freedom to jump around the courtroom instead of tedious chained to the lectern. And Metlki especially given the privilege of entering exhibits often simply going to the jury and to show them to the judge and the prosecutor was even in the course of, or indicate them. judge or prosecutor is not real life will not stand for it. <br /> <br /> Both Perry and Ben almost always ended in the case of wringing the recognition of the real killer. In fact, Perry is almost always done it, but often Matlock would just submit compelling evidence of the true culprit, say it "reasonable doubt", and then leave it to the police and prosecutors to open a case against the culprit - sometimes on the camera, occasionally assumed at the end of the show. <br /> <br /> But that said, theatricality Holland Taylor and the amount of discretion given to her in the hall of the court of the story, the action did Matlock / Mason more closely resemble. slowly, often sad details, such as seen on Court TV and in real life courtroom <br /> <br /> Every character in this presentation was either bland, stale, unpleasant, boring, it is unlikely - or some combination of two or more . of them <br /> <br /> ending was the most banal, absurd, even silly conclusion can be - but then again, fascinating because of this. Ladd and sleep are attractive individuals, and TV movies appear their best fort - probably the best in 2-lead (probably better if «3rd-») role, even in this place. Taylor can be cast as an aunt or mother of one of them. Give it a 1 star for stories / plays and 3 additional factor to delight.
