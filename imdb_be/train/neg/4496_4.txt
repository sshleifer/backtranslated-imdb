This film is crawling festival of bad acting and poor scenography, as well as sticky lines and lame plot. But it's so fun to watch. All of it hilarious.The main story is a group of scientists from the future travels back in time to grab their evil counterparts, who intends to destroy them all. They catch up with him in 1146, "futuristic" scientists from the laboratory in 2033 is the number eightieth style with a bunch of "futuristic" flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn shed. The actors deliver their lines with enthusiastic aplomb, it's not hard to understand when you consider that the line is usually earth shakers like "I double-checked everything twice!" He checked everything twice? He checked it four times? Not only that, but they feed you the whole premise of the film in the first five minutes and continue at a rapid rate of fire, until they got into the medieval part. If Roger Corman run out of money. And I had to stop traveling at the time and, consequently, different sets. Medieval set of comics hodgepodge nothing from the late 10th century until the 16th century. Any costume they can find, they have used. I believe that mail entirely on the budget, because the guys all wear sequins shirt under armor views. The fight scene funny, men casually thrown on cardboard swords selflessly and die in the death throws a drop of cast.It blow sounds really horrible, but I enjoy it every time I watch it. One line is enough to have you in fits and everything else is pulling together to create a fabulous B-movie that if you are a connoisseur of sugary movies, I would suggest that you look at. And once you have read the review on unknown films. I love to hear them show all the funny, really horrible bits in the movie.
