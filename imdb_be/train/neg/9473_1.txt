As a veteran of many, many pretentious French films that I thought I'd take the worst the industry had to offer and was able to digest anything. But not this. Meaningless, restless, violent, nasty, pointless ... The film has nothing to offer and random hatred and aggression, dressed as a pretentious art. Avoid at all costs.
