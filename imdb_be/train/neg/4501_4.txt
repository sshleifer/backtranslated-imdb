However, the installation in Paris is great. Actors perfectly. History twisted morality play. It is supposed to say that if you want someone strong enough, it is okay to hurt the rest of the way? In real romance, you seem to want less clich√© than a person who gets bored with his wife and is willing to lose his family, and a woman, which is fine with encouraging him to do so. So if they are decent looking and when Karen Allen shows off her body? Symbols are still self-absorbed and wicked. Perhaps the moral of the story "you get what you deserve." I give it a 4, only to quickly scan through a potential "male interest" bits.
