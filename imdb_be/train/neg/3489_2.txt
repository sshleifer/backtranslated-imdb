It was my first and probably last Angelopoulos film. I really wanted to get into it, because he showed Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors, and the film was Theo, with whom I had heard. Opening promised long shot over the jeep of soldiers across the Albanian-Greek border. GOOD! but that was all. Nothing left. The film was a big hole, and I do not know what to mention first. The main plot of the story is revealed old journalist. during a long walk. It is a 15-minute monologue, killing action and audience patience, nothing is happening on the screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, except for this old woman to tell the story. All that is supposed to be shown through action, simply said to the old chamber. At the time, equippe TV was heading to the bar. They turn a corner and immediately begins the winter! Perhaps taken on different days, the continuity leaked. Many problems with the story, it's gone from absurd irrational never adhering to the style that makes the viewer ask questions that never got answered. Poor Mastroianni, given the role that lacked integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many Greeks and Albanians or Balkan people would agree with, the movie showed a lot of historical, ethnic or politically incorrect, simply for the sake of making a film about "humanity" as red in another review. Much more to say, but do not have time to play on a bad film that was not a movie at all, but lunacies from person applied to the film and paid public money.
