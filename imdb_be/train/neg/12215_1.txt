The fact that I can say was the theft of my time I was taken to see this film, and I must say that terrible experience. Fay Ann Lee horrible actress and unconvincing in this film. Larryjoe76, obviously shill reviewer. The plot is thin, to put it mildly, Canton dialogue is not funny. Watch this movie on your own risk. <br /> <br /> David Tang of Shanghai Tang has to be after the movie for little or no income, this film will generate. Hackneyed plot is trying to compete with other rom-coms out there, and just part of the landscape. It was like watching paint dry. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie was a waste of time and space. I've seen better movies on YouTube.
