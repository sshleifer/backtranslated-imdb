Description: Trite, quite stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and lame, it will make you wonder why these abnormally stupid people even wasted 2 months or so to spend budget (I guess it is ...), probably no more than 700 dollars to do this film. It was just hysterical to watch with or without the Mystery Science Theater. I give you the best advice in the world: <br /> <br /> Free yourself, save time, lives and money by NOT - I repeat, do not even think about whether to watch this movie worth it. This movie is so banal that it will make your face becomes purple from outraged boredom. If you have a single-digit IQ, then be my guest and watch this film absolutely despicable. You could really admire him. (As I said, if you have a single-digit IQ) <br /> <br /> With about 12 actors of your own, a few dolls that you bought on sale, and, of course, the camera and the music, I gaurentee you I do a little more entertaining home movies than this piece of shit absolute.
