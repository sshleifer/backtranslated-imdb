To learn more about the history, I would like to invite readers to read news-related items to the Kargil <br /> <br /> Note :. If one is looking for the history of the formula in this film, you can be sure that it is not. LOC history clean sacrifice, patriotism, courage, and lots and lots of bullets and blood. A cinema where I saw this film was full of whistles and shouts when the film shows Indian Courage. Movie goers seemed like the audience, both in India against Pak match in cricket. <br /> <br /> See the film as a tribute to the sacrifice of the army and for the characteristics of the real-life war heroes (4 PVC honor heroes) who gave their lives so that we can see this day. The film made a brilliant portrayal of the army, who fought all odds in harsh weather conditions. The negatives of the film is that it is too stretched and the songs are very sad.
