It did not take long to understand why the Code Name: Diamond Head do not make it to the network diagrams. TV movie pilot did not pass loans before it is clear how bad it will be. Maybe I missed something, because the plot does not make much sense. Based on the fact that I got out of the tangled mess, a terrorist or a thief, or something called "Tree" (John McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon. sad in the world of a secret agent Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), then to stop it. There may have been more, but believe me ?? it really does not matter anyway. <br /> <br /> The action movie has to act. Tense moments should be unknown. And dramatic moments must have drama. There is nothing of this in the Name Code: Diamond Head. I've seen others use the word "bombastic" to describe this TV snoozer ?? and it's better than any description of one word I can think of. None of the characters are not in the least exciting or worth caring about. And Roy Thinnes makes the worst possible results. His charisma is only slightly north of the slug. Ian McShane is easily the best that the film has going for it, but unfortunately for everyone else, it does not seem to her that he was going to come back as a regular cast member. Now that McShane was cast in the series lead, then you may have been something. <br /> <br /> I quickly discovered that these Gawd awful 70s made for television movies glorify Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes, and that goes doubly when Quinn Martin was involved. Very funny stuff from Mike and Boat. Thus, while I can only give the film to 3/10, I appreciate Episode # 608 4/5 on my rating scale MST3K.
