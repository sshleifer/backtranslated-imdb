I saw written on the wind, starring Rock Hudson, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack & Dorothy Malone- Robert Stack was just bloody terrible- horrible- he was supposed to be a magic stream installation millionaire- instead it came out as a breakthrough from the word care the second plot was silly and excited and 3 "romantic" is there was no chemistry. Once Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for Best actress-, although her mannerisms Tramp character was boring think older sister with Splendor in the Grass, filled with anger and bitterness, and lacks charisma. Director Sirko has all cast overact their way through dialogue, which felt forced, and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes. Had a bit part actor, who played the boss on Get Smart
