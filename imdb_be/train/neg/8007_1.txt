I really, really I did not expect this type of film outside of America. How anyone can take the subject of sexual abuse of children and turn it into a "thriller" just painful. Auteuil (which I had admired) comes around, like some kind of child savings Rambo was ignorant and offensive to all children who are subjected to sexual exploitation worldwide. <br /> <br /> With half depressing that extraordinary and ground dismountable film "Happiness" was released a year before this film. Menges and his henchmen should be ashamed of yourself. It's great to read some of the comments smart audience there. They were able to see the bad and the funny treatment of this topic. Those of you who think that this is a big screen movie disgusting amount of ignorance, and you should see "Happiness" to open your mind to the real horrors of pedophilia. <br /> <br /> Do you think that your child is likely to have been kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or to be clung to a neighbor, a teacher, a friend or relative? Hmm ... interesting. If they are going to make a film on international child slavery of any kind, they must do so for all, to make it realistic and emotionally involving, instead of pushing the button, shit. 1/10
