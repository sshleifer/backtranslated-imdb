The main problem with the «Power» is that it has too may meaningless characters and plots that do not add absolutely nothing to the movies at all. He gets boring after a while, sitting in waiting through the stage, do not connect to find what drives the film forward. You could transfer all of it as character development, but they are either recycled from earlier scenes in the film, or just a flat and uninteresting. Lumet never gives enough time to allow any of the supporting cast of color. He had to cut a few characters (Hackman's wife), and concentrated harder on the other (Billings). This can be a great, hard political thriller instead of a jumbled mess that loses any message in the sea of ​​bad writing and action, a fact that surprised me, considering the cast. Even Gene Hackman performance was not up to par. Denzel Washington is the only real actor of note here. Gere and others all do much better performances elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet must return to a rigid one person shows that he did in the seventies (ie, Serpico) and stop trying to regain his success with "12 Angry Men" and «Fail Safe». He has not worked for Sidney, and it will most likely never will. leave the ensemble drama Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> * / * * * *
