this is the first time I write a comment about the film on IMDb. but I had to write it for that. it in 3 hours from torture. clean from start to get an idea of ​​what the movie is going to be bad. current lamentable. I'm a big fan of Ajay Devgan (loved him in Bhagat Singh), but it is at its worst in this film. Amitabh seems to be working for this, but somehow there is no fear. Prashant Raj is not an actor. and the most annoying part of the film Nisha Kothari. I have no idea why it took the director in this film. background score is repeated. somehow I felt that Rama was trying to repeat Sarkar, color theme, the background score, the camera angle, but it did not work. Please do not look IT
