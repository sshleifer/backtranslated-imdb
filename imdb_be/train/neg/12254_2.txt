Someone may scoff, but it really is an art to creating a particularly bad films. It misses out on all fronts <br /> <br /> A bunch of young people -. Women with heaving breasts and constantly wet T-shirts, of course - go to the movies, "Blood Surf" and eventually work in a 31-foot crocodile. <br /> <br /> Not only crocodile obviously fake, but some of the props [note the boat hitting the reef in particular] look like they came out of the thunder! <br /> <br /> Is not good, from start to finish. I do not see!
