When John Waters wrote and directed "House of 1000 Corpses" after being struck on the head several times with a heavy object, the result is likely to be something like "blood." It is mildly entertaining for the first half hour, but then he slips into his kind of faceless glop constant screaming and people who do things with each other's genitals with electric carving knives, cutlery and tongs. Susan Adriensen (Sno cakes) is incredibly annoying and Terry West (Elvis blocks) almost as bad what he does in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about "shed" is that it will not accept most of the audience for a long time to forget about it.
