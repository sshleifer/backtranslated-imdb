Puzzled melodrama taken from a story by William Gibson, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Widmark heads the elegant, upscale rural nervous shelter where his wife loose Battle with the self-styled queen Lillian Gish, and he gets Widmark eyes roving employee novice Lauren Bacall, who puts his life together after the death of her husband and child. Humorous and confusing, set the time and place of the indiscriminate, and "David and Lisa," a love story, hidden in a plush quagmire. Widmark and Bacall have some good chemistry together, but the script does not give them anything to build on. It was an hour, most of the dialogue concerns what to do with the drapes hanging in the library (this thread is not used as symbols, but this is a maneuver on Sun secrets!). Painting hopes to show knife that a variety of people come to when they are working in the same profession, and everyone thinks that their opinion is correct, but unfortunately detour Minnelli unravels this stew is neither informative, instructive and interesting. ** from ****
