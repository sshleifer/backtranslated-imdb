One of the real clinkers Boris Karloff. In fact dying Karloff (looks about 120 years older than he was), the scientist needs cash to finish his experiments before he dies. Transition from Morocco, where his funding taken by someone he goes to the south of France, where he works as a doctor in the first when trying to scrap enough money to prove their theory. Desperate for money, he makes a deal with the young wife of a rich cotton baron, who is dying. It will finance it when he helps her to poison her husband, so she can take his money and to carry on with a gigolo (which I think is married). If you think I got that from watching the film you're wrong, I had to read what other people have posted to find out occurred. Why? because this movie made me lose two minutes in.I had not the slightest idea of ​​what is going on with its many characters and multiple storylines converge. Few written and much said, until to the end and so far I do not really care. His dull mess of interest purely to perform Karloff is quite strange at times. Honestly, this is the only time I saw him in the company Bela Lugosi amazing territory. It's not every scene, but not enough, and makes me wonder how much they hang out.
