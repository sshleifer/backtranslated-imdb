For the domestic audience, I can see how they will welcome this film. To outsiders, without any self-interest, it does not make much sense. The Germans were portrayed as incompetent and Russian, as heroes. Allegedly romantic angle was unnecessary and entertainment. As a young woman could "love" Lieutenant from just a glance it was nonsense. How could she, as mentioned at the end of the movie, do not marry just because of this passion was beyond me. Did I mention the Germans were portrayed as idiots, and that has been demonstrated in the pursuit of a swamp. Several hundred German troops advanced, pushing the Russian into the swamp. Thus, the Russian escaped the Germans stopped at the edge of the marsh, and just stood there and listened. I believe that they do not want their shoes wet, but I'm sure the officer would order 20 or 30 men in the water to find the swamp. But that would have ended the story. In addition, the Germans entered the barn, where the Russian hid in the attic and did not bother to shoot into the roof. At worst, some soldiers would throw a grenade into the attic and climbed the stairs to look into. <br /> <br /> I see some reviewers who said they were crying at the end. I wonder why? Did you know that this small group will die, and they do not have the heart to pull this.
