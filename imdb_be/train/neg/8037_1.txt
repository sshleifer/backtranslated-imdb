OK, a slasher film. very, very stupid slasher film. <br /> <br /> We've got your stereotypical teenager in the house thing going. We got an FBI agent who saw Dirty Harry one time too many. "So what's the secret .... punks?" We got about 4 different small camera shots and scenes that make no sense. "Hey, man, I repair sprinklers" ((the guy was my favorite part of the movie)) Preacher strapped on the couch to watch movies at home, he dies. <br /> <br /> They follow the killer in the middle of nowhere, with no cops. suddenly it in the church, wearing a wedding dress. I swear, it's stupid slasher film I've ever seen.
