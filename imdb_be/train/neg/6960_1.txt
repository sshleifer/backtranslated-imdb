After watching the first 20mn Blanche (sorry, I could no longer do so), I have now confirmed that it does not. <br /> <br /> In fact, this "film" is an insult to these French actors involved in this comedy piece of trash. It starts from the concept has been used successfully in the French comedies ( "a quarter or two before Christmas», «La Folie de Grandeurs», ...): a historical film with anachronistic tons / dialogues. This can give excellent results, with the support of brilliant actors and "refinement" direction, avoiding the dreaded "serious comedy" stigma. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, horse face Lou Doillon destroys everything and Blanche, instead of comedy, just turns into a horror movie. Horror for moviegoers who want to be embarrassed and shocked, watching great actors such as Decaune, Terr or Rochefort struggling in the middle of this tasteless burlesque kitchy-prim farce.
