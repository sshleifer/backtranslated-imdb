This movie Datoiti, like in the movies «Star Trek» were «Star Trek» - except that in this case every one of the originals was more interesting and fun than the big, brilliant re-do, and did better when substance is more important than the surface if I had not seen them, I would have thought it was beautiful, but empty:. as I was, I thought his style is inappropriate, and its content is not enough idea of ​​the revival of the character in. larger, slicker production should sound good, but there was no point in it, but hope to make money; it etc. a hundred shows, which mostly are not able to convey the atmosphere of the world of the character and fully assumes the character of any place he was (also, the actor was not at his best) is not. I was hoping to see Ichi at a later stage of life, history, which will see him gracefully and to draw some conclusions from the experience as a whole; it is simply paraphrasing bits and pieces from other films, filled with lots of sex and violence SFX is not the same experience at all..
