The plot of "House of Games" is the most powerful thing about it: a successful author and psychologist inflated gang Grifters, but in revealing the evil part of me that loves the thrill of what they do, she finally gets her revenge, it's about the field but someone has to take responsibility for it across as time operated puppets. It must be a director Mamet: Lindsay Crouse was varied and fairly steady TV and movie career, so that it can not perform that bad all the time. It must come from the troubled, cool, controlled by professional calculation, godless fast lady happy, as shown in the change from beige suit (which she seems to be worn for three consecutive days, including underwear) in the floppy floral sundress. But everything seems to be saying the same line of their crop, the right way; I believe, Mamet wanting to make sure no part of his scintillating script was released. The effect of disturbing and spoiling the atmosphere of mystery and suspense allegedly trying to create. In "House of Games" times he loses all touch with how human beings actually behave or speak, and becomes a mechanism to stretch the plot. Vibes'n'oboe clumsy pseudo-jazz soundtrack does not help. The end result is that the only entertainment to be had in guessing the outcome, and the sooner you do, the sooner you get bored with robots, two-dimensional representation. And they smoke too much !!!
