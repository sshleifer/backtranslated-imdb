Average audience looking for any sense of internal consistency in the film should probably give it a pass. It generates the same feeling as looking at a curious array of individual images, which seem to have anything to do with one another, but never merged into a whole. <br /> <br /> While the isolative approach to creating a kind of cinematic editing can turn to several students, or critic, immersed in the internal language of modern filmmaking is strongly irritating and condescending us commoners who just fell off haywagon. Open avoid availability may be a deliberate feature film directors like Wong Kar-wai and Tarantino, but it comes across as Andy Warhol warmed over. Only redeeming feature I find the value of production, and they are simply not going to cut it all themselfs. <br /> <br /> This is one of those plays in which you look and listen, and look forward to in vain some clever design ideas or thoughts to withstand all the wonderful and beautiful individual scenes. Sorry. Calligraphic loans suddenly begin to roll as well as your interest begins to stir. I get the same great yawn and let down to read what I think, is very experienced and careful comments about this movie that never leads to anything really clear. Ideas and images without any external context is not my idea of ​​fun. <br /> <br /> Call me a philistine moved through the streets of Hong Kong looking for a bowl of chop suey. <br /> <br />
