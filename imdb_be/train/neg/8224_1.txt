Watching this film? I thought to myself, what a lot of rubbish. These girls must have rocks for brains for even agreeing to be a part of this. A waste of time, watching his pale sky l just hired him. Action was below standard and the story was unbearable. Anyone contemplating to watch this movie, please, save your money. The film has no credit at all. l I have a real positive effect of the film, and it's worse than "Attack of green tomatoes." <br /> <br /> l can only hope that this stuff is not worth too much to do. The money would be better spent on the homeless people of the world. l only hope it is not a sequel in the pipeline.
