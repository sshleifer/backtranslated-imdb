my wife is a fanatic with regard to this show. In this case, I bought it seasons one through three and four seasons on request. I personally think that the show is one big farce cast is equally bad. Alyssa Milano has to stick to the other trash films that she made, such as Poison Ivy, Vampiric Embrace, to name a few, the other actors supporting women equally incompetent in his drawings. I saw the best effects in the old TV series Republic Pictures, which I saw as a child. I can understand why men lead remained on the show for such short periods of time, even if I do not know if it was their own choice or not. Please. Please do not continue for another season quite as sufficiently Bob
