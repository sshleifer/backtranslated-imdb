As I write this review in 2008, we are mired in a remake of culture. Film studios seem to have decided to destroy as many classic films as they can to thoroughly meaningless updates, including "King Kong," The Wicker Man "and almost every movie that ever starred Michael Caine. This is a remake of a lazy mentality is not a new phenomenon, but as a "test for Do-Do» shows. It is pointless painted version of Bob Clampett surrealist masterpiece "in whipping Wackyland», «The dough for the Do-Do» sucks the life out of the original splashing color all over the original footage Clampett and adding some new footage lame oversight frieze Freleng. Freleng was totally unsuitable to be the director of the falsification of the source material Clampett, although in fact no director could not hope to approach the inspired madness in Clampett. Inevitably, then, "Dough for Do-Do» it is nothing more than a classic rape with a terrible new name attached. For the cartoon lovers, like myself, equivalent coloring "Casablanca".
