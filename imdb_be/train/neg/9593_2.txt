Judging by some comments in IMDB, I expected Action -. Could dramatic one or stupid or just one or comicy one, but in fact the gunman <br /> <br /> Whatever I watched it, of course, I did not feel like a movie. The story is simple and understandable (even though, the prologue is trying to make it seem complicated). Take the three interest groups: 1). Government 2) Rebels 3) a group of killers <br /> <br /> Now, we subtract first (they never appear in the film). Then just let one of the killers, the princess, are marginalized on the travel destination. Add to rebel love interest with a bad conscience. And you have the ingredients. <br /> <br /> But they still have not managed to turn it into a story or a movie. Between some random sequences of action and some odd visual tries to be a Sci-Fi on a low budget, what you're left with a feeling of emptiness. The film just does not feel like a movie, but surprisingly awkward, sad dream. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10
