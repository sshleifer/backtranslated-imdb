I'm really looking forward to seeing this film, but after watching I was very disappointed. The best bit was when Stephen King was in it. Robert John Burke can not act to save his life and can not any of the others. Some of the performances even made me laugh out loud! The film was not as I imagined, after reading the book, which was strange, I imagined it darker and scarier. When I was Steven, I'd have gone mad! <br /> <br /> I do not know why they changed the ending, I thought that the end of the book was very good. If you have just learned cake kill your daughter, you would not feed it to someone else, you would be? <br /> <br /> The book was much better!
