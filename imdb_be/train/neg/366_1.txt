Bad actors, bad filming, choppy dialogue, shallow characters, but again it was a bad assumption in the first place. Basically, the 11-year-old, who bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check to a stupid criminal. Of course, 11 years is enough to have technology and intelligence to buy a house, cash a check for one million dollars, and even upset the three bumbling idiot, reminiscent of the three stooges. <br /> <br /> Preston Blake annoying reverse, the boy who decides that, if written blanche to a totally unfamiliar, he would use the situation as best as he can. In other words, he goes to the bank, <br /> <br /> Hand Teller checks he makes in his printer, and miraculously comes out with a million dollars in cash. Preston also apparently capable of reaching the incredible speed on the bike, because the person at the wheel Jaguar after Preston and could not catch his 10-speed, even if the number of cars jumped Preston. <br /> <br /> Of course, with each adventure hockey, should be hot heroine. In this case, our hot heroine of child molesting FBI agent who dates the eleven-year-old Preston, and promises another date when he turns 17. <br /> <br /> However, the absolute worst aspect of this film was not his casting, nor his sloppy dialogue, such as "the only way I could think of skin a cat, to insert the hose up this example, and then pick up the bag." it was, rather, the whole of the fact that no one in the movie, did not seem to understand FBI entirely random people give a damn about. what I can not explain, that uses pseudo Preston Anime «Macintosh» masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts. Of course, the FBI believes that this intriguing and sends our young heroine after Preston, who uses his 11 years of wit to the first cry when lobsters fall on his face, and then treat her burgers, ending with a funny romp through the cement area, where the water is to get off the ground. Our heroine does not understand in this whole adventure that the FBI criminal worked through slipping and right behind them as they make their way to the limousine Preston, complete with 1-dimensional driver that will never be able to provide low-cost, third speed laughs, the whole family can choke <br /> <br /> generally :. 1/10 incredibly expensive for this film. I do not see how it only has 4.4 / tenth
