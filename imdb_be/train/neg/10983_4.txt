If this play was first shown on the BBC for more than 30 years ago, it would be something completely different for the time. So for this, some people would find it quite scary, and may also have been impressed by the special effects? <br /> <br /> Looking at the game in this day and age, it does not seem all that scared more, even the special effects can leave much to be desired. <br /> <br /> Whether the train is indeed allowed to pass a red light in the dark tunnel? I do not think so ...... but if you watch this game again, you will observe that the first train, which is part of the tunnel, heading straight through the red light! (Maybe that's how it was in the time of Dickens)? <br /> <br /> You will also notice that the path that leads down to the signal box is very steep and in poor condition. Of course, it would be the correct number of steps with a handrail for the signaller to climb up or down the stalk. (I can not help but notice that things like) <br /> <br /> I did not take the action as Denholm Elliott (communicator) and Bernard Lloyd (traveler) gave excellent performances. <, Br /> <br /> I'm not sure what's going on ...... I mean was a ghost traveler, or what ??? Does anyone really fully understand it's pretty complicated story ??? (Well, maybe I'm the only one that does not do) ??? <br /> <br /> In summary ..... <br /> <br /> The game has a great atmosphere throughout, with great character. She suffers from not that scary these days, and little, if not confusing in places and has some rather unusual methods of alarm .... <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading my review.
