Predictability, beaten and badly written. Silly I thought such a prominent cast will not participate if it does not deserve attention. I believe that competition among the actors is so intense these days (and will only get worse) that one can not choose much more. Earlier, we got a hint that played a big role in the murder, and we had it rammed down our throats so far. The film lacks the intrigue, giving us a little insight into the victim, and only one possible motive for murder. Some of the discourse, frankly, embarrassing! It is hard to believe that anyone would even think, let alone commit, spending tens of millions of dollars to do this scar.
