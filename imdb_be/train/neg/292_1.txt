I saw it accidentally showing on cable wanted to like it, as I thought that Sandra was quite funny from what I remembered. The only person I had movement throughout the film was jaw dropping stunned by how awful a movie I just suffered. <br /> <br /> the man who said it was one of the funniest movies of all time, please specify one row, only one scene that should not even laugh. <br /> <br /> It is much better singer than I remember it to be, but I do not want to watch a lounge act. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is trying to please, for they think that they should not see it objectively.
