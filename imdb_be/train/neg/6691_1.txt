MY EYES! The name of God and all this holy MAKE ME UNSEE this movie! what drugs you people on! this may well be the worst movie ever! I felt like I was in a bad acid trip all the time, I need to call a doctor to help me cope with the trauma of this epic disaster. From the beginning to the end of the glow of the rope is a masterpiece of Satan's wicked movie. when I thought that watching this movie with my Jewish best friend and his family, we thought, "Oh, hey, it could be funny! it is likely to be bad, but still a bit funny "how we were wrong, we were not prepared for how awful this film can be. All my friends lined lobotomy, once the film was finished, and in the course of the film, one of my friends tried to hang himself with his belt, and the other tried to cut his wrists from a wooden spoon. I wish I watched the video of the ring, but not so the pain and suffering would be more than just seven short days. For all who want to see this movie, you are not ready! You may think that you are some sort of "tough guy" by renting it, but this film will break you, to push you to the ground and urinate on you.
