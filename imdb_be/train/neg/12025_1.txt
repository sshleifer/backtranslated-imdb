This film was Romance channel and I thought that this may be dull 80-movie that will be enjoyable to some level, so my brother and I watched it. Boy did it sucks. Boy gets put pressure on girls - its correction * dream * -Girl (apparently, there is a difference, and I'm surprised that he realized that it was his dream girl -. He was killed by her with more than 30 feet away I think just goes to show the power of dreams girls), the boy ends up in the guise of a woman, to be the next dream girl (creative in the sense that it is far beyond the plan, but non-creative in the sense that, probably, a better solution would be to come up), the faulty situation occurs, the match is made (all of which takes seems to ODB camping around late at night - either the place was somehow responsible for this amazing lighting and the actors had to wait until they come to their day jobs to come to the set, I suspect the latter). Very crudely done, very sorry. He rarely even funny * accidentally *, so that in fact there is nothing to redeem it. If you are not interested in the fact that the first days of Chad Lowe, before he finally got his piece of cake with his role as an HIV-positive gay man in the series "Life Goes On", or Gail O'Grady, who was on NYPD Blue and probably you need to look at the buttocks Dennis Franz). But it is unlikely motives - I would say, "systematic derangement of feeling" it would be more justifiable purpose. I am surprised that I have seen it all. I believe that this is the kind of thing where, midway, you are * still * Watch out for any painful, self-flagellistic internal party matter, and I think you might as well finish it, so you can tell your friends and family 'and that you actually sat through such a terrible movie, on the off chance that it will gain you some sympathy for the dubious state of your mental health. * Can you accept the challenge?
