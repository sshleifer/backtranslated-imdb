*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If the film has been considered necessary, based on only one room, one would think that you look at the average animal-oriented horror film. The plot is as follows. Group documentary head to the island to make a documentary about surfing with sharks or surf the blood. (I live in South Africa, as it was released as a «Blood Surf».) However, it seems there are a few interesting idea behind it, that if he investigated further, could improve this film a few. However, it is not like surfing in the blood of the film is minimal due to the fact that their documentation is interrupted by a rather large saltwater crocodile. <br /> <br /> The script is absolutely horrible. A good example of this is whenever someone gets eaten by a crocodile, which is a frequent occurrence in this film, no one seems to give a damn. The most beloved people did in the movie was just toast the victim at the scene, which was supposed to be bitter, but just ended up being ridiculous because of that dialogue in this movie was very questionable character. Another thing that's really annoying about this film is that they introduce characters that completely redundant for the film. They introduce a bunch of pirates, who can only be seen to add another 10 minutes to mercifully short film. <br /> <br /> Act can say mediocre. It probably would have been much more impressive if they do not have such a terrible scenario for the job. In general, there is not one person who made a terrible impact on me. Everyone seemed, divorced caricature, and thus, is not one of these actors made any impact on me. <br /> <br /> crocodile called himself a huge, more than 31 feet and the feeling is exactly the size of well-displayed obvious fake crocodile that they gave us in the film. Death of a crocodile at the end of the movie so funny fake and contrived, it does turn the stomach. With a huge cry of bravado, the protagonist says that he has a plan, which turns to fall down the hill and get a crocodile blame themselves for happiness, being a thorn in the lower part of the said hill. <, Br /> <br /> as a whole, I would say that this film is the one that should be considered for you to believe how bad it can be. That probably seemed like a good idea at the time was suffering from a terrible script and an overwhelming sense of low budgetness, which all served to create a truly terrible film.
