Score: 0 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> *** possible spoilers specific scene (but who the hell cares) *** <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right: zero. And I rarely give 1-x. Even for Lamest films I look at things like music, movies, imagination, humor is even good pace to be objective about the account as possible. Looking at it in its own ranks or subgenus. But there is absolutely nothing the sacrifice here. I can not remember another time the movie actually sent me back and forth across the room when she was finished. The only reason I did it until the end, because I could not change the channel - I was sitting there just shocked, watching to see what an insult it would be foolish to think up a little further. It was like a snake digest the rat. <br /> <br /> But let's have some fun and get this baby apart, we will. First of all, there is nothing technical about "Whipped" that works. All visual style sitcom. Deleted scenes simple photo of traffic going by at night over and over again. Music and evaluation, not only do not contribute to the film - it is insulting. Not to mention, that has nothing to contribute in any way. It acts as a board, as is the case all around and that is Amanda Peet (of course, that the "star", which has received this train wreck green light) as well. These guys, they say, good friends, have great chemistry and sense of purpose, when director Peter M. Cohen rounded them at the bus station, minutes before the shooting. <br /> <br /> On the creative side, there ISN »t the original bone in his body. It has no idea. He does not show us anything we have not seen a thousand times. All premises, or "twist" of this film is based on a male-bashing and "idea" that endowed women play men "just as they are played." Anyone who thinks that this is somehow a turn or in any way the original never explicitly turned on TV before. Curly, fine women are common. Male-bashing is the norm. It's not stealing from anything specific, it's worse: it steals from the cliché. I can not imagine a woman making film depicts other woman on the basis of so many stereotypes and with this feeling of contempt. It makes me want to go rent "The Company Men" - or better yet, "There's Something About Mary." This film wants to be "sharp" version of "There's Something About Mary" is so bad, you can see the sweat. <br /> <br /> The film has no understanding of women, men, dating, sex, or really anything. Cohen just throw content of the myths he was grafted from other films sexist. On the other hand, the film does not work as a satire of something, because despite the fact that matured exaggeration it does not, you can view as a "satirical" that grounding in reality, you need to satire. He does not even know that it is satirical. Then there is the dialogue, which is a bit more characters yelling obscenities at each other. Example: Symbol 1: «F ** to you" Character 2: "Oh, so, come ** to you" (repeat) <br /> <br /> And the bottom line, that can forgive other opinions: there are a lot of films without land, without a good action, with the morally repugnant characters and laced with obscenity dialogue that were funny and so were good. "Whipped" is not funny. Nya for a second. He does not have the comic skills or time. The situation is completely false, entirely based on any piece of the truth, especially enough to wring a laugh out of us. The characters are all well drawn, so they seem Relatable to the low level of the lowest common denominator. Just look at the "tent scene", "iconic" hair gel scene. One of our bumbling antiheroes opens the medicine cabinet and see 's Mena (Pete) vibrator. for some reason, the light shining down on him as if he had found the Holy Grail. th Cohen believes that men react so that the vibrators, I do not know. At that time, he rubs it on himself, he throws it in the toilet, and then tries to catch it with his bare hands, when, oh my, Mena walks on it . Oh, my side. <br /> <br /> But, oddly enough, people actually like this movie. Of course, people also like "Friends" and the reality dating shows, so I would not be surprised. this is but the common thread. "Whipped" great proof to me that there is just a huge pocket of people in America who would laugh at any joke just because avorka comes to sex. They, like any show or movie (or think they like it) just because it comes to dating or a relationship. This lack of a quality no exposure to these people. Just as humans are causing want whiter teeth and a thin body to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they are also called blind lap up anything dating / relationships related to sell them cheap, empty, light TV, movies, and any number of products. <br /> <br /> The only consilation will that when I die, because I've seen this movie, I got a loan in order to get 80 minutes of my life back. <br /> <br />
