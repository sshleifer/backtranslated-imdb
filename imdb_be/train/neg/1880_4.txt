Despite a huge fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films, it was not until about 6 years ago, I first saw the "Follow the Fleet". I knew all the songs from old records Astaire / Rogers (yes, vinyl), but did not know anything about the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the songs catchy and Ginger Rogers character is sweet and funny, you just do not like the "sleeping Baker." When you try to do to his longtime partner, he is constantly sabotaging his career. His character does not have a normal sense of humor and Elan with Astaire characters of other films. <br /> <br /> If you look at most of the songs and a solo tap routine Ginger Rogers.
