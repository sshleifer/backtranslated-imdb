How hard is it to write a watchable movie with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? It seems very difficult for the authors here. <br /> <br /> I still have not the slightest idea of ​​how to Sant younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the older brother). I must have missed that part of the story, but in fact, it really does not matter. Many of the scenes seemed ridiculous and far-fetched; kind of "funny concept" stage, which of the drugs WAY too far from where any sense of comedy is lost. <br /> <br /> director / producer was trying to go to "tear Jerker» in the end, that will have to be appropriate, if there is nothing to prove that the point was worth following. <br /> <br /> Uh, big disappointment. I can see how some people may enjoy this kami, as many people will take any rubbish they are fed, but I would strongly recommend waiting for a DVD to it. NOT worth the $ 23,978 you need to get your family to the movies these days.
