SAKURA killers (1+ Outta 5 stars) Perhaps in 1987, this film may seem cool ... if you have never ever seen a * good * ninja movie. Cheese Â«80s music ... cheesy dialogue cheese ... actions ... and way beyond, cheese sequences of martial arts. A cool scene at the beginning ... with the old Chuck Connors plays golf on the beach ... a few black clad ninja trying to get at him, and he seemed too intent beat the ball suddenly notice ... he climbs into a golf bag and. .. the NAU, I will not spoil it for you ... if you're ever the misfortune to see this movie, you'll thank me. The history of a lot of nonsense about some stolen videotape or something. A beam of dim-bulb Caucasian heroes trained in the ways of the ninja, because "only a ninja can fight a ninja" or something like that. It is strange that these guys do not seem to deal better after exercise than before ... oh well, the film does move pretty briskly. The fight scene may not be great .. but they are in abundance ... and overdone sound effects are good a few laughs.
