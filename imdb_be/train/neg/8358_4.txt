This is not one of Arbuckle and Keaton films better, that's for sure. Thick wife is tired of his drinking, so she takes him to the hospital where a psychiatrist (Keaton) claims to have a guaranteed cure! Well, once, Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and taken for surgery. Then he escapes and is pursued to the point where he meets a cute girl who wants to run away, too. Finally, despite the employees who seek them about, they run away at what point it becomes apparent that the girl mad and Arbuckle quickly recaptured. Nevertheless, he wakes up after surgery and everything was all a dream - was not sexy girl crazy and Dr. Keaton is not as great incompetent as he seemed in a dream <br /> <br /> A lack. humor is the biggest problem with the film. Of course, to make fun of the mentally ill is quite low, but in its time it was a guaranteed laugh. I laugh, too, if it was something funny to answer! A lot of energy and all <br /> <br /> FYI -. During one of the chase sequences, Fatty miracles in the race of men more than 200 pounds (wow, what are the chances of this?). And soon after that, it supports in the post, where the number 5 just newly painted walls. As a result, five are now on the back of shirts fatty, and it looks like a normal party. However, the number should appear on the shirt back fat, but came out the front way - a mistake, because they should have realized it would be a mirror image back 5.
