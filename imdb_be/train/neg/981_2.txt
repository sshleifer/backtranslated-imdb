As a big fan of Marlene Dietrich, I had (finally) looking very, very dim picture. This is the first color film Miss Dietrich, and the world's most beautiful blonde redhead! Bad start. The history of a huge hole, drawing object, which in itself bothers me is boring hard: the religious feelings of guilt. (Who needs it ???) Suffice it to say, it is possible that all of the films Dietrich (and I have seen the most, including the "Pittsburgh"), is the only one where even its performance is hardly worth watching. Color photographs in order (this is a very early release of Technicolor), but to anything. Funny Cast: Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (enough said?). The only thing of any interest at all strange caricature of John Carradine to play as «The Sand Diviner», which predicts all that will happen. Imaginary "happy ending" is one of the most depressing ever conceived. Another example of a very inflated reputation Selznick (as he ever make a really good movie - Besides one), and one final stimulation, the soundtrack of the MGM DVD disorder, with the volume level seems to be randomized. Very unrecommended.
