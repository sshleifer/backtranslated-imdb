Good Guys, I came across this film for the evening, when I classify documents. May academic specialty Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that no one has ever done a genre whose honor it deserves. Icelandic "Beowulf & Grendel" is the least offensive I have seen, and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This version of the Sci-Fi included in the version of Christopher Lambert. Ugh. <br /> <br /> What's not to like? CGI for the other. Surprisingly bad. More importantly, it is faithful to the storyline, not to mention the stilted action. I'm used to and with all versions that I've seen. <br /> <br /> Delighted Despite this, Peter
