I bought this adaptation, because I really liked the novel by Anne Bronte, when I read it some time ago, and, as a rule, especially like the BBC drama. But I am very disappointed, I never thought it would be as bad as :. The entire series made me laugh so much more than I was touched, as the novel was <br /> <br /> First of all, the music (and lyrics) seems completely out of place in a period drama (it sounds like it was written for a modern horror movie ), and the other commentator, I was particularly annoyed by the way the chamber formed and spun around actors. I've seen some scenes shot in such a way to "North and South", and it seemed all right there, but the Tenant is certainly overdone and simply annoying. Camera movement can not make a wooden acting alive. <br /> <br /> Most of the supporting roles were difficult to distinguish between the first and the script lacked clarity. None of the characters were not properly presented in the first. The little boy gave very good results, it is very cute and the best feature film. <br /> <br /> spoilers characteristic Tara Fitzgerald Helen Graham made her seem cold and sharp, giving no emotion does not go through. She does not seem to be able to cry quite realistic. I just could not believe that Markham could have fallen in love with her, and I do not mention the terrible hair, she was given. I could not help but feel some sympathy with her husband! Fancy married to a Virago ... In addition, he was the only major actor who sounded right to me. Toby Stephens, I found only in the order, the brother of Helen Graham is not very good. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such gloomy subjects as alcoholism and violence. In addition, only hint and left view of the reader in the book elaborated on with tolerance in a TV adaptation: do some scenes as rough and comic (such as Huntington's eye begins to bleed), and others are too sexy up for the period drama! I mean, we do not get enough of these bed scenes in modern drama?
