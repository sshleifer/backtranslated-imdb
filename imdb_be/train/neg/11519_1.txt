This is absolutely stupid movie I've ever seen. Who spend a splendid cast. This is how James Cromwell plays the ignorant deputy. I could go on and on, but I would obviously be to spend more time on this review than anyone has done on the script. The only thing that this film is about us versus them, and how to revel profane farce for tolerance of any reasonable person. This is one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen - and I love James Garner.
