LAGE Raho Munnabhai film is really disappointing. I saw the first part of Munnabhai, and it was very good, but this one really make and bore n disappoint U ............................ ........... <br /> <br /> This film really Yours wasting time and money. I went with my friend to this film the first day of its release and V both get a hole in the cinema ... .......................... ......................... <br /> <br /> the role CIRCUIT very small n useless n this film. I think dat SANJAY-cut role Arshad VARSHI ........................ <br /> <br /> The character of the film is not very well define as the previous film .this show as a result of self-confidence ......... <br /> <br /> ideas of Mahatma also not defined and confused ........ ..... ..... <br /> <br /> rEALLY big disappointment
