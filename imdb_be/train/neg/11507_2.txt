The noble efforts of Guy Ritchie will hit, knocked down, rapes, legs around, shot, knife, spit, perforated, raped and abused and left for dead by the terrible execution of Madonna. Its action was very similar to a graduate from Al Gore School of Performing and public speaking. Guy Ritchie has made several noble attempt to alter it, and if we exclude all the scenes that his wife was in this film just in the best case. I think the best acting job ever, had to be Guy reassuring his wife that her performance was not enough to re-shoot well. If you have the opportunity to watch Gone or clipping the nails on your feet for 89 minutes ... to the enlarged pedicure.
