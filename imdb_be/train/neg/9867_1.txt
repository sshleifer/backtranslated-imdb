Screener saw this before the season award last year, in fact, do not know why they gave them after the voting has ended, but no matter, perhaps, to influence, at least, but the film was a confusing mess. Of course, some parts were funny black humor kind of way, but none of the characters are not very real to me at all. There is not one person that I could connect with, and I think that's where it's not for me. Of course, the plot a bit interesting and very subversive in relation to Scientology, WOW! What a great idea ... Let's see if it is no longer mined to the point of uselessness. Whole ordeal feels fake, the lighting, the casting, the script for the horrifying visual effects (which are supposed to deliberate, I can say, and therefore can not everyone else, no one is laughing at you, though). In any case, I hope that he does it for sale on DVD, at least, I do not want to project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort to get completely unnoticed. But it is the scar anyway. Sad scar on it.
