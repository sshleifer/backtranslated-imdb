This film shows that "commercial" cinema, or otherwise, Hollywood movies are in serious crisis.There there is absolutely no reason that this film was not to be made except for the fact that someone is waiting for success is based on name.There Shakeel is not necessary with reference to the story: it's a little more embarrassed than knot.What still screen more dim, O'Neal is a bad actor, but Francis Capra worse <br /> <br /> Rating :. 1/10.
