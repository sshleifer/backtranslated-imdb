What was the worst film of 2003? "Cat in the Hat?" "Gigli?" Moses nya! I believe that this disgusting little film from earlier this year. Poorly written, poorly edited, and (if I may be so bold) bad acting, the "Order" is the black hole of the film - the film is so dense, not even the smallest entertainment can move away from its event horizon in the sludge. It's not even funny, accident, as (for example) «Showgirls». <br /> <br /> You know that the producers provided that their audience is not going to be very clever. They renamed the film, originally titled «Sin Eaters», because they knew Americans were too stupid to understand that sin was a cannibal, even if they go to great lengths to explain that sin eater in the film. Instead, they appear in a very generic name and picture of Heath Ledger looking sullen more than enough to get you there. <br /> <br /> And, hey, you know, they were right! My ex-girlfriend saw a picture of Heath and pulled me. Congratulations, manufacturer, you have met your target market. She also liked «Grease II», so that you are in good company. <br /> <br /> Back on topic Heath plays a Catholic monk from specific (you guessed it) the order that tries to investigate the murder of his teacher. He has a problem of celibacy, perhaps because no one in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion, much less be a celibate monk. The only member of this order is an alcoholic funny fat man. As much as I'd like to see the return of funny alcoholic on the big screen, his attempt at humor reminded me of all Dorks in my high school who made imitation Monty Python, thinking that if they just said that the line is that pythons are made automatically It is funny. You know the kind of people I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> When I say more, I would be in danger generate spoilers. Honestly, what ruined the movie for me was the fact that it was created.
