There are so many negative reviews "Stay Away, Joe" here I just can not keep silent anymore, and let this injustice happen. Here are the parties you have not heard <br /> <br /> Elvis Presley movies have schadenfreude for the simple reason :. They are wonderful movies for pure relaxation, because I do not think when I look at them, which means that I do not have to worry about missing a complex plot, because never is not a proper story to begin with. I can just kick your shoes, drink a beer, sit back, turn off your brain and enjoy all the general wackiness and catchy carefree rock and roll tune with decades optimistic of them all. <br /> <br /> in my books "Stay Away, Joe" determined falls into the "so bad it's good" -category. Now, if you're like me and appreciate the "value waste" is the ultimate camp experience of the 1960s. It's so bad that it is almost surreal to watch and only then, when you think it can not get any worse, it surprises you in the most imaginable ways. In the end, you're so surprised by all the new levels of stupidity you just do not know whether to laugh or cry. In two words: I love it because it's so damn funny that once was a generation that actually made movies like that. I still give it a 1 out of 10, though - as soon as he gets to the bottom 100, he became an instant classic bad film.
