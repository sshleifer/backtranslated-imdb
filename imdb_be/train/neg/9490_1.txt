This is a complete and absolute rubbish, a great example of what a bad movie, as it may not be attractive to those who are not even proponents of b-movies. Nia, I repeat, do not waste the precious time of your life on this piece of garbage. Bad action, bad directing, terrible (but I mean really awful) script and a complete lack of ideas as to what entertainment (in any form) is. I bought the DVD for $ 3, I swear I could almost pay someone to take it. Smoking it would not be enough, that this film has done for me. I love B-movies, killer toys, amazing lagoon monster, but it's far away. You know those movies that are so bad they're funny? Even there. Just plain old pathetic.
