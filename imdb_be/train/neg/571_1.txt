I rented it just because I loved the first film. However, calling it Carpenter Vampires: Los Muertos just fraudster trick to rent it. He actually is the executive producer and apparently has nothing to do with the adoption of this film (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?) <br /> <br /> The tragic story, scary special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing Vampire Hunter with ever time. It's not even funny bad. <br /> <br /> What we ultimately it is boring, uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and cliched action. It just smells like a low budget. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the bubonic plague.
