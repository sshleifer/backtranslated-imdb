Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his own debut, this time it's a film that played for ERM ?? She is laughing. While diving, Rome was the body blond beauty on the sea bed, her legs, as one would expect, the prisoners in the cement. Rome from the case after the hired man mountain Walden Gronskiy. Rome is immediately in danger because he had to explore some types of mafia that turn the tables on him, and he finds himself the prime suspect, and now he has to go to the races and hopes to solve the case alone. Overweight Sinatra trying his every effort to sell us lame joke and make us believe that he was a good detective, oh and not to mention sexually attractive to fox Raquel Welch, but he fails miserably in this ham fist vanity project. Frankly ridiculous denouement that surrounds each female is rather strange, every woman in the film is shaking his head, who loves bending it in front of the camera, the director of Douglas, of course, obliged to driving over the cracks of their asses every time they bend their back muscles. There's even a funny Feminine character that believe that this is a film made in the "real men" for "real men" in order to confirm its own weak sexuality, this shameful massacre.
