As this piece of shit was on TV this long? It's terrible. It makes me want to shoot someone. This is so fake that it's actually worse than in the 1940s sci-fi movie. I would like to have a stroke than watching this nonsense. I remember watching it when it first came out. I thought, hey, it could be interesting, I learned how absolutely, insanely, ridiculously stupid it really was. It was so bad that I actually took out a pocket knife and put his hand to the table. <br /> <br /> Please people stop watching this and all other reality shows, they are garbage that suppresses network and cancellation of quality programming that requires some thought to create.
