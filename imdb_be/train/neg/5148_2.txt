There is a lot wrong with this picture, starting with the scenario that is both obvious and unnecessary. Courteney Cox plays a comic book artist, who runs a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city. Immediately she is persecuted by local, which is pretty upset (Craig Sheffer), and that seems to attempt a third rate imitation of Mickey Rourke. D.B. Sweeney is the local police, who are supposed to be there to serve and protect. At the same time, the script manipulates the audience, who is actually a good guy? Logic does not fly out of the window after the first ten minutes and do not come back, and there are more unanswered questions than it should be. If you think, «Blue Desert» can be saved by a great Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. Part of it is insignificant, as well as the entire film. - MERK
