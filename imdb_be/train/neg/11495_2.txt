It was one of Lamest films that we have seen over the past few months with a predictable plot lines and a pretty bad actor (mainly from the minor characters). Interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more useful than the movie itself ... <br /> <br /> Hugh Laurie, obviously put a lot of effort to learn how to dance samba, but the extent of his nature requires only that he was plunged into the end of the kiddie pool. The film is based on the appearance of a beautiful girl and beautiful music, but this is not enough to make a good entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen Rio or in the British bank, this film is for you. 2 of 10.
