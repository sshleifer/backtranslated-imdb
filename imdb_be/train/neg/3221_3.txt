I watched it on the tube last night. first drew my attention to the actor. The first scenes were getters attention. Some funny, some sad. Good character development. I felt that the last third of the film diverged. If it were not for the early part of the movie, I would have stopped watching. I continued to watch as wanting linked. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel that this has never happened. I do not particularly like to extend the period that some of the characters spoke in Yiddish (?). This was the other shoe? <br /> <br /> I would recommend? No, I do not think so. As other reviewers have already released a lot of slang (60-jive), but it was not too distracting. The ending is completely turned me off.
