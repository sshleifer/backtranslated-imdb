It is very funny to watch, "Beretta's Island" as a kind of natural trash-film.It, as a response to the type of Jess Franco in-movie.Bodybuilders Strikes Back (! Face to face!) To pushers.The very very very stupid punch! Action: incredibly bad filmmaker shooting (shooting) scene look even better than the hands fighting.Chasing scene ridiculous.Saving beauties scene incredibly stupid.Erotic scene very unerotic.The major success of the film festival and the pretty scenery scenes.Don Â»t miss : Arnold Schwarzenegger joke at the beginning of the film, and a list of relatives Franco Columbu at the end. Special attraction: naked bosom.Almoust forgot - Franco can sing!
