Here's how to do it: Believe in God and repent for their sins. Then everything should unfold over the next day or so. <br /> <br /> For the last fifteen minutes, this film just does not matter how bad the repetition of a bad life in a drunken. His mother dies. His stepmother is b_tch. His father dies. He drinks. He's getting married. He has children. He drank some more. His wife is angry. He worried about their children. Wife threatened to leave. He calls Reverend late at night b / c that he wants to kill himself. Then after a repetition occurs, that when we get a "backward" -like subtle message. <br /> <br /> «He needed the salary." This phrase, which I had to repeat again and again, as soon as the credits began to roll, so I would not lose my respect for Madsen. <br /> <br /> Madsen falls to his knees and asked for forgiveness of Christ. Once he does, he goes out and actually says that he sees the world differently. He tells his wife that he has found God, and that's good enough for her. Flip scene four months, and his wife tired of going to church. The end of the movie as Madsen goes to bars and gives a monologue about how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol. The final moment? He gives a little dismissive wave of the bar (that is, the sin of the house) and give gay, Miami Vice, after school special greeting jump in the air as stills camera. Look, why do I have to repeat this phrase? "He needs a salary." <br /> <br /> This man is a bad film. Production value The B-Grade 80 does not help. Scenario could have easily been «Touched By An Angel» episode. It could be knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials. The current wooden and never believable. Even Madsen, of which I am a big fan and is the only reason I sat through it, it becomes clear that this is his first acting job, and he does not know his A $$ out of his elbow still on the camera. 45 minutes into it I started to despair. It was then, as homework. I just wanted to put it aside and say well, I saw a half. That's good enough. But no. If I had sat through Cheerleader Ninjas, I could sit for all this <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give this thing 1 to two points: 1) I Love Madsen. I know that it's not fair. But it's great to see the name of the opening of the "Introduction Michael Madsen." Sue me. 2) Some of the dialogue is so bad that it's a classic. I'll stick with some quotations at the end of it, so you can enjoy them too. <br /> <br /> That's about it. To wrap it up, this thing is a piece of shit that should stay clean with the other shit. But hey! Look! Michael Madsen! (See also TILT, EXECUTIVE the TARGET, daughter of my boss, etc.). Now I have to rewatch Reservoir Dogs and watch Madsen police torture to get my respect back to him. I see the children <br /> <br /> «going to this stuff makes me go blind, but I'm going to drink it anyway." - the first taste Madsen cheap alcohol <br /> <br /> "I do not 'know! it seems, everything is so beautiful! »- Madsen walk outside after confessing God <br /> <br />« I'm going to the city center later and pick up the Bible, and I'm going to get a haircut too »- Madsen after conversion at the dinner table, because the devil lives in the hair
