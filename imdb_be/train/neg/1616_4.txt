Star Rating: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night Monday Morning <br /> <br /> This is the second batch of the Che film moves the story forward at the end of the 60th year, where people now lifted a resistance fighter in the mountains of South America, will survive without sufficient food and water, and with the tension mounting between the group. Everything comes to a head when he crosses the border into Bolivia and the government forces to step up their campaign to bring it down. <br /> <br /> Without the fly up between the time and place of the last movie, Soderbergh's second installment focuses solely on activities in the mountains, and manages to be even sadder experience. And even pretentious, the cost has been muted, giving the second installment with more unwanted artsieness air, which proves as alienation. There simply is unshakable air of boredom for the film, which never lets up. You can not fault the ambition or drive Soderbergh Del Toro in the title role, it's just a shame that somewhere in the production of things could make such a disappointing turn. **
