I really wanted to like this movie. I love Kenny Hotz and spenny rice has a magical way. Not that I like spenny general. Spenny ruining the film. He must permit Kenny and his hot girlfriend step movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's pretty boring in the side of the stage with Roger Ebert in it. There's really not too many celebrities in the film, and most of them do not seem to say more than one line. Overall, this movie was disappointing. I would only suggest watching it if you got it from the season 1 DVD Kenny against singing (it comes on 3 discs for free). Regardless of this production, I am still very excited to check Papel Chase.
