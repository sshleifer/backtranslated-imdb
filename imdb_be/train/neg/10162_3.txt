This movie was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California. She thought it was great because it was so real, "just as people in the Ohio Valley!" I'm from the area, and I felt the film as "Just as people in California think we are!" I lived Marietta and Parkersburg and worked minimum wage worker there. We laughed a lot, we bonded with and took breaks to people of our time; Young people came together at night. Older people have a little free time after work because they care about their families. The area is beautiful in the summer and darker in winter rain than anywhere else. <br /> <br /> In addition, "if you live in a manufactured home you have to be pressure," condescension, the story did not have any elements of charm, mystery and even a sense of fear. <br /> <br /> character Martha the worst was drawn. it is doubtful that anyone would be so arrested belonged to the church, but if she was, she would have probably made friends there. I read the reviews that seem to suggest, March jealous of Rose because Rose was "younger, more beautiful and thinner," but if it is not seen. what we actually see March learn more not like Rose, for reasons which will be applied in the same way as the three friends were of the same age and gender. We see Martha feeling left in the smoking sessions are excluded from the cycle, when the social plans are made, used, but did not appreciate, and finally, disrespectful and hurt <br /> <br /> Just one more thing we have to :. murder suspect Kyle, because he once had a few panic attacks? please. This requires the stigma against mental illness to a new level.
