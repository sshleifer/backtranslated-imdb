I know that I'm in the minority, but ... <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll is about as talented as a frog. Not even a frog; a toad. He recalls a hundred other non-talent employees, which in a lot of useless crap one festival after another. <br /> <br /> This film? Eat shit Festival. Slater talent only minimal use leads to the thought that he has other things (his failed relationship) on his mind. Reid performs as if it is either forgotten his acting lessons, a serious blow to the head and forced to forget her acting lessons, and has one of the worst director in the history of cinema. I vote for a third choice, and I, even though the other two always possible. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll has never done one thing with which I derived the slightest pleasure. Frankly speaking, I am satisfied that he did this bitch. I was concerned about Bloodrayne compete with «Underworld: Evolution» for ticket sales. Now, I'm sure Len Wiseman has nothing, and I do not mean nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> This tariff rating 1.0 / 10 for this dirty, confusing the crap festival, with ... <br /> <br /> enemy's :.
