Universal Soldier: The Return is not the worst movie ever made. No, the honor would go to a movie that was trying to make some kind of statement or take any artistic feat, but not pitiful or insulting manner. However, it may not be a movie that I've ever seen the sun tried so little, and it turned out as fully as did Universal Soldier: The Return. <br /> <br /> This film is a parody of the sci-fi / action that has almost nothing to recommend it. It operates just as bad as any movie I've ever seen. The plot is terrible and predictable. The special effects are helpless. In short, anyone even remotely associated with this film should be ashamed of themselves. USA: Return of the previous tariff makes Van Damme, it seems as innovative cinematic masterpieces. Some movies are so bad they're good. Believe me when I tell you that this is not one of them. I really do not know what else to say here. I doubt that many people consider to see this movie, if they had not already, but just in case: no.
