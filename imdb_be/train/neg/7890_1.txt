How sad that there is no way to leave a mark below 1. I saw this piece of nonsense and could hardly believe what I was watching. Each part of the movie was terrible. Music, acting, direction, story, everything, simply everything. I actually appeared to laugh at various points in the film. I especially liked the bit where our hero dashing through a hospital in soft focus slow motion, and knocks on the sharing of a nurse hands the buffer because ............. well. Because. Location of the product? Crucifixion (in crucifi?) Everywhere. If you have faith and are very easy to meet, you may like this movie. If you like this movie, you really need to get more.
