After watching this movie on SciFi Channel, I can only conclude that this film was made by a bunch of amateurs who have never seen a movie of his life. The film is an endless sequence of strange phenomena, or "invention" in the other reading over my shoulder telling me. The plot really is not necessary to comment on how, but mostly the plane crashed with players Yeti territory. Before it was over, we were treated to the Yeti ripping the heart out, Yeti waddling in an attempt to escape before jumping 50 meters, breaking the Yeti feet off the man and beat him with them, a woman kills a rabbit at 30 meters with a dart Yeti survival of some bullets and be burning with no visible damage, Yeti dangling off a cliff, holding a human shoe, but then jumps down, and the whole collection of bizarre future, occurrences. Basically, if you do not go to bed on Saturday identified the purpose of watching the worst of the SciFi Channel original movies, avoid this film like the plague. Or, as my friend is reading over my shoulder, saying, "This is the best movie I've ever seen." On that one to my right, he says: "Only the fight techno could do it better."
