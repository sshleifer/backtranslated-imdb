this movie was terrible. I could barely stay awake through it. I would never see this film again, when I was paid to. The so-called horror scenes in it were increadably predictable and more played. There was not really anything about this film, which would have made it original or worth the $ 7.50 I paid to see it. Nha watch it, not rent it, I do not read about it on the Internet, because any of these things would be a waste of time. Gellar gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of himself for sullying her reputation with this film. Shame on you Sarah for being associated with this horrible, horrible movies. Horrible movie, do not ever see.
