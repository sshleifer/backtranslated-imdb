I can not believe that the same guy sent this crap and Dracula 2000 Dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh and well-written, if poorly acted. <br /> <br /> This bunch could not even claim that. It starts with the defeat Dracula in Dracula end of 2000. Then, ignoring the story after the description of what happened after that. Following descriptive properly could make a good sequel anyway, but Craven decided to go in the style of his old movies, not having a good connection, but the name of the main villain. <br /> <br /> Even the actor playing Dracula is different (the transition from black hair to blonde Dracula 2000 here). <br /> <br /> To avoid this film if you have any respect for your taste in movies.
