I saw this movie with my instructor on climbing, and we found the whole thing is so ridiculous to be of pity. (On the one hand, if Stallone climbing itself, there is no need to carry any gear, but I believe that these hanging hooks look sorta "mountain climbyÂ», so let's throw them in). For those lobotomized people who think that Colorado looks nothing like dolomite in Italy and moguls of Hollywood (where the film was shot) got much more funny and foul-smelling things for you to swallow.
