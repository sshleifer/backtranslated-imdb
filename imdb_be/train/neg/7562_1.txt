I have not seen the original, but just wanted to drop a quick note for those who are going to scroll down far: The Wicker Man the worst film I've seen this year. Maybe even within two years. I would like to ask the House for their money back or turn back the clock to prevent yourself not to see it <br /> <br /> I will give him two positive nod :. Sarcasm Cage character at least, have some laughs from me and island scenery was excellent. Unfortunately, it is. Here come ridicule. The plot of the film is only moving forward, because the other characters do not give any direct cell responses - and he agrees with it !!! How can this go on for an hour of my time (much less days in the film), is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the fact that the plot is full of holes. You leave the theater with enough unsolved problems to fill a library. As someone who can read this script and thought: "Yes, people have to pay $ 11 to see the shadowy outline of what the movie should look like" me. <br /> <br /> Do not go see this movie. Or even rent it on DVD.
