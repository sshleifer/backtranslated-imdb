For those who love movies with depressing characters sloppy and shabby plot, this one is for you! With the gloomy atmosphere of New York, who comes across as an extremely bleak and almost hopeless place up to two different lead characters, devoid of special sense of morality, the film of this loser. <br /> <br /> Why he won an Academy Award was because it was so shocking at the time that Hollywood, new his freedom to show all that he wanted all the moral codes of abandoned, wanted to note this fact. The filmmakers then were as immature six years with unlimited expense accounts in a local candy store. Thus, Hollywood gave the theater audience (perhaps for the first time) dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homelessness and other such prominent sights and sounds, just his twisted mind will think appealing .... and then awarded the work. <br /> <br /> He also expressed hope, I am sure to shock the core audience. Well, it was possible at this level. Spectators were amazed at what they say, and heard, and the Academy, proud of myself for being able to display the dirt and make money at the same time, can not help but to give homage to this piece of gilded garbage. <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, as a very young man, I found the film interesting, too. However, seeing him again in the 1990s has left a bad taste in my mouth, I had never watched, to see it again. <br /> <br /> The action was good, but what? Duties well in many films. No one ever said, Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight could not act. Hoffman was especially good in his youth, playing wacked exit of people. It was kind of like Johnny Depp of his era, playing guys like "Ratso Rizzo" in this film, and then is going to be a "Rain Man" later. So, "Ratso" is a symbol that you will never forget, and "Joe Buck" (Voight) is the one that you want to forget, but the story is so miserable that overwhelms small effect. <br /> <br /> This movie is not "art", and it's not worth it numerous awards; it only pushed the envelope big-time in 1969, and that's why he remembered so fondly in the hearts of critics and film. It's two o'clock profanity and ultra-sloppy religious cheap shots glorifying cranks (Andy Warhol did not even get into the act - not surprisingly), and generally disgusting man <br /> <br /> I did like throwing songs "all. say "that helped glorify of Harry Nilsson, but even that was a fake, because Fred Neil wrote a song and sang it better than before Nilsson made it .... and only a few people have ever heard of the Nile (which is their loss .!) and - as already mentioned - the name "Ratso Rizzo" look stay with you <br /> <br /> The film is zna avym, but in a negative sense, I'm afraid: it has designated it as an "official" that Hollywood had gone to the toilet, and he remained in the sewers until now.
