Imagine you're a schoolboy in the back of the dark, uncrowded theater with your girlfriend. How bad would the film should be, so that you would feel compelled to leave the theater and home before it ended? This movie is that bad. In fact. Films are often so bad that they are good; this film goes beyond this stage bad Ness. It hurts bad. Horribly, horribly, crimes against humanity, the bad.
