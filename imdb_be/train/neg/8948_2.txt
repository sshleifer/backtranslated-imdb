Â«Ninteen Eighty-Four," a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted. It's a very dark film, and it is one that does not make you feel good about yourself. We are talking about the romance that takes place in this society, and changed lovers and of human nature to be selfish. The film has some very good ideas, and make a good drawing is a society with the dark tones of colors (contrast with happiness and bright colors in dreams) and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places. Nevertheless, despite the ingenuity of the film on the drawing this idea, the movie was very slow and did not seem to quite understand the idea across. It seemed to spend too much time being clever, not to tell the story.
