Time spent watching this film being wasted. I do not like science fiction. I do not reject any genre of its own, as a good work can be done in any genre. This film, however, is not a good job. I can not blame the visual (if not related to foreign cosmetics), and the special effects are impressive. History is not categorical BAD, for trekkish comics. But FX visuals were obviously where all the maker's interest / attention / money went. Direction alternated between sluggish and confused (one was not sure exactly who is doing what and what and to whom at least one critical point). "Operations" mostly very bad actually. There was no reason for most indications line but a hint of "It was that way on this page and the director told me that I had to be crazy / boring / scary / whatever. Okay, so it was the pilot of the series SF. because despite the fact that the reason for the adjusted shoddiness in those areas where to be seen as important for the dramatic environment. I'm surprised the pilot sold the series. Or money in the hands of technerds?
