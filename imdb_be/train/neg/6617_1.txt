Accurately points out that advertising is not all. Points to the fact that a crappy actor Abhishek and it receives only the films due to his father and his wife. Amitabh as always hard. Ajay Devgn as always shitty and useless, and the new guy is a joke. The leading lady is such a waste of an actor. Such miserable distinguished from such film director and from such a large industry. With films as such, I reduced the number of Bollywood movies I watch. <br /> <br /> RGV takes very Freestuff movies for a while now. Time to get different actors. Hrithek anyone? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back. Any other leading lady wants to be half-naked. Pffffft.
