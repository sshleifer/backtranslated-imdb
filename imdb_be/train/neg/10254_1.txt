Spoilers <br /> <br /> Wow, END OF THE WORLD is the singularity destroyed cinematic experience <br /> <br /> Here's the full story :. Scientist receives messages from outer space (a la INDEPENDENCE DAY). Reports say things like massive disaster should occur, and then later a scientist hears on the radio that a huge earthquake occurred only in China. He begins to think that the messages must have something to do with the disasters around the world, so he tries to find out who is to receive messages (and which is also sending messages to the space). He and his wife eventually realize that the messages come from the monastery. They visit him. Everything looks normal, including a priest played by Christopher Lee bored. But the scientist firmly and truly believes that the messages are coming from and going to this monastery. So he and his wife secretly return to the monastery, where they are caught snooping around aliens, disguised as priests and nuns. They are held against their will, and the foreigner plays Lee makes a scientist, to get what they need in order for them to return to their planet. Once a foreigner to get a special item, all the aliens depart one by one to their home planet at some tacky looking transporter platform. Or, being the last strangers left, says the couple, that the earth will be destroyed due to some solutions hockey aliens. He goes to the transporters, and he left. Couple looking at the monitors, which show footage of natural disasters that are happening around the world, decided to follow the aliens. Because the earth is doomed, the couple did not see the point of staying behind, so they go to the transporters and disappear. The last frame of the movie papier-mache Earth exploding. End. <br /> <br /> That's it. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a boring film of my life. This is the crumbling film that I have ever experienced. The scientist and his wife are two of the worst characters or characters ever put on screen. They do not care about anything. They see the earth distress on the monitors and decide "what the heck, who needs to land one way or another?" They did not even try to stop them or do something to make things better. This kind of history might have worked if the film was an overwhelming sense of doom to all, but the action and the atmosphere does not exist. The actors and the people behind this stupid traffic going through its paces, so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards if they came out and went back to work. I was not expecting much from this movie, because it is a production of Charles Band, but I did not expect it would be so bad. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee once asked what his worst film he has ever made, and he mentioned the invasion Starship. Well, I'm sorry, but Chris Starship invasion was actually stupid fun. Starship invasion scary but very exciting. END OF THE WORLD is much, much, much worse in all: is this dull and inert, with no entertainment value whatsoever.
