I happen to be the director's nephew. It took me years to get my hands on a copy of this film, and I can confirm that this is really one of the worst films of all time. My uncle did not even have a copy of the longer (I asked). I have desired it up. <br /> <br /> Currently, the average rating of the film is 1.9 / 10 How can I say that he should put it somewhere in the mid-30s in the IMDb Â«bottom 100 ', however, only 206 votes, it It has not yet been established. <br /> <br /> It's sad that the film does not even get the respect of the bottom 100 titles. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I give a copy of the film a family member this year on holiday gifts. Best / Worst gift ever?
