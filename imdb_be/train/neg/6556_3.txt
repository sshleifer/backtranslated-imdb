I bought it on DVD for my brother, who is a big fan of Michelle Pfeiffer. I decided to see it myself at the beginning of this week. <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting part, which contains two completely separate storylines. Section with Michelle Pfeiffer was much more interesting of the two. It plays a rising Hollywood actress, who had a lot of short unfulfilling relationships. She literally bumps into Brian Kerwin (regular married man with children) after driving his car into the back of it. After initially hostile to each other, he offers to take her home, when she no longer feels comfortable ride. Romance develops ultimately leads to tragedy when his wife finds out. What happens in the end, I was not ready to walk but slowly, and the current direction of TV accepts any drama to the scene. <br /> <br /> Another section includes the old studio boss played by Darren McGavin. This section actually has a better shot from Kenneth MacMillan, Chiles, Steven Bauer, and Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio boss, but in the end, when he asked to retire, they realize that their career will not be is now nowhere. <br /> <br /> It takes time, but it's not all that interesting, and I'm glad it was not bought for me. I do not advocate Michelle Pffeifer, but it was the truth, the only actor worth watching in this movie, and even in 1983 it was a decent actress. In general, though, if you are not a fan of her to avoid this as it is very routine.
