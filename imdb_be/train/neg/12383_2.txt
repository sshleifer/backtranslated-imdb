While some of the performances were well-Victoria Rowell, Barb, and two Italian friends come to mind the story was lame and derivative, the emphasis on racial background girlfriend was handled clumsily at best, and relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes, Sun like real people. I found myself wincing uncomfortable in many moments that were supposed to be funny. I can not understand why the local newspaper here in San Francisco, said it was a good movie, and I wonder who published a glowing review here on IMDb. Very disappointed in this film, and mad I actually went to the theater to see it, based on the wrong connecting to the Garden State, which is much funnier, more inventive and touching film than this. I must emphasize the emotional climax of the church, which was so wooden and by-the-numbers, which I'm almost to the end, and some in the audience really is. This was followed by a silly climax at the cemetery, I saw the next 10 minutes before it happened. I really do not like to mislead, to spend their money so aimlessly.
