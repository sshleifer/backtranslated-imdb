At first the film, it seemed, everything is fine, they are character profiles set ... the story seemed to be going in the right direction ... However, as the film progressed, it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of thing. ..or just a lot was edited out of the film. character identity has changed for the worse in the film. In addition, there seemed to be a lot of uncertain meaning - in other words - they were things in the movie that is not stuck the film itself. And the name ... No where in the movie is to put the name of the movie ... I think, title to preview .... The actors did well with what they did ..... if they had the best director and writer, maybe it would have worked better. But this is not the case. So now there is a new scary movie coming out this Friday .... My opinion! .... do not waste your time and money.
