I saw this film as a very young girl (I'm 27 now), and it scared me witless over the years. I had nightmares about every aspect of this film is how it was paid to music (obviously) violence. My parents are still arguing about who has allowed me to see it, and both of them say that they would never have allowed me to watch a movie. I think they only say that, knowing that I have such strong feelings about it; 0) I'm reading a book (of morbid curiosity and the fact that this is a classic), and it's really a great story. However, I do not think it should have been done in the cartoon. Ever. Well, maybe the children now would find it strange but it gave me nightmares for weeks, and I still have difficulty seeing rabbits, made in a similar way. It gives me some heart palpitations every time. Yah I'm a wimp, but I strongly recommend that any parent wants to show this film to my children, read them books instead, or look at it first to make sure that they approve of the content. Not everyone finds it as a concern, as I have done, but we are there; 0)
