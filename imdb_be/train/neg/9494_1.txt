The only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this film is that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, whose work I admire very much. Guides had absolutely no chemistry. Nya for a moment I could believe that there is something deeper than lust between them. History simply does not ring true. Add to that the high-sounding talk, tons of stereotypes, and incredibly slow plot, which basically leads to nowhere, and you've got yourself a real bitch. nude scenes keev Lenzen can be useful for those who are looking for some kind of indecent fare, but otherwise it is a colossal waste of time. My thoughts as I watched a movie that itwould have been better under the name "cheese".
