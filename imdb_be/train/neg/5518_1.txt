I did not see, and do not plan to see the movie, or any other, which includes Lindsay ...... if and to the "poor rich girl" is not straightens his life during the 2 years since her most recent arrest in July 2007 year <br /> <br /> in fact, I do not know anybody that went to see all of the latest movies Lindsay. I probably will submit in 2007 a high assessment of water in her film career until she removes her act. all recently publicized only prevents it from making a career in the movie, if she has any further desire to do s any more movies <br /> <br /> So far, the movie producers actively tried to Lindsay for his roles in their upcoming production. Now, Lindsay may have to go to the audition and actually compete for any role. It reputation is currently "poison" and quite possibly could have a negative impact on the sale of tickets at the box office of any film it is. <br /> <br /> Sooooo .... Now Lindsay is going to have to deal with the "do not want" .. ... it is going to be able to cope with this? <br /> <br /> I wonder if even Jay Leno will want to have Lindsay back on his TV show? <br /> <br /> All of the above is just my opinion. I have no inside information.
