I'm a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K, so I'm looking forward to see this episode. I will comment on the first film, this episode of MST3K. The recipe of this movie: take a talented actor, a rich and beautiful Shakespeare stuff, and a budget of $ 1:25. Mix well, then drain all life and movement, yet dull and lifeless. Serve cold in a large, simple stone pot. The film, I give 3 out of 10, because the actors at least deserve a little credit. Okay, now this episode MST3K. I admit that this is the first time I saw it, I fell asleep halfway through. I understand that it was a reaction to several other veiwers, as well. However, when I watched it a second time, I realized that there are a number of smart links and good lines I missed the first time. The trick with this episode is: listen carefully! It will take a couple of reads to catch every line. Give him a second chance, and you'll see what I mean. MST3K Episode: 7 1/2 to 10.
