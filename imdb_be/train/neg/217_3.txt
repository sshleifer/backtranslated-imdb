This is a film that relies only on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to get it noticed.That it.The Dialogues helpless and sensuality with "sex scenes" absolutely absent.The action and dialogue is more suitable for high school students children, but the subject is intended for an adult . audience is gutless and shallow movie.It could be much better if he had a history, and more drama Oh, and besides, one more thing. why internal monologues so overly used makes it seem so cheap.All in? all uncomfortable film for Romanian cinema as well as for an adult audience, which is trying to see it.I know the means are not sufficient, but it is not always a reason for a movie like this one spanking does.And please start using some good actors in films and stop the disposal of the musicians (Tudor ChirilÄƒ) - they can not act!
