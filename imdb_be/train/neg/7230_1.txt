I love fantasy, I'm fascinated by the Egyptian mythology, and I appreciate the digital animation. I thought that the film, which combines three of these will be at least enjoyable. I could not have been more wrong: the story (or actually the lack of it) was completely uninspired and lacking in imagination - while the idea is generally the largest component of any science fiction stories. Dialogue and action is worse than the average porn. Especially Krechman gives new meaning to the term "poor performance." Bad action would not be such a big problem if only "director" Bilan not take yourself so seriously; all the lines sound like they should be poetic, it looks like Bilan really thinks he made a piece of art here. Well, there is no art or poetry can be found in this part of the junk, but the quirkiness! This person should make sure to stick to comics, because it does not account for all possible as director. Worst of all is a terrible digital animation that is so unbearable that it actually turns out to watch this movie in a physically painful experience. The graphics look so fake, they even make the werewolves in "Van Helsing" look like live actors! And since half the characters CGI-animation, it is very problematic that the CGI-effects look so fake. If the Egyptian gods do exist, the Bilan dead guy, as they will no doubt take a terrible revenge for a funny way in which it reflects them in this catastrophic bad movie.
