How many more of those fake "everyday" films to be made? I hope not too much. <br /> <br /> Youth Victor Vargas very shy attempt of director Peter Solett on gathering the attention of Hollywood. There is nothing wrong with that in general. What's wrong with this film, in particular, is that it ignores the audience and field for every cliche in the book allegedly "sharp" Hollywood independent production. <br /> <br /> It should be "real", as the left camera shake "documentary style", except that a documentary would not shake the camera specially ... <br /> <br /> This "acute" so let's not waste time on film lighting. <br /> <br /> This is the "hip", so let children use swear words, like Al Pacino in Scarface ... <br /> <br /> and so on, and so on. All that remains very self-conscious attempt to impress Hollywood, that will not leave anyone indifferent outside the "rarefied" indie crowd, which seems to have a lot of recognition in every bad movie.
