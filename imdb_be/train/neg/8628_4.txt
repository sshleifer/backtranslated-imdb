May 7-year-old daughter loves it as Disney Execs ridiculous estimated that it will be. This is a problem with the «Air Buddies.» It is strictly a numbers-children's film, filled with carefully calculated wit, steam politically correct morality, and the pot enough humor to avoid the dreaded rating of G. As a parent, or even as a 10-year-old, you seen it all before, and done better before. Think of "101 Dalmatians Meets Home Alone" and you get the general idea. I am of the opinion that a good children's story is a good story, period. «Air Buddies», which is just as original as the recycled paper does not meet this standard. This is not the worst of the video your child can watch, but there megatons best.
