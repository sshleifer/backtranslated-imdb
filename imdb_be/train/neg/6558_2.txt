We shot five films in the New Year's Eve weekend and saw this first. All I can say is that there was no place to go, but after watching this one. It was pointless and vulgar. Harvey Keitel, the script must have been easy to write - just take two every three words a curse. Andy McDowell is surprisingly good in a roll of the character, but the film has nothing to recommend it.
