I read all the reviews here after watching this piece of cinematic garbage and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that someone has not thought it terribly unfunny installation was not the acme of humor in the 70s or even in some a different era! If it is not less than a set of funny sketch comedy * * I have ever seen, it will do until it comes. Half parody has been done (and much better) actions, such as Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I had to say that a good piece of animation, which lasts about 90 seconds, is the highlight of this film he is still not entirely get summing up only as a mindless and senseless waste is covered 75 minutes. Seminal comedy? Only in a world where the seed does mean sperm. Scatological humor? Only in a world where the slope actually cal. Previous jokes? Only if by this we mean that it is a guide on how NOT to do a comedy. Tits and bums and the odd beaver. Nice ... if you pubescent boy, at least one hand free and did not recognize that there is a Playboy. Give it a rest, because it was in the early 70s? No way. There was a sketch comedy rising for at least ten years ago. The only way that I could even forgive this film, even if made, when it was at gunpoint. Retro? Hardly. Essays about clowns subtly corrupting children may be the leading edge of in some circles (and it really can be funny), but it just comes off as a really very sad. What kept me going for the whole 75 minutes? Sheer belief that they can be kept really funny scene to the end. I gave the film a 1, because there is not below was not ... and I can only recommend it to insomnia or comatose patients ... or, perhaps, a man suffering from tetanus ... their jaw finally open in the fall sure.
