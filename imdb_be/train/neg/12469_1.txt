I rarely refuse a movie without seeing all the shows. This is especially true when I rented it on DVD. Syriana was one in which I give up. Halfway through, I turned it off in bored disgust. <br /> <br /> This film is disjointed, boring, confusing and unclear. Action was dry and without reliable pictures. The overall plot was good, but developed in a tasteless and boring manner that he could not understand my attention or interest. Multiple Suba portions often are not connected to each other and more like random stories than the actual connected portion. It is a pity, such a serious issue, and such great actors could create such a flop. I can not imagine this film that takes all candidature much less reward.
