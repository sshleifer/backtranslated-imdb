I was ahead of the release of the film, as any fan of the Broadway play. I was waiting for and read for months about the rewards performances reviews. I mean with the star power of Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover ... the film can not be less than 4 out of 4 stars, is not it? Wrong! I was definitely disappointed with the finished product. The film does not coincide with the hype it was given and the only saving graces were Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson. <br /> <br /> performance Brownesque James Eddie Murphy rescues the film only when he gets his performance a few lulls and Jennifer Hudson makes you pay attention every time she is on screen. Her rendition of "And I say to you," was the only time I felt that the hype was deserved. You cringed when she begged her not good for a man to allow her to stay in the band and in his life. As many observers have stated that it steals the film from more experienced actors and deserves all the praise it gets for this performance. Anika Noni Rose is also a strong presence with a loud voice and comedic talent. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx and Beyonce, on the other hand, cruised through their performances. Fox cast for this film seemed preceding his unusual performance "Ray" and Beyonce was on the way to enhanced shooting a photo or video recording on the tape, which creates and shimmy their way through the movie. Her performance was not strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in the film. <br /> <br /> The film was too bloated, 30 minutes and 1 song (solo Beyonce Jamie Foxx "heart"). too long <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, Washington
