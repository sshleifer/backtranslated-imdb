Neat room. Very surreal. What I learned from this movie is that speeding wildly out of control, to go at the weekend cabin may not be the best idea in the end. I loved how comfortable Bill rolls out of the car and down the slope, with no injuries at all! Unfortunately, the same can be said about his gal. Yes, and the police never seemed to find a car or track the owner of the sunken ship. <br /> <br /> Many pulled out of scenes, including a simple stripper (still have nightmares of the scene). The poor guy and his assistant lousy useless hand. I admit, I was intrigued to see that the mysterious "thing" behind the door, but when he came, I just laughed. HA HA HA !! She really seemed sadistically evil spawn. Personally, I would very much like a new body after a traumatic experience like this!
