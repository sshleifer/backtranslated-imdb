One star. This is all that this movie deserves. I have not felt this disappointed in watching the film, not to mention the documentary in a while. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the series «Walking With ...", including Nigel Marvin is a spin-off for all of them meet more joyful informative information. And although the subject of primitive man has never interested me almost as much the same as other prehistoric creatures, the topic is still unique and interesting to explore. after reviewing all of the other documents in the series, I thought that I need to be convinced of this, as well, especially after seeing the relatively good reviews elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Well, for those of you who put a good review of this item on the dock ... about you thinking?! lol. <br /> <br /> While the information that they were able to pass it was interesting, the presentation could not be in any other way possible. It was a terrible stream, was incredibly focused that he tried say (information omelet, and sometimes from the place), dire consequences (which includes several moments CGI and especially make-up), and abusing MTV-style camera effects. <br /> <br /> Speaking of makeup, one reviewer here referred to as the funniest scene was when the cave came across this giant monkey, and she looks like a 70th-people in the Coast horror movie, well, there are many things that just as people were depicting a monkey man looked ridiculous and funny acting. None of this did not help the terrible camera position and composition. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is, none of them is not specified in an interesting and dynamic way, looks remotely real. He does not even look like it was taken seriously. In addition, there was no emotional impact that a series of predecessors had. Remember the scene in "Walking with Dinosaurs" about the fate of Ornithochirus (sp?)? This episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time I watch it. It is this kind of interaction with the subject, which lacks most of all here. If you are more involved in the subject and his own personal history, even one that is just speculation, you care more about the facts surrounding it. <br /> <br /> Only the continued commitment of these products are good enough story (at least in the version I saw BBC) and music. Otherwise, do not bother even rent this if you want to have a good laugh (which I often, but, as a rule, should be hilly eyes). This does not belong on the shelf with other «Walking With ...» documents. <br /> <br /> And it makes sense to know that this document does not or are directly related to the same people who made others in the series? Hmmm ...
