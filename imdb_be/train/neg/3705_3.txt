I like Chris Rock, but I feel that he is lost in the film. rework the idea of ​​Heaven Can Wait is fine, but the filmmakers followed the story of the turkey too close. If Eddie Murphy rewrote Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he again made them completely - so they became Murphy movies / vehicles, not just cool remakes. That's why they were successful. When Chris did the same thing, it might be much better than the movie. A few laughs that come when he does his routine of standing - so he might as well have made the concert film. It also would be a lot funnier if a white man, he inhabits the body was a truck driver or a mountaineer. So why Hollywood continues to make garbage like this? Because people go to see it - because they, like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us the best movies! Nha remake films that were not so good in the first place!
