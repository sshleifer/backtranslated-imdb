TV does influence society ... just look at the wave of popularity CAPPUCCINO stores after this small little piece of work made its debut. In addition, the real people who look as good as these people do not have any problems. <br /> <br /> In addition, anyone really believe that these people can afford to live in a nice Manhattan loft with a view of what they do for a living? NBC just loves to insult the viewer's intelligence, even if they are only around Gump level. I know a man who makes $ 100,000 a year as a web designer, and lives in a small two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, which costs $ 2200 per month in rent. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a show called Phriends, where six ugly nobodies in dead-end jobs, who lives in an area where lousy sirens constantly moaning and someone gets mugged every week ... and then the master socket up rents. Now I would like to see.
