Dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and the killing and the result of the noise. Violent sexual Milligan for the most part improvised. Slightly better than home movies (like many Milligans films) is a trip to the 1960-style debauchery. Notable rich nudity and sex, this film is neither sexy nor terrible, play now more like weird. (Though obviously Â¨R rating). The film suffers from its uneven cast and cheapness of manufacture. (No one was ever sure where the money went to his films, because he was always broke). Its a bad bad movie is not worth seeing, but to completeist Milligan or because it got some good looking people fooled.
