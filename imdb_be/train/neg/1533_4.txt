I will not spend a lot of time or energy to this comment. I just want to add it, because all of the comments were so positive, I felt that I just had to let people know that not all are so excited, not to mention intellectually provoked by the attempt to create a fascinating philosophical cinematic mystery. Some of the scenes seemed promising, playing with visual size, but they could not accommodate all the rest. I felt like I was stoned for the first time again, with floor-philosophical conversations with other teens. <br /> <br /> What a useless attempt to raise the Dutch cinema to new heights. I prefer to look Jesus een Palestijn, without any claims and pious sense of humor, as well as raising questions about life and reality that we create for ourselves. <br /> <br /> Sun Gert de Graaff, Jean-Luc Godard, Tarkovsky or appearantly and never will be.
