Yes, it was purely an incredibly indulgent babble. We know that the French often have a distorted view of the United States, this Puritanism and attitudes toward sex. As an American (Hoosier), living in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these relationships. And while some of these biases may be true, none of the elements in the Midwest city depicted in this film really rang. A person who has never had sex, because he said in high school 20 years before that his penis is too big? Where in the world do you find that? Juke box in the bar, which plays only an old bluegrass? Town with maybe 16 people less than two hours drive from Chicago, but without the large gas station, Sun Tvs in the house, NO McDonalds, no children ... People that know each other intimate details are hard is not going along, as one big family that hates each other. Adult male plant whoopee cushions at the local caf√©, there is a farm, but did not collect, kill the guy, they do not like to all, and it seems to get away with it, and all with the same excitement? Freed a French girl who will screw the 17-year-old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity, too many flesh guy who comes from corn planting in the way of simple breathing in the wind of Illinois to help virginity that same 17-year-old rural boy? HELP! I am so confused and amazed the absurdity of this film, I did not express clearly how this is ridiculous. Go its primer A-to-Z on what to avoid. Gosh, I hope I did not spoil it for you!
