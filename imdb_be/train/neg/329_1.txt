Firstly: I bought it in the video store. Secondly, I watched it. Third: It was sad. Fourth, it was not funny. Fifth: Most lame antics. And last but not least: It's not just a bad movie, it's a bummer <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler, in spite of the disappointing and forgotten film .. I am sorry that, because it was his first film. Even if you are a big fan of Adam Sandler, do not bother to watch this movie. Instead, just take a video, board the yacht, and throw him overboard.
