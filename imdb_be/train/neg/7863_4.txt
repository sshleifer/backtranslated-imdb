THHE2 entertaining that you will be a lot of laugh and cringe and probably say, "Oh shit" and "get his face on the damn hole you're dumb ** SÂ» or things along those lines, but I do not know when it really worth seeing- I was very annoyed by the totality of the terrible war heroes, who do not seem to know the first thing about combat. <br /> <br /> Yes, there was more violence, blood, and above the amount of the body than the first, but I'm still debating whether I this is my feeling overrides throughout the film about how ridiculous it is (and is not a good absurdity like Dead or Alive festival). My time would be better spent watching a remake of AJA in the 5 th time. <br /> <br /> So for some laughter, or go for some gore, but do not go hoping to get out of it happy.
