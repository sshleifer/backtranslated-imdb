My roommates and I almost closed our TV on a large spit takes we did, watching the fun part of the 1970s, very important pseudo-Zen dreck. I read about this campfest for centuries and looked at my local late night television for years to find that elusive excrement. Several years ago, our local ABC affiliate was known for showing a cool click of his late-night weekend Flick (ie, "Frogs", "Night Lepus", etc.). Then one day it happened: at 1:40 am on a Saturday night (more than 5 years ago) there was! We had over 15 people, more and Flick did not disappoint! <br /> <br /> Look! Andy Griffith as the foolish and the most innocuous bad guy, as Jay Davidson «Stargate»! <br /> <br /> Look! William Shatner sports a lot of things on top of your head that barely resemble human hair (or anything organic for that matter). <br /> <br /> Listen! jaw droppingly stupid 1970th psychobabble that makes the "Chicken Soup for the Soul" sounds like BF Skinner <br /> <br /> Feel! . The contents of any decade that was better than in the 70 years <br /> <br /> For those who are still reading ... the story surrounds a bunch of middle-class middle level and - holes that suck them decided to head --- boss (Griffith) by attaching it on the cross races dessert, which covers California & Mexico. They all wear leather jacket, looking over Christopher Street than anything else. Along the way, they stop at the Cantina, drink, smoke joints (sight Robert "Mike Brady» Reed smoking jamb is the image that you will not soon forget), start a fight, attempt to rape, and just act like a bunch of suburban jack off middle class. Although I have a fine specimen, I WISH TV disguised the one to be released on video, the whole world can enjoy it soggy goofiness.
