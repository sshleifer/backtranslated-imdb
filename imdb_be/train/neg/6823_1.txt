I have to trust your instincts better: No expectations - no disappointment. Instead, however, I've been waiting to try out such a masterpiece as Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was severely disappointed. Powaqqatsi in my humble opinion, nothing more than a cheap attempt to cash in on the success of its iconic predecessor, and - art - it's not a failure. It turns out that some manufacturer has collected debris from Koyaanisqatsi, hurriedly threw it together, put it all in slow and got some pop artist under the pseudonym Philip Glass hastily throw together some banal background music, which is continuously repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the audience with clever slow and fast motion changes, Powaqqatsi one long sequence of routine images in slow motion (if you watch them on a VCR in Quick View mode, you'll see what I mean). What disappointed me the most, however, was the soundtrack of Philip Glass. I could not - and still can not - believe that these commercial-sounding drones such as New Age, which could be easily made up in one day every 14 years on the calculator Casio, were of the same composer, so brilliantly written emotional and well-synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. In general, a big waste of time! My advice: Forget the commercialism! Koyaanisqatsi clock again instead!
