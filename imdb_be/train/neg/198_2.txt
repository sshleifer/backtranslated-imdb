Burt Kennedy used to be a very good director, but you would never know it with this lumbering mess. Not only that, this film looks cheap, cheap - most of the battle scenes filmed with much higher, «The Last Command» in 1955, and that the images taken 32 years ago, looks more modern than anything in this picture. Several scenes were actually shot for this film to disorganize, confused and incompetent, looking just as bad as the rest of the image. It has a look and a bad student film (and the budget does not seem to be much more). It moves like molasses, which operates for the most part any more ham-top or under the upper coma - although Raul Julia comes off better than most of the rest of the cast - and it's crowded annoying historical inaccuracies. In addition, it is too long. If you are going to make a boring film, do it for an hour or so to get it over with - do not stretch it for three hours, as it does. If you want to see a good film about the Alamo, check the version of John Wayne in 1960 or even in 1955, the film from which the film stole his scenes. Hard to believe that it took six manufacturers to make this film lousy. Skip it.
