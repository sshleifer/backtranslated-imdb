WARNING: The review contains spoilers Mild <br /> <br /> A few years ago I was able to see the first five films in the franchise, and plans to do a review of all Elm St. series. However, in just two years, and I find that I can not remember enough about them to do this ?? I believe that they might not make much of an impression. From what I remember, some of the extensions ?? Dream Warriors, in particular ?? not as bad as it is often made out, even though the original was not a classic. As a rule, the predictability of the room (when people are asleep they will kill in his sleep) defies narrative tension. But I can not remember much of the first five films, I know that they will never stretching the depths of the Dead Freddie. <br /> <br /> indication of how tired Freddy public at this time can be judged by the fact that the film was produced exclusively on the death of the character. The fact that the conclusion of the film does not even hide, but really the whole purpose of being the film goes on to show how vacant, soulless and cynical this company was. <br /> <br /> Taking morally dubious idea of ​​having child molesters as a charismatic villain, Dr. nya-way-chilling interpretation of Bon Englund, laughing. I always thought that the abuse victims Freddie teens were less focused on the characters than on the teenage audience that may someday see the scar. It's like crying with Englund "We know that this garbage ?? but you pay to see it, so who is the one laughing? "And I'm sure that the victims of child abuse will be puzzled to see so insensitive drawing their plight. Freddie was the appearance in films ever since its infancy? All he can do here are a few «haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr ?? Features ?? Features ?? HARS »and that is all. If this was the only Elm St. film you've ever seen, you would not get to know the character at all. Even the character of a death in his memoirs Englund plays it as a b-hiss pantomime villain of settling transatlantic (ie. Inflated, ridiculous and not very funny) irony. <br /> <br /> duty almost universally poor. Just look how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. Only the Kananga, Japhet Cat, retains its dignity. And if Ryazanov, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper will be, you can almost see the film can be seen sinking further into the mire. The script is also absolutely disgusting, almost completely unfounded. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map on which Noel Coward, Freddie cleverly written "You ** KED." When prompted on the map, by Carlos responds "well card says that we are ** KED." Who wrote the screenplay, Oscar Wilde? <br /> <br /> What about the scene where Carlos tortured Freddy, his hearing is amplified to painful levels? So Freddy torment him, threatening to release the pin ?? potentially fatal sound, given that all sounds are amplified. Ironically, the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him to watch out for him, seems to have no effect. "Nice to hear from you, Carlos," Freddie smiles, hoping some of the best lines come. It should also be noted that sleep sleep is not happening instaneously, so the time lost consciousness does not allow instant access to the world of Freddy. Although, as part of the narrative contains a computer game person and 3-D final story logic is not that high on the list of requirements. <br /> <br /> Teens headed actors, this time really is the ugly, dislikeable group in a number. Tracy (Leslie Ding) is the only one who gets to welcome Freddie of "F ** K shut up, man," and kick the scallops. And there was a ridiculous pop music is always one of your components? Dead Freddie. A lot of laughs. Quite a few scares. No interest. A lot of fun. <br /> <br />
