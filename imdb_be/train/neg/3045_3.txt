Believe it or not, I have my own copy of the DVD of the "movie", which I bought at Walgreens for a great big dollar. I'm still not sure if it was a buck well spent or wasted dollar foolish. <br /> <br /> Quite a strange costume and production design. Apparently a lot of thought and effort went into making them. Set design is very Mexican in styling. I liked them a lot. And Santa is impressive. One of the most spectacular in Santa moviedom. <br /> <br /> I believe that the original intent and purpose of this film was supposed to be something uplifting and fun for children audience. But, anyway, it gets quite crazy. In fact, I was stunned by how abnormal it is. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's English dub, which makes it seem so insane and weird. One of the reasons why I prefer to watch movies in the original language they have been made and the use of English subtitles dubbing often produces unintended strangeness. The boy voice at least duplicate the real voice of a child, in contrast to the women, pretending that children who have a tendency to sound very, very strange. <br /> <br /> Did you know that the demons in hell spend their free time doing ballet danced in their longjohns? You did not? Neither I, until I watched this movie. One learns something new every day. <br /> <br /> Is this movie really worth watching? Now it tossup. I can not in good conscience recommend it to anyone, as it is quite disturbing in his peculiar way. Nevertheless, its unintended strangeness that makes it worth watching. You decide what you are going to do. I do not know ... for me, it made me feel uncomfortable, seeing demons constantly makes Cutesy ballet moves. Now, that's just wrong ...
