Greetings again from the darkness. What happened to the great Barry Levinson? He sent two of my all-time favorites in the "Avalon" and "Diner". He had some great films, as well as ( «Rainman»), but always under the condition that something interesting ... until now. I think that the worst thing you can ever say about comedy, it's boring. "Envy" is the definition of irritation. Never a big fan of pure slapstick ( "Dumb and Dumber"), I was just shocked at how god-awful this film. There may be 2 chuckling the whole thing - if you can pay attention that long. The best part of the movie is the title song of the town Redbone sound-like. If the film has been written and songs, it would be tolerable. Rachel Weisz wonderful actress, and I understand that all they want to do comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world is one exposes weakness. SNL cast members Amy Poehler it is usually on top of her role as trailer park trash turned into a princess. Disaster movie Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first work together switched flashing some promise, but after that their chemistry is disappearing because of bad script. This scenario, as most of the ideas of the character Jack Black - not a bad idea, but no hope of success.
