I really do not understand how people have made this movie and thought it was worth all the work they put into it. Even more mysteriously, those who watched this movie without feeling cheated out of 88 minutes to do something of value, for example, cleaning under the sofa or reading Leviticus. <br /> <br /> First of all, of course, they might have found 2 real Irishman, and some pretty woman, that could deliver their lines better than thrown Haggard porn stars permeate the film. Of course, gore work- but oddly enough, it's not so worried about how you would think, to see the bodies pulled out of the hot (above) pornstar dense bodies left and right. Perhaps that has something to do with the fact that after their monstrous inhuman action you just want them to die in pain <br /> <br /> So if you do not care at all about the following :. <br /> <br /> - .. not acting (.. Seriously, all I have not seen it before sucking each sucked) <br /> <br /> -plot (some crappy horror movies remotely linear, or at least, strange This film does not make sense if you're not thugs, as the authors were obviously). <br /> <br /> - Topic (Nothing to learn from this film nothing to be afraid of in bed at night, do not contemplate or grasp or explain to others.). <br /> <br /> - Soundtrack (Shit, shit, shit music as normal and boring as a scenario.). <br /> <br /> - scenery (. It may be the saving grace of this film, but there is nothing nice here ... even the stones are not fake) <br /> <br /> So, yes .. If you do not care about it, and you're just a horny teen with a bad taste in music and "women", this film is for you. Positive Feedback: interesting cinematography at times, to spend on other items. Very realistic gore; again, to no avail. But bowel classic scene. I agree with the mutant evisceration solves the problem of false accent.
