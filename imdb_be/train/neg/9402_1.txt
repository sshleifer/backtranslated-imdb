Why this film was made? Even bearing in mind the generous tax breaks that Australian investors were given the film may not be impossible to explain this film being given the go-ahead. For goodness sakes, the actors cast in this film Aussie celebrity b-class (rather than actors, people like John Michael «Hollywood» Howson, the original drummer from the band in Hey Hey Its Saturday, and the voice-over guy in the Countdown. But saying that it is still very watchable as long as you give it the attention it deserves brain :. Neither scenario is bad (even for horror to Admit class) and acting and film quality is worse. often it looks as if it were a house cinema but even a home movie is "realism". Any interested in the Australian movie, please, for the sake of a pleasure ve to God, pretends that this film never made.
