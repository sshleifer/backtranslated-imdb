Incredibly stupid, excessive and offensive closing up -series "Nightmare on elm street"! Part 6 so incompetent that it looks like the director Talal deliberately wanted to turn the original Wes Craven's room into one big bad and tasteless joke. It is not just the worst entry in the saga «Elm Street»; it is also one of the most uncomfortable horror films ever, and it's quite insulting proponent of the genre! History dumb, ridiculous characters drawings, the structure of the whole muddy and ?? most ?? special and visual effects resemble those of the cartoon Tom and Jerry. The sequence in which Freddy Krueger kills its victims are endless and very interesting. If we have to be petrified when talk turned Freddy Breckin Meyer in a video game character-and-paste it wrong around the walls of the house? History takes us back to Springwood and it seems that Freddy has suddenly middle-aged daughter. You would think that he would like to note that in one of his previous adventures, but not ?? There's only one teenager survived in Springwood and Kruger uses it to get in touch with his long-lost daughter. Another reason why it is so terribly final is quite illogical structure. John Doe Boy is introduced as the lead character, but then suddenly he dies, and the plot continues to rotate on two adults! How about that: Freddy Krueger, who has spent as many as five films not kill anything, except for teens, eventually gets beaten two adults to wear 3D-glasses! Kind of like the ruins of the whole matter of fact, is not it? As I understand it, "A Nightmare on Elm Street" was always terribly overrated series, but still, even the weakest elements do not have at least some redeeming elements. "Dead Freddie", however, is simply unbearable, and no one should spend his / her precious time to view it.
