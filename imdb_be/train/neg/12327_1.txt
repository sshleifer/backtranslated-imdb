The previous reviewer has said that the film is not so bad. What?!?!?! The film celebrates the abuse of children. Yes, but Christel was naked in it, so let's give it a 5 out of 10 stars. Why not the full 10? Since filmography was "excruciating" child looks shocked were "unrealistic" and a thick one was "annoying." Nowhere in the review does not make any reviewer to express outrage that American cinema in 1981 showed the baby scene who has sex with an adult woman. I happened to catch the steaming loaf of film while staying in a hotel that was Showtime. For me, even if each acted thick storm and was worthy of an Oscar, I would still have to give the film only one star. What TV Hessman Howard starred in the film at the same time, when he appeared in WKRP particularly funny. But do not take my word for it!
