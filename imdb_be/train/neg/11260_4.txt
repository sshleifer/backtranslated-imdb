This film should be called "Plan 9 from Joseph Smith." I think that it is underestimated strangeness. playwright seems to read Ehrlich in the "population bomb (1968)," and to create a musical response tailor-made for the Mormons. the whole essence of the game is that having as many children as you can is a part of the "heavenly father" plan (god) . and all that stands in the way to have more children, it is very bad. get it? <br /> <br /> this version was filmed in 1989, which is confusing. this Utah, so it looks like 1983 the play was written in 1973, and, of course, theology is a part of the 1840s, part of the Battlestar Galactica. some actions occur and the earth, and some in the "pre-existence, aimless romper room, where the children are waiting for annoying to their bodies so they could come down, try not to close the door on a missionary, losing their shot at the glory of heaven. <br /> <br /> This so unnatural as they come, but do not let the poor stage spoil its assessment for that of the Mormon insane universe where the "cool kids" are just population control (supposedly) consulting their parents, so as not to have any more children !! have large families were, at the time the play was written, a cultural norm in the LDS community, and more importantly, is seen as part of God's plan. Church has since made 180, and made family planning choice of parents and families with many children much less a cultural norm nowadays. make all doctrinal movie room for modern Mormons controversial! <br /> <br /> ahhh, but it is really only as good as the music. there are some catchy melodies that are simply not allow this film to die the death of the 1970s it was previously assigned. brother and sister sing some songs about love for each other, which makes you wonder if maybe something else is going on there --wink. and hard, cold children make new low on the block look metallic. so Greetings all! gather the family around, make some jelly-O shooters and enjoy the show! <br /> <br />
