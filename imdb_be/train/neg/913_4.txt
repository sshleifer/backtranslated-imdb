Okay, now, let's see. What was funny in the first film? I know people with funny accents, people fall into the water, stupid boat accident and funny comments between the two teams. In this film, they are twisted accent piece to the maximum, to no good. Whole lot of people fall into the water for undetermined reasons, to no good. Boatcrash, check. Funny comments between these two teams, they tried, but failed. In addition, there may also be the person they are following in this film. This film should be about what is happening on the water rather than on land. I am sorry to say that it is too far from each other funny details and sponsors film exploited to the maximum. Nothing good. Overall, I give it four out of ten, as it has some funny parts.
