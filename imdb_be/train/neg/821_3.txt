Stanley Kramer sends a gunman in and out of two key elements: action and thrill. Domino Principle features Gene Hackman as the convict emerged from prison to carry out a mysterious task. Widmark, Edward Albert, and Eli Wallach are its operatives --- they allegedly work for the government, but, like most of the storyline of the film, is never clear. The taxi driver asks a lot of questions that were never answered, so that the film does not go absolutely nowhere. While it tends to be like Night Moves and parallax view, DOMINO PRINCIPLE confusing ambiguity and mystery with an error and boredom. The film is very well photographed, but even that works against him. Kramer's direction lacks any style. This film is very sunny! <br /> <br /> action perfectly with Hackman prove that it is largely unable to be bad. Widmark and Wall are respectively backward and Albert are well matched as the waiter hard WIDMARK in. Even the usually unpleasant Mickey Rooney is quite good as the sidekick in Hackman. One strange thing, though, is the casting of Candice Bergen as a wife in Hackman. We were told that she had made in prison, and she seems to be trying to put on some southern dialect. The idea of ​​Kramer make it seem trailer trash to her to wear an ugly brown wig. This role is best suited to Valerie Perrine and Susan Tyrell.
