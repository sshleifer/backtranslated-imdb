Every year I watch hundreds of films, including many low-budget amateur contamination directly to DVD, that no one in their right mind would ever want to see. I have seen thousands of movies at one time, many wonderful, many people forget. Zombie Nation I will remember forever, as one of the most hopelessly ridiculous horror film "" I've never seen ?? in fact, I still have not moved away from the experience of seeing it. <br /> <br /> The day after, it seems a strange dream. Do I see what I thought I saw? Why do the police work out of the warehouse? Is the bait priestesses do recommend that "zombie" eating cheeseburgers? Is this safe? Is this safe? Is this safe? <br /> <br /> I would not recommend Zombie Nation, if you want to see the "good" movie and nor I would recommend it as a "so bad its good. However, if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably most indefensibly horrible movie ever ?? it to you. Now, when someone asks me what the worst movie I have ever seen, and I will speak Zombie Nation. <br /> <br /> Seriously ?? I think it's more a crime to make a boring film than bad, and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for the production of a film that really stuns you with its lack of talent. He's Actually Ed Wood Jr. of the digital age, and I, for one, can not wait to see if he makes another film as inappropriate consistently as this one.
