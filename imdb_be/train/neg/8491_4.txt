Despite some occasionally original touches like a "virtual sets", which provide the basis for Victorian interiors with the image of Ada Lovelace and her circle, this film falls short, and ultimately disappointing.

"The idea of ​​Hell" takes off for a short time when a lady Hell (Tilda Swinton); the camera lingers on her facial expressions, mannerisms, even making it appear to be translucent or invisible for a moment, apporting to dramatize scenes "virtual" rendering her Amy. <br /> <br /> straightforward biographical Ada Lovelace would cost, but this film, unfortunately, makes a hash of life as Lady Ada, and a computer scientist with modern (and it is widely drawn, feeble-minded one).
