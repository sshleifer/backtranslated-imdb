Since then, Christopher Lee dons a pair of punk sunglasses and trying to break into the punk rock club, you know you have a stinker on your hands! This film had potential. Under all the mud there are the remains of what could be processed into a decent movie, if not interesting. The final product is a true confusion, however. Besides gratuitous nudity and some very attractive women, Howling II wind being ridiculous reason for a horror movie. Christopher Lee gives him a nugget of confidence, but even he can not lift it above the level of crap. <br /> <br /> I've never seen any of the other films in this series, this critic will be forced to accept on face value, that is a real continuation of the events in the first part. We begin at the funeral of one of the characters from the original, and in the first ten minutes we find ourselves in Transylvania with a small group of heroes who are ready to fight the werewolf coven. The film is driven by quite well, and there are not too many dead zones. The action is; it just is not a good shot. One bright spot is the music of the punk band called Babel. Although their song is played quite often, it's pretty catchy. <br /> <br /> The problems associated with this film large quantities. Firstly, it is acting worse than abysmal. Christopher Lee is good enough, but that's where it ends. Two wire Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe is not enough just everything you want for these characters. Compilation is unsuccessful, editing unnecessary and amateurish direction. There are a couple of good special effects tricks, but the cheesy ones far outweighed their numbers. Sybil Danning nice to look at, but its performance is less than satisfactory action. Judd Omen looks the role he played, but his voice and acting unconvincing, to say the least. Much of the dialogue is in an incomprehensible language, which may or may not be Latin. <br /> <br /> I like the general idea of ​​the story. I always love stories true believers to battle with the invincible forces of evil. One scene, where a small group of good guys in the trek through the dark forest and knocking a bunch of werewolves even kind of exciting. View. Maybe more budget or better director could make the rest of the film a little more convincing. . 3 out of 10 stars <br /> <br /> hound <br /> <br /> Side. Note: this letter, the censors on youtube.com still have not taken down the ending credits Sybil Danning up from its top a few times, and Babel song is playing! Catch it while you can!
