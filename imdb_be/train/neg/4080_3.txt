It seems like one of those movies that we think we'd like to, but they did not. It seemed to be trying too hard to be "artsy". All flash, no content. It has some beautiful scenes, and all of them are nice to look at, but to maneuver them all together, and it becomes difficult just to sit through it. I rented it because of the glowing reviews on the video box, as well as the fact that I'm a big fan of Shakespeare, but I was very disappointed. I just found it a bit pretentious and sometimes sad.
