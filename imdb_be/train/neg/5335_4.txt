It was a time looooonnnggg, since I've seen this comedy, and I forgot how idiotic it is. I would put it easily in the bottom two or three of the very worst of Elvis Presley movies. Presley plays Joe White Cloud Blood Indian bull rider who returns home to Arizona and the broken hut, where his family and where his friends love to party all night long. His parents play Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado and his old Indian grandfather Thomas Gomez. None of these three do not offer anything substantial, comic or otherwise. The government has invested in cattle cattle family, but they do not grab the bull. Elvis gets to sing only a few songs are completely useless, and will be prosecuted young boy psycho-Gal and her gun-toting mother. It's just a real sloppy mess, and the old environment virtually stench of manure and make it much easier. The only thing that confuses me, however, is that Elvis really seem to have a good time in the film. Hard to believe, given that he was so upset jam making so many mediocre films.
