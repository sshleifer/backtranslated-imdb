The first half hour or I liked about this movie. Obvious budding romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was nice to watch, and I would like to see the inevitable happens between them. However, after the action has shifted to the groom's house, Ingrid, it's all completely collapsed. Instead of romance and charm, we see some parallel Dopey painfully characters appear, which destroy the film. boorish son of the groom and the military attach√© vies for attention maid looked ridiculous - such as the story of the old series Love Boat. Like a charm and elegance of the first part of the film may assign dopiness me. This film is an obvious attempt to Renoir, to regain the success he had with the game rules, as the film is very similar to when the action moves to the estate (as well as in other films). I was not a big fan of the game rules, but Elena and her MEN made me appreciate the skill and the nuances of the original film.
