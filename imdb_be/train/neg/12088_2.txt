I read reviews about this film, and they are usually pretty good, so I thought that I should see it. I'm a big fan of a Francophile and a feature film, but I think that this is another case in which the critic to do something "Arty" or "intellectual" in something it is not. I'll be blunt: it contains scenes of sexual iniquity, I never, never wanted to actually see. Obviously, the piano teacher has some serious psychological problems, but I really did not want to see them so clearly displayed. The film, in fact, disgusting. I mean, when I saw Requiem for a Dream, I was repulsed by the latter type of scenes with Jennifer Connelly, but it was not anywhere near the kind of disgust and revulsion I felt at the time of this film.
