There are times when the movie ends one wants to have a cover for the time spent only. It was one of those times. I almost gave up only 15 minutes left to suffer ... and I would like to ... <br /> <br /> The rate that a person goes from a straight laced, controlled life of one full spineless and irresponsible can never be so fast. <br /> <br /> with the end of the celebration in the end predictably Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) people and culture of privilege allows himself to be seduced by women, violence, and mental change agents. Of course, women are often understood by watching the talents of beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). But for a penny in for a pound of the drug aspect, violence and devotion to a person, it is simply impossible to understand met. <br /> <br /> To be honest, besides being able to look at Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film has no redeeming qualities. Save your money, save your time ... to do anything else ...
