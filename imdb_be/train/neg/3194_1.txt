I can not believe that this film was made recently, in 1984, he received some ridiculous action, not to mention one of the silliest plots ever. Who could ask fat Texas Sheriff Joe Don Baker, to escort the Italian he had been unlawfully arrested in Mexico back to Italy? Not to mention the fact that the title of the film does not tell you quite a bit of anything about it - in fact, we are talking about an ordinary name for a copycat action / cop movie I can think of <br /> <br /> EV Board I've only seen it on MST3K with Mike and the bots as a shield. As noted on the similarity of women's role in Elaine Seinfeld ( «None of them spongeworthy») and non-stop riff on Baker's weight. This film is probably not worse than "Mitchell," but Baker's reputation precedes it is determined here that if his name appears at the beginning of the film, Tom says: "I wish I was illiterate, so I would not read that" .
