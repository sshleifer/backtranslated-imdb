This is not one of those movies, it is one of the biggest pieces of the scar I have ever scene, the camera work is trying to be ostentatious, but it's actually just crap, it looks like the red shoes diaries, but without sex, the only the reason why I bought it, I wanted to try the DVD, and it was the cheapest I could find, perhaps, the worst buy in my life and could put your DVD ever, the soundtrack is really sticky, and most of the film from the endless repetitions of clips from the first two films, why someone wants to make a movie so badly as for me, if they really tried to make the original film and I'd rather be in this review, but they not only got the right to play material from the first two, and then edit it and repeat it in this film with and possibly under 1 3 of the original frame, which is about to film school students' standards, do not buy this film, the only entertainment of this DVD has to offer when you had to stick it in the microwave and watch the flashing lights! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTTER incredibly rubbish! 0/10, unless the voting system will allow it.
