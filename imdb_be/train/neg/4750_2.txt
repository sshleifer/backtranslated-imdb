I would give it a 2/10. <br /> <br /> I was very, very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The storyline was poorly developed, such as the incidents were too short and stubby, so morally was not clearly brought. I thought that Brenda Song has done an excellent job, but the tires Koyamada seemed heavy processing time of his role. I could see the need to put in the western elements in the show, but there are some parts where Chinese elements were needed too! Villain, for example. His appearance was like a robot, not something from the Chinese culture. The final and worst drawback was incorrect and distorted facts that are in the show. <br /> <br /> Others may point out that this "show a small" a, and therefore, there is no need for such a high standard. However, there are other Disney shows such as Mu Lan, who were much better in terms of the development of the story and presentation. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I feel that Disney movies have to be better understood and better plan. Good show is not enough only with a series of martial arts moves depend.
