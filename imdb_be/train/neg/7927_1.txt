This movie is awesome. I watched it the other day with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said that it was good, but I think it RULEZZZ! I mean, this is so cool. Ted V. Mikels so brave and smart. He made the film entirely unlike those scary Hollywood movies such as The Matrix and stop or My Mom Will Shoot. It might be better, though. I like ninjas and pirates. I also like the fact that a large claw that is funny man. I think he's the coolest guy with the Domino Pizza claymation Man. Not only that, this film look really cool as those unfocused my dad movies with my birthday when I was 6, but it tells a complex story with dozens of characters who seem to be totally unrelated, but they are all there in the end . It's genius, as fabric is woven to make things meet. I want Ted V. Mikels to make a sequel. But you need more foreigners. And pirates.
