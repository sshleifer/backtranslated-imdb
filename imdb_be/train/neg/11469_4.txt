ORCA is not entirely bad, but it really is not the finest hour of Richard Harris anything. As crazy Ahab, fisherman, Harris get in the game of death from vengeful killer after the murder of "wife" of a whale and the unborn child. Charlotte Rampling plays a whale expert who linked to Harris. She yells at him a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone. He does not listen, and somehow gets in the Arctic is battling a mad revenge whale. There are no special effects to speak of for what looks like a round mirror eye whale, except --- there are endless shots of Harris reflected in the eyes, so that the viewer realizes that the whale knew who he was. Because Derek is one of crewmen Harris has a particularly nasty run in with Orca, and most of the supporting cast, including Robert Carridine, Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn Sun rate is very good too.
