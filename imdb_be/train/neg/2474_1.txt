As I watched this movie, I thought it would be good to get good at any time ... I was wrong. The real best part of this movie was when it was finished. A complete waste of 92 minutes. All serious side best part was when Wendy finally showed up, that was the end, and you could not even see him that well. And the tail end was really kind of dumb as well. Too many sections in the film where you thought something was going to happen, but was let down. The worst part was more talk about the Wendigo was then Wendigo. For creatures to be so bad, you can not exactly tell him the film.
