the only scene that made me laugh, when those of Christopher Walken in it (crazy filmdirector) the rest of the movie was just boring.in the first hour or so really nothing happens.jokes, to be funny and not Zeta Jones Douglas really overacting.julia Roberts makes the chore of former ugly duck (yeah right!) from a neighbor (where I've seen this before?) who gets guy.for short.i really do not care what would happen to the main characters.if Cusack actually fell building in a suicide attempt film could be more interresting to watch.
