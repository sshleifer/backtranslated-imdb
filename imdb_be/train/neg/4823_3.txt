Lame story and two-dimensional scenario made the characters look like cardboard expression. Needless to say, this made it difficult to empathize with any of the characters, especially the groom; He looked and acted a caricature. In general, I think you could say that it was on a par with your typical TV drama. He uses just about every cliché in the book. Tortured classical musician who wants to break, and play salsa. Free-spirited fiancée engaged to "bean counter" the person she loves. I will not list them, otherwise it will be a spoiler, because I would have given the whole story. The dance was okay, but nothing special. I've seen worse. 3 stars for good music. The group was very tough. I saw it on YouTube. Fortunately, I did not pay good money to see it in the theater. I'm still a little shocked at how many great reviews of this film is smart.
