I really do not like this movie .... mostly because of the protagonists! They're both immature, selfish and self-centered people. They hurt all around them plays a silly game. The visual effects were good, but that they are good, when there are no characters that you communicate or storyline is interesting. I should be happy if these two people psycho FINALLY complete their love for each other? <br /> <br /> After watching this film, I thought, "This should be the # 1 smash in France?Â» ........ <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> < br /> As for the end: the tablecloth They both deserve each other! <br /> <br />
