This film is one of the worst movies in the history of made.How can play Jon Bon Jovi in ​​the film? He is a singer not an actor, what? Is it to kill vampires with his guitar? And what about the terrible conspiracy? My God, this movie really sucks. In the end, the queen of vampires play forever vampire Arly Jover (Blade), surrounded by a whole army of vampires, but when the "fantastic" Killer arrive only 4 were vampires !! What happened to the other 10-15 vampires? They run in the sun ??? And what about the "Grand Finally," when Bon Jovi headers with a gun ??? It really is "NO". The "Buffy" in 100 episodes of more than one vampire killed with a gun ??? It really is a lack of originality!
