I do not give a worry about the violence in a movie, or a huge amount of philosophy, symbolism and psychology. All this is very good to me, and the movie brings a lot taller than we are. There are beautiful pictures, especially of the lake and nature, good characters setting in the right direction. This film could be voted for as a good movie. Nevertheless, he is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons against making this film just disgusting. <br /> <br /> First of all, the violence used against living beings, to make this film. Not a movie violence, I'm talking about real violence. This violence alone, perhaps, could be justified, if not, and Thats the reason number two; Post film is not just a reflection of the directors twisted attitudes towards women. Not that we all do not have some real twists with women. (Accordingly, male). But the conclusion of the film is ruining everything. <br /> <br /> * spoiler * Our "hero" finally dies (from here own hand, if I remember correctly, I've seen this movie years ago, and it angered now the guy with the new film a witch, I'm aware well, I will not watch), and now even more clearly portrayed as a kind of natural demon, nature grows over it, in particular, its floor .. of course, this is a filmmaker who "kills" the female protagonist. Women have to die, especially when men are attracted to her sexuality. This seems to be the final conclusion. ** end spoiler * <br /> <br /> Well, well, everything, it might be good to me, when the director would have kept his gaze on himself. But the use of large photos, artsy direction of cruelty to living beings, so to speak, people are afraid of women, and men are cruel to women. That's just not enough. I knew that when I saw the film, it would be to get good critics for the "philosopher, Oriental and Art" and any approach. But this film just completely spoiled for me.
