Please someone stop Ben Stiller to act in any movie. Writing studio, features, write your local congressman even. I got more laughter going to the funeral, I watched ANY Stiller flick. Jack Black is trying to do something about the comedy of the disappearing dog shit, and Christopher Walken, perhaps on of the greatest actors of his generation, just looks embarrassed to be there. Stiller unfunny it myself, but now even with someone to save him, proving that he is way overrated as a comic. It is no wonder why this film is bad tank, and was available from movie theaters dollars after only a few weeks. I warn you, and you need to warn your friends, do not watch this movie, it's just awful, the worst part is Gothic (personally, I never thought I'd say), the worst plan 9, the Ishtar worst, worst then the Golden Child . Please, Hollywood, quit letting Ben Stiller in the film, it's not funny, that he is a god awful actor, and he will bring others with him. Next film took 1 because there are no negative points allowed, so while the board says one thing, I'll give it a zero.
