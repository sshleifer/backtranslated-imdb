A few weeks ago I read George Orwell's classic novel, 1984. I was fascinated with it and thought it was one of the best books I've read recently. So when I rented a DVD, I was intrigued to see how it measured up device. Unfortunately, the film does not even come close to creating an atmosphere or character development that Orwell so skillfully made in his book. The director seems to think that everyone watching the movie read the book, because he makes no attempt to show why the characters act and feel as they do. John Hurt, the main actor is wonderful all the way to the end, and almost does not make any acting before the end. We will never know what he does for a living, or why it is forbidden love, or what the political climate and why the protagonist wants to riot. This book can not be done justice in the form of a movie without proper presentation and explanation of the political system oppress the characters and the fact that those who are absent is the biggest drawback of this film. In addition, John Hurt was a terrible choice of casting, looking about 15 years older than the 39-year-old Winston he had to reflect. On a more positive note, however, the rest of the cast was well chosen. It's just too bad, they were placed in such a terrible film, adapted from the wrong lead actor. -Brian O.
