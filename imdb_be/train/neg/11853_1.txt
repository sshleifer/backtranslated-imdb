Let's face it, a romantic comedy to take it easy in comparison with dramatic films (just look at the nominations for the Oscar every year). But all the same, really good art form. Look at the "When Harry Met Sally," "Sleepless in Seattle" and classics like "Roman Holiday" and «It Happened One Night». I like a good sense of seeing two people are destined to find happiness. <br /> <br /> This film is trying to build something that resembles a romantic comedy. But no one believes that the romance between the main characters, and there's nothing funny to eliminate this disadvantage of the main. Modine is way past to be a leading man - especially romantic lead. I am sure that as an executive producer, he had the means - but not the common sense - to jump. And Gershon ... I see the possibility of a comic talent, but she had no script and poorly-developed character. And whose idea was an English accent? . Pointless <br /> <br /> Others have said, but I want to repeat: this story is poorly conceived, poorly executed; actors terribly miscast; and the characters, well, we just do not give a hoot about them. <br /> <br /> form of art, it is not. Go rent "crazy" again.
