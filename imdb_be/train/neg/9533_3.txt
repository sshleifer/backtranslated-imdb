The text of the prologue warns us that we must not allow evil to enter our home, but I think the more appropriate word "entropy". Good grief, what slobs the two small! <br /> <br /> George (Seymour Cassel), one in his office in San Francisco and his awful expensive house in Tiburon while his wife and child are away in San Diego. Two girls (Sondra Locke, as Jackson and Colin Camp, Donna) to knock on his door asking. Well, the rain, and they were trembling like two drenched helpless kittens, and they are not sure of the address they are looking for, and that on the one hand, and the other, George invites them to come and take part in its fire pizza. All three of them wind in the bath George and flows for about five minutes, mostly undifferentiated nudity in double exposure, triple exposure, exposure and quadruple dodekakuple exposure. They spend the night in the top three and the next morning the girl to fix his breakfast. But something got a little silly, because the guests George gobble it all down with your fingers and pour ketchup and syrup all over the sheets and - "You have, like an animal," George cries and tells them to get out. In his dreams. <br /> <br /> Now, do not get me wrong. Sondra Locke unusual beautiful young blonde with a cobalt-blue eyes and Colleen Camp bounces around like a Superball. You have to say that they breed 'Em powerful cute there in Shelbyville, Tennessee, where Locke comes from, and they multiply it with Bodacious tushes as well as we can not help but notice after the first five or ten minutes. <, Br /> <br /> But when girls go mad, so does the movie. The film is then washed in garish green light. It's time to put on make-up and make a shameful face of a gargoyle at myself in the mirror. They marrow courier, and then drown it, to be sure. They cashier storm and smash windows and furniture. They have one of those scenes in which two people sit across the table from each other, licking food, and then jump the bones to each other. <br /> <br /> And Georgie? They first make George unconscious with a mace (which does not contain anything that you can not find in this little red bottle of Tabasco sauce McIlheny in your kitchen cabinet), connect it, pour the flour and milk all over him, expose him psychotic court, put it through one of these thick-type floor-executions, slapping him around, dressed in strange costumes, then prance upon him and virtually destroyed his upper-middle-class home, and sent to the camper Ex Machina. <br /> <br /> As for the current, it is as if someone said to George, "The first act polite to the girls, and then act panicked after you tied." And to the girls: "The first act is a shy, not wanting impose on anyone, and then act crazy. "and that's all. <br /> <br /> pictures and place of work is right out of the 1970s porn film. I'm not sure which implies a complete lack of skill. It takes effort and talent to transform San Francisco's ugly. The number gives us two leitmotifs. Georgi some pop tune with lyrics of "Be Free" and "subjects". Jackson and Donna is catchy Rinky-tink thing called «My Good Old Dad.» <br /> <br /> I approve of the moral lesson of the story, though. There are some things that you should just not be, despite what they may look like a lot of fun at first. All very informative.
