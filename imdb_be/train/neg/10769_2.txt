I found on a shelf while housesitting and boring. How can people possibly give it to 10? It's not just that he must be a good feeling for the redemption of the film (I think) because it does not work at this level, too. Weak plot, bad dialogue, terrible acts; there's just nothing there. Harvey Keitel is decent, but does not have anything to work with, and Bridget Fonda, and especially Zhonaton nis just awful. Progression portion (particularly the relationship between Byron and Ashley) has no meaning. It seems that the authors wanted the story to go in a certain way, and it did not actually write in the necessary bits to make it flow. It's only a half hour, but it is 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back.
