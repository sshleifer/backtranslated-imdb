The only reason I even watched it, because I found it in my local library (and will distribute them mercilessly for embezzlement of public funds on it), and, despite the abundance of tits and ass, it does not take much time to understand that the fast forward button has been my friend. Terrible direction, pedestrian camerawork, from time to time bad to almost-tolerable actions, chintzy effects, and one of the worst scenarios, I had the displeasure to see brought to life (such as it was, badly mutilated and disfigured) in a long, long time. Best laugh is actually derived from "Making of ..." a short film in which the poor intrigues associated with this HDV mess attempt to justify their clumsy efforts, as if they were working on something special, not something that will not be completely forgotten next week. Wait! because once someone lured Tippy "Birds" Hedren, all people have to do a cameo, along with Kane "Friday the 13th" Hodder exception! As it happens, I'll never know, and to be honest, I do not really care. Look at your own risk, and do not say you were not warned. it's shooting on his pretentious, cowardly worst. He gets a 2 from me for having some pretty naked woman, and even then, only led- bit.
