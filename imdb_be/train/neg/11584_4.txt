About twenty minutes into the movie, I was bored. Simply put, these characters were pretty boring. Sometimes something nice will happen, but then it will slow down again. Fortunately, my patience is finally rewarded and the ending of this movie was not bad. However, it was not in any case well enough to justify sitting in the first ninety minutes. Thus, I would say that the movie was mediocre in general and taking all the talent in the cast in mind, I would call it a disappointment.
