... there is no one to watch the movie. My husband and I went to see him last night. This is just a small theater, but there is usually a decent amount of people there. Not this time! My husband and I were the only people watching Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why. <br /> <br /> The film was far from one of the worst I have ever seen. Yes, CG was good, but it was. Action script and dialogue, directing, editing, etc. God-awful! Since we were alone in the room, we felt free to talk during the movie. That is, we were talking about how bad it was, it reminded us of the powerful Morphin Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal Combat and Lord of the Rings. It was as we expected to see Rita and Lord Zed drawing commanders of the army of Sauron. <br /> <br /> These creatures were funny. You can not just enter the legions of Dean / dragon / lizard thing loaded down with guns without explanation. Lord of the rings has a wide range of characters, but it introduces and develops them for more than 3 movies, not in an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> Jumps horrible scene. I fell asleep during the movie, but despite the fact that it was too simple plot, I found that got lost in the plot holes. <br /> <br /> characters were Caucasian Americans, but spoke almost with broken English due to poorly written dialogue in the script. <br /> <br /> The final scene, which could redeem some value ... the movie failed. Ethan was not crying when Sarah died ... But he did not know her very long in this life anyway. He did not seem too upset to stay in the "Mordor" not knowing where he was or how to get back. We could not for the love of God to find out where he was and how he got there either, but if he was not upset, we should not be. <br /> <br /> Yes, and why is that spirit dress Sarah was wearing look like she borrowed from Queen Elizabeth? One more thing ... all 3 of the main characters were the epitome of the hero returned to finish the job. Sarah has completed its task and moves on to the afterlife. Jack does this, as well. Then why Ethan screwed? He was alone, without women, without a map / compass / helicopter to help him up. What should he do? Send smoke signals? And when he gets home, he just get back to work? He is the same grace was given to be killed from the film, which had the other characters. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time and money on this film. We only stayed til the end, because we paid for it, but as soon as the credits hit, we went out the door.
