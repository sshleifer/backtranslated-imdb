This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years !! You could accidentally disrupt the 5 man in the street, and they could do better than anyone else in the film. Absolute waste of time watching it. I only gave it 2 as I love terrible movies, but it's just garbage. Actions (and I use that term very weak) plaintively, someone please tell me what the 5 main characters in this are making their first movie ?? Do not waste your time watching this. The hostel was the best film in some way. I can not believe that someone spent money to do it, I hope for the sake of producers is only worth $ 50,000 to make - it looks like a school project made by children who have not got a clue. Perhaps it even make it in the movie ??
