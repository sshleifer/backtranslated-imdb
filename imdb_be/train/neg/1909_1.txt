One of the worst romantic comedy (in fact, the worst movies) I've ever seen. The boy (who works as a psychic phone!) I have to pretend to be gay to move to an apartment with the woman of his dreams. Hilarity will not follow. Boredom, light gay bashing, and terrible dialogue do. If you read Brad Meltzer and his bad dialogue, you'll enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Be reasonable. Avoid it. if you see it, to destroy the copy.
