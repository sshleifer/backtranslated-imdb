I like Robin Williams in his more serious roles (eg, Good Will Hunting, The Fisher King, The World According to the harpies). This is my favorite films of Robin Williams. But Seize the day, although it is well acted, it is one of the worst films I have ever seen, and definitely the worst film of Robin Williams (even worse than Death to Smoochy, Club Paradise, and Aladdin on Ice). <br /> <br /> Every good story will have its ups and downs. This film, however, one giant down. I do not need to feel-good Hollywood cheese-fest, but I have to have something more than 90 minutes of complete and utter hopelessness. This film reminds me of "Love Liza" (which is actually worse), because it seems that the only point of the film, to see how one man can fall. The answer? What is the difference.
