I rated this film 1, since the story is so incredibly unbelievable. Judge for yourself. Keep in mind, the next section is not only to give but also to spoil your appetite for watching a movie. <br /> <br /> computer virus developed by a frustrated nerd, sends the code via television screens and computer monitors. If the code - in the form of light - part of the eye, he can access the "electrical system" of your body. What it does is makes the cells of the body in the excretion of calcium. A few seconds after the infection the patient reaches his neck, develops tunnel vision, his skin turns white calcium, after which it falls, and his hand and the skull will crack in a cloud of chalk. <br /> <br /> This virus is very clever. If he finds that a blind computer expert tries to parse the code to Braille output device - operated hand - the device is set to a very high voltage, causing severe burning wounds on the scalp expert. The virus is also experiencing aggression against the remote control and the ATM keyboard. Fortunately, this can be stopped by throwing outdated desktop PCs in a rack and the electric chair nerd with his back to the broken computer and his feet in some spilled water. <br /> <br /> Oh, my God ...
