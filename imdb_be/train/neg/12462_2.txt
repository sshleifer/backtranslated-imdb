I saw this movie last night after a lot of good feedback from many sources. I would like to point out that if you're not willing to try and work continuously, who's who and what it all means that you will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to understand the role of the actors in this film, the film jumps from different stories and does not allow to really empathize with any of the roles. <br /> <br /> for political buff and those who are interested in corruption and other world governments, where the film is probably pretty good, but for the average observer cinema this film is awkward, very sad in places, and you will leave the theater confused and annoyed that you have paid the entrance fee. <br /> <br /> see if you are ready to focus 100% on every minute detail or policy you are interested in. I do not see, if you really like watching movies.
