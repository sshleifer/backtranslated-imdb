The old intellectual conversations about what he considers the art in cinema. You get your Hitchcock, Chaplin your, your Bergman and some other things, to the 80th. In order to conceal the fact that he has no idea what's going on in theaters these days, he throws in a matrix. <br /> <br /> But it's not just the same lame film-as-art speech again. This speech is reduced to a banal psychological legacy: the ego super-ego, the anal phase of sexual failure. <br /> <br /> This is a side dish of cheese effect Zizte edited into the movie it takes about. For someone who needs to know a lot about movies, his own there, cinematographicly saying :. Yeiks <br /> <br /> in order to put it in their own words Zizek - I saw 5 \ - \ 7 on the screen last night! or in the words of the great filmmaker: <br /> <br /> Mr. (Zizka), what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everything in this room is now dumber for having listened. I will reward you (two) points (only), and may God have mercy on the soul.
