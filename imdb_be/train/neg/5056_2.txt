*** SPOILERS *** Let's start with the "good" of the film - serviceable action on Cynthia and Richard Norton. The rest of the action awful (it did not help, brutal scenario). The worst culprit is the villain, Buntao, head of Asian crime syndicate (played by France Tambuan). I laughed my head off when he expressed his "rage" over the loss of a lot of money; inverse performance. Patrick Muldoon is not much better, and it "is a hostile takeover" line (the rest of the title of the film) was delivered about as bad as one would do it. There are no other main characters, but no other actor / actress did not put forward his / herself in this film. Then we come to the story. That should tell you everything you need to know: In the original, "The Rage and the Pride," Cynthia, who plays Chris The Fairchild, was a teacher in the city center. She is now C.I.A. agent (or was it some other government agency - I'm sorry, but this film was so bad that I can not even remember). Hmmm ... I can imagine that it C.I.A. The application process was. Interviewer: What previous experience do you have? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: Okay; You're Hired! I just give it a "2" because of some decent action and a good plot twist at the end (although we know that Tommy (Muldoon), a secret villain is caught).
