This film had a lot of promises, and the plot was quite interesting, but the actors, director and editor of the film is seriously let down. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for writers, it might be good. The acting is wooden, very few of believable characters. <br /> <br /> Who ever you edited it clear just learned some new editing techniques and would throw them all over the film. There are many quick "shout" edit almost every scene that is clearly meant to be symbolic, but in the end, how annoying. <br /> <br /> I wanted to love this movie and waited for it to be a decent solution to the imbalance, but unfortunately not, I was left feeling like I wasted my time, and the filmmakers spent their money.
