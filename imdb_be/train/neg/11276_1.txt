I will not waste my time to write anything much more about how every aspect of the film is indescribably bad. This was done in detail many times. "Story" started out as a very sad Cockney wide boy / gangster in the trunk room and quickly went down to the destruction of the decline. Anyone who pretends that they can see some of the hidden masterpiece in this terrible mess just kidding themselves. Now 7 or 8 years since I watched it during its one week run in the cinema before he was pulled, but it sticks in my head for what is easily the worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I just make these comments, and in fact the only reason I went to see the film, because of the fun fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as a second "heavy" in the pub stage. It was his hands, put a lighter to the side face Rhys Ifans at the bar in "Russia" (it was actually filmed at the former Butlins holiday camp on Barry Island). My brother has absolutely no acting experience at all - he recently joined the agency Extras', and it was the first part. Having seen the film, it appears that no one in it does not require any acting experience at all <br /> <br /> I remember, there were about 8 people in the whole movie. - and it's just a couple of days after he was released, I had never heard of another film that was so unpopular and disappeared so quickly - and rightly so. If you are thinking of renting this film on DVD, I would advise you instead put two pound coins in the fire until they are red hot, and then jamming them into their orbit. This is likely to be much less painful than watching a movie.
