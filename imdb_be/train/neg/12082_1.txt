Alas, poor Hamlet. I knew him, dear reader, and let me tell you, this version sucks! I do not know who all the people put up the money for this wreckage, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They took the classic game and turned it into the most sad melodrama can imagine. This version is quite literally so bad that not even the presence of a large theater, like Maximilian Schell starring can save it. only redemptive quality of this film is that it has made a great fodder for «MST3K»; Mike Servo and Crow had a lot of fun with it. <br /> <br /> But in any case, I believe that Shakespeare, if he was alive when they did this, did not want his name associated with it. This "Hamlet" is not even so bad that it's all good; it's just bad. Absolutely awful.
