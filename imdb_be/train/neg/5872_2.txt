I saw this for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson, thinking that they were buddy cops. Busey they are only in the initial stage, it does not show up again as long as 40 minutes of the film. Although he is awesome in every scene. Especially if he disguises himself as a blind tramp. <br /> <br /> What about this incredible film story. In the film, Fred Williamson tries to find out who is stalking and killing phone sex operators. At some point, I think it's Busey. But it turns out I'm just kind of. Busey is not a killer, but he was calling and harassing women on the phone. Why? I do not know. In any case it is associated with the killer, he just does it for fun, I suppose.
