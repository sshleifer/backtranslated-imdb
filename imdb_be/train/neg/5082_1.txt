It is very sad that Pintilie not prevent making movies. They even worse each time. Niki and Flo (2003) is a depressing stab at the camera. It is unfortunate that many of the films that are made every year in Romania, the worst of them are to be sent abroad (eg the Chicago International Film Festival). This film without a plot, action or script is a waste of time and money. Rating: 0.02 out of 10.
