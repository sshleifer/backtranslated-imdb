A group of people who are looking for aliens who come to Earth to eat crash lands on a planet of prehistoric animals instead of where they eat physcedelic fungi and act retarded. Seal with scenes from "Planet Dinosuars» and terrible jokes is definitely one to miss. Disgusting acts, as well, and while it's not as bad as «Chickboxer» (that film perhaps?) It's still pretty awful nasty things. This 90-minute runtime feels like an eternity, and you're likely to curse life so do yourself a huge favor and just move on, skip this crappy film, nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> filmmakers try to re-sell this piece of shit like MST3K style ridicule the film they did ten years ago, and it works to a certain extent, this is still nothing watchable though, Ariauna Albright hot, but Lilith Stabs has a rather unattractive voice, speaking. <, Br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Joke comments, 17 Behind the scenes featurette; 7 minutes in a black short film; Jessica Mills statements; Stills from the film gallery; and the original trailer
