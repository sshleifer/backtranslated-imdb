Here it is a great example of what not to do if you have a great idea. That is the problem? The concept of fresh and full of potential, but the script and its execution lacks any real substance. It should take you from the beginning, and then pull a little on your emotions so that you are interested and invested in the characters. This film is not what is needed to lift and support the mission, and here's why. Firstly, you do not really care about the characters, because they are not presented in a way that people can relate, I mean, it's not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it is suppose to be about normal people caught in a stressful situation . They are not credible in how they act and interact. Example: Jeffrey Combs as police on chewing gum, frowning and looking intense all the time so as to come here. I mean, that's what? He looks like he's on the toilet or something. I loved him in a re-animator, and the way he plays intense / neurotic, underestimated medical genius was right on the money. But not for this, he tries too hard to make up for a look so intense and at the edge, but still soft neurotic way, it is not natural, I'm surprised that he did not dislocate his jaw during filming. The film is basically on life support, he barely has a pulse, and it kept me waiting for something that would never come.
