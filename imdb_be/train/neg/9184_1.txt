F * ck Me! I've seen some incredibly horrible movies in my time, but this takes the p * ss! <br /> <br /> To be honest, I can not express in words how bad this film really is. In addition, a plot that actually does not exist, comical shit works in funny terrible zombie justification; You know that I could go on all day. Every detail in this film or stupid, pointless, crap or uncomfortable. I commend all those who want to watch this movie ... nya! <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to say, I have it on my desk. It is hidden right at the bottom of a huge pile of damn. I could not even give this horse sh * t an excuse for the film away. That's how bad it is.
