at the end of the follow-up 1973's "Walking Tall," continues the real life drama surrounding Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, but this installment plays like a lame TV commercial. After Swanson takes the lead with Joe Don Baker, but he is too soft for the part; He comes off as amble country singer with a bat instead of a guitar. Good supporting actors like Richard Zhekel, Luke Askew and Robert Docks end up with very little in common. I would give the film one star strictly on their good intentions, but the script is clear and lazy routine of heavy weight and production base. Followed in 1977 Â«Final Chapter-stepping" and the 1978 television movie "Real American Hero".
