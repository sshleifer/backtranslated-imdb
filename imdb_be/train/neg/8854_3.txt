Starz we had a free weekend, and I went to the station to see what happened next. This film Howling II: The acting was terrible, but the eye candy was great. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as mentioned above eye candy. I laughed a lot in a few scenes that I saw. <br /> <br /> My friends wonder why I do not want to go to a horror movie when they saw the film, they will know why. I would get thrown out for laughing so hard <br /> <br /> Just a couple of notes detail :. Reb Brown, who played Ben White played a captain in the American made for TV movie Marsha Brown Mick Jagger was the inspiration for the song «Brown Sugar» Mick has a wonderful taste in women for sure.
