Well, you'd be better if you plan to sit through this amateurish, soft, and Pokey flick about a middle-aged widowed mother, who has a bit more to do with her boyfriend or old teenage daughter than she would like. Located in Tunis, piddles mother in the apartment, gets restless and decides reluctantly (she just can not help yourself) to wear a suit and dance at a local theater. Meanwhile, her daughter takes dance lessons. The common denominator of the Tunisian drummer. This film is so full of filler, I watched a DVD on x2 and read the subtitles, fast forwarding through most of a very ordinary dance and take too much walking frames (they walk everywhere) and a longer walk and a bagpipes at x4 only to get at this sad, monotonous , low budget flick, which is how some got some pretty good critical applause. Go figure it out. (C)
