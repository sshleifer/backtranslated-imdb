Claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the movie: Too long face only the frames where most of the time to get a sense that the lower half of the film is absent (the screen is cut off), because, as appears to be the important steps that go, but you can not see them . There is in any case too much confusion in the film, so that the viewing angles make it worse and do not contribute to a cunning visual effect. <br /> <br /> I love the elaborate films and unconventional camera work. I can cope with deep and slow films. But this one is trying too hard to be something tricky and not in my hurt. <br /> <br /> Do not get attached to, any of the characters, because they are not developed well enough. In order to work the characters more necessary than a minute face shots, at least, with this set of scenarios + director + actors. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, some not so good either act due to the script and the director or because the actors. <br /> <br /> I'm going to stay away from the film as a writer-director Le You certainly in the future. <br /> <br /> What annoys film, even for someone who would be interested in that part of history, and for someone who has spent time in Shanghai.
