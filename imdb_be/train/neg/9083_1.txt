It was so awful. It was not fun to watch at all. Even the scene where the girl uses a vibrator, it's not even fun to watch this movie. I say again, the scene where the girl masturbating with a vibrator is not even fun to watch. Or maybe, if it was the only part of the movie that you watched, a woman on the couch using a vibrator. Maybe they were just released, that one scene in the theater can be, then the film will be enjoyable at a certain level. My advice, fast forward to the time, watch, rewind the film, watch it again, rewind, replay. Maybe you could enjoy for 2 hours so. This film is in line I spit on your grave and generation of doom in the category of the worst films I have ever seen.
