A funny sense of humor, some of which provide a flat, some decent action, some of which are quite brutal. This film is just as horrible, guaranteed to delight the 12-year-old boys, more than any other niche. <br /> <br /> The child actors in the film simply unfunny. If you make a family comedy, which tends to be a problem. Beverly D'Angelo rises above the material to give a funny and, dare I say, the human performance in the midst of mediocrity.
