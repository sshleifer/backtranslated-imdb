Grier stars as Coffy. She is a nurse who seeks revenge on drug dealers who got her sister hooked on bad character. Like any 70s movie of black actors, you can expect to see racist bad guys get their just desserts. <br /> <br /> There were estimates of these films made during the '70s, and they were really humiliating both black and white audiences alike. This is mainly due to the vicious racial hatred in these films, and degraded, stereotypical character. Especially female characters. <br /> <br /> Another common points between Coffy and other films of its type, include crude violence, corrupt cops, car chases, the generous wealth of nudity and sex-obsessed magnificent woman. Not to mention the urban ghettos inhabited by drug dealers, pimps, thugs and other criminal scum. <br /> <br /> Grier, was undeniable Queen 70 black actors heroines. It was great, being as hard as nails, and drop dead gorgeous. As in his other films, by Pam overshadows the other characters in Coffy. In fact, by Pam is so charismatic on the screen, that such unwatchable movies without her as the protagonist. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, you better see her other movies like Foxy Brown, or perhaps Friday Foster. These films are far less empty immorality than Coffy does. character Pam Coffy, humbles himself too much to get the bad guys. Pam characters in his other films, black actors, is no slouch as low as to take revenge, as did Coffy. <br /> <br /> I would say, just look Coffy, if you can not see any of the other films in Greer. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Pogo only talent as an actress, makes Coffy friendly viewing.
