I would leave the movie halfway, if I was not with the people who loved him. The film is based on real incidents, but it is on top of it did not feel real at all. I have some psychological background, to hang out with a lot of therapists, and of course, seriously crazy people, so it's not that I think that people like this do not exist. But in the film, the only character that seemed to consistently people were Augusten's father (as Alec Baldwin) and a young Augusten (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an intriguing diversion - very sexy with a wicked sense of humor). There were a few funny moments, but the overall tone of the film was dark, strange and disgusting. Which is a waste of an outstanding cast! As I watched them go through their twists and turns, I just felt like I was watching the actor's class. This was brought home for the loans, when several people were shown just sitting there, not action, not talk. Those few moments were more interesting than the previous 2:00.
