Well, what can we say about this disaster? I watched it because it was featured on the cable. I'm sorry for wasting your time, but at least I do not spend money. <br /> <br /> The creature is Cheesiest you can get! Please, you have to be very generous to not outraged Cheap Halloween costume. Well, there is also a manifestation of the terrible actions, F / X, and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is incredible, you can not get more than a pathetic scene. <br /> <br /> This is the worst thing you can get from direct to video movie. "Unknown Creature" makes the full moon PICTURES movies look as "Halloween." <br /> <br /> Avoid this one at any price, please. The only "positive" thing about this trash are sexy women.
