The film written by Charlie Higson, who previously made "The legendary» Fast Show and his own show on the basis of one of the Fast Show characters (Tony car sales people). He also wrote a book for children, James Bond. <br /> <br /> In fact, I see this only Gordon films that are based on the stories of HP Lovecraft, and each of them is amazing. Here Gordon is trying to do something different. Style completely "modern", which means a shaky camera, quickly and strangely sharp, cool chill-out music in the background. It works pretty well here, I think, but it is still meaningless and cheap. It often makes me think of the cameraman who nodding DV-camera to the actors / actresses and try to make the stylish steps in pictures (in the hope that something would come out of it is tolerable). Casting well and has all the atmosphere that is the result of a good guide. I think that the main character, a "zero" a young guy, very interesting in his «zeroness». The fat man is good too. And the guy who looks like Alec Baldwin, but he did not. But fairly quickly after the beginning of the film it is something not so interesting: In this case, I mean the endless line of scenes of sadism and disease. There are not many men in this film / story: It is absolutely pessimistic, and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless, and soon died. Needless to say, there is no humor somewhere. It is 140 long vomiting without any relief at any time. Anyway, Gordon remains for me one of the most interesting filmmakers who are active today, and I think that this film as an experiment, and as a rejection of it. Everyone has the experience to get lost sometimes, just to learn and find their way back. This may be most uninteresting and empty work Gordon.
