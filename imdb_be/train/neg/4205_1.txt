Alarmist so pitifully scenario that you think about yourself, why on earth did up and coming actor David Arquette agree to be in it. It should be one of the weakest areas I have ever seen, and no humor at all, it borders on the border tedious. He wobbles along with a nightmarish conclusion which seems to be happening only because the director bored and just wanted to wrap up quickly to get home for dinner. Stay away!.
