I would like to write about this story, but there was not. I would like to quote a couple of hard-hitting dialogues from the movie, but "Hinglish" fun only 5 minutes, after which it is oversupply. I would like to lose consciousness on the "hold-to-guess the unknown", but it was so predictable as ... um mm, the Yash Raj film (?). I would like to talk about the action of the edge off-site, but I do not like a lot of cartoons. <br /> <br /> * sigh * <br /> <br /> In general, this film is ideal for: 1. People are trying to suicide - I promise it will push you to the edge 2. bdsm - it the film is much more efficient than the barbed wire, Silas guy in the code of Da-Vinci was wearing. 3. People who are exploring alternative ways to the spread of terrorism - I swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in the mood to kill someone Cinema 4. Piraters: More power to them. If any movie deserves to have an audience to spend money to see - this is it. 5.Barnacles, most species of plankton and green algae - because almost all other living creatures require IQ factor is slightly larger than the one offered by the cinema. Afterthought: film director, obviously, is a species of its own. (And I hope to God that he is the only one of its kind..one enough) <br /> <br /> Things that could make it better movie: 1. Story 2. choreographer 3. script writer 4. stunt coordinator 5. history (I have already said that?) 6. a director - preferably one who is not mentally retarded (though even the one who was challenged could do a better job) 7. Anil Kapoor = bubonic plague - Avoid any price 8. law warning - "Observation of Yash Raj films is bad for your mental health» <br /> <br /> things that I liked about the film: 1. Kareena Kapoor - for obvious prichinam-. English subtitles - "Mera Dil Gaya CWC» becomes - "My heart is in the void», «Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya» turns into "Im a flirt, Im a lover, Im tramp» ..priceless <br. /> <br /> In short, Tashan me, it's like the opposite of a cube section - the cube is supposed to increase the IQ player, Tashan promises to lower IQ, and that .. in only 2.5 hours! Woot! <br /> <br /> * sigh * .. But that's just me. I might be wrong You've been warned.
