1940 - Visiting Lodz ghetto in Nazi-occupied Poland, German cameramen recorded with naive cooperation of the Jewish community, combined with archival footage, newsreel clips of the international, and excerpts from the related cultural films to reflect the Jews in the world as crooks and parasites. This "documentary" interprets Jewish life from the point of view of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. Open kinematic-unique expression of racial hatred. I personally believe that this film is terrible and very offensive. One can only hope that such a picture, as it will never reach the screen again.
