While I appreciated the film A 2 to display a complete lack of effort in an attempt to create a horror film as it was 10 to unintentionally funny scale. I could not understand what was going on in the film, or who were the people, but I do not care, because I knew that every scene will have something to make me cry with laughter. Dialogue as a minimum throughout the film, but I believe that it is because they started shooting without a script. The fact that the film does not have no story line is very versatile. It does not matter if you sit down and watch a movie from start to finish, or if you're watching it in fast you will be confused with pleasure. I particularly like the scene in which inmates took turns running outside to beat each other with sticks. I consider that the doctor refers to it as a treatment. Genius!
