This is the biggest piece of shit ever. It seems that they have spent more time, effort and money, making the DVD cover than they did in the actual movie. I really thought that the DVD has been switched with someone else's home porn, until I found one of the actors from the cover. This film looks like someone did it with a hundred bucks and video cameras, and they spent half of that in rats. Picture exactly clear, but at the very unfortunate lighting, cinematography, if you can call it that, production, acting, when in fact what they are doing, and the script when they were alone, makes this movie look worse than old porn. At least the old porn have a point. It looks like some members of PETA got together and decided to make a really alarming, meaningless PSA about animal rights and feelings. It's so not worth the money or time. It has nothing to do with the actual BTK serial killer another name of the murderer, and that some of the victims. The people who made this film should be glad that he is still not free, or he might come after them only to screw this movie so bad.
