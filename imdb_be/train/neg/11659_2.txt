I * loved * the original Scary Movie. I'm a big fan of parody- is my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor. Wayans boys seemed to understand this concept well in the original film, temporarily forgotten when creating a sequel. I think the Wayans family comic geniuses. Unfortunately, even geniuses make mistakes. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a promise. I liked «The Exorcist» parody, especially "Come out, we" gag. Now it Wayans quality material. But apart from that, I can only think of two other cases I laughed: 1) when Tori Spelling seduced in the middle of the night of the spirit, it becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him. At the same time, he said: "It was just a booty call !!" It was pretty funny. 2) "Save the Last Dance" parody, where the character of Cindy inadvertently knocks a girl practicing her new moves. But even short-lived giggles are not suitable for side-cleaved laughter first scary movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is pure trash, filled with cheap gags gross-out. Jokes from the first film, who were thin or realize increased and exaggerated. For example, in the Scary Movie I, I made some insinuations in mind that the character Ray is gay. It was fun. But, in Scary Movie II, the whole penis strangulation scene with Ray under the bed was intoxicating and incredibly unfunny. This picture film. Shock humor * alone * does not accept the film is very far away. This has been the trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> As far as it pains me to appreciate the film Wayans so low, that I should give it a 2 out of 10.
