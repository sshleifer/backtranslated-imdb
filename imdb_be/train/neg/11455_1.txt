Firstly, to give you some idea of ​​my taste in movies ... <br /> <br /> 2007 comedy I enjoyed: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades of Glory <br /> < br /> 2007 I hated comedies: Evan Almighty, Salomon brothers, Good Luck Chuck <br /> <br /> I should have followed my first instinct and excluded «Hot Rod» after I got on the 20th minute. I knew that by the time that the film does not make me laugh once. The script is absolutely brutal - I have no idea how it managed to crack the ugliness 6 to IMDb. Any one older than 10 years who use it must be some mental defective. <br /> <br /> It does not come close to anything with Will Farrell and it was clear that nothing Samberg can not be more than 5 to 10 minutes a sketch on YouTube or SNL. I do not know how they tied Ian McShane and Isla Fisher in making this movie ... they should have adequate grace or something. I went, knowing that it would be a silent film, but I thought it was at least funny. I do not so much as a smile. <br /> <br /> I do not usually comment on the movies on IMDb, but it was so awful, I just had to warn people. This is only the fourth film I saw that I was forced to vote for 1/10.
