You can not hold too much against it, knowing that it was done in four days, and I expect it will mannerisms anyway. (It's not all that campy in fact, except for Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter, who do not take seriously, the rest of the cast play it halfway right ;. Riley Smith exceptionally bad.) Funny story actually paid attention to that kind of shocked me; I assumed the whole purpose of an ultra-low-budget horror films was to meet the vile sexual fantasies, and not give a damn about the story, but they use a lot of words like "technology" and "physicality" in the script to get their point across. (While it is possible that this story is important only to explain why so few actors.) No one cares about this stupid story line, and the only things that are interesting in a film mocking cults and soft homoeroticisms core (not all that nervous). I would have enjoyed it more if there were only some random murder for no reason. The film is grainy, with TV-quality appearance and level of acting. There are some "erotic" scenes that are well - boys writhing in bed in his boxers, feeling; or being tied down and making faces during orgasm wine is poured on them - and some of them are kind of funny. And I liked the excavations in L. Ron Hubbard and the supposed irony of history of religious sects, narrated with intense gay connotations, but it still does not fit. 3/10
