I was intrigued to see how the little seen 2008 film somehow won an Oscar for the best film of 2009 and thus went to The Hurt Locker. Unfortunately, all I got was two hours invested grim confirmation that this film won the award purely for reasons beyond the screen. <br /> <br /> direction and visual style of the film, some of the weaknesses you will ever see. if he is not busy, being another Bourne Identity honoring horrible, annoying "rocking cam" visuals, it shows all the signs of the second course of the daytime soap opera in terms of lensing. <br /> <br /> «plot» is worn out, the characteristics of which is about as well-developed as it rejected the idea of ​​Beetle Bailey comic strip and dialogue - on when the film gives to the "minimalist" and for no apparent reason is one or two soldiers in a right chatterbox - some of the worst ever recorded. justice, the actors do their best in the circumstances, is simply not enough to hide how bad the project. <br /> <br /> the whole movie has a sense of it being conceived as a kind of "mockumentary" that broke up was devoid of humor and, thus, re-edited, as they could so as to pass it as a serious drama. <br /> <br /> When you spend two hours on the two o'clock they film you never go back, and two hours in vain, that you'll regret the rest of your life.
