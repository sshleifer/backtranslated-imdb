More mysterious film with some gratuitous horror elements thrown in; mediocre overall. <br /> <br /> It starts with a woman who has a nightmare in which her sex to get out of bed, go into the room of her child, who was crying, and kills him. She wakes up. Then that person dies in a hospital, spitting blood. His estranged daughter arrives, and he manages to contact her through her dreams (I think), and he wanted her to find out who killed him before his body was completely decomposed in the grave. <br /> <br /> There's not too much of a mystery as to who did it, or how; Most viewers will be calculated that long before disclosed. I'm not sure how he was killed did work <br /> <br /> Anyway, the horror elements are accessed through :. Bloody autopsy recurring dream man to kill a boy nightmare in which a plate of eggs turn into the eye, which are then cut, and a few shots of decomposed human, both in nightmares and in fact in his grave. <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised to see the dedication in the end of Fulci to Clive Barker! That's interesting.
