«Metamoprhis» history of brave young scientist, revered at a local college, we have investigated the financial providers for college. This forces him to take shortcuts in a typical bad Hollywood melodramatic fashion. <br /> <br /> My first thought then was this movie output. "Not good, but not bad for the early to mid eighties." Of course, I then realized that this was done in 1990, that almost propelled him to "4", but decided to leave it on the mediocre "5" that it is. <br /> <br /> «Metamorphis» making a few times, it seems that a good film is desperately trying to get out. to act, not stellar, basically competent. you can even see the occasional sparkle of modest quality. Stimulation is a big problem with the movie. Thinking I watched ninety minutes, I realized that I had just watched an hour. with etsyyalnyya effects are not stellar, but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around this weakness. <br /> <br /> lead, gently charismatic man, who appears to be trying to mixed channeling Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves, reminded me mainly the character of Matt Dillon in "Wild Things". the female character does the job OK, but does not distinguish itself in any way. There's a "naughty girl" role, and the actress is doing what it can with it, but it does not seem lot. There is a child actor, the director can not decide that it is gloomy, funny or simply weird. <br /> <br /> Going, as I said, this is the biggest problem with this film, before the final battle with the bad guy, that would make blush Ranger power. It's strange and inexplicable, to the final scene, which is supposed to be dramatic, but it's just fun, full of every bad trick cameras and replays that can be compressed about thirty seconds. HN <br /> <br /> decent edinovremennoga look at 'Mill Creek Chilling Movie package 50'. Nothing that's going to bring you back, and do not buy on their own.
