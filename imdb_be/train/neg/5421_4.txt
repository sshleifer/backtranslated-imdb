This is one of those topics, I can relate to a little more than most people, I hate noise and have no idea how those in large cities, especially in New York, how people get any sleep at all ! It amazes me that people can stand all the noise out there these days. The main plot of the film is that it makes for an interesting topic. It's too bad about it. Tim Robbbins well, although in a few scenes (especially with absolute supermodel looking Marguerite Leiveva) except that it does not seem to be really quite there. My greatest hope for this film is that casting agents will see absolutely stunning and talented actress to boot, Leviev. She does not have much in common, but it is a beautiful supermodel. Even if they try to make it to another neighbor. It makes me sad that people can be like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian in the world / is not repaid skills or talent to have more fame and fortune than the talented beauty. I'm not worried about much of this movie because the script is not very good, but I'm glad I got to see some new talent. I hope that the producers and directors think of Margaret, when they need a beautiful new actress to be there a big budget film. If they can do Megan Fox star (c'mon it's not so hot, and its actions "talent" made worse for the Disney Channel TV show) 1 film, it has to happen easily for her, as she is beautiful and has a talent! I would recommend it to change its name, so we can say it and make it more popular. Here's hoping that's what makes it a career, and if there is any justice, it can jump on some big summer movie or two in the next couple of years.
