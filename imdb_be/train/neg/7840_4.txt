This film is narrated through the eyes of a young teacher in a Catholic school, watching RAWANDAN UN genocide-furls around him. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a short explanation of the past history and rivalry Rawanda. He then goes on to the history as told through the eyes of a young idealist "her" young teacher, who does not take life too seriously or situation. As he and the driver coming to the road block, he plays with his driver ID Sun realizing that this is a serious point, and that, if the driver can not identify themselves as right knee to the soldiers, they would be killed. And then, as it relates to the history unfolding chaos unfolding around him. He realizes that every Rawandan (including its driver) is involved and that the Europeans soldiers and tourists can not and will not help. Media camera can not stop a machete, and there are too many machetes have a militia-men also fired. the name comes from the army captain said that he was going to shoot a dog eating a dead body around his compound, but will not fire Militia men who are killing people all over the compound. Mainly because they did not shoot at the soldiers again. Finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation, and the guy who says the team vacuum that he wants to give up her seat for one of the alleged victims, runs with its tail in-between his feet, rather than face the immanent death with students, he promised not to leave behind. <br /> <br /> This is more character study, and came to Jesus moment for one character than the story of the genocide in «RAWANDA». This film must not take place in RAWANDA, it could have been any one of the genocidal hell holes that go around the world at any time.
