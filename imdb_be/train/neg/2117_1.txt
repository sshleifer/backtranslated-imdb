Bride die at the altar, and their corpses disappear. It's all about, but no one seems to be able to understand why and how this happens, they can not prevent it from happening. Bear with me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this, since it removes the spinal fluid of these young women, to pour his old wife and keep her alive. Continue to carry. Finally, the authorities understand that someone needs to be engineering the death and disappearance, but of course, they can not understand the incredible motif. Let's just ignore the ridiculous pseudo science and move on ... If you can get over the first twenty minutes of this mess, you will be treated to Lugosi beating his assistant for contempt one of the brides he killed, explaining that he is sleeping in the grave is much more comfortable than a bed and other non-real parody of horror films (the kind with the budgets and areas). Anyhoo - female journalist should face to the offender, and then fun really begins <br /> <br /> In cinematography and acting is OK (and perfectly inept police nowhere to be seen!) .. There are a lot of well-dressed, good looking people this film. The guide is true, and the script is slightly better than the material deserves. However, this film is not able to sustain the interest of all but the most seasoned fan of B-films. The best thing about it .... It will eventually end, but not fast enough.
