I admit that I did not expect much from the film by Roger Corman. Actually, I think a lot of walking and bad scenarios. But in this case, I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Gunslinger history of women (played by passionate Beverly Garland), who takes over as sheriff after her husband brutally murdered. Ms. Garland is a pretty good shot himself, killing one of the murderers of the next day at the funeral of her husband. Her first task is to close the local bar that violates the city curfew. bar owner tries to buy the land in anticipation of repurchased (desired) railways. Nevertheless, Ms. Garland is a thorn in its plans, and a bar matron of hiring someone to kill Mrs. Garland. <br /> <br /> Because of the Garland honestly and realistically play a role, there is absolutely no temptation to go to the Suzanne Somers' She Sheriff "jokes. With the exception of a few faux pas (apartment door that opens from the inside, jeep tracks and two horsemen waiting for them on the screen Kiya ride around the corner), the film becomes fully passable as fare film. However, Corman could not resist adding his film with scenes of horse riding, in the same way as it is in other films. <br /> <br /> The shooter says stubble horse opera worth your time.
