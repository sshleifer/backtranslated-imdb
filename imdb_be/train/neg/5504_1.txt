There's no way to reason, I can understand why this film ever made. <br /> <br /> Why Hollywood should continue to crank out one terrible updated classics for others? (Cases in point: Mr. magician, The Avengers - awful) <br /> <br /> Christopher Lloyd, I usually use were so badly miscast in this role. His manic image of our beloved "Uncle Martin" so unspeakably unenjoyable be almost criminal. His talk, moaning, grimacing and theater gives us no reason to care about his character, but to some one dimensional cartoon character. <br /> <br /> The director must have thought that flits screaming dialogue and "one-take" poppers had some similarities with the comedy. Apparently, he told each actor to act as if they were red ants in the pants . <br /> <br /> Fault should lie with the irresponsible wrought script. I think that the author used the "It's a mad mad mad mad world" as an example of successful comedy script. how manic, like 1963 classic, he is far superior to this nonsense - really -. all of a sudden it looks pretty good compared <br /> <br /> the saddest thing in e th film, it must have seemed to have been written to appeal to young children. I'm just not sure whose children had been done. Of course, no self-respecting, inveterate child I know! <br /> <br /> If they were to remake "My favorite Martian", why do not they add contains some timeless charm of the original classic? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, IMDB.com is not a factor in the "zero" as a rating for his readers that it is the only ranking that comes to mind when describing the bullying. <br /> <br /> One good thing came out of this film, the cast and crew have been paid - I think.
