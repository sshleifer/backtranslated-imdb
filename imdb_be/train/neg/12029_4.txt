Overall, I found that if you do not hear about the film before seeing it on the DVD, there's probably a good reason for this. I have not heard about this movie at all, while I was in Blockbuster the other day and saw it on the shelf. Since all good films is already leased (the ones I'd like to see, anyway), I decided to give this a shot. <br /> <br /> It's really not that much different from the other films in the genre, such as The Singles Ward or PM If you are in these films type, you'll probably enjoy this. <br /> <br /> However, if you are not Mormons, this film probably will not appeal to you. There is no way to avoid open religious messages (Mormon) contained inside, and sometimes catches as juicy and cheese. In the end, if you do not fall into the Mormon demographic, you're probably better to look for something else. <br /> <br /> However, there were some very funny moments in the movie, but I do not think it was enough to save the movie as a whole.
