Here is an overview for people like me. This movie sucks from the beginning to the end. I threw popcorn at the screen and turned to partying a la MSF2000. The plot depends on chance and relies on the stupidity of the people who are supposed to be reasonable. Lead falls to the cheater and did not occur to her that she may get cheated ????? And it is rich ???? And it is well-known psychologist ????? Come on, people. She walks into a bar in just the right moment, when we all gathered to talk about her cheating ??? It was so set that it felt like a slap in the face to even fool the audience movie. Rain man would be offended. I also admit that I despise Mamet dialogue with a view of the passion that some people have for meat eaters, war-starters and fur owners. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But I'll give it a shot. The fact that it does not sound like a real order. I do not care. Is that all say the same thing. Mamet can not create characters; all he can do is shove his voice at us relentlessly through the different actors. Not surprisingly, his actors are not so wooden. They mess up constantly the same character. (However, his later films really improve.)
