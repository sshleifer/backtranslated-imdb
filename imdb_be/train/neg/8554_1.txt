The movie was, in all probability, made in 1930 and released in 1931, I would suggest that talking motion pictures had great difficulty in making the transition from silent. Nevertheless, this particular story Zane Gray is very weak. In addition, Gary Cooper, probably just learn to act. The result is that there would not be acceptable by today's standards. In 1931, maybe. In 2004, it is not acceptable. Some of the actors have worked well. Unfortunately, the Indians always get the short end of these early westerns. They lived on the land long before the arrival of the white man, but through the twisted history, they were not allowed to defend himself.
