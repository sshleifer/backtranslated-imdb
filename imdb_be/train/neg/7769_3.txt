This chapter scraper film Bill Rebane, who seemed to be getting worse in their trade during the eighties. Three abnormal millionaires invited nine people to a remote hotel to compete in the last men standing in a contest in which the final participant will be given a $ 1 million, provided that he or she is doing so far. Series lame pranks pulled on some of the guests while others are engaged in that most adults would do under the circumstances, namely to get shatfaced in the hotel bar. Most of the scenes are just an excuse to focus on a different part of the female body, including the opening dance number, which is an American pop crossover meets geriatric aerobics complete with prostitutes. If it was not any hesitation that white people can not dance to this scene hammers the final nail in the coffin. Pay special attention to the nipple slip. This goes on for about forty-five minutes until Bill Rebane starts throwing darts at various plot twists and all that it has inspired the next scene makes this a disjointed mess. This is a game, as long as it is not a game. Three old coots in full control until they are. Hotel possess supernatural powers, until it becomes a prop. They are dead, yet they are not. Even the narrator at the end says that he does not know what happened, dammit. I challenge anyone to think where Rebane was going on it. Dinner theater acts caliber minus dinner. Most of the actors are likely to have returned to his day job at a local stack of years. I give him a few points for the stage where the yuppie opens a wide wardrobe and a skeleton is inside the skull pushes himself. Let's see Gone with the Wind to do it! This cools the Classics collection is really getting to poison me. Bain, get it! As rebuys! I hate myself.
