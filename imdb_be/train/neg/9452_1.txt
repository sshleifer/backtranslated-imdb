I can not wait to see it when he was in production.But it turned out to be the biggest let down. Far from whimsical world of Dr. Seuss. It was vulgar and unpleasant, I do not think Dr. Seuss would approved.How Grinch Stole Christmas was much better. I understand that this was some subtle adult jokes in it, but my kids did not even catch. While the Cat in the Hat screamed vulgarities they caught a lot more than I would have with Dr. Seuss liked.Growing It really bothers me to see how Liverpool got smashed on the big screen .Lets see what they do with Horton hears a who .I hope this one does Dr. Seuss some justice.
