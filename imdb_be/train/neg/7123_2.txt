Welcome to the bad ghost story and someone's nightmare. This horror story is a young husband (John Hudson) and his wife (Peggy Weber) ghosts in the memory of his former wife and screaming skulls found throughout their empty house and pond lilies. Is my husband really kills him already hectic bride mad? Or is it a training challenge gardener Mickey (Alex Nicol), who took care of the mansion grounds after the original hostess death? This low budget horror flick has a storyline that keeps you participate all the way final. The special effects are pretty bad, even in the 1958 standards. I swear, sometimes screaming skull sounds exactly as it should be in a Godzilla movie. Also in the cast as a character actor snow Reverend Russ Conway. By the way ... the vaults gardener (Nicol) is the director of the film. You can catch it as part of the AMC Monsterfest.
