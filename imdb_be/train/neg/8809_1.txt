A bunch of women who can not act to sit, talk, smoke bomb. They have another woman in a wheelchair, they hide because it is deformed, and sometimes they kill someone to feed the man of human flesh, which actually looks like some kind of store bought ham, which they wore, sticking several plastic fingers. We do not see them kill anyone, suddenly there is a body on the floor, covered with blood-stained sheet. I can not eat Spam cover sheet more because of this. Just the thought of spam cover sheet is sufficient to cause the same narcoleptic fit brought on by trying to go through all this movie. Sometimes there accidentally inserted scenes Man, who "hunted" by their hurts some guy, he is attached to the seat of his basement. Why he caught this guy, and how it relates to Sit-On-The-Couch Sister never explained. There are also some "non-human" Man is worried scene. He P *** es the blood and hitting the wall, but who he is or what happened to him is neither explained nor even tied to the story. <br /> <br /> There is no action, no special effects, no history. If you want to watch some boring people say in the deepest sense of anything sitting around and eating ham and smoke, it's 90 minutes, because, on the stage, where a chicken makes some hooks on the street corner and the mentioned above, except for the occasional scene, absolutely nothing happens. (Yawn) Oh, I almost forgot, you can see them move some things, including deformed sister, when they move into a new apartment. Its one of the few cases where they do not sit on the sofa or lying in bed.
