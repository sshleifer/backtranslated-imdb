Sogo Ishii may be qualified cinematographer under the right conditions, but GoJoe tells the story of a warrior monk, and his only rival, the scion of the clan Genji. Filmmaking is the main features of the production of low-budget, including blurry scenes of struggle and clumsy installation (the kind you can find within Dorama production). Monk Bank reports its spiritual mentor, that his fate lies in the destruction of a mysterious spirit who guards GoJoe bridge at night, but he does not understand that this decision will lead him directly into conflict with almost every element of society at that time - but can make it enlightenment. <br /> <br /> There's no lack of ambition, however, in its description of the conflict between the holy and the profane. Frilly blooms in some of the photos and editing helps to compensate for the loose style of cinema. <br /> <br /> A disappointment.
