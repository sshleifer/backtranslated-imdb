Fe. The film was in an interesting manner, but quickly ran the gamut from intricate dim. The confusing part was mainly in the beginning, where the cut scenes are so numerous that it is difficult to say just what occurs within the first twenty minutes or so. Deaf comes later with lukewarm romance between two human beings (pusses both). Vengeful spirit of the dead girl really is the living person in the film, which is boring. If the rest of the cast was her caliber, the film could have been better. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Because the story gets really interesting for a while, as it seems that mad priestess mother of the deceased girl of sixteen tries to resurrect her daughter from the dead, with obviously unfortunate side effect that all the other dead people come back and take on a solid human form, and It is likely to start killing everyone. A sort of Japanese mystical night of the dead things like life. But it has not come true. Even if this hairy unwashed priest with a small basket, tied to his head says young people are not interested, it's going to happen when the priestess completes his ritual, she does just that and only dead man who shows her daughter. Many mass rising of the dead, not to go the army of corpses, nothing. The priest simply makes the spirit of the girls to go back to the land of the dead, taking the washed WUSS with her boyfriend, she crushed his spine, like peanut brittle (at that moment I was tempted to cheer loudly as this idiot went to kiss and caress the dead ,, ewwww !! !). Sucking Robitussen, spineless best friend has a long introspective shot at the end when she leaves the village for the last time, and that's all. No real fear, no real horror that Japanese people tend not to do much better than American filmmakers of them focus on more-top cheesy facial makeup, sun screaming Mimis. I was very disappointed.
