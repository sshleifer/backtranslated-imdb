Waiting to go inside theathre with tickets in my hand, I was expecting an interesting sci-fi fantasy film, which could finally feed the appetite of films in relation to the robot technology, but instead I went disappointed with every aspect of it, once again proves that stunning special effects can not help a sad site, which in my view was worse this year. By acting in this film, too, displeased me, Will Smith does not show anything new in this film, but I've never seen him cast change as Â«Men In Black", which was his only success in my view. He had to resign since without spoiling his name with such titles as "I, Robot" and "Men in Black 2". 4/10
