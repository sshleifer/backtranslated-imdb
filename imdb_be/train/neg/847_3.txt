The film is about two brothers who should be similar - but not in any way expect to be clever - one surgeon, and they are something else can write computer code. Geniuses, as they like to call themselves, which sounds very exaggerated, if we compare it with the personal characteristics you can think of the name of the material. <br /> <br /> I really do not like the style of the film. I believe that the anxiety, confusion and deep blues, he brings it to the goal, but the fact that I do not get why so many. Film cheapest on the stage and said basically, without a human aspect to it all. This gives a comic book-like experience. However, this visually stunning the audience, it somehow brings his blues with short dialogues, monotonous scenes, dynamic cut, music and sharp sounds. <br /> <br /> storyline of the film is very simple, most of what is happening in the sharply depicted for long minutes, basically, in a tangle of delusions modeling consequences of drug use and dynamic contractions. <br /> <br /> I will openly say that this film does not fit my expetations slightly.
