Girl pouring suspects that serial rapist was looking at her through a dormer window. Detectives Martin and Orville Stone Manners on his heels, but not as much as they find him after he kills, rapes, and eats nipple girl.He shot to death in hot. One would hope that this would be the end of the film. Not because it's too awful, but because the level of acting is terribly nasty. Unfortunately, this is not the end of the month and the rapist is resurrected as a zombie by a bunch of Satanists. Thus, he continues where he left off, with the detectives on the case, this time flying the child after him, too (do not ask). There has been very good very low-budget films (Street Trash and Filthy McNasty spring to mind), but this one is scraping the bottom of the barrel. Terrible acts bad dime store special effects, lame attempt at comedy, and oh yeah, and also the ending sucks <br /> <br /> My rating :. F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Theresa Bestul gets completely nude; Anne R. Key Gets Topless
