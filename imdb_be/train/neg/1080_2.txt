Experience as a director of Altman could have expected that we want to spend time with, or care about what is happening, the leading character, neurotic whiners, jerk, without redeeming qualities - is the central puzzle about this deeply embarrassed the work. A terrible piece of garbage. In addition to this crippling flaw storyline requires a lot of concentration to follow. The device is part of the character of Bran so obviously rigged from the outset that we are inclined to wonder whether the writer and director have completely lost respect for their audience. This last question is at the heart of the film: it is a director's indulgence with a deep contempt for taste, value and audience intelligence. It is very unusual for Mr. Altman. <br /> <br /> Patrick Watson
