This film has been slow, but it is difficult to effect i often drifted into the land of ham. Redgrave was unattractive character as a 60-something woman who is trying to compete with Thurman 20 something for the love of nature Fox (why me). The film's title was to be "Small people on the lake." The actors played as they were rehearsing. Awful predictable ending load. I can not believe that it is on this site, as a comedy!
