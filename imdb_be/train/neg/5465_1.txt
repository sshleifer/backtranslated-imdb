This film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I have ever seen. It is about as fun as doing hard manual labor with stomach cramps. The film starts badly (I would rate the first few minutes of the film 1/10), and then get worse, minute by minute. The only way to evaluate it is a general spiral abyssmal negative number that grows within ninety, long minutes. Unfunny sun a real word, but it is best to describe the humor in this video. Once the video manages to make even a cute, poorly dressed women and sex seem grotesque and unpleasant. This film is remarkably bad. I would say that it would be better to be closed with the theme of TITANIC to play again and again, and with the character of the Bush escape from LA drones in the ear than watching this film. The sequel is not so bad. If you need to make a film TROMA, get Tromeo and Juliet or Combat Shock. I prefer to look ~ d 5 Tony Little commercials back to back, than to see NUKEM High class again. Do not get me wrong, it took some criminal genius to make a film that awful and if ever a movie deserved an award for that terrible, this is it.
