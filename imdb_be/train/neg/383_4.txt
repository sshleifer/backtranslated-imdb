The plot line of No One Sleeps is not a bad idea, and the subject is quite a bit of interest. But in all to look this film, we said loudly: "These filmmakers go to the trouble finding good places, good lighting, make-up and hair well ... why the sound is so bad?" Throughout the film, the sound was echoy, distorted, and most of the dialogue was incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There are some good acting in this film, and I think that Jim Thalman really good actor. . This story, with some of the same actors, should be done as a high budget movie <br /> <br /> I just can not be repeated enough - if you have a limited budget, to allocate more good sound, the sound of the film, as an image, and it should be done properly. Can I gained 6.
