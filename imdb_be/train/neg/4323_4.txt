The European rest (the so-called National Lampoon's European vacation) is the weakest of the Vacation films (the first and the third one of the most beautiful films). While Chevy Chase and Beverly DAnzhelo Clark and Ellen Griswold return (with new actors in the role of the Rus and Audrey Griswold), this time they give a very weak script with bad dialogue. This leads to steps to suffer with the jokes are not very funny. To be more precise, what really causes this film to suffer is the fact that the "joke", as they are simply glued into the cobbled-together screenplay), and not serve as a central section in 3 other films to relax there. Well, they can not win them all. 4 10.
