Absolutely nothing happens in this sloooow, annoying, thrill-less thriller directed by regular employees in Amen√°bar Mateo Gil. The film, which somehow has to do with the effect of boredom and thrill-seeking, is not actually brings none, and it seems like an exercise in boredom. Only slightly disturbing moment is the climax of the film, which takes about 30 seconds just agonizing over 100 minutes, and can be solved very simply. The plot lacks finesse and confidence, and while the idea is original, as the story unfolds at random, and each portion of the apparatus, or turn is a result of outside intervention (Deus-Ex-Machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or resourcefulness. If you are fans of the genre, see "Tesis" instead.
