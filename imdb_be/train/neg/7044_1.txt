How sad to see a beautiful and talented Tina Louise is to create this horrible excuse for a movie. Tina still looked fit and attractive, but for some reason, it seems, really scared. I can understand her fear; fearing that this is the third bitch rate would somehow be released to the general public. Also, I'm a fan of cute Adam West. Again, as with Tina, Adam looks good and in good shape for a man his age. His acting is passable, but the script is so bad that it is difficult to even listen to the dialogue <br /> <br /> The film is a rip-off of the classic Brando's biker flick, The Wild Ones. outlaw biker gang out of control in a small country-town. Cyclists here look like a motley group, and I'm sure would not want them to date my sister. Acting stiff and wooden, and the story, the story is as old as the sand. Hellriders hell to watch!
