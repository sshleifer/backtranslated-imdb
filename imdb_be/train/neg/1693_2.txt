My husband and I went to see this film, as the imposition of a horror movie, which we are. Two hours later, I found myself wanting to like my money and time back. I was so disappointed. Teaser for the film mainly comprising the best moments of the film. There was nothing terrible film, but a good time to unexpected inputs, etc. I found the most "scary" parts to be funnier than anything. After watching other films based on works by Japanese authors, I have to conclude that what is considered terrible in Japan is not that scary here in the US. My advice: If you are a fan of true horror films, save yourself the pain, sitting through it. I can not say that I would recommend to rent it or if you have a free rental comes to you.
