I was not sure whether Andy Sidaris repeat its success with cinematic hit «Malibu Express.» With his film Fit to kill, he proved that Sidaris serious director, not just a one-shot director. The plot is written Sidaris who ungratefully passed up the Academy, it is a complex scenario involving many twists and turns invisible. The main characters are drawn sexually to work on the basis of the radio station, known as KSXY. Cleverly, KSXY actually their secret headquarters. In «Fit to kill," they resist their long time nemesis Kane, who is trying to steal one of the most expensive diamonds in Russia. Well-written script is not all perfectly valid cast helps ensure that the film as a cult. Panned by critics and the box office, the film will be evaluated in the coming years. Who suffered the same fate as A Clockwork Orange and the taxi driver did, but in the future will no doubt become a recognized. I am disappointed that no critic wheels are not recognized filmmaking commodity Andy Sidaris sign in. Costumes, special effects, all help to complement this already beautiful piece of cinema. It can make you better ignore the deplorable 3 rating of the film and go out and rent it out for yourself. My personal rating of 10/10. Drama thick blockbuster Runaway Bride, and the action is better than or equal to a cinematic masterpiece Last Action Hero. Andy, keep up the good work.
