Deadly Wake is the perfect film for film students ... to learn how NOT to make a movie! <br /> <br /> Let's see ... that the crew mess in this film? The worst music mix Worst editing worst-case scenario Worst constantly directing Worst worst act choreographed cinematography Worst worst worst props sets Worst lighting, etc. Let's face it, if this "film" was in the ultra-high-contrast black-and-white and silent ... it would still be terrible. All the scenes are dark (lighting people call it "black"), often choked score meandering dialogue, which was ok, because no one ever said as many as two proposals without long pauses for effect. "Evil" robot was fun ... what was it? Jazz dance? Oh ... I think he had to walk tactical or something. I'm sure that was filled with fear in the heart of the ... poor editors. And as you edit as many frame garbage, it is not possible. Waste is not waste, no matter how you splice it. As someone when something is through dailys ??? <br /> <br /> The bottom line IS-I could not stand to watch more than 15-minute segments, it was so bad ... but I see it all (with Lotsa breaks) to see if he had any good parts in it whatsoever. NO! NONE! <br /> < br /> a perfect example of how not to make a movie ... And I do not need to see every serious student of the film !!!
