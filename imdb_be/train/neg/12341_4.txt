Horror parody not only a thing of the 21st century. The way to a series of «Scary Movie» were a few examples of this genre, mostly in the 80s. But, as a franchise, most of these films came. Some, like "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" mostly go higher, but others, like "Saturday 14", and this continuation is not able to deliver the laughs. But of all of these types of films have a particularly big criminal, and that "Transylvania 6-5000", one of the main waste of time for many reasons <br /> <br /> Pros :. Excellent cast, which makes it better. Some of sluggish humor funny. Trite, but to catch the theme song. . Some good place Transylvania <br /> <br /> Cons: threadbare plot. Basically tedious pacing. Much of the humor just does not cut it. Monsters give little to do and little screen time. I thought it was supposed to be a parody of the monster movie? Lame ending that is likely to viewers angry <br /> <br /> Final thoughts :. It's a comedy? If this is what is really funny bits are so few and far between? Comedies should make us roll on the floor and not to roll his eyes and yawning, aching to be more. I can not believe, Anchor Bay released this tired trash. I admit that this is not one of the worst films ever made, but it is not the time or the Wörthersee anybody's money, even if you're a fan of any of the actors. See. 'Transylvania Twist' instead <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
