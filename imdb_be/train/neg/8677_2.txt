I loved Chiba Street Fighter, and I realized, hey, no matter how stupid it would be a movie, I'll at least get to see him kick ass, is not it? Wrong. It's a sad, sad mess of meaningless conversations, half the estimated writers and meaningless intrigue. There are several scenes of action of any kind, even less than the martial arts scene, and a few that are shot and edited so bad that you can not even understand what is happening in the world. Dub and disgusting, and perhaps stupidity, this film is best illustrated by the fact that supposedly has the Italian Mafia ... except they are ALL Japanese! Avoid like the plague - you might be better to see the martial arts, looking through the window of your local preschool class karate for five minutes.
