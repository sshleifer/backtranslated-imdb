Perhaps one of the most terrifying horror films teenagers I've ever seen. I'll start with the bad points so it is a movie that pretty much covers the entire movie. First of all, something no one can avoid: The terrible acts. I swear, they picked up some random street children on the basis of how they looked. Secondly, BAD / unconvincing nature of the work / development. You hardly even know the half of the children who were killed here. All you have to understand that they deserved it, anyway. Scarecrow character was overdone and a cheap rip-off of the other big killers fantasies, such as Freddie and Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOGUE: Scarecrow was full of terrible severity, which will make you laugh, just because it was so awful. Lines like, "Let's find some small animals to torture!" In fact, just leaves you with a raised eyebrow. And last but not least, from the following: BAD casting. How old was the guy who played Lester? 30? Back of his head was bald to God. There is much more I could say about this film, as it is cheap special effects, this "high school class film" efforts, but are given. It's just a bad movie creation at the worst. As for the fact that I have found to be "good" in the movie: -Entertaining for low, low, low -Would help put insomnia to sleep. Very cheap laugh, or even giggle.
