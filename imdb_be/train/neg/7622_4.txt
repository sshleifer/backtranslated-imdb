One can only assume that Robert Osborne contractually obligated to express my admiration of even the least attractive films in TCM library, as it could explain his extolling "dignity" of the "magic" of the film at the time of its introduction, when I saw it on cable television. Seeing as any old movie on IMDb receives 'classic' status from a number of calving amateur reviewers, I thought that there was an urgent need for more honest review of this film. <br /> <br /> This is not your father "shop around the corner." For all my quibbles with "You've Got Mail", it still outshines it as a remake in many respects, can be imagined. For those who have seen the original, deficiencies will only be more and more obvious. <br /> <br /> from one of the Lamest Meet Pretty sequences I can remember seeing the (sad farce of trying to "humor"), this movie comes out on the wrong foot, and he will never come back up . These "musical" is entitled to only one in the sense of a rare term. there sprinkling instantly forgettable musical numbers, and then there's Judy singing " I do not care ", and twisted his hands around as if in captivity. Christmas song she sings in the store, probably one of her best numbers here. Miss Garland was beautiful in a number of musical films, but here it seems terribly miscast . The role was originally filled with June Allyson and Judy certainly are not able to fill the shoes of the old part of Sallavan in. Van Johnson is also in a pretty soft performance of the second type of Jimmy Stewart's speed. Guides never reach chemistry Stewart / Sullavan or even in Hanks / Ryan. <br /> <br /> This is a film that knows (some) music, but not music. It really does not seem to understand why the original processed and even feels the need to add another possible love interest for the character of Van Johnson complicate unnecessarily. a remake of the original replacement for infidelity plot is formulaic plot tool featuring priceless violin. It's almost a shame to look and feel as if it was possible, it was removed from the episode Three companies by one of the DeLorean and a flux capacitor. It's really just an excuse for the complete failure of Keaton. Even high resolution romantic scene between supply carpeted. After watching both films, you can see why they call it "Lubitsch Touch" and "Robert Z. Leonard touch." <br /> <br /> In order to avoid this and rewatch any original film or one of Judy Garland's early films, if you are iconoclasts who likes to see the once great star falls to the ground.
