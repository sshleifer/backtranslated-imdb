Residents of the two writers struggling to finish his book in an almost empty apartment building. They help each other first, and then slowly the tension between them begins to build. <br /> <br /> This is based on Malamud's novel and, unfortunately, they all say, as if they are in this novel. Very little dialogue, of course, its filled with purple and shades of meaning. Its as if a college English major with a head full of pretensions wrote. This is horrible, and I found that immediately immune to what the film had to say that it is a shame, since the film is filled with great performances from top to bottom. Snoop Dog at the fluff good shape, unfortunately, none of them can not come within the falseness of words and spaces. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this film. Though actually not bad, it is very instructive and pretentious point of making you want to go. I lost interest in less than a third of the way in and had to fight to get to the end. If you are interested, I would try it on cable, but I would not lay out good money to see it.
