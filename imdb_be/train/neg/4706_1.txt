That's right, you heard me, this movie is a fucking "abomination. Firstly, the group, who the hell is going to watch or listen to a group called "The Naked Brothers Tape"?!?! Not only is the name of awful, but so are the musicians, they can not even play anything! In addition, the lead singer sounds more girly than Geddy Lee, and even his voice is terrible! Not only that, they are terrible musicians, but they are terrible actors. Led by a lousy director and a thin plot, it has to be dull film ever. I want this site will allow you to use a vote or below zero to 10, because it gives the muck 1/10 currently WAY too generous. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if you can call it a comedy film. If you are looking for a comedy with music, go to the «Weird Al» Jankovic guy "because he does so much better than these talentless teenagers.
