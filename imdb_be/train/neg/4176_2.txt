Maybe I missed the meeting when it was explained the value of «B-movie", but what I just saw, it was funny. You want to get a good overview of this film? Take Alien replace xenomorphs with vampires, then remove everything that was good about it, and that's pretty much it. <br /> <br /> 5 minutes in the film, «V-SAN team" (that stupid acronym I've never heard of) extract the "base" Thats a vampire had been killed, and then they go up (down? What?) staircase, obviously attached to the bulletin board with obvious modern train in the background. At the same time it should take place? 2210. Good ... (hold on, I'll get to that) <br /> <br /> Yes. characters. Oh, well, there is the token lesbian Asian chicken, the redneck cowboy wannabe, weathered captain, goth vampire / Hot Topic of the time teller and wussy noob second in command. They all play their respective subjects with the same lack of ambition. It almost hurts me to see Micheal Ironside in this film. Is he not getting enough money, Sam Fisher's voice in Splinter Cell? Practically the only thing original about Vampire Wars on how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie will follow, the only entertainment I have received from the weak attempts set of solutions. So when the tape PCI computer card on the account in the walls of a room on a spaceship? The money needed to make this film could be delivered much better use.
