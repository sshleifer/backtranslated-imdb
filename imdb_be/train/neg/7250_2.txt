After reading the film other reviews I was of the opinion that the high marks, probably paid studio lackeys, like the film I saw was absolutely horrific, with wooden actions dull scripts and perseverance predictable direction, one of the few pros have to be gorgeous scenery as the film shows some beautiful backgrounds with large sweeping vistas and dramatic skies and wide-open prairie, unfortunately, when the most memorable thing in the film is part of the sign behind the actors that should be in a warning to the quality of the film, all in all thoroughly boring annex to the Western genre that even at a very reasonable price, it can be obtained on the DVD should be avoided.
