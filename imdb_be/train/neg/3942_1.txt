My God, what an awful movie. The film has all the right people involved, unfortunately, it is not worth watching. I saw it for free at my local library. If I gave to look at it, I would be even more upset. This film unwatchable. How could Tarintino be associated with such a slow pace, uninteresting film. Not surprisingly, that did not get much distribution, everyone involved should be ashamed. I can make a better movie with Dated camcorder and my big toe. For his sad, I really hated it. Tarintino just lost credibility in my eyes. This must be some kind of sick joke. Do not mess with this film. If someone even hints you have to watch it, to kill them.
