I must say that I was pretty disappointed with this "horror" movie. I am not afraid even once during his show. It is also not very disturbing anything .... I was able to guess the ending halfway through the film ... So .. what's left? <br /> <br /> «The Ring» Trully is a horror film. .. I would like to stop copying other movies out of it (eg, trademark long hair). Please give me some novelty. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film.
