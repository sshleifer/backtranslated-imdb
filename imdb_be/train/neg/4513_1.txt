Despite the fact that the book was not strictly accurate to the real situation I described him still wearing the feeling of Japan. I find it hard to believe that someone who has been involved in making this film had never been to Japan, as the Japanese do not feel in the least degree. Almost all of it was terrible. I admit that the actors are usually pretty good, but can not stand a chance to save him. Before the beginning of the movie I was surprised that there were only ten people in a movie theater on Friday evening shortly after the film opened in Japan. 30 minutes in I was amazed they were. I stayed, so I have the right to criticize it. The entire film was packed with my moans and stifled a laugh of disbelief from my Japanese friend. Everyone I saw, coming out of this movie was the views of confusion and frustration on their faces. <br /> <br /> To the creators of this film, you owe me two hours.
