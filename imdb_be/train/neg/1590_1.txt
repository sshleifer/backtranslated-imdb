HA! So it's a film that «Next Action Stars» landed. Well, I'm glad that I was not involved and did not win ... <br /> <br /> Is not it funny how you can just look at the first 10 seconds (!) And make up some thoughts about the film? I mean, come on! Just look at these names? I watched this movie (or part of it, "the drama", as it was made for TV, and we can not look at it) one evening, doing military service, and the audience was with me the typical hodgepodge of average guys who kogda that while the series of watches, like Las Vegas just for the girls in the show. so that the bar was not very high, the most watched film in my group was a neighbor (and it was not because of a great script; D But the complete absence of the film original, acting, script, and just about everything else that makes the movie good. made it quite easy to change the channel to Las Vegas (or was it a CSI? I do not remember ...) without any complaints from the rest of the group. And it is rare (!) for the sake of heaven! entirely from the film! If this is televisions, yes, watch it. And behold it. My conclusion? well, as Joel Silver is really you abiv some of the best action movies there (Die Hard, The Matrix 1, to name a few), I can only say that the producers do not give a film of this quality, they give money to directors. And to sell this film just because it's a movie Joel Silver a desperate attempt to hide the obvious shortcomings of the crew, who really did it.
