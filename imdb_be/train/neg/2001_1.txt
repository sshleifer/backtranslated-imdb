Why do so many people crowded in the evening show Roberto Moreira in the "up against all» ( «Contra Todos») at the Film Festival in San Francisco? "This is a killer," said my friend. "Well ... This is Brazilian," I added. Beautiful multi-colored people, tropical weather, beautiful rhythms and hip gangster story? . Strong temptations without doubt <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell us one little detail: it is a very bad movie, is actually quite horrible, and as unpleasant to watch, how bad it is done <br /> <br. /> So how on earth, and «Contra Todos» get to make the rounds of Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, numerous small local festivals, and now in San Francisco? Apparently, due to the method promotional process and scheme of Film. <br /> <br /> First of all, he won first prize at a film festival in Rio the movie, where it was named best Brazilian film of the year. He had a bad year; they were much, much better. Further, picky notes in the catalogs plus imaginary buzz leads to overcrowded classrooms and - since the film is not specified in any place and thus avoid attention from critics party. - he keeps going the rounds <br /> <br /> The festival advertising aimed at the promotion of the goose is sometimes a lot. Chicago Festival one called «Contra Todos» «cocktail and speedball shot straight from Brazil" and calls Claudia s boyfriend as "pin from the slums like the neighborhood." Soninha is "Theodore in nymphs, as a teen-aged daughter of a prosperous sexuality." The film "The shelling of the urgent often a handheld camera," and director of "working until now, and a palpable sense of frustration Blossoms with inner despair and decline." The effect of "unbearably raw and honest , "and the film rushes" towards the conclusion of the deceased ended, as life on the screen. "Not the best of the letter, but it sure pumps up excitement for a certain kind of potential audience. <br /> <br />« Contra Todos »really concerns hitman, two killers in fact, and his wife . And a daughter and born-again Christian girl he shot - in execrably ugly digital video, without the talent behind the camera-work - mainly in the barren appearance of the poor suburbs, rather than in one of the teeming "favelas" or village type the Brazilian city of slums where such wonderful movies like "Black Orpheus», «Pixote" and "City of God" were made, not in Rio at this time, but Sao Paulo. <br /> <br /> killer of family problems is Theodore (Giulio Lopez) and his partner with a drug problem Waldomiro (Ailtan Grass). Both sides have a little experience TV like actress playing sloppy blonde wife Teodora Claudia (Leona Cavalli) and Sylvia Lorenco, who plays his inflated, ready to revolt Soninha daughter. These actors can make it through the rear corners of several telenovela. Who knows? - in the best director of the film, they might even be a good thing. Besides them, there are some young people who receive stumbled on by Teordoro or if it is not available, a gang of thugs. Leaders do not work to a large presence, even if the camera enhances its time. <br /> <br /> Pairs of observers one in the Berlin festival and one in London and see the flaws of this film, but unfortunately, they are "once again immersed in the web hinterland. Henry Sheehan said from Berlin that the "film" (his quotes) was "the worst of the video work" is shown. "Film director seems to have chosen the video simply because it was a cheaper alternative to the film," Sheehan wrote "i do not make any creative use of new media" - no, he adds, to do something more creative <br. /> <br /> Sheehan said the first big mistake of the film: he "starts as a domestic drama, which is supposed to inflate when, half an hour into action Moreira reveals that the father and one of his friends with a professional hit. men waiting thirty minutes adds nothing to the film seems quite arbitrary decision and, at least, it is a waste of time, but the effort is all Moreira ever does, like a little kid who got a set of tools. on his birthday, and goes around hitting everything in sight without rhyme, reason or ability. "The devastating, but it's true. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the festival in 2004 in London for Kamera.com, Metin Alsanjak tried look at the positive side, but nonetheless, given the lack of redeeming features, calling the performance "easily the film's best feature." Yes, it is very easy, given that everything else is so bad. Alsanjak acknowledged that "it is a low-budget, violent and seedy by lawless in São Paulo, is devoid of any cute characters, and how to COROLLARY, hope. Too dark and cynical to be a clear story about the human condition, the film does not help the poor subtitling .. ". questions Alsanjak, connecting Contra Todos to the "dogma" and Mike Lee Sun helped <br /> <br /> In addition to this senseless first half in which nothing redeems the longing of our expectations during the first acts of violence -. which, if they They come just "banging everything in sight without rhyme, intelligence or skills" - Moreira ineptly tries to redeem his abrupt ending, adding that appears to be outtakes immediately after it, and then fetched an ironic final scene where one of the characters gets married . Without a doubt, the director wanted to expose the "banality of evil" hit men with a low level in the working class neighborhood, but he can not make the symbols that he sees in general, come to life for us. And the structure of the film indicates that he can not change his material. <br /> <br /> (seen at the International Film Festival in San Francisco, October 28, 2005)
