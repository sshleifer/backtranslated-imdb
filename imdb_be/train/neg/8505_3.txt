«Semana Santa» or «Angel Of Death» a very weak film. Mira Sorvino plays a detective who tries to find the killer who shoots arrows of people. Mira has an Italian accent, who stumbles from time to time. she can not just speak in English? All other characters are forced Mexican \ English accent, which is distracting. Dialogue is very bad, and the delivery of its wood. Film looks nice, but it's not enough to keep the scar. The next part of this review does contain spoilers !!!! <br /> <br /> During the climax, it looks like the villain is going to leave, but then it comes back down the stairs to get a picture and make a cool trick down the banister. It just shows that the script is not novelty in general. AVOID!
