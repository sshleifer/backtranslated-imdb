Before I continue, I must admit that a huge supporter of Bon Jovi. In fact, that's what attracted me to the case of a DVD in the first place. I probably would have bought it anyway to be such a big horror fan and enjoyed the first title Vampires are so many. <br /> <br /> But it's not half as good. Not even John can save this film for me. My main problem was that it just is not scary. In addition to the character Derek Bliss nor John of other characters make an impression, and you could not care less whether or not they die, especially annoying female vampire addict / drug. Female vampire simply whether sexually scary. Rather, it looks like anorexia 14 years old girl, no wonder that she so desperately needs blood then. Another big problem is that all this is simply "too bright". There is no atmosphere or fear. I know that the first vampire to be installed in New Mexico was not entirely gloomy area with a view eerily, yet it still managed to be dark and anticipation, when you need it. This film has no voltage as it is. <br /> <br /> The story is basically the same as before. Vampire wants to cross Berzier, to be able to walk in the daytime. History, however, has less cool bits at this time. There's no wow factor, knowing that it is the master of all master - the original vampire, like in the first film. You really do not care who or what this one is. There's no military masters. Instead, she hides in some old ruin, which is more like a Disneyland attraction that horrible temple. <br /> <br /> So what you have really is. The lack of panic, lack of atmosphere, the lack of interesting stories. A real let down for me personally.
