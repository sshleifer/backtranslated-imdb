Do not waste your time on this movie. This could be good, but the end was one of the Lamest I've ever seen. I seriously have to wonder how the people involved in making this film would look at it the final scene, and thought: "Yes! Now is the end! "And patted myself on the back of it. For me it was more like they just run out of ideas! They created the final scene to have a sharp turn, but instead just let the whole build-up to fall flat on his face. If the last shot faded black, and I could hear the music from the loan, I was shocked - I could not believe what I saw, and that someone could even say that the ending. The best thing someone can do with this film is to rewrite the end and give it some substance. Seriously, I'd really like to get the one who came up with that one in the room, look them in the face and say - WTF ?? !!!!
