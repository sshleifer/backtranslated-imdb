Unfortunately, there were 0 for rating or else I would have chosen it. This film does not have a star power that the original film had in such abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Herrmann, innocence newcomer Eileen Quinn, and expert direction of an experienced professional John Huston (father of actress Angelica Huston) is what made this film so sweet. Even the 1999 remake with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming, and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer than this sorry excuse for continuing. Before she made the film all Ashley Johnson was known for was her role as the little Chris Seaver on the prime-time show Growing Pains. She had a few bit parts in movies, but I do not know who thought she had talent enough to carry the film on his own. And the addition of Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom, funny! They could not get enough of the good actors to play the main role as daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan, Annie, but they will sign Joan Collins play some British ladies? It does not surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was. Critics were right to disagree with this film, even if it was only made for television, he was a bad sequel otherwise attractive film.
