Firstly, let me say that it should be on top of my list of sad movies. Nothing, and I do not mean anything in this movie even remotely exciting. Most of them are very complicated, and as you progress you just want it to end !! Some people want a movie that makes them "think" through the whole thing, to which I say ... "More power to you" !! I on the other hand, just want to be entertained. This brings me back to that bitch, entertainment is not the case. This movie is silly and a waste of time. It seems that the majority here, too, agree. Most of it has no meaning, and by the time you think you have figured out one scene another lame scene takes place around and .... Well, I think you see where this is going. Avoid this one sucks .... bad !!
