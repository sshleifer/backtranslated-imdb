Someone actually gave the film 2 stars. There's a high likelihood that they need immediate professional help as those who do not spend 30 seconds to see if you can not award no stars quite simply terrible. <br /> <br /> This movie is ... well ... I think that it is pretty much any attempt at a terrible porn / snuff film, no porn or without real scary bits (except for acting, story, stories, sets , dialogue, and sound). I mistakenly assumed it was about zombies. <br /> <br /> Watching it is actually very scary to justice; you scared someone will come and you will never be able to describe what it is, and they will think you're a freak, that the clock is a home-made video amateur torture or something along those lines. <br /> <br /> I was so taken aback, I am writing this review on my phone, so I do not forget to try to bring the rating down further than the current 1.6 to save others from the same terrible fate, I just suffered. <br /> <br /> I'm the worst film I've ever seen, and I can tell (with hand on heart), he will never, never refilled.
