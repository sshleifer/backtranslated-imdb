All too many cases of violence. <br /> <br /> The film goes from one scene to another, and almost every one of violence erupts. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not one who is shocked by the violence, and to me the film without a fight in it there is something missing. But please, not one after the other. May the reaction is shock and horror, it was: "Here we go again." There is a kind of history between scenes of violence, but two-thirds of the way through the film, which I turned off completely, and could not wait for the end. <br /> <br /> If this is the best film-makers can do, they have to find something to do with their pathetic lives, how to make shoes or mail delivery.
