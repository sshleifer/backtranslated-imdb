This film is only the children against the evils of the genre. Thunderbirds just the hook to get people to see it, but almost accidentally in use. The fact that the action takes place on Tracy Island just a ploy to draw in society. It was interesting to note that the filmmakers look into the future of London as the world will all fits together. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film, some of the lines supplied by Lady Penelope, which are very comical They provided some light relief for those waiting for a re-run of the series. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it runs 90 minutes or so in the "fun" way and so can simply be worth watching.
