I am sorry to say that it was one of the worst films I have ever seen. Although visually exciting (for example, the use of color was much), it was pretty boring and disturbing (see the father / son incest). <br /> <br /> Moreover, music is completely absent, and if you think these wonderful soundtrack by Michael Nyman (who wrote the soundtracks for most of Greenaway's films), then you can imagine what a difference it makes. <br /> <br />
