Normally I would give this movie 6 tackles a very important topic, and it does it quite well. - despite Katie Wright, which is an achievement in itself <br /> <br /> I have no idea when she was actually instructed to play the character as it is, or course annoying, but she did an amazing job what makes it impossible for me to take care of Lex. There's no measuring it, but to get confused, helpless and ignorant she is, and how well she whimpers. I can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of his friend and whose eating disorder spiraled out of control to be confused, scared and in pain. Nevertheless, all of Wright's performance is based on the continued screaming and whining, whining the rest. I could not help but feel that the problem was caused by a particular girl is not a demon, bulimia, but her without backbone. I very much doubt that this point of the film is meant to do.
