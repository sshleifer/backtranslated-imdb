I watched this movie, because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I'd give them a try sister, Rain Phoenix. I'm sorry I check it out. She is awkward and the film just has this amazing story, when the one you want to call it. Cisse was fantastic and Jellybean just sitting on the toilet, which, like to sleep with the old in the mountains, what happens? I have never been so unhappy in his life. It was just total rubbish. I can not believe that the actors agreed to do such a film waste of money, time and space. In Sissi to be "beautiful" does not get to me. I thought she was all but that. These fingers were just stupid, and why do we care if it can hitchhiking? What's the deal ??? 0 out of 10, the survey shame buckskin is 0 doesnt even deserve 1. It is hoped that the rain is better in other films, I forgive her for that one performance, I mean, I did not have much better with this film.
