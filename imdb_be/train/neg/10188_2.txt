This juvenile, soft film strictly for teenagers in bodies of old men desperate to relive their teenage years hormonally challenged. How? The combustion gas and equating to fast, reckless car (or airplane) with freedom. <br /> <br /> The plot borrows from Mr. Rogers' (if it were to run its oil conglomerate) and Logan's Run (if it has been greatly sedated and did not have a clear sense of style). <br /> <br /> starring Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith, this film is set in post-gas-crisis world, in which an all-powerful government does not want you (* ahem *) to drive, and burn the gas. Sort in reverse current Enron-shrub, capturing oil, SUV-pushing government. <br /> <br /> This opposition itself makes the movie ridiculous. But wait ... there's more. Although the film is set in the future, we have not shown any signs of future technology, for the return to the bikes, golf carts and horses. Are you sure that the future looks ... just like today. Same clothes, same suburban house, the same green lawns, as it is today, and if the film was made. There's no solar panels or wind turbines, alternative energy no concessions. <br /> <br /> The action is flat and insipid. Even the scenes that could be sand, or moving, a member of the film, honor, romance, horror ... all fall flatter than a paper doll suitcase. <br /> <br /> Going lacking-- jet flown by Burgess Meredith character color change and configuration from moment to moment, as the creators of the movie to insult our intelligence with unrivaled footage over and over again. <br /> <br /> the story like a madman, and only half as exciting as the Dukes of Hazzard episode. <br /> <br /> Even avid car fans and film SF should avoid this movie like Roadkill month, if you do not like barking guide Exxon is trying to make a film as empty as a tank character.
