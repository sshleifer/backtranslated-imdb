"Major Payne" movie about the main thing, who makes life hell for him a small group of boys in the Marine Corps. This film is not a lot to offer, but it provides some fun moments, which are well worth a look. Do not expect that this will be an unforgettable film nonetheless. Just wait, laugh your way through the film, and at the expense of others. Confrontation between Major Payne and chubby boy was gay, and that is really all I remember about the movie for boys who want to take revenge on Major Payne except. Again, this is not a great film, and it is probably best viewed on a rainy day when you need a little laughter.
