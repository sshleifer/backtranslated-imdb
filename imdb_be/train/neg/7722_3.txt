Very bad action movie starring the ever wooden Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee is captured as a friend who never gives up, gel. Action at best, on average, I use a little bit of nudity thrown in, and Tia Carrera body twice! <br /> <br /> Setting up regular renegade cop is forced to hack a new partner on the big event, the producers, at least try to give a twist to the formula to make Lundgren policeman with eastern values ​​and Lee in the modern city slicker, but there is zero character development, making it almost comical, Lundgrens oriental warrior outfit for the big demolition should be seen to be believed. Action sequences are numbers and Lee (who would go on to make an excellent Raven) never give volume to show any specific martial arts shine. But, given his illustrious origins, he had a hell lot of pressure and a much better served without having to live with his father, took on a very different role in The Crow, which showed that a unique actor, he might have become if he had not been tragic and early death. <br /> <br /> If your Lundgren hardcore fan or a fan of the style of action poorest 80 films (think, Cobra, etc.), then avoid it. <br /> <br /> Poor 3/10
