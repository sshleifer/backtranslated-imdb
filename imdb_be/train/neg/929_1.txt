My wife and I love to shoot really stupid horror / Sci-Fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We have seen this on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our list of Netflix. Now, when I say that this film is terrible, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, acting, camera-work, history, costumes, just cheezy and a low budget, but that's what makes it so good. I think that in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking on the spot. I very much hope that the one who made this film was not serious when they did it, because if they were, it would be just boring. If you like to look really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them, I recommend this.
