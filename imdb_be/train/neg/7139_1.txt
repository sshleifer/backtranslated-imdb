Redline is a fake with Fast & Furious, without any redeeming qualities. It does not need to have a quirky story with lots of twists and surprises, but you need something! This is equivalent pornofilm where the plot and dialogue consist of 60 seconds of the beginning and the same end. In addition, it is worse, because you will not get your money's worth. Mind-numbingly sad impossible race sequence, and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars, which almost become negative points for having appeared in this film. Of course, she's hot, but who lost hope that the on-screen male? I feel like the director was sitting with a hat full of dialogue and story fragments, and shook the 8-ball every time they switched the scene. No serious person, race or knows anything about this will not watch this movie and enjoy the race scene.
