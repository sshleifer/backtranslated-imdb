Follow-up is much better "Cleopatra Jones" was statuesque black actress Tamara Dobson, who returns to his signature role as chic, super-hard drug business agent 1973's destroying heroin ring in Hong Kong. Cross-pollination action blaxploitation flick and kung fu B-movie fun in the beginning, but in the end flags. Shootout finals directly from the conveyor line, and Dobson himself, seems to be less vigorous than before (it's still sexy, and it puts a unique spin on her comically unnatural dialogue, but these neighborhoods may be too much of one thing for it - it is exhausted ). Stella Stevens plays a thief this time; it is good, but can not be compared with Shelley Winters in the predecessor. ** from ****
