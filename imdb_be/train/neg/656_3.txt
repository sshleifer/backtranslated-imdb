Note: I could not bring myself to actually write a constructive review of Prom Night. It simply can not be done. Instead, I went through what I thought about while watching a movie <br /> <br /> The things that I was thinking about watching Prom Night :. <br /> <br /> -I was so tired of those dreams where these complex deaths will occur, only the main character to wake up right before she bites him. Of course, when I say "complex of death", I mean the screen is gushing throat or around the stomach. Not all "is just a dream" thing get destroyed Dallas? By the way, I wonder if a couple of punches in the gut causing immediate death. <br /> <br /> -The film only ten minutes, and I can no longer be considered a clich√© horror on two hands. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> -Even after just meeting a friend of the protagonist, I am convinced that he would die. Who wants to bet? <br /> <br /> -The killer in this film is a teacher, who will receive with the main hero of the bottom. (By the way, someone will say that the "Donna" is a terrible name for the main character in the horror film?) He spends three years in a penal colony, before breaking out and finds Donna celebrating his high school graduation. Although there is no accounting for taste, I seriously wonder who would have all the time to harass someone as dim as Donna. <br /> <br /> -High school allow pain takes place in hotels and do not keep track of the students. Apparently, students are well able to buy a hotel room and come and go as they please. I believe that if this plot point was not in place, the film will be 90 minutes of people's boredom on their mind and accidentally bite the dust when they go to the bathroom. I believe that the trade-off for these excitations my complete boredom with everything. I was playing "count the pieces of chewing gum under the seat" and "guess how much money is in my purse," and I am only in the 20th minute. How else am I to entertain yourself? <br /> <br /> -Note to self: Do not forget the milk and bread on the way home <br /> <br /> -Honey writer :. You've spent enough of false scares to go through this film and any other horror remake this year. <br /> <br /> -The 1980 version of the film was not so good, but compared with this remake of it was like Citizen Kane, or, at least, The Godfather. It was Jamie Lee Curtis in one of his many horror movies after Halloween, and it really was a little "twist" at the end. I miss Jamie Lee. I want her to act. <br /> <br /> -Apparently at the outlet there is not a lot of dancing going on. Instead the girl to quarrel with her friends on where they plan to go to college. I've heard all these college educated by name, and I can not help but wonder who these girls have to cheat away at the entrance exam to get. <br /> <br /> -The assassin must carry a bag really effective detergents and wipes his confusion between scenes. It's the only logical explanation why he could strike someone to death on the carpet or in the bathroom, and by the time someone walks into a room in a hotel, there are no signs of a struggle. (On another side note: This is a very lazy killer Michael Myers went on the hunt for their victims Just say ...) <br /> <br /> -It's official: the entire audience in the theater of the introduction of a killer. What caused it? That was when Donna went back to her hotel room while the sirens were about to leave when ordering everyone out of the building? Whether it was her constant dreams, and how even after going through something dramatic in the mentioned dream she insisted on reproducing it moves to the target? Or was it a convincing performance Brittany Snow? I must say that it was all over. <br /> <br /> Okay, that "it dies screen in the third act?" You win the pot. <br /> <br /> -Finally, the film ended. My friend turns to me and says: "Donna was not too smart." This humiliation of the week. Like it is said that a tornado small gust of wind, or a week-long break in the supply of energy a minor inconvenience. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to get on Rotten Tomatoes and see if someone gave it to move conducive review. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend. I refuse to recommend. It's lazy of the horror film, like any, and unified way to enjoy it raw plot of smell when you're under the influence of at least ten beers. And, unfortunately, for the theater patrons, alcohol is not served <br /> <br /> Evaluation :. * C ****
