I bought a blood-sucker on Ebay some time ago. I watched part and considered too stupid to see again. An excessive amount of watery "blood" in the beginning it's just outdated - not to mention the "stick around" sounds of the wind. My friends and I made a film super low budget, and the consequences are still higher than this crap festival. <br /> <br /> As for the number of errors in this film, there are too many to count. I knew that one of the actors - believe it or not, he was my teacher of theater. HA! <br /> <br /> The verdict: Do not mess with this "horror" flick. <br /> <br /> 3 star (out of 73)
