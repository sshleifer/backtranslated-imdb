We have served. - spooky movie <br /> <br /> Okay, I admit that, since I'm white and he had no practical experience in the "competitive world of step-dancing," I could not really be an expert in this type of film. On the other hand, I know a bad movie when I see it. <br /> <br /> And, boy, I've just seen him. <br /> <br /> The film is made in a low-budget-Vision and directed by Ian Iqubal Rashid ( "Touch of Pink"), "as it moves" tells the story of how important it is to follow your dreams - even if those dreams include bopping around loud, irritating the hip-hop music and let the average person dialogue would not have understood if he or she had an international translator. <br /> <br /> I will try to give a short synopsis of the "plot". First of all there are two actors who look like LL Cool J, working in an auto shop in Toronto (Mecca racial diversity), but there is still time for dance classes for eight hours a day. <br /> <br /> There are a few other guys in the "team", including the token white guy and a guy who looks like Denzel Washington in «Malcolm X» There are also two women in the film - one reminiscent of Serena Williams and other It looks like an old Geraldine «Flip Wilson Show.» One of these women was expelled from a private college, because her parents have spent all of her training at fellow drug addicts. Another girl, a member of the Salt N Pepa, without doubt, not just not good. <br /> <br /> There's one guy who looks like Buckwheat Eddie Murphy, while another actor who is Huggy Bear knock-offs. These guys vying step dancers. It is obvious that this activity is very evil in the hood, and they practiced for the big "Step Monster" jam in Detroit. <br /> <br /> Since it's hard to explain what's going on but there is a lot of arguing, I could not understand 90 percent of the dialogue (maybe some subtitles would be useful, as in the movie Bergman or one clip in the snow) Serena Williams, the girl (who never smiles, by the way) becomes independent stepper (transition from one group to another), there is some step dancing and a lot of annoying hip-hop music <br /> <br /> This is a typical story of rags to riches. such as "Rocky" with a very bad soundtrack, "by Rudy" with annoying rap music in the background, «Cry Freedom" without laughing. <br /> <br /> But why the film - which could be made a big impact on a black audience - must contain a drug addiction, a bad father and a name that sounds like a first-grader saying the phrase "How She Move" <br /> <br /? > I "moved" the movie, though. He moved to leave the theater as soon as possible.
