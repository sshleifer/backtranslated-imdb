I just loved to watch him, though pleased with his overall harmfulness of the film. I saw this film through useful sarcasm Mystery Science Theater 3000, and I have a DVD. If you turn to the other side of the DVD, they show the actual movie, so I gave him a chance. Seriously, people is grilled cheese. <br /> <br /> Act, special effects and the story as a whole is very cheesy and unrealistic. "Do not need it light," said Blood, seeing as head still can talk as long as he has no body, and Tom Servo just dreamily says: "No, her neck juice!". The ending is just a classic, and no one can touch the soundtrack of the K-porn! I loved the "cat fight" between two stripper. This "meow" after the fight scenes, or, regardless, was a classic. Thus, in a sense, it was a fun movie. I think, for horror lovers, you'll probably like it. . For a good time, to see the version MSTK3, you will get a big laugh <br /> <br /> version MST3K: 10/10 of the brain that have died: 1/10
