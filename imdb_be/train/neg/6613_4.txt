IAM big fan of Mr. Ram Gopal Varma, but I could not believe that he did this film. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag does not come anywhere close to the real Sholay. He does not leave a lasting impression on the viewer. Ram Gopal Varma does not create the chemistry between the characters. There's no camaraderie between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant Raj). There is hardly any scene of more than two people in a scene together. The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal to measure perfectly. Amitabh Bachchan did not have to make this movie. Ajay and Sushmita sen tried their best, but do not use. Razhpal Yadav in voice modulation - is inefficient and rather pointless. Mohanlal has done full justice to it and proved once again that acting is all about facial expressions and body language. The rest of the cast was lower than expected. The situation comedy, which has been adapted from the original Sholay incidence plane in the film. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal Varma could work on the script, but because of the controversy surrounded against the film, he messed up and only in order to do he did it AAG. But there are no lights.
