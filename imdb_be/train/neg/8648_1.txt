Well, basically, the film blowing! It's Blair Witch meets reckless fantasy Sean Penn on a trip to Iraq to show the world that the "war on terror" is really about. Scenario sounds like it was painted grader 8 (no offense 8 grades); two protagonists over the whole film acting; they used the wrong kind of camera, and the wrong type of film (not that I know anything about these things - but it just does not look like real documentaries I watched), and worst of all Christian Johnson took great idea and made it suck. It reminded me of the time when I tried to draw a picture of my dog ​​and end up with a very bad figure looking thing that looked more like a giant dung. I would like to see Blair Witch VIII, than to sit through it again.
