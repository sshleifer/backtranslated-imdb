Loss of control is another suggestion in the erotic thriller genre, which could be considered as a fiction film world. As a rule, they are associated with a roundabout route to the slaughter intentions, which alternate with rich undress. This is not a complaint, especially if it is a stunningly beautiful women who inhabit it invariably pretend world. <br /> <br /> Kim Ward (Kira Reed) suffers bout of writer's block. Just by chance (or is it?), She meets a man (Doug Jeffery), which comes into contact with it in an increasingly risky sexual encounters. The man refuses to give any information about himself, but Kim has steadfastly refused to dismiss the case. Her agent, Alexa (Anneliza Scott) believes that it will do wonders for her book sales. As with most films of this type, isolation is coming to an end, but some things do not add up. I've seen enough of this kind of film to think, no change there, then - but I love them. They are so unpretentious. <br /> <br /> Presentation of cast changes. Doug Jeffrey carries the film as a psycho / sociopath you do not want to cross. Kira Reed looks good, but is unable to convince the woman is in danger. Clay Greenbush as a PI is not convinced either. <br /> <br /> And, finally, the prevention of DVD viewing. Both the cover and the status of the disk R-rating and operation time as 93 minutes, but the operating time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why the sex scenes are truncated and why the performance of Jennifer Ludlow is broken just as it starts. 4 stars.
