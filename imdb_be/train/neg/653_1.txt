If I could give this film the actual rating, it will probably be in minus figures. While I respect the fact that someone has to keep making those horrible "horror" films, seriously, people who bought a ticket to this film is a waste of money that you could spend on something much more worth your time. <br /> <br /> Despite it being a horror movie, there is nothing wrong about it, if the idea is to see how many horror cliches can be placed in one movie scares you. If the rating was higher, he probably would have done to the best film in the long run. <br /> <br /> The one who made this version of «Prom Night», you screwed up. The actor, perhaps we could do a decent job, if not dubious scenarios. It was a terrible waste of a trip movie. I used to go and see, "One Missed Call" again, at least had some land.
