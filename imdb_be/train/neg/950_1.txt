I caught this movie on AZN on the cable. It sounded like it would be a good movie, the Japanese «Green Card». I can not say I ever do not like Asian film, quite the contrary. Some of the most incredible horror films of all time Japanese and Korean, and I am a big fan of John Woo's Hong Kong films. I do not mind light films of the heart, like Tampa or Chung King Express (two of my favorites), so I thought I would like it. Well, I'd like to cut my veins and drink his own blood than watching this laborious, badly acted film ever again. <br /> <br /> I think that director Steven Okazaki should be spiked water Quaalude, because no one in this film was a person. And if any of the characters DID try to act, as opposed to mumble a line or two, their performance across as forced and incredibly fake. I honestly do not think anyone ever acted before ... The only person that was sounded by this brand Aoki .. I find it strange that it promotes as a comedy, because I was laughing one time. Even more surprising is that the CBS morning news called it "refreshing breath of comedy." It was neither refreshing nor breath of comedy. And the ending was very predictable, the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think of such things. <br /> <br /> AVOID this movie if you do not want to see sad predictable story line and wood effect. I actually think that "Spike with Bensonhurst» best film acting than that ... and I went through this movie halfway!
