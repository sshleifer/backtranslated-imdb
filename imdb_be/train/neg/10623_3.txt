"Three Daring Daughters" is a sugary pink color look at the divorce, remarriage, and one of the parents lives. Obviously, the social problems and economic difficulties do not occur in an ideal picture of the life of one of the mother's parents, who feel exhausted, take a cruise, and then date and marry a stripe conductor. Even if "it's just a movie" phrase excuse script from solving real problems, suffer from the "daughters of too much incoherent high note songs, children whose Sun face based on a real child and the leader of the hose group Iturbi play itself. Is not it strange that any real man will appear in the film, in which their apparent true essence marries? <br /> <br /> I must say that this film was released in the nineteen forties. Only love for the old style Hollywood romance and comedy could do "Daughters" tolerant film.
