A film about the saber-toothed to lose in an amusement park, where young people are on a scavenger hunt. Since there are no rules, they break into the building and start getting killed off. The deaths are the cheese and dumb. But at least it was better effects when saber-toothed. I gave it three because Stacey was in it, and I loved the movie saber-toothed. I thought it was fine, but some deaths were off the screen. It was silent scene where two teens kissing and saber-toothed head pops up, and the boy leaves his girlfriend for leaving her to her look completely fake red guts. Then the saber-toothed rises in the ventilation holes and biting the baby's head. Final death of the owner was completely fake looking charts. Even the fact that death was stupid, because the statues tooth has passed through the mouth and hangs there, as it will support it, and there's a scene where Goth girl loses its contacts can not find them, and it seems that it does not need. The film is stupid and a waste of time.
