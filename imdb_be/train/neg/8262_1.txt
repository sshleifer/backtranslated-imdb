It's really scary: painfully irritating stylized singers scream and mugs gratingly rambling conversations that occur in scenes that seem to have no end and no beginning, middle and end, cut together without any visible descriptive or cognitive intentions, all in the service of some perfectly uninteresting and almost impossible to detect, "the story." What makes it worse claims the movie on the "style": a sudden camera crane with remote head downward spiral, and without any good reason there is a sudden whip-pan or wobblyhand held sessions: all this "style" can only serve to increase the almost unbelievably huge misleading the project and almost insulting material sparseness. Definitely a candidate for the worst movie ever made.
