I wrote a review of this film further down after you buy it on DVD and be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I tried to watch it again after reading a few comments made since then. As a film student and making such budgeted films himself (that is, not the budget, shot on digi cam), I stand my initial remarks. This is not a budget for a student project (and not a particularly good), released on video / DVD, to look like film awards (if you read a little bit). So deceving the public to think that it is something it is not. I want my money back on the description of the transaction are! Complete Rubbish!
