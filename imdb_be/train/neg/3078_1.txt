I do not think it was possible for a horror comedy fail so miserably on both fronts .... really awful. The fact that he does not take himself seriously (usually a good thing) running against him in the first place because the actors are so wooden you really have sworn that they read cribs. At junction, though ..... MST3K version, as always, have a few laughs ....
