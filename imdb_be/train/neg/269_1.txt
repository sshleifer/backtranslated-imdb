After seeing the first ten episodes, I have to say that this show sucks. <br /> <br /> What worries me most is the fact that the show was filmed in Canada. I know that it's cheaper, but they had to shoot him in California, so we could have a scene in the desert. It would be more accurate in the movie. The first scene, where they are outside in the other world, in the mountains, with a lot of pine trees, where it looks cold. It does'nt feel very Egyptian. What worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in ancient Egypt. Here it feels like they are running fight with the aliens in the Canadian Forest. And it's so lame that appaerantly, on other planets, fall is coming, as well. You can see the writing on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside Vancouver. It just makes the show even more incredible, and dumb. <br /> <br /> Finally, Richard Dean Anderson. He did not Kurt Russel. Of course, he does a decent job, and he's trying to copy Russels performance a bit, but it just is not as cool as Russell. And it is not as good as actor Russell. And Russells way to play O Neill, and he was much more cynical. Andersons O Neil, is too soft. I liked that version Russels just did'nt give a S ***, and there were no problems does not detonate the bomb to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Michael Shanks does a very good job as Jackson, but taking on James Spader. <br /> <br /> Teal'c really annoying character. He Jaffa. Nha Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! Former bodyguard of Ra helpless character, seen only in the pilot and one other episode so far. Teal'c says talks and acts like a robot. I've seen better acting from Jean-Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> And the fact that Teal'c and the nature of Ra, and the people they are stored in the movie, can speak in English all of a sudden too incredibly dumb. What made so scary alien in the film was the fact that they spoke in the ancient language, and were the real monsters. <br /> <br /> As for the special effects, they are really good in the pilot. But it is very rare effects in the actual show poorly made and look cheap. Specifically, they visited the planet with crystals. It is so obvious that they go to the audio from the bad to make a picture in the background. It is an insult to our viewers, that they made it look so cheap. Especially if they could do it before Bluescreen with CGi backgrounds. <br /> <br /> X-files have the best effects if they have expressed their first episodes in 1993, it was 4 years before SG-1 began. And they did'nt have an imaginary budget of two million dollars per episode that SG-1 had alleged. They have to spend all the money on food. Because I do not see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Incredibly boring and pointless show, which would be great if they filmed the show in Hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters.
