I saw an early screening of the film in New York, and I, together with my friends and almost the entire audience were very disappointed. The film was not even so bad it was good; he was lifeless, like a snakebite victim. Samual L. Jackson looked strangely tired through most of them and the consequences of snakes were inaccurate. It reminded me of one of those bad pictures SciFi, except for the cheesiness of this movie was not funny, or even old-fashioned. It all seemed worn out, flat, and open the template. I'm shocked to say that I really think that anaconda was more interesting. It is easy to understand that SOAP realizes that this work with * him and plays with him, but the fact that the film is not in a position to embark on a script that has any frightening unknown. This is the worst kind of lame movie: it's bleak.
