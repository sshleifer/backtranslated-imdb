Too many unmarried Grade B- <br /> <br /> Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days in theaters each year. Because of this, movie studios try to avoid releasing more movies estimated that over the weekend. Every few years the studio released a counter film programming female skew (2001 «The Wedding Planner"), to compete with the big game. This weekend Super Bowl similarly titled «The Wedding Date» will try to find success and attract viewers not to watch the game. <br /> <br /> Sick people feel sorry for her, one woman, Alice Kat (Debra Messing, TV's "Will & Grace") hires male escort Nick (Dermot Mulrony, «About Schmidt") put in her boyfriend's wedding his sister in London. Her family had to give her a hard time about her not in marriage, and her ex-fiance of seven years, which left her without a reason, this is the best man. In order to make him jealous Nick Kat parades around her ex, to make him see that he is missing. But in the end, Nick Kat helps to understand that it can open and let someone who loves her. <br /> <br /> The film takes too much from the likes of wedding films. It's almost vellum 1999 "Picture Perfect» and mixes in scenes like "The Wedding Planner" and «My Best Friends Wedding». The film also has a reverse "Beauty" theme going for it, and knowing its audience, the director makes a clever reference to this and other films. <br /> <br /> «wedding date" has all the elements of a typical clichéd wedding film, there are stereotypical overbearing mother (Holland Taylor, "Legally Blonde"), and virtually rip-off wedding speeches from family and friends at the wedding rehearsal and dinner. Turn in the final has been done before, but it was something that was not to be expected. The real reason why Kat dumped as a surprise and changes the direction of the film in the last half hour. <br /> <br /> While the "wedding date" is predictable, it can stand on its own, Debra Messing, in her first leading role, she proves that she can be charming and fun. Dermot Mulrony has great chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of his dialogue was too corny and unrealistic. He is able to make the best of what he gets, and be able to save the character. <br /> <br /> If you are using a lot of clever puns (often sexual), the film is really funny. Although primarily chicken-Flick film has components each can enjoy. Feel good story, and humor make this the best film released date for a long time.
