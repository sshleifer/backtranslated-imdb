This is a typical 70-soft core sex romp in the genre of Russ Meyer, though perhaps less strange than some of the work of Meyer. This film has a higher "value of production" than many of his contemporaries, offering a bigger budget. This story, writing and actions are right out of the zone B, though. Recently, the film became the basis of movie channels, B (for example, "Drive in classic") in the 500 channel universe. If the soft core that you're in the mood for, it is "good", like everything else in the band B. Do not expect that Polanski, though, just Sarni Sarni. Nothing more, nothing less. address, Jennifer Welles as "mother", perhaps the best of the actors. None of the actors in the film did not go to great fame, which is not surprising. Confessions of a Young American Housewife is far from the worst example of its kind. It's watchable, if this is your type of film. 30 years ago, it would have been the avant-garde film and Riske. You can see more or less the same things on the Showtime / HBO series these days, and in prime time.
