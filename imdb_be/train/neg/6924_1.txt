If this film was worse, it would be directed by Uwe Boll. This senseless mess makes Ed Wood look Hitchcock. It's been a while since I've seen this steaming pile, but I remember that I wanted to do grievous bodily harm for all participants. How anyone could give this movie more than 1 star amazes me to caressing all those who searched for the scar. I give it one star because it is not a rating below. All copies of the film should be burned to the ground sowed with salt and reserved as a testing ground for the most toxic waste. No, one copy should be kept under ultra Khoi security and shows only the filmmakers, as an example of how not to do it.
