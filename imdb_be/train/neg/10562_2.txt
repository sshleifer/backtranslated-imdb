This is a very low-budget caper comedy film is a success only in the low budget. Dialogue dumbfoundingly stupid chase scene equally sad, and most of the money on the screen seems to have been kept for a number of accidents and the explosion in the parking lot in the last five film minutes (short flashes port-a-potty at the beginning of the scene, of course, suffered the collapse and spew crap on the main villain of the film - no support here is not without purpose). The entire film is distressingly reminiscent of those that sometimes come out of the studio RODGER Corman, when he let the first director of a few dollars of time and the camera - but without discipline Corman impose.
