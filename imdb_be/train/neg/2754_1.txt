My initial review of this film was just a word crap written 2,000 times. Despite the fact that it was very accurate critic, I felt that my review should be a little more descriptive <br /> <br /> I'll start with the main actress. Her expression did not change once in this film, she shows no fear, joy or depression. Her skills in the language of the body is largely reduced to her eyes darting left and right, and looking like she does not know jack. It is insensitive husk, which I think is too much Botox. Her lack of facial expressions by the film outmatched but dull affair with the lead actor, who seems to jump out of nowhere and have them making out on the beach and fall in love for a few hours meeting with each other. The lead actor, whose hair requires more attention than he was mediocre at best and did not make me feel that he was really in danger. <br /> <br /> The only thing that tops heinous acts is a guide, the plot and inaccuracies in the plot. I saw tampons ads with more structure than this film. No character development, they just seem to say and do things that I could never believe that a real person is. <br /> <br /> This film would not have been bad if he was trying to be shit on purpose, like snakes on a plane, but he tries to be a major action flick that I could not even laugh. I think that now I have a brain tumor from watching this movie and coming up with all the different ways I could use this budget and Cg command to create something much better. If I bought it on DVD, I would break into pieces DVD, burn it and then dissolve it in hydrochloric acid for good measure. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
