Spoiler below, but to read or you will never know the terrible fate that awaits all planing to rent «Rodentz». <br /> <br /> In a moonlit night in the research laboratory of distance, a major medical breakthrough about to have deadly results. The chemical compound, which was created for the "hunt and destroy the" deadly cancer cells leaked from the dangerous waste disposal system in the basement of the building. Now, rodents, participating in laboratory experiments not only at the top of the rats in the facility, which will be modified species. Professor Schultz, Bio-leading researcher has just found that the addition of the new enzyme now allows its "hunt and destroy" preparation for regeneration to the length of time necessary for the neutralization of cancer death. If three different degrees new mixture is administered three different rat and the rest poured defective «Waste danger" plums, disturbing side effects lead to night terror right ..... ..... <br /> <br /> Seriously this is probably the worst film I've seen this year. Everything about it screams "low-budget", from the monstrous actions before special effects, which are one of the worst I have ever seen. Clichéd characters morons and act stupid, predictable fashion: walking the dark corridors alone, looking for a cat, stumbling and falling, so that the "rat" could catch up with them, planting himself in a small room, etc. <, Br /> <br /> while some films are cheaply made, this film really takes the cake. Every possible angle cut, everything from reusable previous rounds, shot a "laboratory" for vestibules from different angles, to make it more (That reminds me - why only two guys who work in this Freakin 'massive building?!?! ?!?.), music and special effects, which could be done on the children's workshop PC <br /> <br /> this brings me to the worst aspects of this steaming pile of manure - special effects. Just awful. Computer generated rat look so fake and stand out in every scene, so that even the blunt of movie lovers can see that they are the computer. And this giant rat costume - OH MY GOD !!!!!!!! Seriously, we have to believe that uncontrolled beany baby monster? Just pathetic ........ At best, some of the baked looks pretty cool, especially considering the budget. <br /> <br /> actors all suck. no one associated with the production did not care to know what they are doing. I spent enough time with the review, just my advice, it's garbage. . 1/10 <br /> <br /> About the DVD: Transfer sucks, the sound is passable and there is a commentary track on the disc and directed by two of his friends, who say that they had absolutely nothing to do with making the film, but there were to ask questions and make comments. All three of these original non-human mucus so incredibly stupid that they should be institutional, before they can cause harm to themselves or others. I do not want you to spend more time or my venerable reader, because I'm starting to remember more than I want to about this movie ..... DVD rating: 1/10.
