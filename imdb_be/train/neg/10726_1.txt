I agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the film is quite good, and you get the wandering that will ....... there is nothing. All the story lines open remains open; two characters who at first glance, they might have some meaning completely eliminated from the picture, with the exception of 1 or 2 is very short scenes. I wander when Ilya did it would be better just to leave them completely .... As for the one remaining character, nothing to do with it either. She's just visiting some god-awful place, and suddenly the film is not about her anymore, but some of the geriatric witches, who spend their days making dolls out of bread, drank homemade vodka, and apparently flashing each other. Someone may say that the film does well showing a crumbling society, judges IFFR, but for me it's just bad taste, bad camera-work, lousy script and frighteningly bad direction. Therefor I can not be as generous as my predecessor, when it comes to sorting: 1!
