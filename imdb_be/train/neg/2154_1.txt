Let me confess. I found this video to be used and bought it because Gutenberg looked so sexy in underwear on the shirt. But inside was a different story. In addition, the film was basically a parody of "The Invisible Man" genre effects (highly visible lines, and other similar attributes), the scenario without losing the chance - in fact it went out of its way - not just insulting -WASP race and real or imaginary -gomaseksualisty. Every insult directed at the person in the scenario was a homophobe or racist or both. He begins to grate on the nerves, with the shaky sound, candid- camera style photography and melodramatic story. However, the end of some surprise. But by the time you get there, you hardly care less. Too bad, it could have been quite a good movie.
