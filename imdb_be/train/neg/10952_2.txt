I hate this movie has absolutely no creative input. I know what they're going for realism, but to be open, I just do not want realism. Realism sad. If I want to see the daily life, I uh, live. Tell me an interesting story, and we'll talk. I can deal with the low production values, hell I'm a sucker for low production values, but, at least, work in some good ideas. The direction is only to capture video camera and walk around a bit, but obviously I have to dig, because it makes things a lot more realistic. Hitchcock said the drama, in fact life dull bits cut out. I can only conclude that it is not a drama, not by a long shot. We will see Rosetta to go somewhere, Rosetta is working in a bakery, eating waffles Rosetta, Rosetta carry bags far, Rosetta to go home, Rosetta to go somewhere ... it's just not that interesting. There is really no deeper meaning, either. I'm so bored I started looking for some reflections on life in this film, but it's just realism, the most valued quality in the business. I believe that I have to love it, but come on, there's nothing there.
