This is almost certainly worse than Western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula is especially common in westerns and martial arts movies - the hero learns that family / friends have been killed, so the hero is sent to the exact location of the film inefficient lawyer who rescues a kidnapped girl and the murder of a loving expert arch nemesis in a tough duel. This formula was often successful - otherwise it would not be a formula - but Gunfighter is the babble of doing this you will ever see. Scenarios terribly unsophisticated and offensive; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue, because it lacks depth, maturity and realism. bad sound; He sometimes looks duplicated. Cinema is lame, and sets sometimes only the facades. Actions are helpless; Of course, some of the performers could blame the script, but others can not use that excuse. I hope that I have never seen Chris Lybbert in conversational role ever again; every time he said that the line, which must be evil or mean that it does nothing more than to lower the tone of his voice, and it sounds just like a child trying to act macho. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check your clothes (if you decide to see this movie): It is the brand-new clothes that make it look more like Roy Rogers than the hard-working, down and dirty cowboy, if you like silly cinematic fare, which serves only to worship an imaginary greatness Hopalong Cassidy, you will get it, but if you have more than two neurons to watch something else.
