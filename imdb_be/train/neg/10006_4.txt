I do not know who is to blame, timid or ignorant writers director. It seemed like one of those movies where so much has been paid to the stars (Angie, Charlie, by Denise, Ryazanov and John), there was not enough left to really make the movie. This could be very interesting, but there was a veil of shyness, even cowardice, which hung over every scene. Since it was rated R is why the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with the 70-year-old woman, and Angie Harmon? Why Sheen sleepwalking through a potentially hot relationship with two of the most beautiful and sexy actresses in the world? If they are looking only for a laugh why not throw Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead? It was so predictable I was surprised to find that the director was not five years. What a waste, not only for the audience, but also for the actors as well.
