SciFi has had some very bad luck creating quality films in recent years (such as the Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel should be based a great epic Beowulf, however, it deviates so much (and offers so little in comparison) that television advertising may also call it some kind of a crappy movie Christopher Lambert. I did not expect that it will be just the same as a full-blown Hollywood production, but nevertheless expect "artistic integrity", so as not to interfere with the actual story (even if it was slightly modified to make storyboards flow at two beautiful in the allotted time intervals). <br /> <br /> Or the director and producers have no idea about what they are doing (doing any research goes into it?). Obviously not, as one could tell from the massive horned helmets, Beowulf and his team (except for mullet boy) wears. One of the main problems I have, even though he was from the look of Grendel ?? When Beowulf must fight with him, should not he was sixteen feet tall and weighs 2 tons? Grendel's death segment is also missing in all respects ?? in my opinion, one in the epos was actually better than the painted trash on the script; for example: Grendel, presumably, his arm torn from Beowulf outlet ?? Sun is cut on the forearm after he was set on fire an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300 pounds! And Grendel's mother ?? they just combine it with a dragon at the end of the epic, where he eventually dies, if he succumbs to his wounds? And honestly, what the hell is with that mullet? <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie, because his relationship with the epic ??. No, because in fact it is not the only one (except for the iconic names). The only way I would recommend this movie if you liked the movie Druids (directed by Jacques Dorfmann) ?? although I do not recommend playing either.
