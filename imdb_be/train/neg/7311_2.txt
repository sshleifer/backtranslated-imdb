Well, I've heard a bit about this film, so that when he came to the movie channels on TV, I would like to see it being a horror fan. I think I can make a collective "huh?" For anyone who watched it. <br /> <br /> I decided to move on with his life, but at a party with my closest friends, we saw approaching, and some of us saw it had already decided that we would laugh our way through it, we both declaring "this stupid thing I've ever seen." It was not terrible; Ill give it a Roth (who I think is a young hack); characters change throughout the film, ala "Cube". <br /> <br /> However, in spite of your typical "rat in a cage", which will be the scenario turn on who and so on, it was pretty average horror. <, Br /> <br /> a few points: 1.) What is with this kid? I'm not even talking about it being weird and bite people. I'm talking about the whole "slow carat foot traffic," what was it? 2) Well, I know the character of Ryder liked Jordan Ladd, but as a young woman, I was shocked that he just went ahead and stuck to her in a dream. Well, that's illegal. <br /> <br /> 3.) Roth in the film simply because Roth can be in the film. It's about aimlessly to write yourself! 4.) What was with the deputy? 5.) So she just immediately take away a dog? And there was little to no blood left? Just a piece of her jeans? Anyway, we laughed our asses, and I like to laugh while watching a horror movie (The Return of the Living Dead 2 Evil Dead), but I do not know when we were supposed to laugh here ...
