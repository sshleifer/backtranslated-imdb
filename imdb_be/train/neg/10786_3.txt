As this film was made so many big stars is beyond me. This is a terrible clich√© 'ridden film acting with the worst of any of these actors have ever made. It really surprises me that many of them will agree to a list of stars for this unfunny film. What's worse is that made nearly 100 million here in the states. It really goes to show, however, that the big stars can pull in dollars, even if the movie is terrible. I was sorry for all those involved in this festival snoring. Billy Crystal did his best with what he was given, and the rest of the stars seemed to be going through the motions. Whatever you do, do not cast for outstanding gypsum, because no one could save it.
