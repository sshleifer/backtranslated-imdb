Sold out as the most offensive MOVIE EVER, guaranteed to offend EVERYONE- Guess what? He was working, I was offended that we put money to rent it. Two friends and I was bored and decided to see if all that bull about the film, which we saw on TV was true. Curse of Comedy Central and all other networks that have promoted this garbage on us! This is definitely the worst film I've seen from the Hollow Man. I generally avoid bad ones, but got caught up in this. Since then, we have broken a shot that offers to remove it, and his film collection privileges were abolished. There's nothing remotely funny about this film ... even the "Adventures of Dickman 'scene was babbling at best .. Expand me p *** ed. Thought maybe the volume of production has been an important cause of some shit ... no..it simply sucks. NEVER WATCH IT! for any reason. Not even copious amounts of this movie is funny banned substances. This is evidenced by the many. Please, for the love of all that is holy, if you value your sanity- never watch this movie. That's a lot of things: stupid, pointless, and does not cost anything, to name a few. But most importantly, he is aiming for: offensive funny- he failed miserably. The collapse and burn ....
