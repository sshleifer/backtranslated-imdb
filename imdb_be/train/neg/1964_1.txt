When I saw this film a little, the first thing that I thought that it was done for a video. The second thing that came to mind, as it seems to look at another scary movie «Darkness Falls», the story of this dumb witch who killed a man in the dark. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was completely masterpiece compared to this bunch of garbage, and this film was not made. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a little background for a witch, or rather how pointless introduction of two small children, who are going to meet the tooth fairy in the hope of giving them her brand new bike for their teeth. Opening removed bad, and the rest of the film, it certainly is not terrible. Currently, the film is about Peter (Locklin Monroe). Peter renting his house, and his ex-girlfriend Darcy (Chandra West), Cole and her daughter came to stay there. Cole meets the vicinity of the child, and they talk about the tooth fairy and you should not lose a tooth, or she will come to you. Unfortunately, after a few seconds, it looks like the Tooth Fairy steals her bicycle and knocking her tooth (paradoxically). Will Cole survive the wrath of Tooth Fairy, and her mother and Peter will be able to save her, and revive their romance ... it's a bad film, you probably understand it. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with this idiotic movie as undefined Tooth Fairy. They say that it kills you if you lose your tooth, but no. It is more like a serial killer, who kills at random, and if you lose a tooth, you definitely will go. She steals the bike, so it seems, the thief too. I have already said that the idea of ​​this film was based on Darkness Falls, but where do they get the inspiration for the appearance of the tooth fairy? We'll see. It looks like a burn victim, and she had walked around the neighborhood children face. Mmm ... it's almost as if it is true plagiarism Freddy Krueger from "Nightmare on Elm Street" films. And it's not the worst of this dreadful disorder, menopause. This film is probably the most ridiculous climax (not just ridiculous, because I found that it is more sick than funny) I've ever seen. If you do not see it. <br /> <br /> Just a little trivia. Locklin Monroe was in a terrible movie, and Jianna Ballard was Scary Movie 3, and they were both in this, apparently, so Scary Movie stars have to finish his career with bad horror movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** 1/2. 80 min. R for violence.
