Which is a documentary about the musician can not include one track by the artist himself? In contrast to the "Ray" and countless other films about musical artists, half the fun in the theater (or couch) is once again facing a large song. Here, all the tracks are cover worn uninteresting characters, and the issue is not able to capture the slow, jazzy style Cohen. Most often cover bad sang folk version. Ugh. <br /> <br /> In an interview with the same or more with other musicians and figures and not with yourself Cohen. Only in rare cases do feature film Cohen read his work (never sings) - as letters, poems, etc. The film does not capture a lot about the history of the artist's life, or, or of its development for many years. A huge disappointment for a large fan Cohen.
