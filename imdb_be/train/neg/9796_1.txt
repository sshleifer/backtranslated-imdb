Well, I seriously can not think of anything worse than a series of PR. There are a lot of bad things in my life ... traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers need to be at the bottom of this list. You can think of anything more stupid than five or six teenagers (who do not even behave like a normal teenager) dancing around in identical suits in different colors so you can tell them apart? Fans, have you ever faced with a real person who gets thrown against a wall and of the mental arises almost immediately and continues to fight without getting hurt? Power Rangers for five-year-old boys, and believe me, I've never liked this show, even when I was five. <br /> <br /> I think you can say Dino Thunder is no exception. Teens actually behave like teenagers, and Tommy Oliver actually acts as a teacher, or not, the teacher. He has a teenage humor, although the fight is lame, I do not hate Dino Thunder. <br /> <br /> A lot of people say that the Power Rangers that shit, but I would not. It would be an insult to shit. So openly, five year-old boys, Power Rangers garbage.
