I question the motives of the creators of this fictional account of the motives of the BTK killer. They are trying to portray the animal defenders in patients with monsters? Who is responsible for this? Do not they think that the people associated with this monster enough to hurt? What special disrespect and exploitation of the victims! It was like an experiment face: What bothers you more human carnage or murder? They used the actual names of some of the victims .... this movie was disgusting, disrespectful and insulting! The creators of this movie used this tragedy to their own agenda! People need to wake up and redraw the line!
