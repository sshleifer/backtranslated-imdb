After stopping at a movie store to find something to watch, we stumbled upon it. It looked attractive resume, at least, so we gave it a try. And here's the kicker: the first 20 minutes of interesting! It's actually nice! Oh wait, spoke too soon. <br /> <br /> Somewhere, the film took a sickening twist to the fundamental rights of Christian brainwashing. Not quite sure what was going on, but I think that the writer has found God somewhere, finished writing the script, and there was no time to change it, because he had a meeting KKK, to get to his friends of the Westboro Church and hood WASN Â«t clean. <br /> <br /> You can put a warning on this matter? I refuse to support this religious idiocy. Just as video games have a rating system, movie need some sign: maybe a little cross in the lower right corner to show us that the film is going to take a turn for the worse <br /> <br /> If you do not share. feelings with any moron came up with this story, and will have your Bible open on her lap while you're watching it, and plan how you will convert your neighbor, do not waste your time. These are some of the worst stuff that came in for a very long time, and radical religious nuts do not need more money.
