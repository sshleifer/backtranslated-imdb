Ugh! And I say again ... YUCK! The original version of this film is the story of a man who was already dead and management through purgatory was well directed. The original film was a lot to say and did not go out of their way to say it. And it was a naked chick on a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This version seems to me something that the producer bought the rights, and then thrown with disinterest. It looks as if a group of people consciously decided to fit it in the nineties and changed the ethnic group and sex just to be nice. The film is not about burnout is going to commit suicide in the last act of defiance. We are talking about a man who tries to get to the hospital to see his wife. <br /> <br /> There was no reason for this film was made, except to make me angry ...
