I was tricked into seeing this film after reading a positive response from another site and the person I was p.o'd !!! it took me at least 15 minutes to take it off the shelf b / c I do not want anyone to see me. then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it on the counter and actually use real money to rent it out. I thought that all my stress will be repaid by the time I got home and watch a movie b / c I read the review said the film was a pleasant surprise; what a joke! if you can make it through the first hour of the film, then your in the success! b / not until the film turns in horror. do not bother with these people, your better watch Â«dankness falls"
