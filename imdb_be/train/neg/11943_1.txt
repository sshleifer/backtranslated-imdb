The scenery is quite nice and the dog. In addition, the film has absolutely nothing to recommend it. Jack Ward nice brilliant, as usual, but the script is so terrible that even he comes off badly. The plot does not make sense, dumb dialogue, and there are numerous minor faults. But the dog is cute ...
