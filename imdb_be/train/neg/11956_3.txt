This movie stinks. I do not think I've ever seen a film so stretched to the shock. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was superflat and action was bland. This could be a good movie. I think it just relied on this grotesque visuals. I can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboo, but he felt as Miike was shooting for shooting him. Only one poorly executed film. There's just nothing to be entertained by watching this film if you are fascinated exhausts itself with explicit scenes of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, milking itself, parents and siblings abuse and fecal extension. I think I just sold the film for many of you, but I meant when I said it was no good. He excelled in other films, but I think you'd better watch who harass.
