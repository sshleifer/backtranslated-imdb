Not that I call myself with joy at the sight of a realistic shed blood, but when I put the DVD in the waiting for the carnage, and the fact that I get one bloody episode (eyeball) at the tail end of an ass fake slap, and spinning in a desk chair I end up thinking, "well, it's 43 minutes of my life is gone forever." I would not believe it, or flower of flesh and blood "cinema" as much as an exercise of will; to see if you can sit through them. Flower of flesh and blood were a few tough spots to watch. Experiment devil did. It was at best foolish and at worst ... well ... very stupid. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I put the DVD thinking "about man, it's going to be sick." After watching them a fake slap women around a thousand times, I watched it in fast-forward. <br /> <br /> The two kinds of people would be interested in this movie. 1) People who are looking F'd to movies, to see how F'd it actually, or 2) complete horror. I searched for this and other films of Guinea Pig for the latter reason, but even if I fell into the category of the former, this film will not float my boat. In fact, I could imagine this film by increasing their blood lust ... like "YOU JUST Kill B * TCH ALREADY !!" So, in conclusion, the only reason to have this film for collection purposes. If you want to Carnage, the traditional horror does not get followed by death. Of course, it sucks, too, but at least you'll get blood and guts, what do you expect. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can see for anyone who praises this shit, because they feel that they need. No art that I can see no reason for its popularity, there is nothing. Just a lame attempt to shock.
