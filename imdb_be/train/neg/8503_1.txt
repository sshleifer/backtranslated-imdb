all European studios are involved in this, you think that you at least get a beautiful picture; but the local color is kept to a minimum <br /> <br /> Irritation # 1 Mira Sorvino, using a Russian accent to play the Spanish cop. - WTF? History hopelessly confused. There's supposed romantic backstory, which deliberately confused - she is not a lesbian? - it serves no purpose at all. The cops in the film the most decorated stupid serial killer movie for a long time. There seems to be a message of the mid '30s the Spanish Civil War, but has since pretty much everyone involved in that death, one does not see the point. <br /> <br /> Despite the bull fighting background of the story (which part? who can tell), you'll never get a good look at a bullfight. Earnest Hemingway would have hit the director in the nose - with my blessings.
