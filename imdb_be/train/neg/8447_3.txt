I do not know what I missed, but I can not believe all these positive reviews from many people on this film. I thought it was silly, and a little above. I did like the performance Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker, but the rest was just ... boring. <br /> <br /> Now, I, as a B movie, I'm sure, but it was a little further down the alphabet I am. I saw someone compare the humor and horror in the «Army Of Darkness» and «by Shaun of the Dead" and "on par with Re-Animator». You must be joking. I did not find this film funny, he tried, it was to make an effort (perhaps too much effort), but it failed, in my opinion. By the time I was struck with the third or 4th one-liner I rolled my eyes and checking his watch. <br /> <br /> There's definitely a homage to several other films made, which is always cool, kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans. But here, perhaps, it was only the lack of original thought. True, there were some good special effects, good of Gore, but it can not carry the entire film. Mutated Grant looked like a cross between Jabba the Hutt, and in the early stages of mutation- Chet «Weird Science» (after he turned into a monster) and one of the alien creatures / s «The Explorers» children. It just does not work. I thought it looked like something a guy with a Grade 5 class art could designed. Then there was Brand, a woman, that Grant soaked and chained in a barn. If the aid finally arrived, it looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped. The design was once again completely prosaic. Round, flesh-colored ball with the face in the middle. * Yawn * <br /> <br /> Now zombies- The more films that I see with zombies in them these days, the more I want George A. Romero was a patent for them was the only writer / director led to movies about them. He is the only person so far to do it properly, with the exception of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (but it was a comedy). Oh, and Danny Boyle, but they were a different style zombies. Maybe Mr. Romero has destroyed any zombie movie for me because of his brilliant ability to get his actors to moan, groan and pull his legs alleging that their connections dry and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid, and their muscles are fighting effects due to rigor mortis, which began to set in right before they were re-animated. People «Wheelsy» simply has the right motivation ... they were horrible zombie. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, I give «Slither» 3 for laughs and a few pairs of beautiful scenes. mountains
