my friend bought the film for 5 ?? (He was not even a penny's worth), because they wrote it as American Pie. but we soon find out that there is a long way from the American pie this piece of shit. it's not even a comedy, it more accurately a very bad documentary. not only the history is bad, the picture and sound sucks too. they put some alcohol, chickens, dwarf and drunken teenagers. and the result is a disaster. when you see this film does not buy it, and spend the money on something else, and better. if you torture yourself, do not invite your friends / s, if you really hate a lot, and you want to get rid of them.
