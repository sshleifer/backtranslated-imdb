I actually had hopes for this film, because I saw Curry in a few other things, and I think she has some talent. Unfortunately, it is a hopeless case study in what not to do in the script. Completely undefined symbols without any appeal, and no story at all. This is a road / buddy / comedy / thriller / romance / drama? The filmmakers have no idea, and nor do we.
