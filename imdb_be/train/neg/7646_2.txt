The film, which follows a struggling actor, playing, apparently, from the struggles of the actor, it does not do any good for Chris Klein. He struggles to bring something memorable role and meanders on through a shallow script chapters to reflect what can only be described as polite leading man. History exists, but that's all, and do not show any major beginning, a middle and an end, and the viewer is shrugging feeling as if nothing in the last hour and three quarters really happened. <br /> <br /> A bright light in the middle of Fred Durst, who manages to stand above it, seemingly average talented co-stars and makes a half-decent job of providing backward Legde character to life. If Fred can recreate it at work with a higher caliber of gypsum remains to be seen, but I'l be looking for them in the future.
