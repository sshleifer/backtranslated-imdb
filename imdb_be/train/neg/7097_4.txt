This film has the inexorable class B low prices for all of his scenes, effects, etc., to make you think that they spent 80% of its budget to Connery. This look like some things Wing Commander after Star Wars (quite independently of the content) <br /> <br /> story can be described in a word :. FLAT. And my God, I can not remember the villain so uninteresting, since a long time ago. We do not give any reason why he is so angry (a birth defect, we bring to think :) nor any real malice convincedness or smell it. <br /> <br /> If you're Connery, and go rent `Forrester Hunting."
