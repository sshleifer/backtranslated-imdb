Never saw the original film in the series ... I just hope it was much better than the movie is made or continued in 1980, as if it were not so, how were these two terrible sequels even justified. This film was really good in the lead when they advertised it to be shown in one of the oldest independent stations that are in the past. In any case it looked like it would be a very good horror movie. It was, however, a film that would make some of Walt Disney movies darkens. In fact, this movie was just a bunch of fluff with little or no light swampy creeks creatures to be seen. The only real sighting is near the end, when you see its shape for a very heavy rainfall, in addition, that there is almost no sign of the creatures, which was really disappointing as a child. The story is mostly old evil hunters kill everything they see and are found after being swampy backwaters and children, to help him or just some random hairy guy in the woods who likes to pull the occasional boat through the water. Nya really worth watching, I would, however, like to see the original, provided maker that would also made a bad swamp creature from the 80s, but he also made a very good slasher film in the 70's «The Town The Last Sundown».
