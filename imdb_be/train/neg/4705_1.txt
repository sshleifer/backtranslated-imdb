My favorite memory of this show, and the band was when I went with a bunch of my friends who NBB haters and had a big fire, and we took the disc of their songs and DVD movie and a bunch of pictures of the band members, and cast them into the fire and dancing happy jig «Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead» around the burning material during the singing. It was the best thing in the show, and the show silly Capitol God this show sludge. I hate it so much. Get rid of a bad car. You guys really suck! You really ruined the whole canal! No offense or anything, but you guys do not need to get a life, I mean, really, who does stupid show with silly singer who can not sing! You guys actually sounds awful, and you need to get a life as a tramp or something other than Roselina. She is very beautiful. But still, you guys hack!
