Elfriede Jelinek, not quite yet rated, is the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. Her novel has created a film that won the second prize at Cannes and the main prizes for male and female leads. Can I a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation and art has become so debased that everything is going? <br /> <br /> «eat, Gobble» is the preferred spelling office in England bubble noise produced in Turkey. In the world of cinema turkey monumental flop, as measured by cash checks or critical reception. «Gobble, Gobble» Pianist and are ideal partners. <br /> <br /> unpleasant formidable this widely praised film can not be exaggerated. It starts very badly, as though done to annoy the viewer. Loans interruption of non-essential scene for more than 11 minutes. We meet with Professor Erika Kohut, apparently alter ego accoladed writer, professor rocky piano. She lives with her husky and domineering mother. Pope institutionalize madman who dies invisible during what passes for action. <br /> <br /> Overview Pianist difficult for the registration of his troubles. What we see in the movie (and possibly read in a book, as far as I know) is a tasteless, exploitative, pointless story of the emotional pendulum that swings back and forth without moving forward. <br /> <br /> Erika, whose name is used minimally, originally shown as a man with an intense musical sensibility, but otherwise completely suppressed. Not really, because there are bags on the two steps of the scene with her raspy voice maman early on that end rich apology. If the reviewer is to (yawn) leitmotif extract (why not use a pretentious word, if easier could be done), strongly alternating Elrika mood would be it. <br /> <br /> A young handsome, Walter, to study to become a "low voltage" engineer to it, and play hockey in his few moments of leisure, also a talented pianist. He meets an old-fashioned Elrika live in a luxurious apartment that may or may not be Paris. The fight this fashion art, he immediately falls in love and begins to "Cherche la femme." <br /> <br /> Repressed Erika has adherence to a rigid pornography, as shown for a short time, but graphically for a few seconds, whereas it sniffs tissue taken from a waste basket private booth where it looks. <br /> <br /> Walter performs a brilliant audition and reluctantly accepted as a private student of by Erika, whose teaching style is characterized by remoteness, hostility, sadness and humiliation. <br /> <br /> soon he declares his love and by the time haunts Erika in her, where they participate in a soft hanky panky and incomplete oral sex. Erika retains control over her love Swain. She promises to send him a letter for further instructions pleasant exchanges. <br /> <br /> At the same time, frighteningly jealous because of the kindness of Walter to a nervous student who literally having fouls before the rehearsal for a future concert, by Erika student fills his coat pocket with broken glass, causing serious cuts the soft piano hand. <br /> <br /> next main stage (bypassing genital mutilation, etc.) has Walter turn up into apartment Erika shares with its mother. Erika wants to be humiliated, tied, hit, etc. Smart Walter, at the moment, reflected and marches into the night. <br /> <br /> At the moment, there is still almost an hour to go. The viewer can only fear the worst. Erika Walter dogs rink, where he carries out his hockey practice. They retire to the back room. Lusty Wally is unable to resist the hand pulling pants. His "baby sauce" was soon expelled from other stomach contents. Ho hum. <br /> <br /> Reflected but twisted, perhaps wanting to avenge the insult, so recently barfed on the floor, Walter returned to the apartment of Erica. Can you guess what's going on now? It is not very deep or difficult. Yes, it gets rough, and Eric becomes a victim. At one point he maman lock in his room and slamming by Erika, the next he kicks her in the face, have sex with her and update their declarations of love. <br /> <br /> Am I being unfair in this summary? Watching a movie, if you want, but I would advise not to do it. <br /> <br /> Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand, if they are in the right mood. I was able to talk in a complex picture of human relations, conveyed this film, if I wanted to. But I prefer not to ", because it is cheap and cheerful film that appeals to base instincts and do not say anything. <br /> <br /> I have to say that parenteral repressed Erika yearns for love, looking for his ineffective pornography wrongfully rejects it when it is literally pink and throbbing under the nose, belatedly realizes that she does not like to be hurt, blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> the world is, for the reasons not explained, slowing her She apparently makes the monster of those who appeared outwardly loving -. but of course, we all know that Juba people potentially hard rapist, because that is its essence, however, as he tries to convince himself and the world, otherwise <br /> <br. /> at the end of the day, if you have the patience to be there, there is a small turn. Before we proceed to the final stage where it is because of performance as a substitute for underwear, student contamination with torn hands, knife by Erika packages in a handbag. Voltaire? <br /> <br /> Yes, you're ahead of me . It permeates himself in none life-threatening area and leaves. Roll credits. <br /> <br /> If it received the second prize in Cannes, how bad were the rest of the recording?
