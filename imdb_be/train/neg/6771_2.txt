There are some sublime things to say about it, but I can mention, Matt Dillon is doing everything possible to make something out of nothing, and many split screens and chart standing. Since most of the racing films suffer from the premise that car lovers are not so smart, we end up with a movie like this. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Lohan, who surprised many in Mean Girls must make the best decisions which roles to take, where it can only fail. <br /> <br /> The children will be entertained by gently because he is trying to appeal more adults than children (although still pretty dumb). Those in the theater I saw it did not show any real interest after a few minutes. And as family sports movie is terrible. The best moments at the beginning of the dump, creating a sense of, and later in a car-Bash festival creates some tension. If you are developing the car as the central character, you have to develop it better than here. After a few obligatory racing scenes you are in the best part: the opportunity to leave their own car in the multiplex.
