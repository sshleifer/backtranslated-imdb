The film was hard to grasp, and when I finally saw his disappointment was overwhelming. I mean, it's one of the biggest stories of the twentieth century: an unidentified man takes advantage of unsuspecting airline industry and runs away with millions in ransom, without hurting anyone or bungling attempts. With all this built-in interest in how someone could make such a lackluster, to say loaded with a wave of real life events. While Williams is always interesting, the writers suggested that D.B. Cooper persons were stereotypically heroic like a movie star, what we get is a type without involving parts or penetration in the human mind is daring enough and smart enough to pull it out. Harrold practically steals the film with her courage and sheer beauty, but the real disappointment was in the processing area and the lame direction. Shame on this film even existing.
