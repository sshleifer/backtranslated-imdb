Caught this film on the tube on Sunday. I thought it was so bad, I looked it up on IMDb, to see what others think about it. I was not surprised by the number of stupid people that take advantage of this down. I was surprised, however, when I looked at the comments read hated category only to find that they were not. I was impressed with this; I always look at it as hated them there are always those who do not hate the movie, no matter how good it is. Somehow this film made it through the whole contempt I say to the fact that even to call with pride that I hate this movie! I know that I have to go into detail about why I hate this film, but to do so will only provide the movie more respect than he deserves.
