For the life of me I can not understand the good reviews about this piece of shit. It was pointless. Matthew Modine was horribly miscast as the lead female saint. Gina Gershon, well, others have said, but I repeat, why the stupid accent? It is not necessary. And her acting was simply bad. I do not know when she was cast accent or something. There was no chemistry between the two. <br /> <br /> A girl Modin was in love, she suddenly pushing salads half a head in the mouth and acting stupid way? Where did this come from? I think we should have to feel sorry for her, as we have seen, that her marriage with a workaholic begins to break down, but honestly, I could not care less about any of these people.
