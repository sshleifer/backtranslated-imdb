If you can believe it, * other * a group of teenagers to return to the * other * at the lakeside cabin in three years after the * other * one of those fatal "accidents" claimed one of their number. Low and behold, a psycho wearing hockey mask patterned (cheap paper one at that) is to spend them one by one. This mechanical "Friday the 13th" knock got a small reputation as one of the first signs in digital form once, but that's where it ends interesting facts and all that remains predictable, amateur production with sub-par performance and repeated boom-mic invasion. And on the last the second turn does little to lift the mood, and the "Day of Remembrance" is that it is best tossed into the lake and was forgotten. One just crazy chopper collectors.
