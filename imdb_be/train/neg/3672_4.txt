I watched the entire film, recognizing participation William Hurt, Natascha McElhone and désirée nosbusch. I am glad that I did not have any idea about the presence of Peter Weller. At the end of the movie I said, "Peter Weller?" Kudos to Mr. Weller for their excellent performance. Weller played the main character, and his performance was such that I did not even recognize him. <br /> <br /> In general, the plot was bad writing was bad, and performance, in addition to those, Nosbusch and Weller, were subpar. the scenery and setting were interesting, and Weller was strange. <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of a possible 10.
