I liked Batman: Dead End. Dark nervous system for the Batman film noir was committed. Batman: Dead End well. This is not so. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me start with action. None of them is not really that good. The best would be, probably, Clark Bartram Batman. But this is not saying much. He is good at first glance, but then you realize that that's what he is, a bodybuilder who happens to be a tolerable actor. But the main problem is that Batman does not belong in the daytime, it looks like a freak running around in Bat costume. Instead of terrible scar a person tries to compensate for past mistakes. Daylight also displays irritating blunt scowl on his face Bartram, who never leaves and unoticeable in Batman: Dead End, probably because of the darkness that is so short welcome in this trailer. Bertram seems to think that sullen and stubbornly shaking his head acts, it is not, it is quite the opposite. This is called staging, the real actors to avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> Something I never understood why Collora cast body-builders as designated. It makes much more sense to give the role of the actor, who can manage it, not a bodybuilder who can manage their originally his, but hey looks like as a comic! Of course, they could have done better if dialouge Collora did not leave much to be desired. <br /> <br /> The whole trailer (yes, the trailer. There will not be a full-length movie) is more centered around the then Superman Batman. But all on the side of Superman banal, annoying and amateurish. Michael O'Hearn (Superman) is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He stands around, smiling, says his line. That's about it. Although I am not surprised, because he just bodybuilder they hired, and maybe got a few acting lessons. Once again I say Collora, cast the actors. Nha bodybuilders. Actors will be much more convincing that we forgive the fact that they do not look much like a comic book. <br /> <br /> The suit would be expected to wear a Superman. As for the costume of Batman. Well, I suppose that it only looks good in the dark. I say this because in some shots costume looks like something you would buy from Halloween gift shops. <br /> <br /> Superman flying in this film. But this is not a good thing. These pictures look especially amateur. This and a lot of "film" looks like it was filmed in the backyard with a VHS camera. <br /> <br /> The best images of Superman shot to catch the car in his hands. And the last shot of the Two-Face and Batman in the end. For those of you who have seen the trailer. You know what I'm saying. Now if he could only be stretched, which permeated the entire trailer. <br /> <br /> And finally, I ask. Why, when you're trying to show his ability as a director, you would like to make a short movie trailer? It does not prove anything, when it comes to the actual history of the Director. My only advice for Collora there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and be able to work in marketing <br /> <br /> Batman :. Deadlock did not feel lover. I can not figure out where it went wrong.
