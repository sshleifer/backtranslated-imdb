I admit, coming into the age-Dippy Hippy age, I'm a sucker for this kind of movie. I can enjoy some of the hippie genre schlock much more than most "normal" people. However, this film is simply awful in every conceivable way. <br /> <br /> Every banal perception of hippie nonsense presented as gospel, police killed the young long hair when he peacefully landing aircraft. This film is so bad that it is not even funny to watch as a goof on the excesses of the hippie hum. It's like a left-wing version of the seine, except without professional actors. The only reason I gave it two stars because there is some confusion percent on the soundtrack to the same, I could not find the option for negative stars. <br /> <br /> a lot of actors, almost no plot, sheeze, hardly even a script ... you got it, "art" film .... All this is done in a root canal drilling slow, drawling every senseless scene just to fill the time. <br /> <br /> in a bizarre twist of life imitating art, the star of «nonactor» from the film joined a commune in real life and robbed a bank in Boston, one of his colleagues was killed by robbers, and he was sent in prison, where he was killed in a suspicious weightlifting "accident" ..... and just think he should throw it behind a legacy .... Oh wei.
