It was interesting to see how accurate it was writing to the geek sayings, but very naive in the corporate world. The Ministry of Justice will catch some big corp giants when they are naive thing to win. Real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting, but every bit as sinister. I seriously doubt that would AMF actually kill someone directly; even more indirect fashion these days. In the real world, they kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, toxins, etc. This film should be developed some garage geeks, I think, and the studio did not know the difference. They just wanted to earn something on the antitrust case, Microsoft in the news.
