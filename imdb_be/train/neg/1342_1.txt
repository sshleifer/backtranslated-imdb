This film is a newcomer to the efforts of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While it suffers from several problems, because every low-budget production makes it a good start for Ms. Beaton and her company. <br /> <br /> The story is not very new being done in such films as The Burning and every Friday the 13th, as part of the 2. However, cardiac performances. So many big budget movies are actors, who go through the motions, it is always nice to see the actors are really trying to hone their craft. <br /> <br /> This story has to do with the murder (and eventual return) of mutilated classmate remaining sworn to secrecy, but the injury case sends everyone in different directions in their lives. Ten years later, the friends are killed one after another horrible stalker, known as "errant". Who will survive? You should look. <br /> <br /> If you are Roger Ebert or any number of arrogant critics probably do not need to worry. But if your tastes run more to Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people, honing his skills, and then check «The Bagman».
