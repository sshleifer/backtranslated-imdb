I saw "The woman on the beach," this director, and could not understand the benefit to the great reviews. This film is very similar to that one or two people who are caught in the relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else. As with his other films, you have to want to listen to idle dialogue, wade through very little, and began following Charmed, rather uninteresting characters. If you feel that you may like this movie, do not let my review stop you. I love minimalism in film, but I feel films of Tsai Ming-Liang is much higher. He has quite a stunning actor Lee Kang-Sheng in his films. There's nothing here. I want to IU liked, but I do not. Oh, well.
