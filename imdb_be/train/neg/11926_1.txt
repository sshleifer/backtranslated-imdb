I rarely moved to make this kind of comment, but after sitting through the most terrible movie Rankin I feel like I've really earned the right to say what I feel about it! I could not really make it to the end, and was one of a half dozen or more walk-outs (about 1/3 audience) after ragged plot, dialogue bitter and insulting characterization became too much to bear. this film all the poses and no art. all style and no substance. it is difficult to terrible actions really severe scenario, indifferent cinematography and production values ​​of student level. he received funding, began and finished it a mystery to me. I'll bet you a million pounds, he never goes on general release. own criticism to break it. very bad film. terribly bad. really really poor effort and even without mentioning the grant newborn kitten, gets dumped-in-a-deep-fat fryer moment. completely pointless, quite easy, badly put together; this film is a terrible embarrassment for infrared film.
