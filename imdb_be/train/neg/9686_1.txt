Writer / director Peter Greenaway cementing his title of the Supreme Lord pretentious art house with his latest exercise in bad pampering, 8 ½ Women. The film is rich Englishman and his son in their mutual quest for sexual pleasure, because they are lured and blackmailed the woman (guess how much) before the entry into his personal collection of concubines. <br /> <br /> Think of every possible way that this space can be offensive and is likely to do so Greenaway. Female characters are little more than a catalog of fetishes for the two main characters of communion. There Kabuki-obsessed Mio, eternally pregnant Mona Lisa and Beryl, who has a thing for farm animals. Giulietta does not have legs, and uses a wheelchair, she is "half woman," get it? Greenway categorically denies all charges of misogyny, but if it is not, then what? <br /> <br /> The film continues eroticize anything and everything that is connected with Japan, the continuation of the theme from him snoring -worthy (but less sexist) 1996 film, The Pillow Book. But where the Pillow Book was erotic and elegant, 8 ½ Women just gets horny and operational. Greenaway's work tasteless and arrogant in its fetishism, and the only person likely to enjoy watching a film director himself.
