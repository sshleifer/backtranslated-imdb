If you've ever seen the movie, you would know what it is! If you do not, and you want to see the classic BAD movie, I suggest you watch this movie, because it takes just the worst. So, if you're really bored, go rent it. If you want to know what it is, here is my little summary: Adam Sandler was hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some models Ms Universe and five other people. Adam did not like how a passenger gets all the baby, and he's trying to take on a cheezy jokes. But wait! It only gets worse! You will need to rent a movie yourself to see how bad it really is.
