I can not recommend this film as a movie date. semi-autobiographical Gary Oldman in a life lived in the south-east of London real estate is rough, Beckettian by one of the wheels of Dante's hell, to be honest. In the center of Ray Winstone, who has done this kind of character before, but never as well. The film begins with him ordering drinks in the pub bar - that's all - and you are already covered by a sense of frustration, hatred and barbarism, he manifests in different ways throughout the course of the film. This is a valid master class. <br /> <br /> course cornered and disadvantaged need foil in the drama, such as Winstone and Kathy Burke selected as his suffering wife that absorbs and ultimately reject it unbearable behavior Charlie Krid- Miles makes a turn, capable as fuses lighting addict son Billy, although he must have thought sometimes exactly what he let himself in for. Gary Oldman controls close-up on actors, maximizing their claustrophobic council flat squalor. 4/10
