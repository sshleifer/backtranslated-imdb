Cinderella story made for adults who live in a dream world. The novel is very unrealistic, Fluttery, dear darling, perfect, etc. Cinderella story to the very end and Shahid Kapoor is the sole cause of my stars. If you are looking for a dreamy romance with a twist, this is definitely a movie you will, but for the rest of us real people, I would strongly recommend that you keep your three hour preview time. Wake up people! <br /> <br /> Four out of five people who saw this film with me would not recommend this movie. We had a great time scrape most unrealistic scenes. Maybe something I do not have enough .. I just can not believe that a film like this could beat the classics like HDDCS !!
