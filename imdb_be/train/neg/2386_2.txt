I missed this film in the cinema, but had some idea at the back of my head, it was worth a look, so when I saw it on the shelves in the DVD I thought, "the time to watch it." Big mistake! <br /> <br /> A long list of stars can not save this turkey is definitely one of the worst movies ever. Incomprehensible plot poorly supplied and poorly presented. Perhaps it would make more sense if I had read the novel Robbins, but if the film is not completely different from the novel, and Robbins aid scenarios I doubt it, the novel would have to be painful to read, as well. <, Br /> <br /> I hope that the actors are well paid, they looked ashamed to be in this waste of celluloid and more recently DVD blanks, take, for example, Pat Morita. Thurman has mercy even look uncomfortable at times. <br /> <br /> save yourself about 98 minutes of your life something more dignified, like trimming fingernails or sorting your sock drawer. Even if you see it in the "under $ 5," a one-off bin at your local store, do not succumb to the temptation!
