this film has a lot of shortcomings, and then all I could see. it is painfully long and terrible aim. I could see the entire audience impatience and wait for it to finish. run time path over 3 hours that could be edited in less than 2 h. Going <br /> <br /> Between Stories on average. most people have admitted being on the seat waiting for something better to come. <br /> <br /> funny only in pockets. The ambitious project execution and lower pairs. Govinda is doing a fair job, Anil Kapoor has disappointed me, the rest of us, as expected. if Mr. expecting anything close to Babel or love really is, its no where near.
