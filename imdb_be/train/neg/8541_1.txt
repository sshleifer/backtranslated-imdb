Welcome to movies on the 17 terrifying classics 50 package. Where we will see that it is right. Another film that has absolutely no sense. Seriously, this movie made me so confused, in the end, I thought I was rewatching Â«At dawn they sleep." The story seems simple enough .... well, that is up to 3 seconds in the movie, where girl allegedly killed the cat, and then ... um .. explode? I have no idea what happened. and that was before the title SCREEN. It's really sad when I can not even tell what happened during the first 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> In any case, the star photographer with a big mustache, who is this girl after dumping his other friends on the way to photograph something somewhere. so that we get there, but not before someone steals their jeep ride 200 feet from the road to the city. suspicious? Nah. so they decided to stay in this desolate village with an old woman. and then things happen, and blah blah blah speak. A guy with a mustache comes in the fog whatever reason, even if the old lady tells him not to do so. He is lost and then find their way back. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention that this is all after the incredibly pointless 20 minutes they will be staying in the house of a man who looks like gods eyes guy with Casablanca. Then they leave. There really is no sense of the scene. It's really just padding. If you cut it no one would have noticed anyway. <br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, it was actually the best part of the film. wait. Let me rephrase that. Indeed, unfortunately, it was the best part of the film. because the rest is so complicated that I had to look at the IMDb, to find out what happened. But, of course, no one knows, so I'm SOL. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the last 30 minutes of the film were among the most mindscrewing moments I have ever seen in a movie. They put her in a dress, he kidnaps and then released, he runs back to the house, at the end of a witch in the house, and it ends? seriously. I hardly ever get confused because in the movie. I mean, as bad as movies, such as "Robot Wars," at least they make sense. this film even makes no attempt to be consistent. the ending was so confused, as the end of "At dawn they sleep," and the story was much sadder. this film takes 1 only for him purely "I have no idea what happened in the movie" ness. "Witch mountain" gets tangled movie watchers 1 of 10.
