I ... I'm missing something here ??? "Unexpected plot events"? "Twisting plot with subversive joy"? that these viewers are watching the same Arquette car that I have just exposed themselves (currently implicit south (UN) combat conscious sadomasochism) ... I just joined this site just to make sure that no one has ever rented this bitch. ..this film was a challenge for every individual involved ... quick question whether Sir Stephen read the script does before he gave the thumbs up to Kate S.? if so, it must be the same Spielberg, who has a green light, "Howard the duck" ... do not give me that "it was a hit game" Shit - I'm guessing the MSSR. Reddin is not too pleased ... DVD-cover promised "strange corners" and "twisted history ..." Story !! Story ?? This shit is how to do it the old Bobby ~ d Maki and his band of wandering structuralists sound like a genius ... Sundance ?? Berlin ?? Toronto ?? I have a home video of my cat farting that is more interesting than a negative one-dimensional image Arquette painful loss ... and talk about Dese Ex Machina for Mr. Stanley T.; thank God, only nick the findings, according to him, Dave to call the police! and thank Shiva that the cops just caught the real killer ... that !!! to the to the captions, I'm still waiting for that it would be somehow the Grift against Arquette and his "hidden millions ..." No, Mrs. Spielberg, do not leave a whole: what the hell is that kitchen scene from "mycoses in my crotch" gag ??? you worse than this, or "just cause" ?? I do not know ... hey movie buffs: why do not you make it a blockbuster night and remove it along with the "Jersey Girl" and "white chicken", and then make sepukka (or is it seppuka) ... and take E. Dunskiy with you ....
