I see a lot of movies. I saw the original Wargames years ago and loved it. Computers, where there is still a "big mystery" to most of us, and the film was convincing in its own way. <br /> <br /> This one, however, looks like a low budget on Wednesday night special. Total crap from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The story so weak, you will not believe until you see the film (which I would not recommend in the first place). I can not point out one actor who really did a good job in this film. But hey, with this scenario, I would be surprised if someone could make a good acting job. Many clich√©s scenes. CGI looks like it takes from version 86. <br /> <br /> Bah, no, I get in a bad mood, just writing about it. Do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Life in the short to spend it on the poor viewing pictures.
