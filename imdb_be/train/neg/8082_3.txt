It was one of those late night "is there," I saw these things. Sometimes they are great. This one was terrible, but it really should not be. <br /> <br /> The film was a very good shot. How can you fail if you have Charlsten Heston and Jack Palance? We are talking Oscar turf here. It was a good special effects. He even had some really nice boobs! And I mean a good show, complete with a full breast nipple and at one point even some beaver. But this does not compensate for a missing ingredient - a story! The plot was ridiculous. I do not mean "solar crisis' sun blast things, but it was bad enough. It was the rest of the material - oh so stupid and utterly predictable evil things Corporation. The man who just stinks! No amount of good actions or cold spacecraft or fight scenes can get around this one. <br /> <br /> I've seen the same actors incredibly well. I have seen great science fiction films that had little casts and budgets. The only difference lies in the writing.
