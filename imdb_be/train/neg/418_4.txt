One could wish that the idea is so good, as the "invisible man" will work better and more carefully handled in an age of fantastic special effects, but it is not. Story, characters, and finally, all of the last 20 minutes of the film is about as fresh as a mad scientist-movie from the early 50-ies. There are some great moments, mainly due to weird special effects and the whole idea of ​​the invisible man is on the street. But, unfortunately, we soon returned to the small cell underground laboratory, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but sketchy. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of remakes of old movies or TV shows in the last 10 years, and some of them have their own charms. But it's becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of ​​putting a classic Ol »under the nose of eager crazy as Verhoeven (which does have its moments) is very bad. It is obvious that money is the key issue here: the time and energy put into the script is not enough and, as a consequence, "Invisible Man" is seriously undermined by a cliche, vivid characters, predictability and lack any depth at all. <br /> <br /> However, one thing that really impressed me, next to the special effects, was swearing. When you create this kind of film, modern manufacturers are very interested to allow children to see them. Thus, the language (and, sometimes, violence and sex) is very relaxed. When the whole world blows up, the good guys are going "Oh damn!" And "Oh my God." "Invisible" with gratitude refuses this kind of hypocrisy and characters are free to say what is most natural for them. I'm not saying that is the most natural reaction to something gone wrong to swear - but it makes it more believable if anyone actually complains. I think we can thank for that Verhoeven.
