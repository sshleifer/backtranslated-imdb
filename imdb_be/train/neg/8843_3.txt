This film is very terrible indeed. Unfortunately, for reasons that the filmmakers would have hoped. <br /> <br /> There's a mastermind of a serial killer too, but he's not what this terrible day. He's just your standard villain comic cross between Hannibal Lecter and Freddy Krueger, though nothing particularly fresh to add anything. By the way, even the most vile and most vicious criminals, they can be arrested chained in stress on the legs, arms extended to 24 hours per week in week out? I believe in a world that gave us Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, <br /> <br /> No, really terrible about this film the protagonist, everything is possible., Denis. This unattractive young man, aided and abetted it's true some ridiculously loose security measures and the doctor completely negligent of any concept of professional ethics and confidentiality of information about the patient enters the hospital room occupied by what can only be described as very vulnerable and defenseless young woman, and on the basis of nothing at all (it excludes from chronic sleeping to give anything like informed consent) presents itself to have some special relationship with it. <br /> <br /> It would seem that in a few days, he has arrogated to itself the right to kidnap her, believing that (completely false, as we find out), that he take better care of it than anyone else and within a few minutes to get her back to his apartment, sexually molested her, but she (again because of her sleepiness) completely unable to consent or resist. <br /> <br /> Our suspicion as to why he would feel this relationship will be fairly quickly confirmed. He, of course, more or less unable to form any mature adult friendship, not to mention the sexual relationship, so instead returned to this mostly infantilised women who because of her constant dream have a mental age corresponding to the experience of only a few years, the scene where she discovers ice cream especially crawling decisions and knowing gaze shyly, she gives him when he says mischievously, that he has to clean it again is of particular horror. But then again, I'm afraid, is not that horror filmmakers have to hope for, but it is much more than a simple aversion cramps. We can clearly see that at the end of our forks here - this is the ideal dream of innocence pedophile, sexual satisfaction, and total dependence. Awful, awful, awful. <br /> <br /> What else we got in this Mish cork? Twisted Dreamscapes not as good as Del Toro. Forced "You must go to the police" argument, where the protagonist is always a reason not to do so, despite the fact that this is the only reasonable course of action. The sequence of the machine, praised in the comments here, though fully and completely pointless ( "It does not serve any function!" As Sigourney Weaver memorably protested Galaxy Quest) and looking at me in the same way as the Abominable Dr. Phibes warmed in a Saw derivatives . <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Combs makes it better, though, so the star for this, and a few more, because you have to have lower ratings for movies, which is even worse than this, and in general it is a good shot and correctly performed.
