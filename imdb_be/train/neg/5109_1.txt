"Extreme Makeover: Home EditionÂ» is another "feel-goody", so-called "heart warming", and because of the assessment show that the ABC was the time to put together <br /> <br /> I . understand the problems that these families go through. For this, I apologize. But you have a flat screen TV would not have thought that putting four wide-screen plasma TV, three desktop computers, pool ground taking half of the garden, and a closet full of expensive designer clothes is too excessive for any family? Of course, these families have been through a lot. Of course, they deserve more good things that they had not been. <br /> <br /> But, to be honest, that Ty Pennington and his team were in the house is enough to satisfy the entire neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really annoys me about this show as Ty and his team always has something good to say about every detail, which belongs to the family, or family status. Telling the invalid chair person that he or she is "so strong" or "very brave" really grow old after a while. This may seem harsh, but believe me; watch this show, and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In general, this show exaggerated. If you want to watch it, go ahead. This comment Only the heads of the fact that you're looking at.
