Great actors. <br /> <br /> Lousy script and not too large a direction. My main problem was I just did not care about any of these people. Nha killer not a victim. Settings were pretty monotonous. Dennis Quaid character was so poorly written, I do not even care when the end has come. He got his baby back. Big deal! I want my money back.
