Slave. This is very bad. The game is not great to begin with, and the decision to transfer him in the film does not do it does not contribute to - especially Pepnuli decides how it wants to treat the theatrical origin of the material (we get the occasional glances watching a theatrical audience, etc.). and I decided to go to the Jump edit the style that is designed to remind you that you are watching a movie, while in fact it only serves to remind you that you look very bad film director who overwhelmed her stuff. execution of central Mira Sorvino is breath takingly poor: a step-in and juicy, it's as if she is playing the role of creativity through the Merchant Ivory Bonham Carter. Only Fiona Shaw provides performance notes - and it may be that her theatrical genealogical means that it is best able to cope with the material - but it's hard to watch a movie for one performance alone, even if the performance as the light, and all true as the Shaw. Ben Kingsley turns in the middle and separated turn and daughter Diana Rigg in Rachel Stirling plays a supporting role as just that. Unfortunately, none of the magic Bertolucci entirely rubbed off on his wife when this film must be evidence.
