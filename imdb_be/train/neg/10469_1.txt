Yes, I admit that I cried during this movie. It was so incredibly frustrating that I could not help myself but cry. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) has done it again. Firstly the presence of Million Dollar Man (former professional wrestler) on its program, and now this. <br /> <br /> Omega Code should flow fragmentary religious-oriented films. It was pretty funny, but at the same time, it was disturbing to find him so biblically inaccurate. The film is worth what is known as the "Bible Code", rather than after the actual biblical scripture. This movie is very badly made; from his letters to his directing him funny horrible actions. Its disappointing that people actually put effort into this movie. It turned out a late night movie someone would look at the US channel or direct-to-home video and not theatrically released film. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend you do not watch this movie, even if your life depends on it.
