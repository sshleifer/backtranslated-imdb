This film was 100% boring, I swear, I almost died of boredom in the theater. It was not funny, and really was not her that a lot of action in it either, it was boring, and I hope that someone out there that liked this movie, God be with you in the future, when you find out that the movie was really like and try to jump off a bridge or something like that
