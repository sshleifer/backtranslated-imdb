As already mentioned, this should be a great hammer-style film, and I think that's how most of the actors were instructed to play ... but the script is so leaden went bad, and filled with a lot of boring monologues (poor Timothy Dalton difficult most them), that all this is too bloated and self-important. This uncharacteristically weak performance from Dalton, although he quietly nails climactic scene where Dr. Rock finally realizes what he has done. The only actor who comes off very well, Patrick Stewart, who is a most welcome sight. Freddie Francis may have been great filmmakers, but he was a lousy director.
