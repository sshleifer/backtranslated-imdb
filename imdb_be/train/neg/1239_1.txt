Being a big fan of the "other" Planet of Apes movies I rented this DVD, despite my aversion to all things Tim Burton. Again, he does not cease to disappoint his uninspired direction. Even monkey makeup looks second rate, which is unforgivable, considering the enormous budget of this ugliness. Mark Wahlberg proves once and for all, that he is not an actor (like BOOGIE NIGHTS was not enough evidence). I was confused for the real talents such as Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. Without a doubt, their salaries are not motivated them because he could not cliche-ridden scenario. I rented this DVD at a special $ 1 night, and I still feel ripped off.
