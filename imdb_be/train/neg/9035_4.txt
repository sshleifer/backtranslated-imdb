Born in's 1960, I grew up watching TV "Movies of the Week" in the early 70s and loved terrible movies that were normally given including "Crowhaven Farm», «Bad Ronald», «School of Satan for girls" "Kolchak night Stalker", and so on, but this one is just dumb.This, obviously, the author is trying to capitalize on the gruesome murders of Manson from a few years earlier. The film stars Dennis Weaver of "McCloud" and "Duel" is known as a father who takes his family camping on the beach. The family met some hippies who, for whatever reasons, decided to terrorize the family. The reason for this is never explained, and pacifist position weaving difficult to swallow. For God's sake, call the police, beat the hell out of them or something, just do not sit and whine about it. Act fairly lame, unbelievable story, etc. Susan Dey looks cute in a bikini, but that's about it. Ignore it if he ever televised.
