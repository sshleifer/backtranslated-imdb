As the film begins the narrator warns us screaming SKULL so scared you can die of fright - and if this happens the free disposal is guaranteed. Well, I do not think that one has died from fright to see this film, but some of them may have died of boredom. Shouts SKULL is its native film that makes Ed Wood look good. <br /> <br /> It is based on the famous novel by Francis Marion Crawford, SKULL about the rich but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances. After the installation in your home, it suffers wit gardener, poorly executed portrait, peacocks, and eventually the skull, which rolls around the room and made her cry a lot. And we must pay tribute to her, the actress Peggy Webber yelling as well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, her ability to do this is a high point of the film. The plot is quite clear, to put it mildly, and while the actors are really good, the script is terrible and uninspired movie so you'll be ready to run screaming yourself. However, it is a question only of sixty-eight minutes, but it feels a lot more. Add to that a really terrible print quality, and there you are. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are so bad they are fun to watch. It is true that screaming SKULL has a few pearls - but the film drags so much that I could not work up to more than an occasional giggle, and by the time this is over your head will roll from apathy. If it had not been as Peggy Webber with a shout, it will be error-free cure for insomnia. Give it a miss. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
