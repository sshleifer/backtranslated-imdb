The final score (average film-qualities- various classical actions visuals creation, graft, humor, entertainment, ECT): <br /> <br /> 4,3 (10) <br /> <br /> If to "Atlantis: The Lost Empire» was released a few years ago it would have seemed bold, serious new trend in Disney animation, however, it is only a year after the innovative and almost a genius. "The Adventures of the Emperor" and means a step backwards in the release of Disney is repetative «Disney formula." I'm a big fan of Disney animated feature-length films. Yes, to see them sho love it or hate it. "Atlantis" is an animated throwback "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" and other similar live-action sci-fi adventures of the 50s and 60s. The problem is that this version is unlikely to contain one original idea. It feels like a remake of something, more so than the actual remakes Disney (Tarzan, the Hunchback of Notre Dame). the characters are little more than a walking cliché usual suspects, which usually inhabit these types of films (in crank mechanics, overreliance on the whole, the arrogant tough women). For Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner) supporting cast is flat out nasty. The film also suffers from its compression rates. Instead of specifying it in an epic story, Disney jam in the short run is usually the time to brush over the possibility for the development of ... suspence, character, nothing really. They Relieve us in this new world and the wonderful and just let our Barings. Clumsy pace sometimes makes tangled, it is a relatively simple story. Animation dark and dreary, with a cheap. This thing looks slapped together on a Saturday morning cartoon. Let's hope they do not forget that traditional 2D animation can still be wonderous. "The Iron Giant" among others proved that <br /> <br /> Negatives :. Visual, pace and complete lack of originality <br /> <br /> Positives :. Quite possibly the coolest death scene for Disney villain for a long time. This is a creative highlight of the film.
