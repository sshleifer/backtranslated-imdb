This film is not only a very bad movie, with terrible actors -OR, alleged actors--, bored direction and story unattractive, it also copies the exact scene with a beautiful «giallio» «Torso" directed by Sergio Martino, one thousand nine hundred seventy-three (two years before), one of the the most famous psycho-thriller of Italian cinema and cult cinema worldwide. The «La Sanguinusa la Danza promote" the director plays the sex scenes between a black girl and a white girl with peep-Tam, watching from the bedroom window. Naturally, the scene in the movie Rizzo ridiculous and inferior softness and charming in the film Martin. To put another black girl, the other white girl and still looked to play a scene than just the most appropriate way to prove that Rizzo's film has no ideas, no originality, no taste, and nothing at all. I think that such things viewers offense.
