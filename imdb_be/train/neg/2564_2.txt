When I go to watch movies I would like to stay and watch it or if I wanted, I would have to sleep, but it was pure crap, I actually got up and left! .... It was a bad script and put together, I hated him. In addition, they should not have been taken off of the Fraser, it was much better. It was not as good as I expected, given that I liked George of the Jungle 1 and the graphics were not as good as the first, for example, a bird, and if he ran into a tree. I hope that the director takes heed of this, and subsequent films to make it, he needs to reconsider ... awful! I really would like to give Ursla a job well done, as she made the film worthwhile (as I did not come out) ... all in all I give this movie 2 out of 10
