I do not know about you, but I have always been drawn to the "art" cinema. The first "art" film I was able to get a hold of was Peter Greenaway's "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover", which blew my mind and creative spiret into overdrive. The film was the ultimate paradox, as the beautiful and the grotesque ... is that "art cinema" was about exploring the idea of ​​intelligent and visceral attraction to the screen for the purpose. Life, real life can be like living in a madhouse, and the art is shown that shows that it is. I love movies of all types, but especially those who like to entertain and have something to say, whether I agree with his position or no ... <br /> <br /> «8 1/2 Women", dry, clinical " comedy ", where the father and son to collect a harem to fufill their many sexual fantasies. There is only a very brief hint of Fellini in the movie, unlike that offered previews. The main focus of the film falls on the "close" relationship between father and son, came after his mother's death. In the early scenes of the film the parents sorrow is believable, you can feel his pain. What happens after that clear standards Greenway, harem collection, comment on love and death, flesh and reflected for the flesh ... It could be argued that it is, but I feel that the film be shallow and stupid. And the idea that this could be a comedy confuses me. Acting for the most part, if it's good ... especially good Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (although poor Mandy has to put his clothes back on) The fact that the film lacks is a fascinating story, and ordinary Greenway excess risks that make it different movies so cool to watch. <br /> <br /> At the time, filled with moments of inspiration, and sometimes taboo, "8 1/2 Women" too cut and paste to treat art, is too soft to be considered "ridiculous" and just too boring deemed appropriate . <br /> <br /> Save your money ... I can only recommend this film as a sleeping aid. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
