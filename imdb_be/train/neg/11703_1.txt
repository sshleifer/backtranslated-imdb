You will notice that the chemist, who appears in two scenes, and gets to say, played by Stephen King. "Do not give up your day job" a standard thing to say, but it's not fair. King will pay off well enough: it is not worse than any other member of the cast, and better than most. History, on the other hand, is pure garbage. Please let your day job <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many terrible performances. - of which the leading actors (Lead actor!) Is probably the worst - come together in one film. Each acts hammily, but not in a form of a game; they somehow manage to go top, without spending or manifestations of energy. I blame the writer / director Tom Holland. It can not be that all the actors are really that bad. What are the odds against that? However, I never heard of any of them before, but still, I do not think I could go to a talent agency and walk with it a lot of bad performers, if I tried: one actor, in spite of the all my efforts turn out to have a talent. So it is more likely - that Tom Holland rolling a dozen straight snake eyes, or that he wrote a hideous scenario, and then sent it bad? This also explains why the actors are bad in direct proportion to their popularity in the script. The more the direction of becoming an actor, the less he spoke. ( "Do you want me to bend over like a hunchback, talk to my back of the throat, to show all of my teeth, and look dull, all at the same time? Well ...Â») <br /> <br /> This theory is supported the fact that the Netherlands could certainly co-write the script lousy. Some authors here have commented on the fact that Billy Halleck entirely sympathetic character, but this is misleading way of putting it. He is not cognizable in nature. All we know about him before the supernatural stuff starts to happen is that he is fat, and all he can think about food. ( "All I can think about is food," he tells us, helpfully.) And in the end ... <br /> <br /> (Sigh) I guess I should insert a spoiler warning here .. . <br /> <br /> In the end, he becomes angry. Why? I can only shrug my shoulders. Maybe he was under some kind of ecstasy. Yes, it probably is. Under the "evil", perhaps I am in the "inexplicable" mean - is not so much a hazard as socially undesirable suspension of the usual means at the end of psychology. In any case, his actions at the end makes no sense, the actions of a tie does not make sense, and this despite the fact that the characters do little but to explain their motivation for the benefit of the audience. <br /> <br /> By the way, here is my candidate for hammiest line / delivery: "I do not think you would like it after all ...". [One dramatic pause] "... I do not think you'd like it at all. "
