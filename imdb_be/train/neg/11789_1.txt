Actually I had to stop. Do not get me wrong, like a bad movie monster. But this was too boring, regardless of the music that alarm will never lead you anywhere. The actress has too many teeth and the moment when it comes into contact with one of the animals was too obvious clich√©s. The film reverses the lid on the DVD, which looks quite interesting. On the cover you can expect a giant monster, but you get these cute no longer as huge as expected, electric eels. I moved to another to watch a film called The Killer Rat, but it's another review. Deep shock was really crap, a great shame, given the fact that it looks pretty high budget.
