Some gorehound-members recommended "Live feed" for me, and, in principle, I can not complain, as the film, of course, put a generous amount of gross head and a bucket full of nothing, but it's certainly not a very good film. More obviously cashing in on the latest trend in horror movies, the so-called torture porn, Ryan Nicholson tries to surpass all other film in this sub genre (and that includes a role-model "Hostel" and "Saw") with his sick and twisted makeup effects and thoroughly indecent images of naked co-eds have tried up, suffering, and ask them to life. There's no actual plot to describe. Five completely brainless twenty-something friends on a journey to Asia. One of them has Asian roots, but other than that I do not know why they decided to go there, and not in Cancun. They are clearly not interested in the culture of the continents and even cause fever scene when they see a local sausage cute puppy in the market. The quintet then dives into the ominous night life and one of them accidentally offends the leader of a criminal clan. Just forgiveness is clearly not enough, as the gangster follow them in an adult theater, and gradually all for their brutal torture. One girl pinned her chest, and the other poor girl even has a poisonous snake tucked into her throat; Slave. "Live Stream" surprisingly dull, despite all the bloodshed and amateurish production values ​​rather hard to miss, even if you are used to playing an independent fan-boy trash movie like this. Fat guy on the cover, oriental S & M executioner, admittedly, pretty cool, and it is also the most talented of the whole bunch, because it at least keeps the mouth of the castle all the time. I would not recommend this pile of dirt, but hey, if you love loud and disgusting throwing, sickening footage of torture and relatives losers, go straight ahead and watch!
