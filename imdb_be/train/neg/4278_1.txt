Just took this film to the dollar in the national wholesale liquidators, and after watching, I feel like I got ripped-off. <br /> <br /> I do not know, I've seen worse than this film, honestly. And I would never write a negative review of the film was not so much respect to the subject matter, ie, Stephen Foster and his music. <br /> <br /> First of all, what is it? This musical biography? So, Melody Foster then interspersed here and there the number of pseudo-Jerome Kern Broadway-type that stink more than in the Mississippi Delta. I mean, someone got PAID to write this nonsense? Second, the real story of Foster is a fascinating one. Why even close to it? Thirdly, the fact that they have a great Ray Middleton, to force him to make this film? Photos of him with young boys ?? With the Communists? What a waste of a great talent. <br /> <br /> So, friends, Foster, and the truth, and good fun, do not be afraid ... very very afraid.
