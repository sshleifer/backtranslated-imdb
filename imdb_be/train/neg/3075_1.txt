Yes .. this is definitely up there with some of the worst MSTifyed movies, but I've definitely seen worse. Think Gremlins rated R. Well anyway, I met Rick Sloane in some sci-fi conventions, that is surprising, it is laid out on! It was one of those conventions really low budget, where everything goes, all listed in something (if you want to see the shit, you should be able to see that some friends and I brought). <br /> <br /> He seemed a very nice guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments on the brownies, and he even told me not to take him seriously, and said that he loved the MST3K version! <br /> <br /> In general, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think that was bad as Mars Attacks. So I guess I'm on this film and giving it a 5, and betray all my comrades MSTies. Sorry, guys.
