At least among those films, 100 votes or more. Nominated for best screenplay written directly on the screen? Blethyn was nominated for Best Actress in a leading role ?? Nominated for best film ?? I do not always agree with many of the church Oscar, but this film may well be the worst film of all time will be honored at the Academy. Preparation and acting, both were terrible. Perfomance Blethyn in particular, was one of the worst I have ever seen, and probably the most overestimated the effectiveness of all time. Horrible movie, not worthy of the big screen and not worthy of any cable or TV channel that has ever played on it, including HBO (where I saw it). I'm just thankful that I do not really pay to see one of the most overrated movies of all time.
