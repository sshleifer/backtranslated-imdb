This film is weak, binding tight box that says gangs of East Los Angeles, and this is actually Santa Ana, James Cahill works as a closet queen takes down all the tough guys in a tough Chlo gang. It's a fake, sad, senseless and beat, I tried to get my money back from the video store, the film was so bad. He was also on the homo-erotic tip is far from what is proclaimed the video box. James Cahill should act gay porn .James in every scene, he can not act to save his life. In the film, Eva Longoria, which is hot, but James could not even kill with it !!!!!!!!! I felt like I sometimes watched gay porn and was converted - away from the film. James clearly wants to be with the men, and then submit it to the homosexual desires, he knocks a member of the gang again and again and again. His martial arts skills are minimal at best, some of these gang members would have him and his poor skills and rip him a new one.
