I grew up watching the original series in the sixties and the one thing I can tell you right now, there is no comparison. This film was completely ridiculous arrival costume that was alive. Martian which have different shapes. Special effects that look like something that a young child will create. In contrast, in the original, the characters and the audience have developed a feel for Tim and Uncle Martin have been developed. The only event in this film, so in fact there was one, was when Ray Walston finally made an appearance at the end. He wore dark glasses and made references to live on this planet for 30 years as a kind of tribute to the TV series. But even the real Uncle Martin could not save this turkey.
