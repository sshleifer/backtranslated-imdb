In the history of the nut, which is particularly interested in this particular historical event, I was very disappointed with the film. Of course, the costume and production was completely accurate, but the Hollywood image of the «British Little Big Horn» was really boring. <br /> <br /> The number of film material dedicated to marching or parade were unprecedented in the history of cinema. Eveytime I heard a cheery background music start, I knew that I had to prepare myself for another tedious scenes of mindless filler. Obviously, the manufacturers have invested heavily in a "staged" and were determined to get their money. <br /> <br /> Despite the outstanding cast, their dialogue was, again, a sad and their characters were not developed. Every time Peter O'Toole or Burt Lancaster finished the scene, I would shudder with disappointment. Their data lines were so weak and pointless that I could hardly believe it was the same two great actors portraying Lawrence of Arabia and Bird Man of Alcatraz, respectively. <br /> <br /> There are less epic, but this is not much better.
