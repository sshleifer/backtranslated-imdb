I am surprised that all (even criticism), seems to think it's a good movie. It was the most clichéd thriller ever made that I have seen. We have a "bad guy" who wants to make a "good guy" (or girl in this case) to do something or face the consequences. "Good girl" in this film is to use your wits and skills to defeat the "bad man "and save the day, and her family. With charisma, courage and even success, to save the day. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Well, a young woman named Lisa Reisert meets a young man named Jackson Rippner (good name) at the airport. One coincidence leads to another, and soon, it seems as if fate brings these two together. Sharing drinks, sitting next to each other, it would seem to hold in every way ... there's more to this strangeness? Can these two be assigned to each other? "Destiny" really is the cause of their strange and accidental collision ? <br /> <br /> well, as it turns out, unfortunately, true. Lisa Jackson needs to help him kill the director of national security, transferring it from one room to another, so that its people can launch an attack on him. Ah, if she does not, her father died. Although we may never know the exact reason why, and who is really behind this madness, Jackson is more than explain how this will happen and why his behalf Lisa to help him. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lisa wins his evil plans with her mind, and in the process stabs him in the neck, making him stumble seats, and hit it off the stick. Oh, and the fact that she leads him on a wild chase through the Miami airport, where she gets a message is transmitted 11 9 Safety and steals a car, which she later uses to strangle a man who was ordered to kill his father. <br /> <br /> Yeah, right. <br /> <br /> First of all, I find it strange that someone like Jackson, who can get their hands on high-tech weapons needs help hotel manager. Could not he have just sneak a bomb into the building? not something that would make it safer for him and his team, leaving any third parties? And why characters like Jackson also explain all that they are going to do for someone they threaten? Does not that make it easier to stop them with the same people? <br /> <br /> actors have done their best, given the film they were given. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy has the actors to look out for. In addition, I believe that Jayma Mays (who played the «» Cynthia attractive) will be someone we will see more. It's just too bad they are stuck in it. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
