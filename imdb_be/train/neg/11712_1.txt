The only reason I remember this movie, because it was (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money ever spent. I was 17 and my boyfriend 18. We were age, when the militants were our things, to enjoy the majority (about the second maximum). We left feeling so insulted, we wanted our money, but time can never be restored. <br /> <br /> Editing is what killed this film. As the truck gets attacked more and more vehicles with rocket launchers attached film completely offended audience intelligence, with these rogue bad guys in 4x4 VW Bugs shooting missiles on a truck. Please missiles on a truck, is known to conduct plutonium? What's worse, this VW are in the running to get 15-18 shots from 4 rocket. You should have seen at VW with 4 rocket fire two of them circle the truck with the last connected, go back for a moment later with two rockets attached, fire another, and then in front of the truck, and now he's back to full set of 4 missiles. <br /> <br /> We toughed it in the hope of a great end, that never happened. It seems that they just ran out of money and stopped. <br /> <br /> It's ridiculous.
