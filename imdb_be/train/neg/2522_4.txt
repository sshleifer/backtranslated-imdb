What a terrible movie! The idea of ​​robots that fight each other is cool, but the plot is funny, a real human action is laughable, acting and special effects are non-existent (in which this type of film should depend) archaic. I thought that this must be done about '80 -84 and was amazed to see it was in 1990, that is 5 years after the foreigners! Well, many people said that it was good, considering the low budget, but I just think "what's the point?". it looks absolutely incredible. I would not mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and completely rewritten the story because I still like the idea of ​​the huge robots beating the crap out of each other.
