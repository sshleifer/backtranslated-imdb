- = contains spoilers of the two original and film versions = - <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Notre Dame de Paris musical, I also read the book this summer, and I watched a movie today, at the beginning I was hoping to watch a good movie, especially when I saw 6.3 IMDb point.first scene was good, but I really expected, theater scene straight out of a book, but that's okay, but if Esmeralda kisses Gringoire I felt something wrong..they not even kiss in the book, even in the music .. <br /> <br /> and have a huge gap, why Esmeralda judge by the sorcerer, in the book it teaching her goat, how to respond to the number of hours or write the word "Phoebus" wait .. there were Phoebus had not been there? In this film, he is a soldier stuff more than anything, the creators have made Quasimodo love to show around, and they even canceled Frollo's love..but Notre Dame was Frollo. his thoughts of his struggle between love of God and love of man in the movies we can not find anything like that, that all we have, some of the villain, which is really bad, and kill people, whose collision with his thoughts..and not to mention the Phoebus, not to mention the love of Frollo, not to mention the Jehan (brother Frollo), not to mention the mother of Esmeralda (maybe it's good, the plot would have cut a lot) they do not even mention the real story .. (other PS : Frollo was not OPUS DEI or some cult member, it is actually in the interests of alchemy he tries zrabits gold..he stuck in the science and religion) <br /> <br /> Finally, do not watch this movie, it's kind of publication directors in a real masterpiece, and if you saw it before reading the book, have mercy you..you must read book your .. <br /> <br /> this movie is worse than the hunchback of Notre Dame II animated movie, spend time with a view of Notre-Dame de Paris musical .. enough said ..
