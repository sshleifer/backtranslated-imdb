Darkness I found to be too dark. It was kind of a cool idea, and some ambitious ideas and not bad scenes and a few shots of moments to make you go ugh! BUT, it was underlit to the point of confusion. You do not really know what always happens in dark scenes, and the film, which is shot on Super 8 film, you already have everything you reverse the grain to have to deal with. Nathan Schiff movie, it's too much. Director Leif Jonker, seems to want to make an original film, but it lacks the know-how to do it. The camera never in the right place, the lack of basics such as how to take a simple dialog scenes and how to light the film hurt as well. The actors are all pretty uneven and unnatural. But, despite these negatives, the music is good, a lot of gore and ranges from silly putty to a very good instrument. This is a classic, as he says? It consists of two discs worth of praise? NO. But this is a good first try. Now, when these guys to stop patting themselves on the back about this film (from what I understand there is only one thing they have ever finished) for some time and try again, they can do better.
