Where to start? This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. Editing is the worst, the sound effects were awesome and the sound editing was exhausted. Much of the film all here Crappy pushing effects with intricate talking in the background. I had to turn your volume to full capacity only to it, what's going on .... and I had to hear it? Probably one of the worst scenarios have ever done. I can not believe that people actually put some green for this film. It makes me think that I could take a crap in a box, send it to the manufacturer and then they finance the film for me. <br /> <br /> Dolph was usual, Dolph. Nothing else needs to be said. Villains were bad, the protagonist were poor, and the film was a bitch. If you really want to know what NOT to do when writing or directing or editing a movie, look at this!
