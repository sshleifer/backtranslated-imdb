I will not mention any of the plot, because, although it would have been highly predictable in any case, a sharp twist will be given worldwide in film commentaries, in a brief story outlined here, and even in the overview Netflix on my envelope, I could have enjoyed more if I did not know that. Maybe. This film is a deceptively good shot, most of whom do commendable acting with relatively limited available material, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren, and Tia Carrera and Dunsmore in smaller parts. It was impossible, William McNamara, but it was clear design. And there were a couple of quick nude scenes in callipygian Lenora Zana. But all this does not make the slightest recommendation from me. Do not any of these fine actors actually read the script before signing?
