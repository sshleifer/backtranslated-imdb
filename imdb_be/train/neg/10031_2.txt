I just saw a movie at the cinema. The film has very few good things to talk about. Karina Beauty and a couple of songs can be. It. The film is a complete disappointment in all areas. Anyone associated with the film will be disappointed, even as Mumbai Indians (Now Chennai made it to the semi-finals). <br /> <br /> But the worst thing I feel like a movie action scenes. Now Bollywood days trying to copy from the Hollywood scene. But they forget that Hollywood directors takes a lot of influence to make him look like a real one. But, unfortunately, Bollywood filmmakers do not have much time. They spend their time on the songs of the film and advertising. Now the same stupid can work scenes in the South as well as the audience to pay just to watch your favorite actor kills a bunch of people. But in Bollywood, of course, it will not work. All the action scenes, I would like to send. In the end, even some Chinese people show up out of nowhere to beat Akshay Kumar. It is the height of stupidity. The audience does not pay to watch such nonsense. I think that Bollywood should now forget about the militants. They can not do it. The last good action I saw was a «Ghatak» and «Khiladiyon ka Khialdi». The current scene in Bollywood really sad for the fans of thriller, like me. See these people of their movie after completing? they can not understand that the slow motion action (which is done with the help of a rope) is too unreal and childish? Better not to have the stage, if you can not handle it. I just want to go back to the era of Amitabh, where the film as Zanjeer and Deewar was having exciting action scenes. The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but visually it is much better than the current age of the scene. <br /> <br /> This movie should now open the eyes of film directors of Bollywood. Please do not do more fighters until you have acquired the art makes it realistic.
