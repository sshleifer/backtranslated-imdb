I get his character Diehl is s'posed be a microcosm of America itself - seeing Arab terrorists under every stone, only to find out in the end, it was his own actions all along that he had in the state of siege and now, when he practices good will to all men everything is rainbows and lollipops. Unfortunately Wim you have done amazing movies in the past that remain neutral in politics and for good reason, debate your weak spot, and they weaken the well-made, oddly filmed with ridiculous characters, dialogue and plotting. Better luck next film. Another thing that tore my eccentric point was ponderous homeless section of LA to be there because of the famine, the people do not get enough to eat. Are these people do not eat royally, but the real hunger of these people have a spiritual hunger and emotional hunger, mental hunger. They need self-esteem, self-respect, dignity, which can not give a man. Yes, these people are hungry, and if they need it it's available. Less hunger center in America, I would say that it is more alcoholism center, drug abuse, mental suffering and economic devastation. Fighting hunger, although noble endeavor is bandpass using deeper systematic social and age-old human problem of homelessness. Bill Diehl was good, though, and Michelle Williams was cute as a young yet (clich√©) an old soul.
