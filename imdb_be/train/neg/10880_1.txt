This is perhaps the worst film I've ever seen, and I have quite an appetite for a terrible (and good) film. This can (only) get the kind of adolescent humor, when he was consistently insincere --a l Rocky Horror Picture Show, which was really very funny. Other films, like PLAN NINE out of space, manage to be funny while (apparently) trying to be serious. As for the action, it seems, they have driven brain dead teenagers and asked them to improvise the entire production. Compared with them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was a decent interpretation - that of the old ghoul busting wide on a motorcycle.
