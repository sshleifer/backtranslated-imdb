Scary, but mainly in the sense that it will be longer before I turn 70. I saw this as a late night re-launch in 1976, and thought it would never end. Like crackers, it is better than nothing (but only). <br /> <br /> Ray Milland a little scary, because it looks as if it were stuffed taxidermist. Yvette Mimeux looks as if she smoked all the Beautiful Downtown Burbank Brown. <br /> <br /> This is a kind Roy Rogers version of Rosemary's Baby. This is one turkey, which had never been made. If you have insomnia, and it's 1:30 on a Saturday morning, and there is nothing on but reruns in 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship, I believe that it beats that. But God help you if this is your only choice for entertainment.
