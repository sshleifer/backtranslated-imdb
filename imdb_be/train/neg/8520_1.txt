When I noticed that, "Hamish Macbeth" was broadcast in the United States, I was excited. I had the misfortune to watch the damn thing. I love books Beaton MS in the beautiful Scottish constable. The characters in the book exciting and very well written. Powers that are responsible for this mess of apparently never read one of the books in Beeton. Only the name "Hamish Macbeth" has nothing to do with the series. In addition, the lack of familiar characters, I find all the show offensively loud. It seems that the actors feel that they have to shout his lines and scream at each other. If you like M. S. Beaton Hamish Macbeth magic does not waste your time on this stuff.
