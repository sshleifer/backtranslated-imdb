I've never heard of this one before he appeared on cable television. This is very typical for the end of the '50s sci-fi: a sober, depressing and not a little paranoid! Despite the inclusion of as a typical romantic couples, the film pretty much crank in a documentary style - that perhaps cheaper way leaving a lot of exposure to the story and a reason to put in as much footage as humanly possible for what is undoubtedly a very low-budget Company! Although it is not uninteresting in itself (The-apocalypse-through-the-renegade-missile angle later used with much more aplomb as for DR. Strangelove [1964] and of the failures [1964]), and fortunately short, focused approach of the film it subject matter results in a fair involuntary laughter - especially in scenes related to the impending birth and the gang of ignorant juvenile offenders!
