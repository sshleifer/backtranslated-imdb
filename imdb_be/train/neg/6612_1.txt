Yesterday I downloaded the movie via the Internet site quality was kind of good! I watched the movie with high expectations (even though I knew that it was a failure), the more the film has superstar Amitabh Bachchan plays the role villain.I, although at least the actors, he would make them some value roles.But unfortunately Mr. Bachchan did not hit, as the villain it turned out that no one can compete court Amjad Khan Magic RGV, to rekindle past unpleasant consequences royally! Sholay, an old friend is an important milestone in Indian cinema with an all-star, cult dialogue, stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack, which is still a hit this generation too.A good actor like Ajay Devgan talents are wasted, and his speech was average.Prashant Raj, a novice does not know what acting is. Nisha Kothari has proven that it is one of the worst actresses we have, I do not know how she is still in the RGV team Urmila and Abhishek have seen in the song, without emotion and passion Mohanlal tried my best and work Susmitha Sen was good, I somehow liked the work in this film, it was a massacre Total original Sholay
