Complete nonsense. Unfortunate manifestation of hypocritical, toxic culture ten years ago. In this film, walking remorse for slavery go hand in hand with colonial overtones (irritating red feeding Shack rice?). Forget the historical reality too. Is not it most Western slaves coming from West Africa? American slave Shaka easily grab a handful of people?. Finally, David Hasslehoff could not be more unpleasant. One can only speculate as he took in the miniseries? (Operative planted most likely). The series was delicious, and it is a pity that DH had to get his hands on something unique, and made it to the people you need. (I tend to think that he has a hand in the creation of this fiasco).
