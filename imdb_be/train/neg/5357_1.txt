I do not know where to start. This film feels a lot like one of those cheap Saturday morning children's shows that they used to do back in the late eighties, early nineties. Kind of like Captain Power or Power Rangers. It is full of bad digital overlays and really bad sound "secret agents" and villains. <br /> <br /> actions are so bad that not even funny. Direction scary and there is little that is now continuous. It seems as if someone had just dropped a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was to be a story. <br /> <br /> It may be one of the funniest scenes in the film is at an early stage, when some miscreants plant an explosive device in a car agents. For some reason, even if the device is clearly indicated as "remote undermined" the bad guys decided to pursue it on their bikes as it drives away. This pursuit continues. all the time with the bad guys, doing stupid and utterly pointless stunts on the bike. Standing on the bike, do the villa and so on. At some point, an accident occurs, and one of the attackers was thrown off his bike, we see a bike (obviously OIG), thrown through the vehicle's agents, but the rider disappeared. Then, after a few seconds and return the bike rider ... apparently the whole accident. At this point, even if the car has an explosive device planted in it, hackers prefer to withdraw funds while driving by, and then blow up her car. Which was also clearly done with CGI. Sound confusing? This is so the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I could show that, when I say, CGI, we're not talking about the Lord Of The Rings-type CGI here. We're talking cheap cheesy Power Rangers-type CGI, in fact I think it would have been done better in the Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> Why Savinykh and Todd made this film I'll never know what I can only assume they did for the money, as a favor to someone, or because they are blackmailed into it ... probably last.
