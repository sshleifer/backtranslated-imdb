Somewhere I read that this movie should be a comedy. after watching, I would call it anything but. the meaning of the film escapes me. dialogue is very superficial and absurd, many of the sets seemed to be too late, and despite all the nudity and sexual content of the course, there is nothing erotic about this film ... all leaving me to wonder what this damn thing on! the name of the room can be the basis for the satisfaction (if politically incorrect) comedy. Instead, we were treated to cheap, amateurish, unfinished sketches and debauchery and strange for its own sake. if I want to, I'll go buy a grace Jones cd.
