I bought this video at Walmart for $ 1 a bucket. I think I'm more paid !!! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi made a long series of third-rate films for small studios (in this case, Monogram - those who have done most Bowry Boys films). While the poverty of the majority of these films did not approach the level of awful his last films reached (Ed Wood «classics» such as the Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 from Outer Space), however they are bad movies and avoid all but the most diehard fans. <br /> <br /> I'm an old movie junkie, so I gave it a try. In addition, some of these smaller films were actually very good. - it's just not one <br /> <br /> Lugosi is, what else, a mad scientist who wants to be a rather strange and violent wife alive after he invents a serum of young brides. They never explained why it had to be a bride, or why it should be women, or even the fact that his wife's disease. - so you can see that the plot never really hashed all <br /> <br /> In any case, really annoying female reporter (type without Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to get to the bottom of all these obvious murders in which the bodies have been stolen! Thus, she goes for some clues all the way to the doorstep of Lugosi. Lugosi house is complete with his crazy wife female assistant and two strange people who seem assistant sons (ugly tea Sex Fiend and dwarf). Naturally, this brave reporter fainting repeatedly throughout the film - apparently, narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! In the end, all the freaks die - mostly because of their own hands, and all is well. In conclusion, the reporter and the doctor she just met decided to marry. And, of course, silent operator reporter fainting, when it happens. If you have not noticed, there are a lot of insanity in this film. Or maybe because it was so slow and ponderous film they just fell asleep!
