{Recitation} the beginning I did not want to believe it at first, but I think that is what people are talking about when they say that the South Korean film industry has reached its peak and may even go down. After a surprisingly funny and touching movie Monster «Gwoemul» (aka «The Host») to 2006-- which actually failed to make a sharp satire with a B-movie genre-- successive Korean blockbuster became more and more common even though their budgets (mainly spent on special effects) are becoming more and more fantastic. In South Korea, the filmmakers really want to squander the entire audience and investor friendliness that their industry gained since one thousand nine hundred ninety-nine tear film "The breadth / Swiri», having made a number of big budget films mediocre as mainland China do? Recitation {end} <br /> <br /> The only "why" I can understand, for making this film is to deceive investors for financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation Korean / Asian stylized dragon I've seen today, for the final scenes. Now, when they were introduced by the dragon at the beginning and gave him more personality and goals in 1996. "Dragonheart», the film may have been a few other than to have a lot of digitally animated dragons more bailout money. Remember "Dungeons & Dragons "in 2000? Does not anybody know that the trick is not how many special effects you use, but how well you use it? I hope that more (and better) Korean legends they can use, because they just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legends with you m, they filmed it. <br /> <br /> In short, I agree with all the negative reviews are gone before, and wondering how Koreans feel that their national anthem, "Arirang," which plays at the end. As a special feature beings, I would give it at least 5 stars 10 when the special effects and action sequences has been worth it, but I saw a lot of video games with the best operation of the camera and scenarios (just under the dragon).
