So far, the worst film of all time. Even Japhet Cat could not save this turkey. I heard that the film was originally to be called "Treasure", but was changed to "Shark Treasure" in order to take advantage of the excitement created by the "Jaws". I think sharks have been in one scene of the film; the fact that they were included in the "Thriller" was to sell tickets. It does not work. Anytime something "good" happens in the movie, the ship's crew toasting each other with a certain brand of beer which has just been introduced at the time the film was made. Gee, I do not think that beer can be a sponsor? Maybe they did it is already clear? The only time someone has to break out the beer, if they make it through this thing. It is enough for celebration.
