Somehow, they summed up the 60's, a decade that have radically changed our country in four hours. And how painful it was four. They trivilized major developments and events, and they "claimed" it was about two families, but you hardly saw African-American family. If I were NBC I would be ashamed and embarrassed for airing this stuff. What was funny was that carefree family you saw at the very beginning was tortured in many ways, but he was able to take part in every major 60s events across the country. the second family had such a non-factor. They are devoted, perhaps five or six scenes in all of this family. Poor baby ... please, NBC, do not make any of the films as a Ia a different era .... leave it to PBS and History Channel
