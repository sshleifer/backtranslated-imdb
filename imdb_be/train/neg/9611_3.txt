There are so many goofy things about this film that I can not name just some of them: <br /> <br /> Bogart's character: 1. His name ?? Whip McCord (too easy, so I'll leave it at that. Boy, does it sound good `Humphrey.") 2. His long, curly hair and sideburns silly. 3. His Black Bart uniform, complete with spurs! 4. Not sure what shade of lipgloss they have to wear it, but it is neither too flattering in nature <br /> <br /> Cagney (Jim Kincaid). 1. His lipstick does not make him any service either. 2. The man swallowed his hat during the whole movie! Could they not find the hat to match it? Even LITTLE? !!?! 3. His pants are too tight in the rear. 4. He blows smoke from his gun too many times, you know what I mean, and I think what you're doing. <br /> <br /> If you accidentally Bogart and Cagney fan, and I think that this may be a change of pace to see them in the western, do yourself a favor and forget the idea. Even LOOK horse puzzled! (That is, if they do not look bored.) <br /> <br /> In all fairness, I will admit that the Westerns my least favorite genre movie, but I still saw a lot, lot better than that. <, Br /> <br /> on the comedy level, or as a great camp, Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, it is the viewer beware. Thus, it is seen only if) you should see a western with it b) you really Cagney or withdrawable Completist c) any of the above comments apply to you. Wow .. ??
