Rachel Hannah Jo, Tina, Bradley and John all in good shape here. They deserve Oscars for their performances. I'm a big fan of the TV show Aswell. Their music is rock, and they are all so talented! I am also a great indicator of sarcasm !!!!!! <br /> <br /> If you are an S CLUB FAN DO NOT READ THIS !!!!! <br /> <br /> performance is very weak, fearful and even jokes dialogue is not performed properly (I feel sorry for the director). The jokes are so incredibly bad that 8 small, S Cl ardent supporters did not laugh. They thought they could do it better. And they did. They conquered the world. They became S Club Juniors. Paul, "fat, ugly one who started mosh group" should thank his lucky stars that he had left when he did. One of the worst movies ever made. BEWARE of this film! Not go and see! YOU DO NOT LAUGH! YOU CRY! 0/10 RJT
