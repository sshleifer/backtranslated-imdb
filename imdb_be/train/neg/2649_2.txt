My wife and I started watching the movie look. It looked warm and touching. He started well; but soon it became sad and frankly silly after a while. It got so bad that we have excluded his film was poorly acted and honesty, we could not understand, we want to understand what, why and how the hell they can put up with that woman! You have lost sympathy for her after she was rude and act eccentric singing and cleaning. I would have had her devotee. And, of course, like most of the movies and TV series T.V, made in Hollywood, we have to throw it a token "gay" character! This film was boring. I expected more from Diane Keaton!
