You must understand that if the name of the star is shown correctly in the opening credits, you are not a good time (credit reads "Cuba Gooding, J.R.»). Some good car chase, Shoot «Em Up, blow» Em Up action, if all you want is action, so that the ratio to the fact that the site exists, is tenuous at best, and completely unbelievable. The motives of the characters, especially in Gooding at the end, which is worse than unbelievable, they are irrational, if not hopelessly confused. All I can think is that Andy Cheng has to be a really good guy to get it a lot of good actors in this project is not fair (it can not have something on all of them, he can?).
