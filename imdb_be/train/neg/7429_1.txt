Who am I? No, I'm not kidding. That's what it really says in the video case <br /> <br /> Plot. Short version: Pretty woman is standing around smiling. This, for some reason, makes all the people kill each other. <br /> <br /> Â«Find Ariel of Ariel ... Where ... can not find Ariel ..." It is for you, you idiot ... <br /> <br /> Most of what can be said about this horrible little space opera has already been said, it is as follows. <br /> <br /> bunch of sugary actors playing mostly convicts comes after the first casting knocks down very quickly. Then they shot down the same way. Each scene is broadcast almost fifteen minutes in advance. Perhaps it was drawing straws to see what the actors were most of the time on the screen and more checks. An alien virus / hologram / VR witch / glitch seems physically weak and does nothing. Why can not she just stay in your computer, instead of doing her "vampire teleportation" daily? (In fact, it would be more interesting if she was a vampire, or to do more than just stand around looking at people that everything she ever does. That's enough to all the people kill each another. Come see what's what. ..) <br /> <br /> it really is not space Flick. There are far more shots of the old western trail, 1950 Easy Rider trail, night club noir scene, even jogging on the beach in a fantasy land, none of which has any real depth or even make any sense. Nightclub scene in black and white, of course. He worked with the "Wizard of Oz". It does not work so well here. It's probably a good thing, as these few shots, they show spaces are depressingly stupid. You are likely to cry during those moments, especially when he saw that the vortex "spaceship", which looks like three inches long. <br /> <br /> Do not feel for any of the characters, and not because they are convicted or have no personality, but because they are in serious need of acting lessons, Billy Dee Williams that really looks overwhelmed and at a loss, probably by being this work, ... <br /> <br /> this is one of those movies that, when viewed with friends, going to cause some very "loud" silence, especially if botanist throws his comic attempt to single-line (including the line of the French-kissed a meteor? ... I hear that right? Maybe not ...) <br /> <br /> The original virtual reality girl gets "killed", that does not mean anything, because they do not even really begin. Well, the other "heroes" are not, either, but that's beside the point. Haha. <br /> <br /> Something funny that the scene that adorns the video case is its native skull-horror-looking stranger things (green filter is added to the fact to give it more. ..uh ... green eyes ), which is actually an android after he dies, and ultimately has nothing to do with anything prepared. <br /> <br /> even the odd bargain, I noticed. Every time an explosion occurs (at least on my cheap DVD copy), it becomes very poorly. I do not mean LITTLE nekachestven, I mean huge blocks about 1/16 the size of the screen. Wow.
