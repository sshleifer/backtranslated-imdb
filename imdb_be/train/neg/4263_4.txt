Disappointing movie. Performance weak actors. Sets well, could be better. The history is also weak. Fighting horrible sequence. Music and film quality are poor. The history of the Kazakh people were told very little. This film was supposed to include more of the Kazakh actors in the lead roles. And also need to be in the Kazakh language. Kuno Becker and Jay Hernandez is a Hispanic. I do not understand. So when the Hispanic people play the Turko-Mongol people. This film is a shame the Kazakh cinema. Rustam Ibrahimbeyov disappointed me. He is one of the best directors in the world. Director of the Ceska forgiven, since it is not a nomadic origin, he may not know the true spirit and history of the nomads.
