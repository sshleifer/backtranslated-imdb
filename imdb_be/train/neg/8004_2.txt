First of all let me say that the first 20 minutes are great, the monster looks great and reasonably done CGI. It's a shame that the rest of the film is disappointing, <br /> <br /> ******** spoilers below ******** <br /> <br /> With the opening scenes, we can see this movie is anti-American, as a rule, this kind of stereotypes will not bother me (we Brits get enough from Hollywood), but here it is not thin that the Americans brain dead morons. He walks past the point of realism and left wondering if cutting raped director's mother. <br /> <br /> A sad scene was really poor and part of the film, where it starts to go down. <br /> <br /> Here we are introduced to the Olympic medalist drunk aunt and uncle, who go to the memorial and start blaming his father for his daughter's death, and then hit him, before they begin to roll on the floor crying. A little realistic bonding in times of crisis! <br /> <br /> The whole virus sideline funny. If Americans know that this is not a virus, so they spend time, money and resources research? The US government agent orders the brain of an innocent Korean drill for anything, making Americans look bad (or stupid), it is not helped by the fact that this guy was a cross-eyed for comic effect. <br /> <br /> film about hunting monsters. US and Korean special forces designed to find the creature, although through the exit of the film they are invisible. The only people hunting for the monster, the whole of Korea, is the main family, and some occasional vagrants, who appears at the end to save the day! Naturally, several US / Korean agents trying to stop them on the way. <br /> <br /> Sister was included only in the movies, so she could make a vital shot in the end. It was the pattern, you know that it will happen, but make it worse, she does all the asshole to that part! and my last irritated as hell that the child will survive in the end? Monster swam with his head under water for 5 minutes! why not a monster eats the children in the first place?
