First the good news. 3-D spectacularly well done, and they do not go on Gocha tricks. The film is based on the true story of the highest point in the history of mankind, and even shows one of the actual participants in the story :. Buzz Aldrin <br /> <br /> And now the meat question: It's about the flies, for krissakes! Flies with a large googy human eyes, it is true, but nevertheless flies. Remember, when I compared the «Underworld» movies on rats against cockroaches? It was not intended as a compliment, and I never dreamed anyone would literally. This one was even less empathy going for it. Children's quirks? Ugh. In one of the odd mergers Hollywood groupthink, then Bug's apparently on the drawing boards at the same time as the «Space Chimps», as well as the creatures in space. <br /> <br /> Go rent «Apollo 13" and see 9-rated film about the real space program (RIP).
