This sleek, sexy movie is a must see. Only after multiple views can one truly understand the uniqueness of this film. Personally, I like the narrator for his clever, no subject is not left untouched, narrative style. The introduction grabs you right away, and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the film. It provides an excellent insight into the world with trainables and allows the audience to really "connect" with the inner horror of this film exhibits. the script itself holds the film together perfectly. Not only for children, but older people, so it will get a higher understanding trainables and modern understanding that they have a sexual experience. Ahead of his time, and innovative in film, it certainly defines the word "masterpiece".
