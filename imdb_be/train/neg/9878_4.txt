There has been a lot of love, which was introduced in Wes Anderson's "Fantastic Mr. Fox", unfortunately, self-love. Of course, there was a lot of time and effort was put into this to make all so self-consciously quirky universe, but only if at the same time and effort has been put into the script to try to make it funny. Disturbing is the fact that I think it was, and the best thing that could come up with Wes Anderson. <br /> <br /> animation is good in close-up shots of animals, but when the camera is on everything is very harsh on the eyes, and to be completely honest, it looks like a bit of a mess. There was nothing special about the action or with Wes prefers to choose his buddy and more big names more specialized voice actors who could probably have made the movie better. I am sure that the voice of George Clooney resume consists of two episodic appearances in South Park, one of them, where he played the dog. <br /> <br /> The film is too smug and trying too hard to be clever and different, and, as a rule, even though the film is set in England, all the good animals typical Americans play baseball, while the poor stereotypical English guys with the most offensive English accent. I can not stress enough how much a waste of time this film. I did not laugh once.
