Christ Christ ... One hour stunned, incredulous, and possibly abnormal, as tasteless exercise in black smut unfolds with all the wit and dexterity relaxed Galapagos tortoises. Can such things be? Is there really exists this movie, or I was the unwitting guinea pig of some shadowy international pharmaceutical company, sipping your coffee knowing that it was spiked with dangerous hallucinogen? I've seen a lot of movies, and a lot of bad movies, but nothing prepared me for this; to the end of it I was not clear, whining wreck, tearing at the carpet with his teeth like a dog scratching at the walls, howling, until my lungs ached. I pleaded desperately, passion, grace (to whom the appeal was made, I do not know), and the like with a burning desire a soothing balm Odom Yasujiro. Sweet Jesus Crying, memories ... sometimes they come back to me. When I was at my most vulnerable, when I least able to cope with them. I tremble, I broke down in tears, I bite my fingernails until my hands smeared with blood, but I can not quite banish the bad memories from my mind. I'm a ghost. I damaged. . I am a human shell <br /> <br /> Other users comments here believe that I am not alone in experiencing this terrible experience, which can only mean one of two things: a) the film does in fact exist, or b) I but one victim among the legions of the international conspiracy is really ominous proportions. Which is quite stunning that some people seem to use their trials, or, at least, did not remain traumatized by it. Perhaps they are a part of the operation. Damn them, freaks! Damn them all to hell !!!!!!
