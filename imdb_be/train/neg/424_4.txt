Yesterday was Earth Day (22 April 2009) in the US and other countries, and I went to see the full-featured version of the movie "Earth" by Disneynature. I think as car manufacturers, Disney is trying to convince us that they care about the planet. Maybe they really care about the planet, I do not know, but I do not think it warrants a special unit with the word "nature" in it. I know that my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse, and who am I to say, one year old my personal feelings about Disney? <br /> <br /> In addition to the incredible film, it was a typical Disney frustrating for me. Preceded by a half-dozen Disney movie trailers, rich Disney clich√©s ( "circle of life", "falling with style"), over-dramatic music, recycled footage (Disney claims "40% of new frames"). I'm even beginning to think that James Earl Jones The story gets a little sad. I like James Earl Jones, but his work Disney and Morgan Freeman makes every Warner Brothers story begins to wear thin. I really think that Disney bought the BBC pictures of nature, which is so effectively done, they felt that it would sell themselves when they slapped some orchestral music and well-known sound bites on him. <br /> <br /> And that obsession with Disney featuring the predator minting and kill cattle child? There were half a dozen scenes, complete with the bleating of young people on the verge of getting their throats ripped out. I think Disney should recognize that animals have a rich and interesting life beyond life and death struggle, that call to action-movie for adolescents who got dragged to this film of their parents. I was also aware of how Disney has stopped well short, this means that a person does not have anything to do with climate change. They are so afraid of a tiny minority of the negative, they think that this is still a controversial issue? <br /> <br /> I recommend skipping this and chartering DVD-Blue Planet on Netflix. Nature movies seem better to make the British at the moment.
