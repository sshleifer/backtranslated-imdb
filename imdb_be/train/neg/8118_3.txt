Well, EYEboy, I must say that it pleases me to no end when someone singles me and trying to make fun of me, especially when someone who seems to be as smart as you are doing. My favorite part of your post was, "But there is not much relay the good guy bad guy here, kimosabe. I do not suggest you follow the movie with Lotsa Bang Bang Â». <br /> <br /> Well said! I love action movies, especially if they are well made, but I also love movies that do not have a whole lot of action, by the time they are well made. I'm sorry, but the secret and a lie does not fit into this category, and it is just a very bad movie. I really do not see a lot of non-American movies, so maybe I was spoiled and did not realize how bad foreign films was really when I saw the secrets and lies. Perhaps, if I had to judge foreign films on various standards I could ever see as secrets and lies could be one of the most popular movies on IMDB. Hmm ... If this is true, then it is very frightening. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new e-mail)
