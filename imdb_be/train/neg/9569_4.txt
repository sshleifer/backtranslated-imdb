Of course, not horrible, but certainly not very good. <br /> <br /> Cry, The Beloved Country (1995) was directed by Darrell Roodt and written for the screen by Ronald Harwood (Adapted from 1946 novel by Alan Paton). Actors James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. <br /> <br /> The film is about the pre-apartheid South Africa, as well as the stories of the Negro and the white man weave. Pious but naive preacher Stephen Kumalo (James Earl Jones) receives a letter from Johannesburg that he should come immediately; Later he finds out that his son had killed a man. Wealthy farmer / landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris) believes that his son, a fighter for the rights of blacks, was killed by the son of one godfather in. In this they are joined. <br /> <br /> I can not compare it to the 1951 film of the same name, because I have not seen him. Or 1974 musical titled Lost in the Stars, because I have not seen; how to look better than this. But Cry Freedom, on the other hand, I have seen; it has much more urgent air to it, it is actually trying to say something, where the film Cry, The Beloved Country, it seems, has no idea where she was going. Very "vague". I refuse to compare the film with the novel (except for the fact that I really enjoyed the novel, more than I enjoyed the movie), because novels and movies are two very different media and there is no point in trying to directly transmit to each other or to compare them with the using the same means. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this film blew. Well, I suppose it was not too bad, --Five-to-ten - but it was not as good as. The two leads, both are very capable actors to pull some of the wooden performances that I have seen some of the most awkward dialogue in movie history (but it can be charged with his screenwriter, Ronald Harwood, who also surprisingly leave a game with this film, as well as I wrote sublime pianist and Being Julia). Among other things, the point and the theme of the novel is almost completely lost in his transition to film a third time; there is little, if any, power to any point in the movie, racial or suspensefully. Music does not help. Painfully ridiculous and sickening pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this blunting down film. One advantage is the cinema, with many quite good or excellent photos, but unfortunately, it does not help the film too much. <br /> <br /> Last strange words of the novel by Alan Paton is reflected in the final moments of the film. It's too bad that they seem to be so separated from the film, which has just been revealed. I do not know that Nelson Mandela could be seen in this film. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
