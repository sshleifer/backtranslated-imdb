If many people say that it was "the worst movie I've ever seen," they usually say that about almost any movie they do not like. However, with almost 700 films that I remember ever seen that one of the two that I walked away from feeling personally insulted and angry. This is my first review of the film, by the way, and I am registered in IMDb only rave unsuitability of this film. I went to see him when he was in the theater (I and two of my friends were 3 out of 5 people there), and after 15 years I can not remember very many specifics, but my attitude when leaving the theater still crystal clear. <br /> <br /> --- Spoiler warning --- <br /> <br /> Oh my, where to start. Fat loser left at the altar, go on a ski holiday, met a blonde bombshell who is interested in him and takes him home to meet the family, they are cannibals, and he main course, a pathetic attempt a dramatic escape, kick all their butts and escapes with his girlfriend's brother, they live happily ever after. Pook. Firstly, the earplugs are so bad that it took me some time to understand what they are trying to be funny, and it was COMEDY. Special effects, which have little, to see how they were made 15 years ago. Large dramatic finale was so sentimental and have acted badly, that it was almost unbearable to watch (he knocks all the cannibal family with a rake, which lie in the grass, facing up Tom and Jerry style when they go to them). I'm sure there are many, many more, but I'm not going to see him again for refreshment.
