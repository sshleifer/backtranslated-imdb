Slaughter High internally your iconic 80s slasher flick. Leprosy come from hands, leaving the caller guy badly burned. A few years back eccentric guy and he begins to kill people who hurt him. Now the story may seem intriguing and very interesting, but what makes this a terrible film so different from the rest of the '80s slasher flicks that it has some flaws, and sadly continue mistake. <br /> <br /> To act is terrible, however, is not really as bad as it could be suspicious. Although it does not help that every character in the film is so grody and unpleasant. Lead, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is easily the biggest executioner of them all, and it is one that we supposedly have to share the compassion and root for. Not to mention that they cause the guy is almost too provocative, and I think that even the stereotypical geeks will own roughly crazy and just directly counteracted as he calls it, so when it gets crumpled, someone really cares? <br /> <br /> There are many potential unintended laughter. Monroe lack of acting talent is quite obvious that puts her down on the same level as the rest of the cast terrible. However, most of the entertainment is easy, if the film is bad is trying to dress Munro, who is in her mid-30s at the time, as a teenager teenage cast. And when it comes to the future life and Munro plays around her actual age, the other actors are not as adults. It all goes well with the theme song, which is a funny pose heavy metal thrash accompanied by maniacal laughter and shrieking voice, "I'll get you." At the same time, as they say, Slaughter High is not really a very good slasher film, but he has a bad cheese entertainment value for him. It may be essential for hardcore fans of the chopper, but do not expect a dilemma, unknown, or any trust him. Horrible !!!
