I think a lot of people comment / review of his first film at the IMDb, because the film was spectacular or awful. - I'm writing because last <br /> <br /> I was glad for the continuation of «Wargames» .. I thought the original was pretty good, considering its time and content, I felt that I need to watch more than one time. This time, in 2008, I had high expectations for what they will do with this film. Computers, Games, terror, Military excessive jealousy all grown so since the first film, and «Wargames: The Dead Code» was able to bring all this to a great movie <br /> <br /. > The film failed at almost every level, but I particularly blame the writers and all those who had any input on the realism of game aspects. "Dead Code" was the air flight simulator 1990 with several people on the ground, waving his arms. Meanwhile, Will Farmer mashing a button 7,000 teams - none of which are influencing what is happening on the screen. Until finally "wins" by clicking on the box on the screen with the help of the mouse, that release of gas, which instantly kills 20,000 virtual people (no one next to the gas). Because he shot down 5 levels for 15 minutes, it says Ripley (real life war machine), that he is a threat to the high-level terror <br /> <br /> Even if what some 5-16 years of age can perform the same task. - the Government believes that it is a mortal threat to mankind. They say things like, "He has expert knowledge of bio-terrorism" ... He showed less knowledge than those who read the first paragraph of 3 Wiki entry on Bio-Terror. Thus the film has long chase scene with about + 0.01% of the budget and the excitement of any of the Bourne name implies. they have a capacity of about 1000 to catch it and explain the whole issue .. sometimes they are stupid, they are a little lacking .. but sometimes they artfully create opportunities just let him go intentionally, to follow him. <br /> <br /> ugh ... I would write more .. but I had already spent 1.5 hours, called rayuchy it, I'd rather see Broderick and Joshua to play tic-tac-toe for 1.5 hours.
