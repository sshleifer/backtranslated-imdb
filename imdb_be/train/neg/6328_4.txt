Why this film is much lower standards? Ultimately, the answer lies in the poor, a sense of humor script. Thin / Medium looking Travolta (looking quite forsisto in black, I have to say that even with a huge mullet) and Gross and works very well, as the two young-ish "slippery dressed", but still near the people of New York want to open your own nightclub. In addition, the rest of the film is just boring to watch. It's so sad that this is actually not necessary to know what happens in the climax of the film at any level. Kelly Preston, obviously exudes sex appeal and sexually charged dance with her husband to be Travolta is one of the few pleasures of the film. Charles Martin Smith is quite funny to see how struggling head of the KGB, "Bob Smith". Personally, I think the film would have been better if the story has been changed a bit, so that the parameters have not changed from New York to «Indian Springs, Nebraska" (which is in the former Soviet Union?) - you'll know when you see movie ... Perhaps, this film was made in 1986, is ready for release 1987. I believe that the stalled Paramount to release the film in January 1989 due to the incredible story. It was reported that they consider it a «unreleasable». However, this film has received $ 6000000 a little more embarrassing $ 163,000 in revenue, as it was only released a short in places like Texas and Colorado before heading straight to video. It is a testament to the overall poor quality of the film.
