Oh, where to begin. The cinema was great. If the film is first started from the initial scenery, I thought I was in for a good movie. Then OIG Bigfoot manifested .This was like a cartoon image of the Lion King and the King of love child.It Congo completely took away from plausibility in character.Now I knew that was not Bigfoot chasing people marching through the woods for no apparent reason, but shoddy CGI cartoon. So since then the whole movie was not filmed for me.The money they are lowered into the toilet OIG they could of spent on the costume, Roger Patterson did. It was the best ever Bigfoot costume no one could match his.I I'm a hardcore fan cheesy Bigfoot movie, and I was warned about this film, but my compulsion led me to watching this film, and I was disappointed as previous reviews warned me about . I know that after reading this review, you have to say. "I have to watch Snow hunters should watch Snow Hunter" Then you will say, why I spend a good hard-earned money on this poor excruciatingly boring movie!
