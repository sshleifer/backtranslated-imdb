This film fatigue but lucky baby, a cliche. There's a Nazi master witch performing SF related experiments in the basement? Oh, please! <br /> <br /> The pursuit of a creeping sense of dread and fear, the overall impression of the film is that very immature concept of fear. Not having any expectations in advance, I was left with: aged Xander Buffy and heroine with a monkey face who does not seem to know how to act. Said Barbie I have only met before in a much more enjoyable "Women-cannibals in a deadly jungle Avocado". <br /> <br /> The camera and editing adds to the overall impression of chromium.
