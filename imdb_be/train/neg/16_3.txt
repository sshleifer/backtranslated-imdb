There are a lot of very nice people in this movie. This is probably the best thing about it. It is possible that even makes it worth watching. <br /> <br /> «Loaded» tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man who is about to make its mark in the world. He is the son of a wealthy family with a good reputation, and he is on his way to law school. But, as many of these settings, it's not quite as perfect as they appear. Expectations in this family far outweigh love. School In addition, Tristan's father rarely allows him to leave the house. This seems to be the result of some past traumatic event that shook the family, which is partially revealed through flashbacks but not written until the end. Tristan claustrophobic environment causes it to produce in very extreme ways, at the first opportunity, when his friends take him to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. Triumph of several strippers soon be back on the beach party, and from there, Tristan befriends Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), which draws him towards the underworld of drugs. <br /> <br /> While technically well done, this film suffers from a lackluster script and plot, which is not very attractive. Apart from counting against this film some stunts permanent cameras that usually gave up annoying and out of place, such as slow motion, fast motion, freeze frame and echo. These types of effects director can normally be used to show the perspective of the character while on the drug, but in this case they seem to have been sporadic thrown at random points in some cheap attempt to style. <br /> <br /> Despite a cast of relative unknowns, performances were good in all things, especially in relation to the main antagonist (Corey Large). I suspect that we will see at least a couple of people in more and better projects in the future. <br /> <br /> Of course, when referring to an actor, I have to mention their appearance. Rating based on hotness, this film kills 11 women in this film is incredibly beautiful and almost distract you from a sad movie you are watching. I'm sure the male characters are also very attractive, but you have to ask someone else to comment on it. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not recommend this film, not to buy, rent, or even be seen free of charge. This, unfortunately, is simply not worth the effort to sit through.
