This version is quite fresh, I'm afraid. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books, and has been since childhood, but tired, single acting style William Hurt is completely unfit for bold passion Edward Rochester and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks boring, annoying teenager whose braces hurt! I also can not believe that they have eliminated a great marriage proposal Edward scene from the end of the book, one of the most touching moments in the literature. I understand that they finally used a young, single woman to play Jane, a character who is supposed to be mundane 18, but if you want to see a version that is closer and closer to the personality of the novel passion, please see the version of the '70s with George C. Scott and Susannah York. York was too old, tall and rather play Jane, but no one touched character Rochester path that did Scott.
