Amen Magsel. It was a lot of confusion going on. Firstly, how do you know which movie you buy? Henry sat down stars in each of them. I bought this film thinking that it was a mini-series ... WHAT Letdown !! It would be a comedy, but for a young girl was raped. David Hasselhoff (spelling?) Normally Popcorn TV, but it was not believable in this film (which was his English accent?) And it's a love story ??? The film was supposed to be on the increase in a young man of military force - not the captain of the slave ship gets spicy with English virgin looking for his dad ... <br /> <br /> If I had paid more than $ 7 for this film, I would call the police - because it would be a crime!
