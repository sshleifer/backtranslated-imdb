«Washington Square» is flat, shabby adaptation of the novel by Henry James. Indeed, the novel is very good, but far from the level of the masterpieces of James. Besides its simple, boring story seems inappropriate to turn it into a movie (although William Wyler, with his "heiress", given in 1949, an excellent version of the novel). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the film completely betrays the spirit of the works of the great American writer. In the novel, the heroine Catherine shy, not very attractive and a little clumsy, but nevertheless it does not sound, intelligent young woman, and she was not so naive as it may seem. Her attachment to her father is with dignity and respect, without painful side to it. Three-quarters of the film, Katherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) only seems to be mentally retarded, poor fellow. In the last quarter, it suddenly (and incredibly) becomes a clever, knowing her dignity as a woman, and all that. <br /> <br /> Directed by Agnieszka Holland has added two vulgar scenes in history. Firstly, if the child has a nervous Catherine, well, with its Vesica problems. The second scene, when we see in the background a kind of open-air brothel prostitutes taking their customers for tents, and so on. Nothing could be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of Henry James. It is well known that the writer was a very decent and Tikhon even Victorian era standards. I challenge anyone to find any rudeness somewhere in the thousands of pages of the vast literary work of James. I really was especially annoyed by these two scenes. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that the director should be a reasonable freedom in the film adaptation of the novel. But when the director completely ignores or misunderstands the art of the author (where Henry James), I see no reason to use his work to make a bad movie. <br /> <br /> adequate action film: the poor and flat, despite the talent of Albert Finney and Dame Maggie Smith. «Washington Square», certainly not recommended film.
