I saw this movie twice. I can not believe that Pintilie made a fiction film. I too / director of the film, and I know what I'm saying. It's not over Romania, but I see that the events taking place in the same period, with the incident on September 11th. A lot of the story, no plot, nothing. Many concluded entirely a message, nothing deep, nothing hidden. Just empty picture. <br /> <br /> The fact that most Romanians do not know, this film is for the French audience, and not for us. They really believe that this is the reality in Romania. Also for teenagers. Pintilie should stop making films. I really do not know if we can call it a movie, maybe the horror :) And we wonder why we have such an image in Europe. It was a reality, but no more. A good friend of mine from Brithish embassy said: "You have no idea what a long way the Romanian people came from Ceausescu."
