After all, I loved the cartoon Inspector Gadget in the 80s, I went to see this movie. I spent my money. The site was very thin. In addition, the film could not keep me interested for a long time. I was glad it was over. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Inspector Gadget, watch cartoons instead. It was much better than the movie.
