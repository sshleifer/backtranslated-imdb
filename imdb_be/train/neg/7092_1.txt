<br /> <br /> This film (not film - clearly recorded on a cheap cam-records) may be one of the greatest cinematic stink bombs in history. Caution: the packaging advertises the movie as erotic study of sex addiction. The film is not an intelligence nothing, and is nothing more erotic than watching on their own warts. The script does not make sense and winding, all the elements of the story, which act as Segways between the alleged sex scenes. Nevertheless, even the sex scenes lame lame lame. except for the first, they are about three seconds long (besides, perhaps, have been cut version) and comically overloaded. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a decent movie, you do not want this. If you are looking for tickling a sex movie, you do not want this. Regardless of your life goals, desires, or prospects, you do not want to watch this movie. How they got Ryazanov Arquette, Natashia Kinski, and Ed Begly act confused in the extreme in this stink bomb.
