It is a pity that you can not vote on the IMDb zero stars, because I would not hesitate! In fact I would go so far as to say that this film was in negative stars. <br /> <br /> I, like many others, has bought this film thinking that because it has Michael Madsen in it, it can be good ... no chance! This film was shocking! Imagine the length of the movie "The Bold and the Beautiful", well, Primal Instinct does not even come close to what is good, and I thought that there would be nothing worse than the length of the movie "The Bold and the Beautiful." <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen, as you would do it for us? The worst part is that I did not fast forward a bit, I was hoping that at the end they showed that it was all some kind of sick joke, that they thought it would be funny to make us look so terribly bad film. <br /> <br /> Where to begin ...? Directing - Zero stars Scenario - Zero stars, performing duties - zero stars, operator - zero stars, digital effects - Zero star, production design - Zero Star, makeup - zero stars, Casting - zero stars, editing - zero stars Trailer - half stars, graphic design - half Star, DVD menu. - Half of the stars <br /> <br /> However, I believe it is very important that saw bad movies just so that you know what is a bad film really is, so for this reason I am very pleased that I saw this movie, just so that I have a bad movie to put at the bottom of the list.
