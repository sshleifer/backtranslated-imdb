In short, this movie completely useless. <br /> <br /> The idea is to make a film from the point of view of the fact that someone from the beginning of the 1900s, may have to think about the future. An interesting idea, but the lack of compelling stories and characters prevents us from ever suspending our disbelief, so the idea just flops. <br /> <br /> It seems that the entire film was made with the actors in front of green screens and we should be surprised. But as the graphical face of softening was obvious crutch to hide the severe acute problems edges with green screening. Color is important not to wash out the corresponding effect, except for image degradation. And I do not understand why someone would take anything rendered in the film to be in any way innovative. In any case, absurd retrograde schedule lowered the bar very poor graphics - they do not meet even the ancient chart Jurassic Park. Model for robots were that simple, clear and very uncompelling. There was a bunch of pervert prehistoric-like animals on this island, but they are not explained in any way. <br /> <br /> The history of horrible beyond belief. In fact, I can not believe that I did not just come out of this movie. Relations between Polly and Joe is unmotivated, and throughout the film is based on mistrust and deception. Why character Maurice Paley even there? We are by no means convinced that the heroic Joe - I mean, he's flying the plane and rescued one person (Polly) for personal reasons. Yes, there is a great hero for you. Dex has very little screen time, so why should we care about Joe wants to save him? Who were Nepalease, that blocked Joe and Polly in the vault of mine, and why they do it (remembering that the whole operation was Totenkopf robotic) holes Plot <br /> <br />? (1) Why is the character of Bai Ling (the biggest drop, with its wonderful character in «The Crow») to stop the robot, which took Joe? They were looking for vials, and found them not. (2) Why the hell will be caught Dex, but not killed (he does not know about or vials, and the bad guys did not know what Polly had bowls and has been linked with Joe, and therefore, Dex)? (3) Polly indicates that "they" statement Totenkopf do not know, but it has some secret source of it, containing what appears to be enough full FBI file style to it. (4) The blank spot on a map, as described Nepalis - if they know all about this mysterious region, then why the hell their card blank in this place? (5) In a moment, Polly and Joe have to give up their clothes (they burn) - Joe gave new clothes, which were identical to his old clothes, but Polly had to wear some very weird looking bulky dresses, in the same lineage suddenly Polly has its own original clothes back. <br /> <br /> * sigh *. How far should I switch my brain to see this shit? <br /> <br /> We should be fun for music production, even if nothing interesting or remotely care about what happens on the screen. <, Br /> <br /> And the action? We need to be impressed with a bunch of bad British accents? Which character is not annoying? I think that the dialogue Bai Ling is probably the best in the whole film (it does not have a single line). Dialogue was not a camp, and did not even rise to the level of cheese. It's just bad and annoying. These people are not a hero or coercion are; they are a kind of people that you would try to ignore or disconnect the same time, if you have ever had the misfortune to meet them in real life. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this film gets above average rating here IMDb. IMHO it is to compete with the "Batman Forever" at the bottom 100 of all time.
