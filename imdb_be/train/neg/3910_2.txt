magical, lyrical novel by Isabel Allende about three generations of an aristocratic family in South America was an act of vandalism. A bumbling fool from the film, in the end - thanks in part to an excellent cast of actors Anglo did not result in an evasive Latin mellifluousness Allende character and perseverance Scandinavian directorial hand - it was so uncomfortable in my own skin, I returned to the theater for the second time to make sure I have not missed something important that could change his mind. To my disappointment, I have not missed anything. Nobody with Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave could not wiggle free of the traps set for them directed by Bille August. They all looked very hard and left, as if pushing on as little effort as possible, they waited quietly fade into beautiful period sets. (Yes, the film was directed by art within an inch of his life.) It is interesting that the artist was allowed to slip placement KFC products prominently in a scene that takes place around 1970 - the year before the KFC originated. Then he was known by its original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even pardon that what on earth makes Kentucky Fried Chicken in the military dictatorships in South America in 1970? American fast food chains do not and did not get to South America before the 1980s. "House of the Spirits" was an event movie, 1993. Because it was so club foot and slave is faithful to his vague idea of ​​what constitutes a novel, Miramax was to sell it as a feature film. In the end, it was neither the events nor art. And for this, Isabel Allende has to pressed charges of rape.
