This animated film Inspector Gadget pretty story lame.the very weak, and there are few of the characters action.most virtually nothing to do.The film gave a moderately entertaining, at best, but in fact does not go where it is pointless .it x-watchable, but that was far from the caliber of the animated TV show with 80's.it not a film that is re-examined, at least, only about 74 minutes of my mind.it long including credits, so I think it is a good thing.unlike the television show, the characters are not worth rooting for here.in show, you would like inspector gadget, to save during the day, but there, who really cares? In any case, this is just my opinion.for inspector me nuts last case is disappointing 3/10
