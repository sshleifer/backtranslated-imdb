* MANY MANY SPOILERS In this review * This movie was terrible. I'm a big baseball fan, so I thought I'd watch it, and I was very disappointed. He started well .. When I saw the bad influence DeNiro had his little son, I was hoping that he would be a good father throughout the film or something. In any case, in the beginning, it seemed as if DeNiro was supposed to be the main character. He was the only one who believed in Bobby, and he was a wonderful son, that he loses custody, which gave me a reason to feel bad for him. He wanted to help Bobby, communicating with Primo, when out of absolutely nowhere, he brutally kills Primo to death ... Not to mention that doodling repetitive song "I WANT YOU !!!! **** "in random inopportune moments. <br /> <br /> Later, when the son of Bobby DeNiro rescues drowning, I was hoping that the film could redeem himself .. He could forgive himself for killing Primo when he saved the son of Bobby. But, of course, is far beyond the depth of the film, because all he cares about getting credit for the murder, and does it, stealing Bobby's son, the car and the dog and keeping them hostage- Bobby just has to hit a home run and announce that DeNiro is "true supporter" while showing pictures of him biting knife. <br /> <br /> Now we move on to a totally unreal scenes at the end ... it pours as hell, and we must believe that the game has not been triggered. Then DeNiro somehow magically appears on the field in a suit and the referee calls Bobby out of the house, according to pull out a knife and started stabbing anything that works in the field. Is not there, it would seem, no officers in the field (but the police are on their way), so DeNiro steps on the mound and prepares to pass the knife Bobby when he gets shot to death. But do not worry, it's fun and enjoyable film has a happy ending, because Bobby to find his son. <br /> <br /> This is not a sports movie. We are not talking about the fans. As far as I know the fans entirely mad psychopaths who threaten, rob, and throwing knives in their admirees. It's probably going to hurt a film that I have ever seen in my life. The plot was not deep, sucking soundtrack, the film does not make any sense at all. I warn you not to waste time on this disgusting excuse for a movie.
