According to IMDB Master Takashi Miike in Terror segment, output, was banned in the United States. So I decided to translate the Swedish review I just wrote to him ... <br /> <br /> It was hard not to have any expectations from the episode Ichi The Killer-director Takashi Miike in the Masters of Horror series. And DVD-cover Imprint was actually looks very promising. <br /> <br /> The story mostly takes place in a remote Japanese brothel, some time during the 19th century and tells the story of a journalist finding a lump, the woman he left behind, and he promised to come back for. Tired and depressed, he comes to a brothel, in the hope that it will be the end of his very long journey. It turns out that one of the prostitutes, the deformed and quiet girl, aware of a lump, and a desperate man makes her tell him where she was and what had happened to her since he left. The story she tells him as deplorable as it is hard to swallow ... <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the Japanese cast mostly fluent -English American. But I leave it in the fact that it is not too much. What is the big deal however, as the rest was poor. Miike story moves at such a slow pace that I could not look at his watch several times during the 63 minutes. Increased torure-scene that takes place somewhere in the middle of the movie, I felt so unmotivated - and pornographically obsessive - that even this scene has become interesting. I felt that it was violent for the sake of violence - with no sense of style or purpose. Only the scenes that provoke any emotions I had images of bloody fetuses rolling along the bottom of the fast flowing water ... and to be honest, only emotions, they were provoked disgust feelings. <br /> <br /> journalist looking for the love he left behind plays Billy Drago, for me, the most memorable, as Frank Nitti - Al Capone whiteclad Assassins in De Palma The Untouchables (1987). I have always found Dragos image Nitti be very icy (and I mean that in a good way), and it's probably why I was almost annoyed when I found it so scary (not in a good way) in this one. Its action seems to be flowing whatsoever displays some really bad replays between any feelings or empathy. When his character must react to the horrible things have been subjected lump I was sitting on the couch, twisting and turning in an attempt to avoid the dreaded actingjob advanced drag. I am grateful that most of the stories told Yuoki Kudo (Memoirs of a Geisha, 2005), plays a deformed prostitute. <br /> <br /> In the final are likely to be clogged, perhaps even disgusting and backward, but I just found it to be kind of ... you know ... "blah" (and again I He looked at his watch, for umptieth time, just wanting a crappy episode ends). Maybe finale made me smile just a little bit, but that's only because I could not help but think of an episode of Red Dwarf, and up and down his chin Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules, his eyes glued on them to make them look as aliens ... Lucky you, you've seen this episode, i have now decided to look at the Imprint, I am forever ruined visual ending for you. <br /> <br /> My first thought when imprint finally ended, was that the only thing that made it worth the pain to watch was the main title theme hearing, Edward Shearmur (the same music that I think is used in every episode of the series), and what - if anything - big fucking warning, do not you think? <br /> <br /> You can specify the design of the suit, Michiko Kitamura, and say that, at least, that there is not enough style and sophistication .. .But there are so many other films and TV shows, so much better, showing a Japanese "geisha-fashion". This is nothing but inferior, and I'm disappointed. Master Takashi Miike in horror episodes sad, boring and meaningless. In other words; This is a very, very bad!
