It was an amazing story! ;) I've seen movies with a smaller plot (I do not want to mention Asian films, but ...). I thought that the camera is not bad for a cheap movie like this, and the atmosphere was not so bad. There's no real reason for most of the things that people do and how they react to what happens. Although I think that a lot of movies, in this case, it was awful, of course. <br /> <br /> He ripped several movies so bad for specific scenes only. The acting was bad, but I've seen worse. The film was bad, but I've seen worse. Watching this movie is an experience of boredom, clowns seizures, death wishes, sadism, horniness and entertainment at a low level. <br /> <br /> So, if you like bloody movies with silly sites is one the right movie for you. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3/10, because it can be an interesting, if you do not expect to see a good film, and you're in the right mood.
