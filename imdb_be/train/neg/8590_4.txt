Ridiculous. Angelic 9-year-old Annakin turns maudlin Brat 19-year-old Annakin, who somehow seems attractive to Amidala, five years his senior. Now the 22-year-old Jedi warrior Annakin hero has a few bad dreams, and therefore it is necessary to slaughter the children, their friends, and the whole basis of its existence as a crazy old man persuaded him to a) his precious wife can really die, and b) only he can prevent it. Ludicrosity squared. <br /> <br /> I think that people who like this film, not paying attention. Funny story. Symbols incredible (in the literal sense, and not perverted sense of "fantastic", "excellent", etc.). <br /> <br /> Obi-Wan Kenobi was a wise and good anchor for the entire series, but in the climax, he breaks the legs of Annakin, to allow him to burn in the lava, and leaves him to suffer. Do not anyone think that's a little out of character? Not to mention that it was pretty stupid to risk his life, as it turns out. <br /> <br /> I was expecting at least a story that shows the sequence of symbols with a respectable motives. Nothing of the sort here. The story could have been written 10 years ago. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, CGI is pretty cool.
