... and they tire you right out of your mind! Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD films from the 70s, made without any actors of any note, awkward scenario, bitter, direction, and a tireless desire to fuse the "horror" with a light comedy. This film is a paleontologist who finds drawings of aquatic dinosaur under the crater lake ... a meteor falls from the sky, and water claymation dinosaurs grade begins to terrorize and eat resident surrounding Crater Lake. The whole thing will take care of our local sheriff Steve. Much of the film - if not specified pools of blood left over from what we imagine to be, dining beast - held after the awkward Antic two guys named Arnie and Mitch controlling boat rental place. They try so bad to be funny, we get lines like looking at a business sign, Mitch says Arnie "You see the bait wrong, it is spelled B-A-T-E.Â» Laughter was pretty poor here. Then we see them get drunk together and imagine the trunk of a tree to be a dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy look out! Dinosaur looks fake, but the film is fun in a bad way. And, at least, the lake is beautiful.
