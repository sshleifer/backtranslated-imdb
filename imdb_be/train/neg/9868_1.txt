I almost never comment on the movie, but I have seen 5 of glowing reviews of this "movie" and decided that I had to weigh in with my own review. Mine instructor got this film in the mail, interspersed with his roar Academy (AMPAS, otherwise the guys who vote on the Oscars), and was so impressed with the way this film badly constructed that it has brought to our class to show us how not collected film. <br /> <br /> In this film there is no plot, scenes are not terribly, terribly edited (often with the help of Faux Â«24" style methods, picture-in-picture), and performances (in particular lead, who can not even to themselves as bad actress), mostly unpleasant. Someone really fail to understand the point of administration, namely, the creation of the story. There's no setup! In the middle of the film, neither I nor the rest of the class knew that this film was supposed to be about. Opening the camera crane, which establishes a kind of murder never solved, and now that I think about it, was probably meant to be a flash-forward to the rest of the movie as a flashback, but it takes away from the scene directly to another without any indication as such. <br /> <br /> Bah, I could really go on and on. At least, this movie gives me a lot of confidence in their own ability set.
