I feel like I'm the only kid in town who was annoyed performance Branagh. He's a great actor in the opinion of the majority, but he just could not pull off a southern accent. I mean, it was disappointing. It was as if he was trying too hard to be cut. One of the previous reviewers question why actors are not US N were cast in this film. I second this notion. It's great when actors / actresses want to expand their horizons, but it's another thing to try too hard, so that the performance becomes tense. Maybe it was Altman, but he's such a great director ... <br /> <br /> Well, I really do not want to beat Bran its absolutely disgusting accent too much. Everyone deserves to screw here and there. But it's hard to watch something so annoying that you would like to choke a chicken bone or eat a bucket of shit than sit through a gingerbread man.
