Tourists heading to Ireland for a school trip to learn about the Druids. What they face is a terrible story about a cannibalistic killer. <br /> <br /> If I had to sum up the breed of evil, it will be a low-grade gusset Festival. The film mixes Living Dead, Evil Dead, Wrong Turn all in one. It's just too bad that the film has so many inconsistencies that follow, that it loses any "fun" could be watching. The film has a lot of random "horrors" of nudity ... although the film also stars porn star four, four YUP, so that could have been a lot more. The breed also shows a good amount of gore. <br /> <br /> Evil Breed has a terrible start with ridiculous dialogue and terrible action. It is a given in the direct to video horror film, but this takes the cake. I can not understand who is the protagonist as a woman who "lives" in the end, is not actually in the movie all that much. Talking about the final which must be one of the most random and false endings in film history. It makes no sense to the rest of the film and completely changes his mind about the movie. <br /> <br /> You should see this film to believe it, as there are some pretty big death scene. There are two scenes of death that come to my mind, one in which inbred killer breaks inside with a naked woman through her chest to her breasts .... do not ask me. Other identifier when a guy gets his insides, again, taken out through his anus. Does it kill the guy? No, the killer continues to suppress a guy with his own intestines. These scenes remind me most of the Dead-Alive, with the right amount of humor in each. I also got a sense of Evil Dead, with meaningless mention of horror films and Sam Raimi. Along with Halloween, when a female character in the toilet screaming for his life with a murderer, trying desperately to get into the <br /> <br /> Although the gore and nudity is not enough for the poor audio and visual. film quality. If the teacher wakes up out of bed and goes down the stairs, her footsteps loud and strong, it seems that she was wearing a pair of boots. Distraction for sure. As well as the continuity of the film, with only one innate killer? As a character dies in a moment. I could not tell when the chicken breast implant was Jenny, or Gary's sister / cousin ... I can not remember. As well as the occasional naked chick with a dead baby hanging from her body, still attached to the umbilical cord. <br /> <br /> terrible editing a distraction, as well as introductory loans too quickly and disorient. It really was a bad start and got better, but the ending just brings the film back to monstrous levels. If possible, have the best production values ​​and more faith put into this movie, it would not be terribly butchered to death. Stay away from this movie, if you are not satisfied with the lower budget awful bad movie with a decent baked blood.
