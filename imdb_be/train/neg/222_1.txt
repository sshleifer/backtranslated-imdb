As a woman over 40 years old, I found this film very insulting and humiliating for single women over 40 years, not to mention any other woman, of any age. It was a sad, pathetic attempt by man to write and direct the "chick flick", and failed miserably. Andie MacDowell is not so much an actress to start with, but given the non-existent "plot" (I do not even want to call it a plot) in that it did not have a chance. There has been no development of character, there is no reason to feel sympathy / empathy for any of the characters, and not an attempt to make a film in any way realistic or plausible. And then there is the mandatory straight male fantasy attractive woman suddenly decided to try lesbianism. - PLEASE <br /> <br /> I do not only want to get their money back on a DVD rental, I also want these 112 minutes of my life back. That robbery.
