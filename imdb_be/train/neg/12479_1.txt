Deathstalker is ideal for fans of B-movie fantasy; It is hardly 80 minutes parody film has all may be asked to hecklers - existent conspiracies, the horrible action (save, at least, hoarse-sounding old), ridiculous scenarios and hack-work and editing style is not suitable background setting. There's no characters that come across as likeable or interesting (in particular, lead has nothing attractive about him), and actors gathered hardly do anything to climb over the F-class material. If this is not enough, then how about the absence of a meaningful story (which this film does not have anything like that) to make Deathstalker qualify as a major turkey? I was also offended that women in this film just serve no purpose other than 1) to be topless and / or half-naked; 2) to receive the rape; 3) sex with the hero; 4) all the above. In addition, the background music is disgusting; strange mess electronic noise, cheesy chorus bursts, and the roaring cacophony of an orchestra. Ear numb stupor and eyes all in one packaged nary a thing to keep one interested, Deathstalker, probably best suited for people who are looking for something to laugh (and believe me, there's a lot here). Otherwise, I do not recommend this 100th-class CONAN wanna-be to anyone anymore.
