This film is one of the reasons IMDB should allow for a vote of 0/10. Actions awful, even though some are praised, the nature of the Carpathians! The script looks like it was written in a hurry. In one scene, a black preacher who was left behind when he was asked what Buck «dan7» in computer graphics means, said: "Daniel 7 * Chapter 24 *" Probably, he meant verse 24, but the filmmakers missed this stumble. Perhaps worst of all is that the eschatological position of the film is biblically unsound. While many Christians adhere to the interpretation of a film about the end time events, this interpretation, in my opinion * * defective. In order to understand these limitations, read "Christians will go through the Tribulation" Jim McKeever and "happy hope, biblical study of Rapture and the Second Coming," George E. Ladd.
