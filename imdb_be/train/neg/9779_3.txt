Relentlessly silly, nya-budget "war picture" tailor-made to show the attributes of exciting Eva Meyer - not a bad idea in itself - but this should not be an embarrassment to anyone associated with him. Funny "script", the statement that will not be inspected in an elementary school Christmas theatrical, inept "action" scene, confused direction normal to the competent documentary filmmaker Louis Clyde Stoumena - which, apparently, is not quite sure if he was doing a comedy, a philosophical treatise on uselessness war or sideways T & A (early standards 1960s, anyway) travelogue magnificent Eve Meyer body - and a common air shoddiness and incompetence. Worth a look to see Eve Meyer struts her stuff, but that's pretty much it.
