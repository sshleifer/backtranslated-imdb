When I look back on my college days at Ohio State University, will always be one event in which I will remember with fond memories. Channel 23 has a local access channel OU and until recent years, largely played all that they were sent. This involved a lot of DIY films ranging from the guy microwaving marshmallow, and then views the scanning their photos to the Internet, to Macbeth version starring 8th graders, who apparently had just learned how to make firecrackers. <br /> <br /> However, the King, in my opinion, from the channel 23, the queue was North Skater. The first time I watched it was about 2am. I had to learn. Or sleep. Or watching regular TV. But no, all that for pussies. My roommate and I watched the Midnight Skater, and when it was finished, I do not think any of us believe that any of the film just happened. But of course, it was a few nights later, and we had to grab that this film really, really exists. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on about how awful it is, but a kind of awful things that make life worth living. The plot is inconsistent acting is terrible, all the scarring of the soul, but God, if there are other smotryut with you, it is impossible not to have a good time watching it. Its kind of like the first time you hear the "guts" Chuck Pahalniuk. You hear it, you are disgusted and shaken, but five minutes later, all that you want and desire to make someone experience abject horror simply tolerated. <br /> <br /> In short, North Skater, for all his epic shortcomings makes for some very late night fun. In addition, I desperately want the theme to midnight Skater. Kudos to those who wrote it and sang. Sweet God, I love this song.
