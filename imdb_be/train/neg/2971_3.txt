Batman Mystery Batwoman, is, in a word, stale. <br /> <br /> The story goes that a mysterious woman avenger ( «Batwoman») bursts on turf Batman, and while Batman is trying to deal with Penguin / Bane / Rupert Thorne way, he tries to find out who the mysterious Batwoman is. <br /> <br /> There's nothing surprising about this is wrong, but there is nothing special about it either, noting really made it stick. <br /> <br /> Mask of Phantasm Bruce has long lost love re-surface and mess with your head. <br /> <br /> Subzero was a major event in the life of Mr. Freeze. <br /> <br /> Even the movie Batman Beyond twist, Return of the Joker, dug deep with the characters that are involved. <br /> <br /> But the Mystery of Batwoman were some minor podagovory much formula crowned mediocre SETPIECE on a cruise ship. Honestly, this thing is more Scooby Doo, than Dark Knight, lacks punch and bite that the animated series was in his prime.
