Others have commented on the "decline", directed by Tobe Hooper, but what about Dourif? He was quite able to select good projects (as he proved when she appeared in the same year «Exorcist III»), why he agreed to appear in it? Of course, he gives the corresponding insane job, and the film does not tell the bad; it's just uninvolving, uninteresting and unsightly. These are the three "un-» s too much. (* 1/2)
