I did not even finish the movie, because I was so sad, I thought I was going to go I saw it in theaters, but my friends and I just got tired, so we got up and went to another film, if I ever need sit after 2 min. from this film again, I think I'll shoot myself ... and I know the whole movie entirely, because my friend told me what happened at the end, and I was not surprised, I mean, who does not know, that she was going to do the right thing, and let him be happy, I mean really, you have to be an idiot not to know that. I know that I did not miss anything, and if anyone asks, it's me see this movie, I would have said "over my dead body."
