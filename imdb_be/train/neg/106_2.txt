First observed 2003/03/08 - 2 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about carnivorous zombies 3 story in a movie chronicles. And so we'll see zombies eating human body parts in 3D !! Wow, NO !! This has been done again and again in 2D in a zombie movie, but that usually makes the best zombie movie the main plot is not the actual greedy. That's what made the original zombie classics well. Fond simply thrown in as an extra. We are really sad during most of this 3-part chronicle of lame (twilight zone, etc.) is easy to understand and slowly showed pacingly final years. The last story is really the story started with a movie (with a reporter investigating the so-called ghost town) and, of course, we see the flesh eating zombies in this one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, rather than the 3D-boring holiday.
