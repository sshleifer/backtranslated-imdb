As this piece of garbage was put film me. The only actor who for all I know of Reinhold, experienced actor, whose presence is the only reason for putting it into production. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's worth a nomination for the award of a rotten tomato, this movie really makes the B movies of cinematic pleasure. Car traveling on the highway with the police in tow, and no one knows how to stop the car, yes, yes. <br /> <br /> script must be written on the reverse side of the cigarette box. Most of the made for TV movies are terrible, but it redefines the word. Check the cast operator bridge, pure Oscar material.
