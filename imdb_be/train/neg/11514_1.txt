Without a doubt, when Madonna and Ritchie were married, it was because they both thought it would help her career in cinema. If you have gone through the ordeal of watching "Gone", you know, at this level, it was a match made in hell. After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or «octress», she could have spoken in «The Next Best Thing"), it still can not get out of yourself long enough to turn in a performance that some of taste can even be called decent. And this is what makes people do not like it so much on the screen: that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents it from being able to just let go and connect with her audience. If there is any justice in this universe, it just blew its last chance.
