I think that this film was supposed to be shocking. But the only way it's really shocking, shocking how bad it was done ... and just. It is one-and-half hours of torment. Especially that for the viewer than the characters in the film (five girls). <br /> <br /> Sure protagonists get their bloody piece in a bad way, that basically is good, as this horror- movie. I (usually) like horror movies. I have no problems with violence in this type of films. However, all the violence in this film is not the end all. This is not a sight other than that it is just grotesque. It's so lame even gets sad, and really too fast. <br /> <br /> The worst (if the above was not bad enough for you) about this movie is that they have tried to copy Blair Witch Project, which removes a cheap handheld cameras. But (again, this is also) serve no end at all. In «Blair Which», of course, there is an explanation, and they are their camera in search of a witch Blair. In this film, there is no other explanation than, "Hey ya'll, we would like it to be similar to the Blair !! witch "sound in the film, too, is something to get depressed about. Girls screaming so hysterically that many times you can not hear what they are saying. In addition, no effort has been made to do something better, sounds, or other wise. <br /> <br /> What, finally, there is the soundtrack, which is just as bad as the rest, ranging from cheap Euro-house in the worst rough hard rock ... <br /> <br /> My advice: do not look at it under any circumstances.
