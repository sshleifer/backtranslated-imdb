If you like to watch Mel Gibson's Million Dollar Hotel, you can enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in another movie so bad can never be distributed. I can confirm only the DVD version so maybe VHS version better quality wise, but a movie night and dark scenes were so poorly made that Everythings seems red. I first thought that my DVD players was messed up. It was not. If you insist on viewing it, I recommend you to adjust the color on the TV screen until it is black and white. If you do not, you'll never be able to get through the film. If you do it will just remind you of a bad movie, students are trying to revist Style Pulp Fiction.
