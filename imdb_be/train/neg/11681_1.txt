Trailers for this film was better than the movie. What a waste of talent and money. I wish I'd been waiting for this movie to come on DVD, because at least I would not be at $ 9 Full movie misses. What could be a wonderful movie for all participants, it proved to B-movie at best. The film was moving very slowly, and only then, when I thought it was somewhere, he almost did, but then it is not. In this day and age, we need to unpredictable plot twists and close to the cinema, and the film did not offer any. It's all about how each suspect is well, however, not sure if it was the way it was directed, lighting, supply lines, writing or whatever, but nothing came of it. A lot of hype for nothing. I was very disappointed in this film, and I say to all, not to see it. Cheesy saxophone music for a film made worse as well. And the ending had no relation to the rest of the film. What a disappointment.
