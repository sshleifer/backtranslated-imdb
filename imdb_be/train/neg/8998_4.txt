Stephen Feinberg, who played the proctologist and was one of the authors of the film, died early in 2006, I met Steve in Portland in 1993, it was the year of the last, when he told me that he was a writer in Hollywood years ago, working primarily on TV promo. He asked me not to see the "tunnel vision", but it was too late, I've seen it already! In fact, I've seen it many years ago, when he was released. At that time I did not think it was that bad film. However, seeing as an adult my opinion was somewhat different. Yes it's a little light-headed, as well as on. Steve admitted that it was not a very good film. This indicates that he was just a little proud of the sketch "proctologist".
