Ivan (Valery Nikolaev) is bitter, cynical journalist who investigates unexplained. He travels to the small town where he said that the witch (Ita Ever) terrorizing the community. <br /> <br /> His car kiosks and he takes refuge in a small building, and meets a beautiful, mysterious girl. Suddenly she turns into a demon, and he kills her, and the city is interesting who killed this woman ... I think she was a witch, but I'm not quite sure. Ivan now has its spirit, or something, and he must have faith, or something to beat him. <br /> <br /> I really hate Christian movies. They are usually filled with lame actors, silly storyline and minimal effects. Not to mention the fact that it is not only a Christian film ... but a foreign one, as well. Voiceover actor Ivan made the film more comic than to terrorize, because he is so high, camp, and a crybaby. You will not miss a lot of passes for this film.
