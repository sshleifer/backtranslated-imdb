So what I've heard from several people that this film brought them to tears in the theater. When I watched it for the first time when I was expecting a different romantic, the tear-jerking film Barbra Streisand; Something like The Way We Were. I certainly do not. The chemistry between the two main characters, Esther Hoffman and her John Howard, did not exist, which makes it impossible to become attached to the characters. There was nothing romantic. Streisand's character fell alcohol addict who could not sing a single note without me want to press fast forward. At some point, her character finds her husband in bed with another woman, and she will forgive him for about five minutes. There's nothing romantic about aperiodic rock star and a woman who can not seem to understand him until he actually dies. The film seemed to drag on and on, and I continued to ask myself, when will it end. <br /> <br /> The death of John Howard was quite predictable. But no doubt, an omen of his reckless behavior at an early stage in the film, and when he died, I did not feel any emotion at all. This is not a tragic accident, that it was he basically an idiot. Not to mention throughout the film I was distracted his hideous beard. <br /> <br /> Only a part of this movie is worth a look are the songs of Streisand. The ending of the film, when she sings "With One More Look At You / Watch Closely Now" my reason for giving this film a colossal 3/10. These 7 minutes were just a part of the movie I was really feeling emotions, but irritation and anger.
