I have seen most of the episodes RMFTM as a teenager on «Cliffhanger Theater" work after midnight on the local station a few years ago, and then again when the Mystery Science Theater riffed on it in the early '90s. Time has not been kind to him. <br /> <br /> I can, of course, make allowances for the special effects, which were very high for low-budget '50s series (flying scenes IMO Commando Cody were better than George Reeves / Superman in his TV shows). And I can also make allowances for um, "action", and fight choreography -. for a guy who plays the lord of the moon men exception. He's incredibly miscast. He looks and acts like a guy who comes to fix your plumbing, not autocratic head of an alien race. Even banal dialogue works all right - all the rattles his lines like a string of firecrackers, no wasted time or pauses for things like "thought" or "self-examination". Since all it does, the viewer finds him dive after a while, and even has a contemporary feel, it does not bother much. <br /> <br /> What really annoys me is the writing and drawings. I'm not talking about the sunny weather on the moon, or baking soda power rocket ships or flying suit, which has control Set "up / down" and "slow / fast". I did not even bother cheesiness resolutions to climax, ending each chapter. I'm talking about the fact that our prospective heroes dumber poles and have a cumulative memory. And the fact that, although this dialog clips along like an express train, the story again and again to go through the same movement. <br /> <br /> Dig it: Commando Cody and his friend are tip top secret high-tech scientific laboratory charged with protecting the Earth (or at least in the US) against an insidious alien invasion. But his office has no guards or security checkpoints. They do not even have locks on the front doors. So the bad guys go straight in and beat the crap out of Cody and his staff ... more than once (can be, of course), but several times. They even steal his assistant on the second try. And they never get smarter. To further prove my point, let me show you the way, Cody jumps into his flight suit and flies to get into trouble and do not really seem to be able to catch someone. He does it again and again and again. Cody also ship flying to the moon (female assistant comes to cook), it remains for about 30 seconds and immediately turns around and comes back. Cody grabs one of the guns Atomic Ray ... and then lose it again to the bad guys, because he could not be bothered to lock it. And so on. <br /> <br /> And you would think that if Cody efforts were so vital to the preservation of the United States on the Moon men, he may ask a few soldiers with carbines, several helicopters and a tank or two to support him, instead of just working with the local police all the time. This military operation should have been, but they act like it's another episode of «Gangbusters». <br /> <br /> All this is rather difficult to digest. I understand that the creators were severely limited the scope of their budget and time constraints of the story ... and I realize that Cody is actually quite tough Hombre (despite the fact that he loses half of his fist). But I just can not cry "DOORS! Blocked DOOOOR !! »when the bandits just go to his laboratory, or try to blow up the ship and did not take any security measures in place at the landing site ... not even a fence (!). <br /> <br /> However, this is normal. Of the three national series, I watched "Phantom Creeps" was the best story, and "Undersea Kingdom" had more atmosphere (ha!) And a better hero than "Radar Men", but that's okay time-waster. <br /> <br /> BTW ... why "radar" men? They did not use radar, they used the Atomic beam guns. whether the name should not have been «Atomic Ray Gun Men from the Moon?"
