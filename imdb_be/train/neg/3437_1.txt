yesterday I saw this movie. I must admit that this is not my cup of tea. Despite the fact that it must be a horror film in its own way. But as I looked at it, I thought .. "The film does not make any sense .." Where is this guy in a dark coat come from? Where were the two guys were going when they left the girl behind? Where on earth did the shark came out of ? <br /> <br /> All of these elements in this film somehow did not develop. I felt as if the filmmakers wasted so much time and money on a film that was so sure to be so shit. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of great horror movies in my time, but this is one of the most worst horrors that I saw. at the end of the film, I told myself that I would not watch it again .. So many dads show in this film, I decided to give it a thumbs down! Call me on it! 0 out of 10!
