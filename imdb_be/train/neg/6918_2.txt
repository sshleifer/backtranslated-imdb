I went to this movie thinking that it had good ratings. Firstly, it's ridiculous that they release the film was originally made in 2001, seven years later, in 2008, here in India. Everything in the film looks outdated. Even in 2001, the film looks like it was made on a shoe string budget. There is a scene where the taxi strikes people develop as a low budget you can get. Anthony Hopkins, seems to know what he does in the film. He ends up giving a long monologue to the end. If the film has a bright spark during this scene, I missed it, I slept in his place. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt does not look like the devil. It is inappropriate and vulgar clothes frowns random children. As for Alec Baldwin scene where he goes to meet Webster for the first time not to be missed. What a waste of money! Anthony Hopkins correctly put it, "Go home and write better!"
