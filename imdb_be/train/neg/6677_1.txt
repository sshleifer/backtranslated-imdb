After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb I was delighted by this film. But it's really a terrible movie, the total time you see a foreigner is about 5 minutes (the rest of the film is a cheap suspense) acting is over the top of their own history, oh boy, the story? <br /> <br /> the story does not seem to go in the direction of the first alien they capture (after 7 years! they finally successful), then they do not know what to do with it (after 7 years of age) and even want to release it (why the hell they captured him?). Then a friend who behaves most over the top, looking to get away from this madness, then all of a sudden it does not, then again, it does and what it does not. Then they came to the conclusion that the murder of a foreigner will kill the entire human race (and remember, all these years, no other person saw these foreigners permanently settled), and what they do? . They tortured him and blow a bunch of foreigners to the planets <br /> <br /> This is my first review on IMDb, I am a very lazy person who does not write very quickly, so listen to my warning: this step is not worth your time, do not look this film.
