Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors I appreciated throughout his career, and that was the only reason for choosing to see this movie. Well, all I can say, I totally regret it! These two great actor humiliate himself all the way to the end, completing a series of inconsequential, mundane and Kitch to the extreme (not that it is bad in itself) sketches, which should make people laugh, but not able to do it. The only reason I can think of that was directed by their friend, and they decided to support his film, starring in it, I can not think of anything else, because this movie is so cheap! Fortunately, Tim Robbins and John Cusack has not disappointed me so far. I would recommend you to avoid this movie if you do not want your opinion, which two actors are spoiled.
