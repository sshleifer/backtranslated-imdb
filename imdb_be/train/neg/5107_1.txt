There in the UK edition of the show, which is far less extravagant than the American version. The person concerned will receive a new kitchen, or perhaps a bedroom and a bathroom and a superbly grateful for what they have received. The American version of the show is all that reality shows should not be. Instead of making several improvements to the house, which the passengers could not afford, or by itself throughout the house gets rebuilt. I do not know if the show is trying to show that there is a lousy social security system in the United States, or if asking hard enough, you will get. Quite vulgar product placement which takes place, in particular, Sears, also inappropriate. Rsther, than the transformation of a family in a poor neighborhood in potential millionaires, it would be much better to help the community as a whole, where instead of having to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for a house, build something for the whole community ..... maybe , a place where goods and power tools can be borrowed and returned, along with building materials, so that everyone can benefit should they want to. Giving it all to one person, it can cause a lot of resentment among the rest of the community, who still live in the same run-down houses.
