Protocol is unlikely the film, the only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn, along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around a ditzy waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently save the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes downhill halfway through the movie, and the charm of Gold just does not save this film. If you are not an advocate Goldie Hawn goes out of his way to see this movie.
