The actress makes a movie in Africa kidnapped and taken into the jungle, where it is held for ransom. The producer hires someone to go and bring it back. Complicated are all cannibals in the jungle, who worship really ugly that look "god" who loves to eat naked woman. <br /> <br /> This mountain raunchy movies. There is an abundant amount of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against nudity. CBO exploitation films designed for the deepest darkest parts of our beings, and if the film is not so boring, this film will be a classic. Let's face it, despite the gore, the opposite sex and violence, and the ugly monster this movie is snoozer. Walk from all defective and it puts you. There are several storylines that all seems to be happening separately from each other, although, ultimately, it is only one story. The worst thing is that almost no one says anything. Most of the minimal dialogue refers to cruelty or one character testified that "I will do what I want." Its so quiet and sad movie, if not frequent cries of the victims, I would recommend it as a sleep aide. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to avoid if you do not want to sleep, or if you do not need to see all the Euro-cannibal film. <br /> <br /> (aside. VideoAsia just released it as part of their series of Terror Tales. print them strange letter boxed, which appears as a result of their decision to print from the Japanese source (there blackout), which has been cut off, to remove subtitles. print them, too, has no opening credits)
