Beautiful Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who dies after the angel of ice crushes it before the "I" with her fiance, Henry (Paul Rudd). After two years, Henry is still on and his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) is very concerned about. Chloe organizes Henry ~ d, to talk to attractive psychic Ashley (Lake Bell). Contact Keith Ashley spirit who wanted to help Henry get his life. If the psychic begins to get attracted to Henry, Kate ghost is to stifle the romance in the bud. There are some funny situations; but if you've seen the trailer you saw the movie content. Also starring Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, W. Morgan Sheppard, and Wendi McLendon-Covey. I personally thought that Bell stole the show from Parker. Biggs And, as usual, a pain in the butt. However, this film was more swollen.
