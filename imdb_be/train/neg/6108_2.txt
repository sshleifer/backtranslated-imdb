Ape Man Tarzan remake of one thousand nine hundred thirty-two film at the same time, and both the earlier film, it has little to do with the literary hero Burroughs. But while the 1932 Tarzan was reduced to - speech "Tarzan, Jane," that Tarzan plays Miles O'Keefe, does not speak or even grunt. He does make Tarzan yell a couple of times, that sounds like it was taken from the earlier films. <br /> <br /> No, Tarzan plays second banana After Derek as Jane. Or rather, as the third banana to the left breast After Derek and her right breast. This film has no meaning, but to show Derek naked. <br /> <br /> The two scenes in the film is presented in slow motion, and very bad. More evidence that no one cared. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, Tarzan has orangutan side impact in this movie. Maybe he car combined in Sumatra with Indian elephants, which are also on display.
