I do not understand the positive comments made in this film. It is cheap and disgusting at all levels, and I can not understand how this has ever been done <br /> <br /> Cartoon characters abound. - swearing, alcoholic, slacker, Sue Irish father is a prime example. None of the characters are not remotely pretty - except, briefly, for the Asian friend Sue, but even then he is able to domestic violence! How desperately unattractive, both of them, I have no idea why or Rita and / or Cb to jump into a complete creep Bob - but on condition that they do, why do I have to wait, do not care what happens to them ? So many reviews keep carping on about how "realistic" it. If this is true, it is a sad reflection of society, but no reason to put it on film. <br /> <br /> I do not like the movie at all.
