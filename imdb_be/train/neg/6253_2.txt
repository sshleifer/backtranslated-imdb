Not a very good film, but according to the information, it's pretty accurately reflecting the methods of torture. The aim of the film was to show the cruelty of war camps, NC and is done quite efficiently, with surprising candor over time. there Whatever the technical shortcomings (and there are many), watching it you will see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some pretty nasty stuff. - again, disgusting, because it is on the north of the demilitarized zone, and not in Guantánamo <br /> <br /> I do not think that any of the Korean Veterans torture raised while working in the office, and when you look films like this pork chop Hill compared with the films of Vietnam. I do not know whether it was the people in the 54 trapped in the concept of the Second World War (the boys tend to sharpen a lot) or a war or something, but it is interesting to see it from the same system, that in 16 years will be making such movies like «Go Tell The Spartans".
