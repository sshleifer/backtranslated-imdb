Wow. This is about as much as I can say right now. Who writes this stuff? Who makes this stuff? That respects the actor agreed to "act" in this material? Oh my God! I do not know how I made it through this movie, but I think that the fact that I had the 8 cups of coffee on the same day was a key element in the maintenance of woke me up. Lord! It was one of the most buzzed-out and predictable pieces of cinema I've ever seen ... and for the record, I never plan to "witness", it once again. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw the movie when I bought the DVD (Mistake # 1). I mean ... I realized, hey! Julia Stiles. I love it. It's cool. I'll watch it as soon as I get home (mistake # 2). I tried to watch it without moaning every five minutes wondering if this bunch of crap will come to an end, in fact I did. But I was unsuccessful. It was one of the worst things I've ever seen. I mean ... that this thing where he is, what will happen then snapped back into real life? It's annoying enough if a father to do this in the "paternity" as a decade ago. The "joke" - and believe me, it takes a lot to me, to call them that - stupid, banal and forgettable characters, the plot is quite predictable ... all this makes the film, which must be wiped off the WRITE HISTORY! I should have figured something was wrong when I realized that I had never heard of this film. It was most likely directly to DVD. <br /> <br /> To anyone who might think to look at it, I have one piece of advice. DO NOT! For the love of God ... NOT !!! I am ashamed to have it in his collection of DVD, and I can not get rid of it ... No one and I mean no one wants to buy it from me! And I say second-hand and thrift stores third-hand, what to buy dirt from your shoes and stick it in a shop window. This should let you know how this shit.
