Like all movies carnosaurs, it's a joke. How dinosaurs move reminds me of when my sister played with dolls, because they can not be any hard or a false view of what they were. <br /> <br /> The story makes no sense. I mean, first of all, they are on the bus, then in stock, then, suddenly, they were on the boat. And let us seriously, it makes sense that the pair of dinosaurs can stay together in a van or on a ship? I thought that dinosaurs were the largest animals, and now they can fit in a moving van. It sounds silly, even if you think about it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave it 3, it's because it's still interesting. I found it better than the first (not watched the second long). Just do not rent it out. I saw it on TV, and it's a good thing I did because I did not want to spend money to rent it.
