I read with interest the Rice novel, and became very fascinated with the characters and heartbreaking story based on historical truths. <br /> <br /> However, I was blown away by this disastrous adaptation. The casting was based only on appearance, rather than acting talent (with the notable exception of Peter Gallagher, who was not a blond-haired, to act his way out of a wet paper bag). strikingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts to cast when exposed to a French accent was funny, but not in the form of a game. I found myself wincing through this confusing and melodramatic tripe, and was surprised that I made it to the end <br /> <br /> precautions for fans of the novel. - stay away from this.
