The saddest thing about this "tribute" to the fact that almost all the performers (including the otherwise incredibly talented Nick Cave), seems to have missed the whole point where Cohen intensity is giving his lines in an almost silent poise, Cohen sends a full of his poetry, his irony, his full humanity, laughter and tears in one. <br /> <br /> in order to see some of these singers upstarts make intricate facial flour, begin their miserable squeal in a patent attempt to shout "I'm a singer!," is a real pain. It's the same feeling many of you are probably listening to some horrible operatic version of simple songs like Lennon «Imagine». nothing, simply nothing comes close to the simplicity and directness of the original. If there is an art form that needs no embellishment, is the art of Cohen. decorations throw it in the street, looking like a tasteless poppies same sex for sale. <br /> <br /> In honor of Cohen I found that the pain and suffering, through a miserable and terrible tribute reinterpretation, all of them are completely missing the irony of the original masters, and to be honest, some of these singers It sounded as if they had been recruited at some refuge talent show it Cohen makes a tribute to them, allowing them to sing their stuff, in fact, and not the contrary. they might have been friends, or his daughter, he could become a very sensitive and in the mood for a gift. It is a pity that did not stay in the family. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, but only at the very end, he Koen fulfilled his majestic "Tower of Song», but even this flower was spoiled completely irrelevant background with U2, they carry expression, children are boring if they visit their poor grandfather in a nursing home. <br /> <br /> boring show, in fact, and more sad, if you really love Cohen, as I do.
