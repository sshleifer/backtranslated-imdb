This film is completely rubbish. Some imbecilic intellectual consoling himself by doing everything possible to claim the superiority of the aristocrat over the working class. Nothing more than a piece of complacency catharsis. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> If this kind of film is set in the US, it will be sure to make yourself a big joke. And just because it comes from "the other side", he makes a masterpiece, great fun for certain brain washing and / or rinsing westerns brain (a George W. possible :). . A typical consequence of the cold war, some joke or other <br /> <br /> I would like to say, if it is - as the revealed in the film - that's all that Soviet intellectuals thought about all these years, it may be, they deserve all the hardships, they claim that they have passed. BUT NO! Because like many others, I read and looked real masterpieces made real prominent Soviet intellectuals. For example, what's the relationship with the dog, "White Bim Black Ear" - both the book and movie Troepol'skaya Stanislav Rostockiy - a true masterpiece. Real life, real tragedy, real sad, real pride and dignity, one of the real best of the Soviet era.
