Note: I can see from the various reports that was the original silent version, and audio version of the same movie. I have seen the audio version, and it was aesthetically yicky. Given some point out that the original version was longer and without the lousy dubbing, my review should be read with this in mind. <br /> <br /> Though I know that Rene Clair has an excellent reputation as a filmmaker and Louise Brooks a little cult, and this is largely technically poorly made film. While Hollywood has pretty much moved in silent mode around 1929 through the beginning to almost the mid-30s, many famous French films were mostly silent films - with some dialogue and sound effects are very bad slapped on top of the film. Movement of the lips of many and, in particular, this film does not even come close to matching what they say, and it explains why Americans like Ms. Brooks can make a French film. It's just messy, and I'd rather they just made a silent film - and as a silent film it would be an average film. - with excellent camera work (at times), and some decent dumb style action <br /> <br /> problem I also found the film too simplistic storyline. For a quiet morality ca. 1920, it would be good, but until 1930 the plot a little hoary standards (which means "old" - not "slutty"). The lady will win a beauty contest and its my fiance can not handle it. It gives all of this is temporary, but was lured back into the bizarre life, and this spells the end of it! A little melodramatic, is not it? And also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> Finally, the nature of the groom on the other (?) I found very disturbing and surreal. He looked like Harold Lloyd and spent most of the movie abused and stick to each other and to everyone else. He just took him throughout the film and the resolution of the dispute did not happen, his character seemed unnecessary, and treatment that he received vile. Viewers must have been laughing at him mocked? It seems to me that this is what is meant, and I do not like at all. <br /> <br /> There are much better French films era (Le Million, La Femme du Boulanger, Fanny, Vernet, and others), as well as more silent films. I just can not understand the high rating of this film.
