You know, Jason, you know, Freddie, and you know leather. Now, get ready for: The Safety Pin killer! This is true, in the killer workout, stupid slasher film, if I've ever seen, invisible killer sends him (or her?) Victim with oversized, novelty pins. It is a strange choice, to be sure, the kind of thing that deserves an explanation. Of course, the film is never even trying to find out where he has gained such a thing. <br /> <br /> As the name implies, an aerobics gym is under siege by an insane killer, and everyone is a suspect. In fact, the film gives so little to shed light on the identity of the killer, almost everything in the film is a potential killer, until they are killed. And since almost everyone but the killer dead end, it's really just a process of elimination. <br /> <br /> Ironically, while the full name killed gypsum, aerobic exercise continues in earnest. In fact, nothing can stop dancing. While three people were killed in the next room, the training continues. Death does not even factor; one character dies, but is still considered an important place in the next sessions of training. Director David Ko knew what he was doing when he called the film Killer workout and Logical workout. <br /> <br /> Cop chases, explosive solarium, and hundreds of shots unprotected flesh Women throw in for good measure. Much like the woman caught in the solarium, I felt very uncomfortable by the end of the killer workout. Finally, fortunately, the end flashed on the screen. What happened next? You got it, the boom of the women working outside. Not even the end of the movie that can stop them! <br /> <br />
