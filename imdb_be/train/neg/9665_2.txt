Interested? Hardly. "Scientific evidence" film delivers its point (that explain that the Jews are the cancer) so stupid and lame, it's almost funny (if we do not know what happened in that era). <br /> <br /> It is important? Nah. I can not imagine the Germans (even though terrible time) would like to believe this film. Compare that Riefenstahl de Triumf Willens. Now, when I was a film that I was amazed. It's just a stupid waste. <br /> <br /> «best» of the scene with M (one of my favorites), where (a Jew, as a speaker so eloquently goes on to remind us) Lorre plays -molester child murderer. In the eyes of these filmmakers, only depraved mind can do it. Uh-huh. I did not know that M was Hitler's favorite film, right? <br /> <br /> No, that's just silly. Even that Nazi propaganda-genre. 2/10.
