I do not know why I take the time to consider this waste of film time. If you stick with it long enough to conclude the suit in the hope ?? good, bad, or the weird ?? no. It's finally out of steam after a fierce, patterns, predictable dialogue and action. Indoor scene so dramatically lit you think the camera has been increased by one millimeter further, you would see the klieg lights. Costumes, hairstyles, sets and starched, pressed and spotless. Are we to imagine ordinary people actually lived like that in the beginning of the 20th century, Arizona? comparing other reviews Sam Peckinpah an insult Peckinpah: at least, the director wove his violence in the context of chaos and lawlessness. HARD MEN Gore is gratuitous exploding firecrackers wooden imitations of bad guys with manicured nails. Huh?!? I can not believe that Heston thought it might be something worth doing with this movie. (He really gets to grab the gun in his cold fingers.) But Coburn? I'll never wonder why he signed up for this travesty. Want to watch a movie about the end of the West as we know it, the end of Westerns, as we know them? See the most accurate or Unforgiven again. LAST MEN hard obituary is a mockery to the west.
