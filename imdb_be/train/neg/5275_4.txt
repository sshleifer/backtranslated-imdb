The disappearance of some couples who take his family on vacation in New Mexico and find yourself in serious trouble after a detour from the main road to visit the city, which was seemingly abandoned in 1948 for unknown reasons. City Weaver seems harmless at first and is a tourist attraction, while the family is not bound there all night, and they begin to have reasonable grounds to suspect that others have experienced their own plight fatal. The Henleys Watch Blair-Witch-Project-Esquire video diary left by the last victim of the city, which is ironic demonstrates better performance of those who in this film. Although Hamlin and speeches Day are much better than the supporting casts, their emotional impact appears "flat" to me throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The disappearance attractive for most of the movie, since there are a lot of suspense and good direction. Nevertheless, the story takes an unexpected and unbelievable twists and turns that seemingly does not make sense. What's worse is that there is really no understanding of what is happening in the film, making a bizarre ending less tolerant. It seemed to me that the filmmakers were so focused on creating a thread tense scene, they rejected all the elements of good story-making: the development of the plot, and the gradual explanation of the symbols that lead to the solution / outcome cohesion. <br /> <br /> The most challenging aspect of the film for me was the fact that the first three quarters of this was spent building up tension and curiosity about some aspects of the plot, which were then suddenly withdrawn as if we Wait "t deserve explanation: < br /> <br /> What is the significance of Indian symbols on the walls? What happened to the original people of Weaver? Which has been in touch with people for dinner? The sheriff know? That detect the missing boy, if anything? <br /> <br /> This, I believe, a bad move, because it gives rise to some resentment. I put quite a bit of brains in the hypothesis of some plausible explanation for some of these plot twists and strange events, only for the filmmakers just finish it without giving an answer to any of these things. Here are some good cliffhangers to end the miniseries, which is going to pick-up again next week, but it was the end of care and inappropriate for independent film.
