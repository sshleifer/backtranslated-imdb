Sad haunted house thriller finds American family moving into a 200-year-old house in Japan, where there was a violent murder suicide of a love triangle. <br /> <br /> Novel installation of a single element of interest in this very slow moving with a wave of horror director Motel Hell. The film forms a zero suspension and consists of several volatile scenes that rarely seems to be leading anywhere in general. <br /> <br /> One obvious example is the very early stage where the leading man visited the temple after he realized that his haunted house, the monk had been previously warned. Monk tells the story of the house (which the audience is already familiar with the opening sequence), and then the movie just cuts off at something else. Previously a monk offered to help. Well, where is the help? The family continues to be in a haunted house as things get worse and worse, and no mention of the monk is not done until near the end, when he turns again to do what he had to do an hour earlier - to try to drive the spirits out of the house although so far it is difficult for the audience to care. <br /> <br /> There are some (perhaps) unintended mannered laughter to the American actor in the end becomes obsessed Japanese perfume and suddenly start making bad martial arts, I would probably say, because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of chainsaw duel with the same director Motel hell, which was more obviously meant to be funny, but overall it is forgotten rags.
