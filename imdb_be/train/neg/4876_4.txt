... if he remade Broadway Bill (1934), both on horseback (1950). Restructuring Bing Crosby as DAN Brooks did not help the script, which was "dated" in 34 let alone 50. It is a sad film has a whole scene, raised from the original with many of the supporting cast repeating their roles if they were not dead. While being older, it seems, it does not matter to the director. Nor that the cars and the clothes in the background plates in 1934 does not seem to match up too standard 1950s. Not even singing "Der Bingel ^" can redeem this work. <br /> <br /> We evaluated both the original and the remake IMDb **** Four stars. Frank touch was long gone, and all that remains CAPRA-grain. This did not prevent Mr. Capra, though. After hanging around the 50s doing some educational documentaries, he started his career alteration Lady For A Day (1933) as Pocketful of Miracles (1961). Again, the penalty throw was launched on this IMDb six ****** Star effort than as originals Eight ******** stars. Sometimes it is better to leave while you were yet to come, as soon as the Union states (1948).
