The movie was HORRIBLE !!! Easily the worst film I've seen in the last few years. One of those movies, I'll be able to tell the people in the next three years, it was the worst movie I can think of. Thank you for giving me the answer to this burning question: "What is the worst movie you've seen?" The answer: Celestine Prophecy. Trust me ... I read the book, enjoyed the message and was excited to see the film, but then, they treated the audience like we r * is delayed. There's no history, and the history that there paralyzed by too much magic and coincidence. It's too bad they have to lay out nine prophecies, and not just to weave them into a story, an entertaining follow. They do not spend time on the development of character, and it was just not care if a character has died. It was uncomfortable to be one of the few people who stuck around until the end of this incredibly boring movie. The book is quite sad, too, but I enjoyed the parallels that can be seen in everyday life, while you read a book. The film does not offer the same opportunities, and I would suggest seeing it, if you want to continue to keep the word of the book to heart. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. Trust me.
