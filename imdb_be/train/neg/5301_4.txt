I bought this movie because it was Shah Rukh Khans Debut.And I also liked to see how he would do.I have to say it was amazing he role.Divya Bharathi beautiful in this movie.Rishi makes sustained excellent job. Susham Seth well.Alok naogo was good in his role.Amrish and Mohnish did their part well too.Dalip was also good in their little role.Actors shines in the direction of a mediocre show average.The film editing poor.The sad story. it tells us about the famous pop singer.He Ravi has a lot of them female fans.One Kaajal.Ravi Kaajal and fall in love and get married.Ravi killed by his cousins.Kaajal becoems ​​to escape from widow..To Ravis cousins.They go Bombay.She comes Raja.She falls in love and gets married.Ravi returns.The predictable.The story is the climax of the first half predictable.The bores.It also entails lot.But he saved actors and music.The second half entertains. The music is catchy with some good songs.The cinema looks outdated in t he first half, but it looks unimaginative.The picturisations sad song for «Sochenge Tumhe Pyar» and one rain song.The suits except outdated.Any are ways to watch it just for actors and music rating 4/10
