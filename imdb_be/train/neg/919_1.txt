Although I must admit that I laugh more, watch this film than in the past few comedies that I've seen. <br /> <br /> The budget should be composed of pocket change from the actors. the production values ​​are so low that they did it the actual look of fun to watch. It reminds me of a robot monster consisting of a guy in a gorilla suit with a helmet on cardboard diving. <br /> <br /> In one scene, the unfortunate victim gets their hands and feet cut off. Geez, it is difficult to believe, but the Black Knight scene from the Holy Grail was more realistic. I wondered why the victim started screaming, "Do not Shall Pass» and «It's just too early, I have had worse." It was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in the last year. <br /> <br /> «Gladiator / demon" was a stitch too. Between terribly cheap suit and defiant expression guy in his final result was hysterical. <br /> <br /> really a film that is bad enough to be watchable. Kind of like seeing a slow motion car crash on film. <br /> <br />
