What a horrible sight. fan fiction seems more personal look, regardless of quality. It amazes me that something exceptional, like Firefly lasts one season, while the debris is a remake of Battlestar Galactica generates spin. This branch is a pity in every aspect of the show. It acts against minors and inspiration. Symbols cardboard cliches of all that has ever been in a bad series of Sci-Fi. History bad. Dialogue is worse than in the prime-time soap opera. The direction is of poor quality and many are terrible. Caprica film waste, waste of time and a waste of effort. It should never have been made a spin on it.
