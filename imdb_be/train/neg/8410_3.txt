This film is all flash and no soul. The actors put a lot of passion in the figures, but these figures are not often associated with the film and felt as standalone videos. And no effort was made to a number of sound as if they were happening in front of you, each one sounds like its coming out of the studio, basically suck all the life out of songs. Off stage performance was dull and unfulfilled, especially Hudson, who, in fact, play the same anger, "strong" (she is stubborn and egotistical) black woman, which we have seen before. There was absolutely no depth of her character, nor any of the other women are. Although I think that the film wants us to believe that the nature of the Hudson is facing difficulties because of its weight, it really is its own failure to do what's best for the team, which lands her in trouble, making the end of the film completely pointless . Oscar Hudson joke, there was no reason. When she sang, she reached the emotions (though it is often ridiculous, but it was a mistake screenwriter / director), but if she's just acting, she did nothing to flesh already underwritten character. Eddie Murphy character is the only one with the arc, and he did a good job, but still not Oscar worthy. The only actor who has really brought something to roll, Danny Glover, who took a small, relatively poor nature and did something real out of it. There's nothing to sink your teeth into, no drama or heart, or even laughing. Location musical numbers were so bad that at times the film almost seemed to be making fun of musicals instead of being alone; number when Hudson argues with the other girls in so many words, if there were more could pass for a parody of Family Guy. The film has no idea what she was, and I felt humiliated in the last few minutes. This is a big, sad waste of time, but in fact this is the worst movie I saw in '06, and nothing in the past year was a very stellar to begin with.
