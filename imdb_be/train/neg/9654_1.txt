The film is clearly bad. Just awful. A string of bad films of Bollywood has no end! They must be running out of excuses for making such terrible movies (or not). <br /> <br /> The problem seems to be mainly with the directors. This film has 2 good actors who have proven in the past that it is possible to deliver a great performance ... but they were sent bad. Poor script does not help. <br /> <br /> In this film there are a lot of funny moments and a very bad editing in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After his 1st big concert, Ajay Devgan, meets with Om Puri (from which he fled 30 years ago and again talked about) and all Om Puri is said to beware of him friendship with Salman !!! What a load of crap. Seriously. Not to mention baaad track. Whatever happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy? <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgun totally for drawing miscast in Rockstar. <br /> <br /> Only saving grace are the good performances in the second half. Ajay bright as his hero shows his dark side. Just Salman, like a drug addict. <br /> <br /> Look out is possible only in the last half hour.
