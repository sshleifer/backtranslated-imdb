This movie was kind of interesting ... I had to look at the college class of India, but the synopsis tells you that this is a movie about one thing, if he really does not contain a lot of cold, hard information about these details. This is not quite true to the synopsis to the end, where they are carelessly trying to tie all the elements together. Gore factor is excellent, however. Even right at the beginning, you want to look away, because the blood is quite intense. Just watch this movie if you want to see some cool gore, because the plot is thin and make you sad that you wasted time listening to it. I have seen rumors on other sites about this film is based on real events, but you can not find any information about it on the Internet ... so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch.
