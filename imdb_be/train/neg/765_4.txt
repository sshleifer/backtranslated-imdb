Seriously, what were they thinking? During the year a number of Columbo tried some new things, and distracted from the usual successful formula, but this film really overdoes it. This film is basically very different from any other movie Columbo, but the differences are not in favor of the film. <br /> <br /> The most important thing, of course, makes this film different from any other movie Columbo is the fact that the killing takes place. The whole premise of this film is completely different, and it contains a sign in Colombo totally different environment and situation. In addition, in general it's just a completely different and more "modernized". <br /> <br /> Directed by Alan J. Levi did some other Columbo movies in the past, that's all very stick to the usual formula. It also makes a strange choice that he got chosen to direct this film. <br /> <br /> Columbo character and he feels completely different, perhaps because of the reason that he gets placed in a completely different environment and situation when he helps his nephew after his fiancee disappeared immediately after the wedding . The absence of a good discharge and trademark humor Columbo also certainly not make it good or pleasant hours. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the film begins not so bad, but the film begins to become more and more mockery with its history as it progresses. It's such a stupid written kidnap thriller with a story that is starting to become more and more unlikely. It also makes the film more unwatchable. This is a very interesting little Columbo record, which also is not sure to please your audience in any way. <br /> <br /> In addition, it does not help much that the support is not the most talented actors around, despite the fact that his character falls into a completely different situation, and the film was shot in a completely different style, Peter Falk still holds good, and the presence of several rescues this film. You can just visualize how this film would have been without it? It would be very bad, it satirizes a cheap film, which I can tell you. <br /> <br /> odd Columbo record that might be described as unsuccessful experiment distraction from the usual formula. <br /> <br /> 4/10
