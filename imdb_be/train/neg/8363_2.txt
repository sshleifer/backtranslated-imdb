I gave it a 2 instead of 1, because I think that «The Wild Women Wongo» worse. This is an exercise in patience. It's like a bad teeth cleaned dental hygienist. There's no story. There's no logic. There certainly is not a valid (though the shark has some quality of the dialogue). We are not surprised about anything. We do not know how people get where they got. It is always amazing to me how such a thing even get released. I agree with the previous writer that it's not even funny bad. I know. It's about 90 minutes long, and fill up that much space on the DVD collection. It's like a paperweight. Or a bad picture of you bought on sale starving artists. It covers the crack in the wall.
