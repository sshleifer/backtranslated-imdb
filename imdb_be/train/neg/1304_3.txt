Very low-budget film about a police procedural murder detectives who try to solve the murder of a woman whose body is in a stolen car in Central Park, and the only clue is a tattoo on her arm. Although RKO released, it looks like an independent production, which was picked up in the studio for distribution. Throwing and crew, with a few exceptions, among them - the young and the titles Lord Jack, directed by Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner - consist of a complete unknown, and it shows. Performances universally subpar and not to undergo screening in film school high school, the direction is difficult and choppy, and, as mentioned earlier, there is no chemistry at all between the leading actors. However, despite the many shortcomings of the film, it does have some good points. Location shooting in New York, and an ultra-low budget film, gives him a gritty authenticity is much like the far superior «The Naked City», shooting in the dark basement handled properly, and some of the investigative procedures clever. Otherwise, it's not much to write home about. It's worth a look, however, take a look at the most seamier areas of New York in the early 1950s, and old car buff will be delighted to see the legions of '30s and' 40s cars on the streets. <, Br /> <br />.
