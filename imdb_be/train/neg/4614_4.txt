It boggles the mind how the film was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because it is a bottomless or because, given the collective authority of the creative team behind it should really deserve them, but because in every category she was nominated for the honor of Prizzi's disappointing. Some argue that the old Hollywood pioneer John Huston lost it this time in his career, but I do not buy it. Just last year he signed a fine under the volcano, a dark character study set in Mexico, which ranks among the best he's ever done. Prizzi's Honor, on the other hand, the film is loaded star power, with good intentions and a decent script, it is a major disappointment. <br /> <br /> The general tone of the story and gangster fall in love with a woman hits a man ahead of a nimble crimedies that caught Hollywood assault in the early 90 years, but the script is too convoluted for its own good, the motivation is turned off, and, in general, the story seems not sure exactly what he's trying to be: romantic comedy, crime drama, gangster saga, etc. Jack Nicholson (emphasis in Brooklyn, which works great for De Niro, but unconvincing coming from Jack) and Kathleen Turner in the lead roles, it seems, in the salary mode, simply going through the motions almost sleepwalking his way through some parts. Anjelica Huston on the other hand fares better, but its performance is disrupted motivations of her character: she begins to neglect the sacrifice her father a hypocrite, it is favorable to her ex-husband, it becomes a vengeful bitch who wants to head plate. <br /> <br /> color film have done for quality, as was done in the early '70s and the direction of Houston is uninteresting, just like everything else. There is promise in the history, and perhaps in the hands of director hungry to admit it, perhaps morphed to something better, but what's left looks like no film was not interested in creating.
