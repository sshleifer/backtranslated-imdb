... and * does *, as a purely logical and understandable, because in the drawn in this miserable amount of tired of Hollywood clichés. <br /> <br /> I'm 27, and I spent 16 years of his life fighting through crazy phobia and paranoid delusions. Like the main character in the film, I was successful, mainly because of the logic: because I kept thinking over and over again to preserve the illusion of reality, and to know what is really going on and what was not. In the end, I was very successful, because the drug, by the way, but I, of course, escaped the madness because I knew before I took drugs the difference between what is real and what was not. <br /> <br /> So, I feel entitled to tell you that this film is a complete fraud. Not only that, it is cheating with the history of the main character (who has not been faithful to his wife, who was bisexual - something very important here), but basically, it shows a consolation, domesticated kind of schizophrenia - which is completely missing the point. <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia mind structure, not a disease. Schizoid * nya * "normal person with the disease," is someone who from the outset looks and feels things differently from most people: for him such things as time, space and people's faces are not solid things. He feels that it can be bent, it can change, it can mutate and may even disappear. To cope with this, the schizophrenic has a rich, very creative inner world, "normal" people do not expect - but he is trapped, because it can not apply to most people, and the world is becoming poorer and poorer, until he has finished in empty, wrong deadlock. <br /> <br /> This is very different from what is shown in this ridiculous "treatment", tear-jerking movie. This should be strongly frightens. except the protagonist People must seem strange, surprising and inappropriate, as in Lynch "gum", for example. There must be a * really * spectacular, amazing, tough hallucinations, because that's what it's all about schizophrenia. It's not about the details * *. <br /> <br /> I mean, look, "Naked Lunch", "Lost Highway", read P.K. "The Martian Time-Split» Dick or "Ubik", the DO watch «The Cell», «Perfect Blue», «Dark City», or to play "Alice, American McGee in" on the PC, and you may have a vague idea, what it is, do not look, "feel good" movie of the month, with a banal situation, clear characters and visual effects, stunts and stupid story. "Cell" is the most accurate film about a schizophrenic mind, his vision and his inner consistency - this violence, strange, confusing, and very, very scared <br /> <br /> Another Schizophrenia is not just about. details, it is not pure, hand trick to play with you. He jumps in the face and not let you go: the walls are falling apart, people turn into amazing enemy creatures, you feel like you go back in time, you are not sure that you are who you think everyone feels. .. strange, unnatural. Believe me, it is much more than what is depicted in this soap-like melodrama
