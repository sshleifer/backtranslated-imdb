This movie sounds like it might be interesting and entertaining from its description. But it was a bit of a let down for me. Very slow and difficult to follow, and see what happens. It was as if the director took some film pieces and threw them in the air and they were intertwined with each other, whatever way they landed (not exactly in sequential order). In addition, none of any consequence are not removed. I saw quite a few different Korean films and noticed that a good part of a well-made and require some thought on the part of the viewer, which is different from the typical Hollywood film. But this one confused me to no end. I reviewed the film of the second and third time, and he still has not done anything for me. I still do not understand what the director is trying to convey. If it was just to show the typical secular part of a person's life, I think he did it. But I was looking for more. Needless to say, I can not recommend this film to anyone.
