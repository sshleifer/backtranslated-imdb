Jeff Lowell wrote and directed «Over Her Dead Body» bad. The idea is, first and foremost, as a stale, like my jokes and performing just icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Less Eva Longoria Parker is hardly something attractive in this film. Eva looks great as always and provides a nice performance. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd looks haggard and least interested. Lake Bell is a complete miscast. She looks courageous and provides a strictly average performance. Biggs is wasted, so Lindsay Sloane. <br /> <br /> I was expecting more from this fun film. Unfortunately, I did not have fun.
