Director, appointed in the chain and the skin, prevents the audience at the festival Frameline SF movie on Friday night that we were going to see "experiental" movie. Experimental? Leave your camcorder in the back seat of the car, let the roll of tape and edit all pointless dreck in vision. Stylization winding road show Manque, that begins and never takes the audience has no place. Gratuitous violence, opens the film traveled more than one cartridge from the Castro Theater. I would have gone, but my friend cameras have to go home and have this thing about seeing worse Merde through. By the time the lights came on the audience had thinned considerably. Tepid applause. Director of pro forma questions, which seemed to be satisfied with the product. Avoid this movie!
