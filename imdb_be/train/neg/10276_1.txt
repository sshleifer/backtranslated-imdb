Thus, you could read some of the comments posted on this film, and you might think of yourself: "Yes. There were sure a bunch of enthusiastic review posted on December 30," The funny thing is, most of these rave reviews sound like they come from the same person, or, at best, a small co-ordinated a group of fans of "open doors". the truth is, my friends, that this film really unwatchable. Just because "independent" does not mean he gets a free pass. If you're going to do a musical , whether on film or on the stage, whether on Broadway or at the local Playhouse society, you should probably make sure that (a.) your actors can sing, (b.) your actors can dance (a.) you have a decent sound equipment, (d.) you have a well-written account, and (e.) you have lyrics that are witty and charming. Even Anthony Rapp can not keep this. this is one of those unfortunate films of current events, where I actually felt deeply embarrassed for all participants.
