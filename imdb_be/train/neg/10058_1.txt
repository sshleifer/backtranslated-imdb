I was fascinated by how really bad this movie was. whether the viewer was supposed to learn something, or reflect on something here? What with pumpkins? I had to be impressed with the motel shots? Does it matter that there are some garbage bags on the roof across the street from the hotel? Why does the narrator fails to make fun of people he interviews (this is so obvious that it cut really informative part of the interview in order to achieve bullying). The best part of the film was an interview with the professor of the film, which tells us how bad this movie is even before its completion. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised. I believe that the creator is trying to become an intellectual or trying to make an impression on the intellectual community.
