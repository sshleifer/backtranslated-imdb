Do not waste money on this film. Do not even go into the car and I think that you could see this movie, if any others do not apply to you. If you need to see a movie this weekend, go see Batman again. <br /> <br /> The script was terrible. Excellent written on the format of the film random terror. Whereas: in confined spaces, crazy with various weapons, curious person who was able to uncover any evidence that employees are honest policemen can not be put together, and the innocent and overly curious, but a beautiful and strong woman with a lot of someone in the audience would be able to call his girlfriend. Stir, add a very poorly made of Gore, and what the hell, let's get some freaks out there for a little "spin" on the site <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible and unbelievable characters. - Borat was more believable than that. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** and can someone please tell me how to butcher vest can make a bullet ricocheted off a man after a shot, not even making the person who was shot start ?? ? I'm in the army. We need these things for themselves. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 and I would put it in a decimal that is rounded to give it the lowest rating I can.
