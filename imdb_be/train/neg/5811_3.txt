I have not seen this movie in age, but figured I would comment on it anyway, mainly because the memory of love for him so intently burned into my memory cells. The original Escape was no prize, to begin with, but at least had the distinction of being 1) Peckinpah film, 2) Recommended Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens, 3) was a relatively painless way to blow off an hour and a half time. <br /> <br /> In comparison with the version of the 1994 comes across as little more than a vanity piece for this red hot Alec Baldwin and his soon to be divorced wife Kim Besinzher. McQueen and his then wife Allie McBride also broke up soon after their version of the film was made and you can kind of imagine the Baldwins in the marriage counselor argue about who is stupid idea was it to make this film. <br /> <br /> Let's just say he is out of the way - Alec Baldwin has never been and never will be anything close to the Cooler King, and one of the reasons why this remake annoyed me because it is perceived arrogance from Baldwin to It allows the challenge to our memory of Steve McQueen in the title role. As someone points out Peckinpah in 1972 the film was a satire of the vision is for the sort of parody of action / adventure genre robbery. On the contrary, it seems, Baldwin, Bassinger and the company is trying to cause a more serious tone, just slimy characters unscrupulous villain Michael Madsen James Woods and looking like real people. <br /> <br /> The film is also strongly energetic middle and unsympathetic at a fundamental level, it is difficult to put into words. One view was more than enough, not only because he did not have anything new to offer, but because of how it was done innocently. Peckinpah film was actually stylish enough entertainment, there was elation, where this version is tedious, it takes too much time to make a little or nothing. There's no artistic urgency of the existence and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they are doing a film is difficult to use. <br /> <br /> So I do not know, this is probably one of the films that helped trigger a wave of senseless, artistically fresh big budget remakes then propped up around the brand name actor / actress, which in itself is not very good. I always prefer to see the director, at least try to come up with a new idea for a film and fall flat with something original. This movie just made me want to pull the eyebrows, and it is significant that for the next 15 years from the date of its release, Baldwin became widely known as one of the biggest jerks in Hollywood. Thank God for the "Team America" ​​for placing it on the spot. <br /> <br /> 3/10
