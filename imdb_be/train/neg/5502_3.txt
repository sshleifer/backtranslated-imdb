Silly, often funny romp featuring a spaceship landing, and as a result this leads to the ruin on Tim (Jeff Daniels) and a man in his orbit. <br /> <br /> Am always amazed Daniels. He showed such depth and promises in 1983 "Terms of EndearmentÂ», as the son-in-law flirting Shirley MacLaine in. Like last year, Daniels was not able to get their hands on a good, meaty roles. Instead, he is mindless comedies such as "Dumb and Dumber." <br /> <br /> With regard to this, it is not because of the subject matter. At the very least, a TV show led to different situations. In the film, we have a constant farce and people turns into a monster, the government thwarted in the capture of Mars-Martin. <br /> <br /> As part of Mrs. Brown is a perfect example of the failure of the film. On television, Pamela Britton reflected ditsy individual caught in the situation of the Martian leaving her puzzled. In the film, blonde bomb-shell like Brown tries a romantic entanglement. <br /> <br /> The television star Ray Walston has a small role as an agent of the government, or whether it really that? <br /> <br /> a very big disappointment for those that enjoyed the TV show so much.
