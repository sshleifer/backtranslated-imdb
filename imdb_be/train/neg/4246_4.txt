Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, who dies a Jewish mother who claims her devoted son (Ron Silver), to find the hermit single movie star Greta Garbo and enter two before Estelle checks forever. Maybe under the name "Bancroft negotiations", as an actress storms this indefinite comedy / drama / sentimental material for its duration. Hot or cold film director Sidney Lumet can not get a consistent rhythm going, and the constant replays Bancroft did not turn quite filmmaker - he holds it right up front: cute, watery eyes and speech. Estelle becomes a hindrance to this scenario (not that subtly thoughtful story much going on besides). Silver and co-star Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks will end up with very little to do, but to support the star, and it all trampled Hamming. * 1/2 ****
