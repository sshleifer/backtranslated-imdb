Which is a waste of time. The film begins as a series saw a clone, but with even worse acting. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely horrible. The ending of the story funny and contains no turbulence, no plot surprises and just plain bad end. I liked some of the characters, and I was hoping for everything to be connected with each other at the end. It just does not happen. This is a total of "The Wrestler" ends with either a good acting. I can not believe that I had a great time watching it. This is not a "fun", as some people put it. Man in the mask kidnaps people who are connected and causes them to figure it out. Connect over, and he had to shoot the main actress in the first place.
