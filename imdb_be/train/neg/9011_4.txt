Pretty standard B-movie material. Seriously, who are watching «Dragon Fighter» with Dean Cain and a lot of people who make their first film should have known better than to wait for the actual quality or even a weak intellect. In the movie, there is a re-working formulas that are popular. If you give them even a symbolic analysis, you wind up ruining the movie for yourself (and possibly writing some self-esteem, libelous opinions on IMDb). <br /> <br /> I love the female lead, Christine Byers. She has charisma, and I thought it was particularly attractive. It was an unforgettable view of B-movie. Unfortunately, I do not see where it has made any films since. I will follow her again.
