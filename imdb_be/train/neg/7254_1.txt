Who ever wrote two or three glowing reviews were either involved in the making of this film, the term is used in the broadest sense, or bank-rolled, and if the latter is the case, I would like to have seven dollars back! Actors, again, the term is used in a broad sense, it's terrible, actually almost none of them did not do anything ever again, which is a relief. The scenery and all this yelling, we had $ 7 to work and day to do it. Was it filmed in some backyard? Everything about this project, says low budget. Actors at best were a list of D. Do not waste your time, of course, if you do not want to take it back and try to get the rent back. Lead bad guy looks like a punk to 70s show that eventually married his grandmother dummee Moore. My local Blockbuster video store lists it as the film most returned with a sad commentary attached. Even in rent for 99 cents this film collects dust. Someone really should be obliged some affection. It's a super-bitch, and I give him a 10 excrement.
