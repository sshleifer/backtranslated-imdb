Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) becomes a living in nanny for a young Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole), who recently lost his mother. But Rosalie misses her late mother a lot and constantly visits her grave (which is located in the cemetery directly behind the house), late night ... where she also met her "friendsÂ» ... <br /> <br /> It starts off with a really good terrible sequence in the cemetery ... and then collapses. History is thin and there are tons of add-ons to make a movie length of 85 minutes. Actions terrible over the side (from Cole easily be worse). Badly directed with some of the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie. Scene (and sound) simply cut entirely rhyme or reason. In addition, the film has a terrible (and obvious) post-production sound <br /> <br /> As for the blood and violence. - forget it! There are very few, and there looks incredibly fake. I've never seen this kind of fake blood - it looks like ketchup! Boring, pointless - it is rightly forgotten disk in a movie. You can skip this.
