I was always curious about this movie, because it's so hard to find, so when I came across it on Ebay, I forked over $ 10 and bought it, now I understand why it is so rare! This film is so bad, so terribly written and hopelessly low budget, the ending credits, which show all the deleted scenes, where they muttered their lines, literally the highlight of the film. The film is about the mental (Pettyjohn, cast for one obvious reason, her topless scene), which uses its powers to an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension in this reality. If she pulls into a kind of box, as the object of military carelessly throws it into the open truck bed with one of the soldiers to keep him, and gee, what do you know? Surprise! Child in foam rubber monster suit pops up, instantly killing the soldiers with a zero in the face, and then runs off to the next town. But instead of deploying half of the armed forces of the county, to find it and protect the population of those who are responsible to just leave it up to Pettyjohn and Ray to find his own, but no matter what the film to bear all his authority long before that. It barely escaped to Vote 1 me just because of unintentional laughter, someone has to warn the producers Â«Mystery Science Theater 3000" if they do not know about it already! 2 of 10, in fact, very bad!
