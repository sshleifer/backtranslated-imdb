Unlike others, I refuse to call it a miserable excuse for a movie triumph of style over substance (I do not want to give a bad name style). Nevertheless, it is the most convenient description that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> pointless, unpleasant and eventually the senseless attack on the eyes and ears, «Wonderland» leaves only one wondering why the film was made in the first place, and who in their right mind gave the green light to this gloomy and confused mess. Biography of porn star John Holmes? Learning who was a man, why he went into the business and how it affected him? Excellent. Linked to be convincing, sure to be interesting. Bound to be instructive and entertaining for about a million levels (and I have zero interest in porn). <br /> <br /> But confusing, violent, Rashomon style research Holmes series of murders has been associated with after his career is over? Who the hell cares? What conclusions we win? This movie completely ignores the most interesting aspect of the life of John Holmes, - that he was a porn star! «Wonderland», may also have been of anyone: the fact that the protagonist is the most famous male star of adult films in history is almost irrelevant <br /> <br /> To make things a thousand times worse picture. loaded down with jerkoff tricks - annoying editing machine gun, unkempt Dogme-95 filming, drawing unnecessary split screen and animation, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> In the absence of compelling stories and unique protagonist, the director (and I use the term loosely) threw together a dozen coming from other movies and decided to call the resulting mess movie, among them: fashion, bleach bypass type of «Narc "or" the Traffic "or" Minority Report "; feverish, often incomprehensible, throw-the-part-of-film-to-air sharp style «Natural Born Killers» or "28 Days Later"; Fill each of the moment of silence-an-out-the old song to wake up-to-period soundtrack of «Goodfellas» or «Blow»; The groovy, retro title sequence of "Velvet Goldmine" and "Auto Focus" or «Catch Me If You Can». The list goes on and on and on. Lamentable. <br /> <br /> I wanted to love this movie. I had real hopes for him. «Wonderland Avenue" has been around for many years; that in the context of the killings, it was stressed, not the murder, I think it would work. If the murder (and growing participation Holmes seedy types memos) marked the end of a career, or at the end of shimmering 70's, I think the film could have meaning; he could serve the purpose. How is it - is meaningless. Meaningless. Who cares how many perspectives exist on a series of murders generally unknown to the public? It is not enough known to merit such a painstaking examination. <br /> <br /> This film was supposed to be the third act «The John Holmes Story.» That's all. Period. And it would have worked. What is it? Ah, yes, just that they do not want to tell the traditional story of the rise and fall. They do not want to "Boogie Nights" and "Goodfellas" or "Star 80" or "Auto Focus." They wanted their movie will be different. Right? <br /> <br /> Well, in a sense, they succeeded. There's a big difference between these films and «Wonderland». The difference is that these films are good. <br /> <br />
