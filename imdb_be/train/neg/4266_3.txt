NOMAD course has some of the best equestrian scenes, fencing and landscape cinematography delicious you'll probably see, but this is not what makes a good movie. It helps, but the story has to shine on top of these things. And that's where the Nomad wanders. <br /> <br /> The history of unnatural, giving him the feeling that he was thrown together just to make a "cool" film that "looks" great. Not to mention the fact that many of the main characters are not from the region in which the story takes place (and this is quite obvious, with names such as Lee and Hernandez). If filmmakers want to monopolize our culture, both in Jugars and Kazakhs, they damn well better use of the actor / actress that looks the part. <br /> <br /> The warring tribes of prophecy, brotherly love and respect, love interest, who shares our "hero", all affected, but with such a small amount of exposure and the time of the screen, most of the audience will brush off them in favor of the following order of battle, the next action of the horse scene, or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that some significant changes to its Nomad during filming, in particular, the director and cinematographer. Ivan Passer (Director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov and Ueli Steiger (cinematographer) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In one respect, Laustsno seems better eye, as his vision of the land made the final option that we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, going to the Bodrov as the Director may not be a wise choice. From what I can see here, the focus is on the battles and not the people that I feel comes from the eye Bodrov and Passer years. The real travesty. <br /> <br /> The most shameful aspect is that it could have been really fantastic film, both the nature and focus of action. Unfortunately, the tops, apparently decided it was what was needed, and that the action taken cheap (intellectually speaking) way. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that I can not give this film a positive assessment, it should look just for the amazing work of cinematography. But that's all.
