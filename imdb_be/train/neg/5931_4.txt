This film was only 10 minutes. I mean really only have 10 minutes worth watchable content in these things (I'm even embarrassed to call this movie). The opening credits of the film somehow promising. As the film begins with a brief commentary of the person you really rub your hands and watch footage from the life of Cohen. Well, Nick Cave does a reasonable job, which covers one of the famous songs of Cohen. The length of the performance of Cave makes you even more eager to see Cohen, whose mind and well-spoken words have tickled your fancy. But, as it turns out, the performance of Cave's just the beginning of a super long boring speeches literally pile than those who do not have even a minimal attraction to keep you on their site. I mean what does the director really thinks? five minutes a large boom plan want to be singers fake concert in Australia !!! That the director really think to insult the audience by adding the "fake" these endless applause nasty ideas. The film is a great torture, which shows very little of what you came to see. There is not a single frame from the past Cohen. In fact, within a few photos of the early days as a singer / poet except for absolutely nothing! If you add up all that minutes Cohen says that he can not even reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are represented by bit tortuously between catastrophic camcorder work that captures some of the most unattractive people screaming texts Cohen songs. If you ever decide to spend money on this film, do not! just throw it in the trash, and at least save you time.
