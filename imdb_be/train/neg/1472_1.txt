I am quite shocked to see that the average rating for this movie 5.2 / 10 Because, for me, this is definitely one of the worst films I have ever seen, and I still keep wondering why I did not see it until the end. First of all, the plot is completely hopeless, and acting really weird. I think that any completely unknown actress would have been better for this role than Lucci; Reyes regarding Mr. Camara del, I think it would be the best choice for him to stay in his "Valley of the Dolls." To sum up, a total waste of time (and I'm trying to stay polite ...) to avoid at all costs. My rating of 1, and I still think it's good pay, but because we can not give O ....
