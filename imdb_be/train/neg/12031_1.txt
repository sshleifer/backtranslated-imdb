First of all, this film is not a comedy; if you really do not push yourself you can hardly laugh. Secondly, the film is slow and tedious. Acting is not bad, but not special. There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with the big ears) is fighting with each other in a small town ... you'll laugh a lot more, if you're reading this, instead of wasting your time with this film. Religion and dogma is not the best source to make a good comedy and the film does nothing more than confirm the rule. There is a similar object of comedy "," home teachers " '; it had some good moments. My last comment: do not waste your time and money to see this uninspired and sad movie.
