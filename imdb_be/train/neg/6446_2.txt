Western society has nourished the idea, India is a poor country. Movies, how to do it, only those beliefs stronger. Such illustrations make it more difficult for the Indians to be taken abroad. Agreed there are poor and homeless people in India, but why there is no idea of ​​educated people, if not the successful ones. <br /> <br /> I totally hated the idea of ​​the film, which shows Patrick Swayze another Mother Teresa. In my opinion, this film shows India in a very bad light, giving misconceptions. It is unfair to say only one aspect of society. It is for this reason that people ask me: "If we go to India, we can hire an elephant right next to the airport, so we should not go on the roads, so full of mud and snakes?» <br /> <br /> Those who want a second opinion about the modern Indian society should watch "Monsoon Wedding."
