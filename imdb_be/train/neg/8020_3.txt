I had some beautiful bits of poetry, but it is really just a pretentious-Fartsy draw with no direction or permission. these people get through the film school? who gives them the money to do this shit? could be much more fine lead actor, and I always like Fairuza Balk, but come on, alt-rock metaphor just looked away could not find anything convincing just so tired, and he is sure that does not make for a good movie. director should go and live for a long time and did not go back to the camera, as long as they do not really have to say something. it's how to throw spaghetti-on-the-wall school art solutions simply oppose bunch thorough imagery and hope hope hope like hell that poetry comes out. it can work when the director does have some vision, has a brain that knows when he's in the presence of potential, but here it's just a space filler, does not matter. I felt lazy ending closest moments before it hit, and shouted "you lazy freak" on the screen when loans jumped.
