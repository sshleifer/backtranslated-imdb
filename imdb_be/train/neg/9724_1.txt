Poor Toba Hopper. He constantly directed horror classic "Texas Chaimsaw massacre". Since then, all he did was terrible. This is probably the worst ... and that says a lot. We are talking about a man (Dourif), which has the ability to do things (and people) come on ... or something like that. Hardly an original idea (anyone remember «Firestarter»?) It's a real mess ... literally everything wrong! Pathetic action (even Dourif!), Donkey scenario, loust production values, bad special effects ... everything is bad !!!!! A must miss ... not even good for a laugh.
