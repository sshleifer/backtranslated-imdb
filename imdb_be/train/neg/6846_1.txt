I'm a big fan of Karishma Kapoor and Govinda. I watched this movie since I saw Fiza, who was Absolutley brilliant. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are bad, and there are movies that cr * p. but this film just takes the biscuit. <br /> <br /> We were so annoyed that we cheated to pay our money is waiting for a decent movie. <br /> <br /> avoid at all costs, do not even rent it. <br /> <br /> 1/10
