I am a Dallas / Fort Worth and lived in Arlington for a few years. This film was far as it makes it look like Arlington. I saw the mountains in the background of one scene! Texas has no mountains. I suppose what happens when a film to be shot in Texas in Canada. Emphasis is also very bad. They had to get the actor from Texas to play the role. There are many aspiring actors from Texas to Hollywood. The film is really boring, though, because it's a true story. I pray that the killer is found and convicted. One good thing that bc of her death, we now have amber announcement to help find a missing child quickly after they are stolen.
