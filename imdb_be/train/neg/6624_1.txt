This film was absolutely ... ugh I can not find words to wait ... crap! I mean, when it started, I was like yeah it looks good, and then after it was so boring. I almost fell asleep, and it has nothing to do with the fact that I caught a late show, because it was full of crap. Ram Gopal Varma tried his best, but the throw could not live up to the warehouse of the original Sholay, I mean what he thinks to do a remake. What was he trying to do? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the awards next year, as he did for Black? Ajay and the other guy was good, especially the other guy, who played Raj because of all of them he was the one to see. What is Amitabh doing? He destroys his own dignity, making all these stupid movies. First Nishabd then Cheeni Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now this I mean HPP should raise some money and move as far away from Bollywood, as far as possible, before he loses all his compliments, and I tell you that he has already passed half of the way, I mean it's all very well for other actors like Shah Rukh Khan, who gets a really good name now because of the recent decline in Amitabh. I never liked him, because he thinks he's God, and I just knew that Abhishek is going to be in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to keep your Â£ 17.75 and spend it on something good coming Heyy Babyy watch because it's just the funniest movie ever, and it is number one in the charts!
