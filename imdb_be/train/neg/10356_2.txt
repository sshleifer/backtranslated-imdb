(This may be a bit on the side spoilerish) I would like to start by saying that I did not watch the entire movie, I could not, because it was seen from the first hour that I was going to be extremely disappointed. This, of course, a problem with accepting that many people believe that amazing book, and turn it into a Disney film made for television. <br /> <br /> A Wrinkle in time must be done in a strange film for a long time. He's got a great storyline that can engage the child and adult. In addition, he received a built-in quality sequels. But the Disney-fication was not through. The problem of the film is that all the things that they have changed, to make it into a visual story dumbed down, that was so great about the book. This is a complex and emotional story for children. There was no reason to make a Charles Wallace purely "psychological" because it was the easiest way to explain it. There have been no reason to write a fight between as an additional tension in the three Mrs. the W, there is enough tension in this story, and without it. There was no reason to remove the glasses Meg ... that deprived us of what could have been a very sweet scene between Meg and Calvin, what happens in the book. <br /> <br /> I could find fault with in a few days about the little things, but I also think that the larger things, like art direction was possible. Take, for example, as they did Camazotz look, with his strange dark sky. Horror that comes in the book is that it can be Camazotz Earth. It looks like the earth. It is the people on it that look like humans. The sky is blue, grass is green, and the children play. But there was something a little off. Director decided to make full Camazotz other instead of to take a lesson in the book, and apply it to the general direction of the film. The lesson, of course, that Camazotz may well be the earth, that is, if we forget how to love. It would be much more terrible to have a nice afternoon, as they go down the street with the children bouncing balls in the same rhythm. <br /> <br /> I, unfortunately, I did not watch the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney has spoiled the end as well. <br /> <br /> In general, an artistic disappointment. <br /> <br />
