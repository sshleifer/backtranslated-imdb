I had a very hard time making it through this step. It was extermly slowly and sometimes wondering when the plot of the film will actually come to life. <br /> <br /> This film seemed to flow to slow down and I kept wondering when it will end. I'm usually a person who loves a good indie file every once in a while, but it did not suit what I was looking for. <br /> <br /> It seemed that they were trying to do to much from this movie. At one point it seemed to turn political, which I'm not a big fan in the movie. If you are looking for a low-speed film with virtually no plot, then this is the right movie for you. As for me, I felt like I spent 2 hours when I could do something else.
