This film was just awful, the first film was not so great, I mean, it's funny stupid if they did not have enough of the first 5 films you had to add one more, why not just do it in the current series, James bond, I'll tell you why, because movies bonds is actually very good and the movies just stink, I do not understand, it is to be hybrids to genres like horror and comedy for the good use of my 1 year old niece Sun be afraid of such ridiculous attempts at horror, spit in the face of people of Maine howling least want to be scared at some point in the so-called horror film. Please, no more of these films.
