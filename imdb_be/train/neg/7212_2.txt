Why every horror film director wants to imitate "The Exorcist," a complete mystery to me as the "classic" William Friedkin very overrated film and, in my opinion, not all that stressful or shocking. And yet here is another pure plagiarism, the Spanish one, this time, that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl who gets to give pure evil and turns against her own family. Our Paul (which I must admit, it looks pretty hot) plays an honorary priest who gets approached by John Gibson, because the behavior of his sister Leila has changed dramatically since she met her new boyfriend. First, the priest does not believe in it, but when John's body is shown with his neck twisted, demonic behavior Leila becomes more pronounced ... "Exorcism" is not only a very unoriginal, it is also intolerably boring film! Here Naschy and directed by Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to religiously themed exploitation film full of shocks and baked with blood, and the same result is a manual and common bloodless AMD, which will be almost put you to sleep! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, though very stupid, and there are quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and immorality. The absolute lack of budget has no real justification, as Paul Naschy has proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for lack of money. It's just a terrible film, end of story. Another European «The Excorcist» rip-off "Antichrist" and "the door" and they suck, as well!
