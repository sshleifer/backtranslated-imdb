Come on, guys, some preliminary reviewers almost wrote a novel, commenting on this episode. It's just an old 60-TV show! This Star Trek episode is different because of the very serious low (YEOMAN Barrow) have ever used on Star Trek, and the fact that it was filmed in real open space. Unlike PNPA and Voyager series, which were completely confined to the pavilions. <br /> <br /> This is the use of outdoor seating (and a baby) gives the correct depth and almost film-like quality on a fairly regular episode of this now from and are very familiar with the show. <br /> <br /> except for a few notable exceptions, ie "The City on the Edge of Forever", "assignment of the land" and "Tomorrow is Yesterday" old series Star Trek must be seriously moth -balled and deduce from it sad misery. Half a dozen good episodes of 79 pretty bad batting average. <br /> <br /> This is typical boring stuff Gene Roddenberry produced when in fact, contrary to popular belief, when some people worshiped the ground he walked on, he actually made a lot of rubbish! He does not deserve to be spoken in the same breath as Irwin Allen, for example. <br /> <br /> Just look at the set of the bridge company with a modern point of view. They used a rickety plywood floor, cafeteria chair with plastic backs and cheap cardboard over the dashboard. You can clearly see the folds in the paper! Each account are or what!
