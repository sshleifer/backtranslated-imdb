When I saw the preview for this on TV, I thought, "well, it was going to be a good werewolf film", but it was not. It was not scary at all! The acting was good, the plot was terrible, the military rate was just stupid. I think that the SCI-FI Channel could do better than that piece of shit. The film made it sound like Arron is going to turn into a werewolf, but instead he turned crazy and bite the throat of a doctor with. If you've read some of my reviews on other films, everything is positive, but this time not just because the story was terrible. One of 10 max. I'm sure you've all been waiting a werewolf film, but I'm sure you did not expect. Beyond Loch Nes was much better than this movie, heck, any movie, it will be on the sci-fi channel is better than the movie.
