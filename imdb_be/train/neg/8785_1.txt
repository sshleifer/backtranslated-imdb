I often comment on the full dirth really scary movies in the market, and unfortunately the white noise only served to lessen my belief that the film industry is capable of such an effort. I was surprised to find themselves more tired grow as the story dragged on and my static headache caused increases. I found white noise to be inappropriate for our efforts suspension of disbelief. Even after witnessing the harrowing trials suffered by Michael Keaton, I was completely dependent on his death. By carefully titles I was waiting for something - anything-- substance to connect me with the history of the characters, but such help did not come. Of course, there were occasional moments of heart stopper, but only because the loud noises tend to make it up to the viewer's dormant. <br /> <br /> While acting lame, Michael Keaton, may have played a role studliest today. Perhaps the only redemptive quality that White Noise can offer terrible archietecture in both villages Keaton. Overall, White Noise leaves one of the pathological burdened with the thought that those who die are trapped in the world under the protection of three malicious shadows, managing to deceive lives next dead their tombs.
