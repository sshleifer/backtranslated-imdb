Quote: theurgist: Anyone with an IQ over 50 would see this movie, it's such a smart well-acted prequel to the modern classics, but it does not throw a blockbuster or a huge budget, but it is still very well done, and I I hooked over the entire period. <br /> <br /> IQ- over 50 you say .. that most means you have IQ below 50 .. his name is Carlitos Way: Rise to Power !!! this means that there must be a modicum of the first to do .. <br /> <br /> All and all his film OK, if you change the name .. And there is no symbol name Carlito Brigantia !!! <br /> <br /> Ps not comment on the movie, if you know anything about the films do not. but I believe that the intelligence quotient to 50 years ,, you do not know what the hell, I yell ... <br /> <br /> Peace out !!
