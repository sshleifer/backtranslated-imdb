Well, what can you say about the comedy. There's often pretty lame, morale dedicative and simple. So this show! He received the sad cast, although A.Bynes will be okay in her perky way, the rest is just the stereotypical crap .... as always. We've all seen it before, and will probably see it all over again if the show is canceled. Cause let's face it, it mediocre and samoopravdatsya show. Like most sitcoms have .... <br /> <br /> Well, in short. If you want to see some good entertainment, you can probably take twenty minutes to pause before a mirror. There are some faces and move on .... His more interesting than the show!
