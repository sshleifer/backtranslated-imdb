A pale shadow of the great musical, this film suffers from the fact that the director, Richard Attenborough, completely misses the point of the musical, without the need to "open" it, and spoil the play direction. A show about a group of dancers to audition for the musical work in B'way and see them drive & want to work in this complex and not-always-rewarding line of work. Attenborough gives us blush throwing applicants, provided that they are trying to get their "big break" in show business, rather than presenting grittier combination of characters created on the stage as a group of workers, "Gypsies" live show to show, along with several newcomers. The film has one advantage over the game, and this opening scene showing a size and starting listening true shrinkage scale up to 16/17 on the line (depending on how you think Cassie which store bluntly in line in the film). Anyone who can catch the local production of civil operetta performance will have a much richer experience than seeing this ill-conceived film.
