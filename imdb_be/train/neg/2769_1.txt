This film is a timely warning to those who think that they can both write and direct his own film. Face it, you can not. Because the way there is no one around to tell you if you crack a big hole in your site is meaningless transitions, vulgar, unmemorable dialogue and manage to make a pretty cool Korean legend in a steaming pile of celluloid turd. <br /> <br /> I wanted to love this movie as a cheesy popcorn movie, in fact I did; I like a lot of bad paintings. But once I had to ask myself, what the hell just happened and why, Lord, why? more than a few times, I really can not do this anymore. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would like for someone to explain how LA has become Mordor for the last scene.
