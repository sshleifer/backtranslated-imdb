One would have thought that a film about a young man coming to terms with his homosexuality prosperous it would be anything but boring. Think again. This product must be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia because it is about ten times as powerful as any sleeping pills on the market. It's almost as if the filmmaker * considered * making movies, but got lazy and decided instead to launch a series of random (and accidentally boring) images and go-anywhere scene, throw in a couple of real-world scenes, which show the actual act, pretend that ins't good lighting is important in the process of filmmaking, and to wrap under the auspices of the film "arthouse". This is precisely the dirty kind of product that makes it easy for many traditional film-makers to poo-poo the indie film movement, and which keeps the general public from more easily covers indie films. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the movie, which covers the subject, you would be much better options on some of the great short film available on the site logo or rent Get Real. Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip the long-winded piece of dreck.
