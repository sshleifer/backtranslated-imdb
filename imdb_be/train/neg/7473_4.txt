My husband and I were intrigued by the spectacle - a strong-willed Southern lady with messy personal life solves crimes for the Los Angeles Police Department. The first season must-see TV for us. Unfortunately, stories about her personal life, in the second season has become so tedious and unworthy of strong character that we stopped looking. <br /> <br /> My husband and I have been concerned about the scene where she tries to hide from her mother that she was shaken up. But the deal breaker was the episode where she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend, but he says his boss. Why strong, middle-aged woman to do these things? The answer is it will not. Also, my husband and I choose a bad guy with almost perfect accuracy. This is almost always a white man or a woman put in a cameo appearance on the scene of the murder, or in an idealized family. writers can not do something original from time to time? As I said before, we no longer are viewers. We prefer to show that the characters do not change, and insult our intelligence.
