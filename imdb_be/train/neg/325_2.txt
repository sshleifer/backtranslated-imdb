Having decided some time ago to collect movies, Billy Bob Thornton (strength class movies like "Sling Blade A", "A Simple Plan" and "The Man Who Was not There," among others), it was inevitable that there will be the odd turkey there. What I did not realize, however, that there may be one that's bad. I will give you an idea of ​​how incredibly poor in the film - the funniest dialogue it sounds like this: "Who is there» «Knock Knock», «Big smelly man," "? Big smelly man who "," big smelly man - it's you! ". Yes folks, it's really that bad. Billy Bob just in it for about two minutes (I guess he needed a job at this time in his career), and the rest of the film is painful. For some reason, though, despite the fact that it is, of course, terrible, I do not hate him. It's probably because I keep the anger for all the high-budget, special effects laden junk like "Fast and Furious", instead of "no budget" Flicka, like this one. 2/10 at a push.
