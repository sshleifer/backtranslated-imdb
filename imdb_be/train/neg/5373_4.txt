This is a classic example of a growing problem with the films. Why is the background noise and the soundtrack is much louder than the dialogue? What is the meaning, what to do? This film is not one. Most films seem to be doing it now. Within 2 years, I thought it was something wrong with my TV, but then I got a new TV and there again. Previous level of noise that may occur city block behind the actors drowns out dialogue. <br /> <br /> This is even more distracting in this film, because, in the English version, in any case, the woman murmurs constantly. I kept hoping that Jean Reno will say "I'm sorry, you have to talk or get the balls out of your mouth." If you look at the DVD and you have even a high school French, I recommend the French version with subtitles. <br /> <br /> I put 4, because Renault has been so good to Leon. People rave about the scenery, but I saw it on TV and I lived in the Rocky Mountains for a few years, so that «Enh».
