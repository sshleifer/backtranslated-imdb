Without a doubt, this is one of the worst films I have ever wasted money on! The plot is, uh sorry, I said there was a plot? Scary moment was when ... nope can not think about something else! The best special effect that I was hiding under the covers ... nope can not think of one for that too. You knew who the killer was right from the beginning. There was nothing wrong the entire film, in fact, only two clear interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister, Misty, in the shower, and if you see Nurse Toppan take her top. This film should look only to get an idea of ​​how NOT to do a horror film !!!
