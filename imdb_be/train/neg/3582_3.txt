No, it's not a horror movie ... This one is really a love story. <br /> <br /> Ring silent film in 1927 that stars the two boxers and the woman who comes between them. She loves the boxer known as «One Round» Jack. She loves him, while the champion does not come, that is. Despite the fact that she is getting married in one round, it begins openly flirting with the champion before the climax of the final boxing bout between one round and a champion. She returned in one corner of the round, only if things look grim them, and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the battle and win his wife in return. <br /> <br /> This film was very early in his career, and a hitch, but in the time limit should not be, his deep film. Although there is a special film techniques, and some comedy relief, the film simply does not hold up to any of its future work. Should be very risky for a period of time, though, with the shameless adultery wives. This can be a draw back in 1927. While looking through all those old movies, it's amazing, I think they could be converted at the current screen and really come off. Maybe I should be the one .... <br /> <br /> Ignore this movie if you do not want to watch all the films of Hitchcock. You can sleep in the middle.
