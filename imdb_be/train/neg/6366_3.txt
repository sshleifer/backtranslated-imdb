It was not one redeeming factor in this film. A friend and I both love the militants. Especially the fight scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer was strange), but this movie was not interesting. Five minutes of action followed by twenty minutes and "angry" facial expressions. The protagonist is a caring character who saw the fight, and thus forced to look seriously constipation at all times. Army violated their feces on the top improving its military equipment. The music is not very good. They are struggling with the rap and hip-hop style of the street, because these guys are thugs. The rest of the normal track background noise for low budget AMD. <br /> <br /> Everything about this film is a classic B-style. The actors deliver their line as if reading their cues from the cards and lines themselves should be set on fire and left to burn in some rotten Hollywood Walk. The film is called "Honor", but there was no honor in making this film. It was just a waste of money and spend wisely what I consider an honor. <br /> <br /> One can see the criminal instead. The fight scene and the situation more real.
