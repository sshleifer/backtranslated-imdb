Take the young, beautiful people, put them in exotic places, get stuck in some bad guys, there are two main characters find romance after several severe respiratory scenes to create a flimsy plot, and then work out a happy ending for everyone (except for three or four who get killed of course) This is a classic (and successfully) Harlequin Romance format. It is not very good, but then it's not too bad, as most of the small yellow pocket books. And the place of things in Budapest is particularly interesting, even if they did not use the beautiful old train station (designed by Gustave Eiffel), or show the famous thermal baths of the city.
