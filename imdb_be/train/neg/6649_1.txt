Well, anyone who could honestly say that this film was a great, or even good, or crazy, or know the director, writer and producer of and try to increase the buzz from the film. I watched the movie, because a friend of mine worked for him, and it was awful. I am an actress and worked in the industry for some time now on the big films and even independent and this movie I sad to tears. The reason why I have to be so hard, because this movie was obviously a different view of "Of Mice and Men," and they have to sue, because it is such a terrible history of plagiarism. In the region where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt ... for someone to take a classic book and film "Of Mice and Men" and destroy it with a new error back to me so much. Actors, pressure, dialogue and direction were amateurish and the handwriting was dull . I mean, if your going to take a new milestone in the history of the present, make sure it is as good or better than the original, to make a new round justified. I do not like this movie at all.
