I do not think it would be possible for Joe Don Baker, to make a movie as bad as it stinkbomb «Mitchell», but this one is a success. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it if you're a fan MUCH better working Joe Don Baker. But, if you love watching fat guys sweat a lot and really, really stretched gun battles, you'll love this movie.
