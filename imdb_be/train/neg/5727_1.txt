I just want to start by saying that this is the first review of the film I made in the network. I felt the need to warn people about this film, because it is really one of the worst films I have ever seen. After reading an interview with the director, he says that he respects constructive criticism, so I'm going to try to avoid bashing film just for the sake of it and offer their opinions as to why I found it to be so sorely afraid. <br /> <br /> 1. Actors. I know that the budget can not be allowed for large thespians, but Nicholson worked in the industry for over ten years, he certainly knew that some of the actors who were at least on average. <br /> <br /> 2. Incredibly lame makeup and special effects. Once again, the budget is clearly hampered by the fact that it was initially planned, but after working in make-up for many years, there is actually no excuse. <br /> <br /> 3. Obvious similarities with a hostel. Despite the fact that it was not a rip off it sure is trying to cash in on the success of the former films. Only problem is that Roth knew where he was going and how to get there ... <br /> <br /> 4. Music. Not really terrible or even compulsive sick just annoying. <br /> <br /> 5. The script as a whole. All dialogue was forced and terrible! Also to the south of stories about the theater and the guy who came to rescue them were weak, like almost like an afterthought. <br /> <br /> 6. Edit. WTF. As a concussion, and not in a good way. Nuf. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I would like to hear the thoughts in my post of director (he, no doubt, he is visited pages on the IMDb.) is a friend ... What were you thinking. Of course, at some point during or shooting or editing, you realize that turkey Yol had on hand ... Unfortunately, I do not want to be harsh, but you have to have more talent than I hope your next feature that gutterballs film or wahtever better, we hope that the practice of making progress. <br /> <br /> At the same time, avoid this like the plague. I want my 81 minutes back with interest. (At least, I did not pay to see it.)
