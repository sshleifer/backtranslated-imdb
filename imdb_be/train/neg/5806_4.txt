Nowhere near the original. This is a fairly exact copy without bringing anything new in this story. But the direction is very bad. Basinger weak - no good directing. Baldwin just only the second league compared with McQueen. I watched it just out of curiosity, as a huge fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I got what I thought. Almost B film at a second speed which is acting and the guide. I was not even disappointed, I just do not know what they are trying to do. This remake is not trying to play with the original material, this is not a tribute to and in fact it lacks some really good actor of his era. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a bad photocopy of beautiful photos. <, Br /> <br /> This is a waste of time. Save yourself 2 hours or see original (again :)))
