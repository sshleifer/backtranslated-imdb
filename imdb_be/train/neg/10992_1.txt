Underground Comedy Movie, perhaps the worst train wreck I've ever seen. Fortunately, I did not pay for this movie and my friend reluctantly agreed to see him again, the location, it was so horrible, but he had to prove to me how horrible it was. I love the color of the comedy. I realized, at least it would be that I would have a good time. No, instead, the action was so terrible that the "joke" was very cheesy, and the story was no where to be found. Maybe there was not to be the story, so I can not say that against this film. It's very sad, where the most ridiculous thing in comedy old woman with her head struck with a bat ..... Batman ... man wearing a baseball uniform, having a bat. Hilarious. Simply genius. I got the feeling while watching the film, its creators have done it and laughing hysterically with their friends about it. Perhaps it was full of inside jokes, we just did not understand. Or, perhaps, this is the worst piece of garbage ever done, and it must be closed in the safe and reset. <br /> <br /> postscript words Do not buy this movie!
