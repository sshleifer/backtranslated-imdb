I rarely like irritated leading performance, I was Ali McGraw in the film. God it annoying or what?! It says that everything in the same tone, and it's terrible, so terrible is that, on the contrary, Ryan O'Neal is brilliant. <br /> <br /> There is not a lot of history. It is rich, it is wooden, both of them have to sacrifice a lot for love. His father, Stonewall Jackson, it is called by name, in case you have not noticed the difference in the two of them, that they overcame in the name of love. <br /> <br /> Oscar nomination for this film show, it had to be a bad year. John Marley excellent as the father of a wooden, but the auxiliary extension? At least, Ali won. <br /> <br /> I still think Katharine Ross Jennifer should play, but then again, if it were up to me, Katharine Ross would have been in much more movies. It is certainly better than the actress McGraw. <br /> <br /> I did not even cry when she got sick, it never happened to me, even bored. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Tommy Lee Jones, looking like he was about 15, and score well. But this one is so old now, he has a beard a mile long, and sin, and that it was not that old, but it feels.
