I think most everyone wants to believe that there are extraordinary things, and this film does not show restraint when attempting to use to the full. The presentation is very interesting, well presented and the schedule of state of the art, but from a scientific point of view, this simply does not work. Hydrogen is filled with flying bubbles? They should be the size of a truck Mack, to be useful. And then there is the ever-present possibility of catastrophic explosion. I have no problems with imagination, just not trying to pass it as a fact. Some people will always be misunderstood. In general, the film is entertaining, but I always found myself say. "Oh, brother, that the load of ...." If you want a fake documentary to watch This Is Spinal Tap instead Or at least turn off the sound..
