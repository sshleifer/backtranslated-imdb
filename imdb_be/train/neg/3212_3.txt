I'm a big fan of the series of comics, but the movie fell far below my expectations. I expected that Heavy Metal 2000 Country feel to it ..... moves slowly, bad dialogue, a lot of "blood ..... but it was worse than I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> storyline is almost the same as the comics, but good points largely rest on our laurels. Symbols do not have the energy or spirit that attracted my attention in the comic book series. The film covers only a small part of the comic book, and uses a portion of sad and slower than the later part. The focus of the film on the small events instead of the more interesting the general plot of comics. <br /> <br /> With the right people are working on this project, it might be weird. Unfortunately, this is not the way, so now there is another terrible film that few people will see and even fewer will love. My copy probably gathering dust for many years, until I finally throw it.
