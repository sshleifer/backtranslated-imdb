Cut off trying to be like the majority of the post-crushing Creek I tried to be a parody of the horror genre, which is trying to be smart, referring to other well-known horror films. Now, I'm not packing, "Scream", I think that "The Scream" is a very good horror film, which does a great job of mixing horror and comedy. Cut will not work on most levels. It has its moments, but overall it just does not work, not even as a "so bad it's good" movie, just below average. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes or so to order and install the story is pretty good, except for the fact that Kylie Minogue can not really act, and ironically she gets her tongue, go figure it out. Go ahead and while the students of the film wants to finish his film rest, which seems cursed. And as you have probably predicted, one on one cast and crew slowly took off the mask of a madman. <br /> <br /> stereotyped plot, poor effect and predictable end of some of the elements that follow. There are many references in the film, all of the "Scream" to "Chain Texas Saw Massacre. It is not reasonable either, it feels as if the director wanted to feel smart and cool, mentioning other famous horror ala Scream. For slasher there is minimal gore and nudity, which is a huge negative when it comes to slasher, who has not received the whole lot going for it. In fact, I have to maintain this film, because I'm Australian, and we are not so good, when it comes to horror (we have our gems, though), but the Cut, baa conditionally, not one of them. <br /> <br /> However, it is to keep me watching the 90 minutes or so, so that something good, at least. I would not recommend it to anyone except by hardcore fans shredder which may be able to assess what the film is trying to take aim, but if you are looking for a good movie, stay away. <br /> <br /> 2/5
