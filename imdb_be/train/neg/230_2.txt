It was awful. Andy McDowell terrible actress. So it makes a wooden horse look like it can do a better job. But remember that the turn in four wedding, equally as painful. Another film that reflects Britain as a full chocolate box cottages and rural greenery. I mean that the school, how many schools, except perhaps Hogwarts look like? The whistle of the police station was like a set of Heartbeat (intolerable British series set in the 60s) .This movie just could not make his mind to what he wanted to be-a comedy or a serious study of underwater in the women's friendship. If he stuck to the former while the cemetery sex scene and a very stupid assault wedding may just be working (I am only). But these scenes just do not work with the tragedy in the second half. I also think it implausible that Kate ever talk to Molly again after her terrible behavior. NOTE that the final decent actress like Staunton does in this pile of crap? Not to mention the Anna Chancellor. McDowell wrinkles must follow advertising.
