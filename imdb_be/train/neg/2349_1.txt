It was a great film to do about Biko. Unfortunately, it was not so. Denzel Washington - never the most flexible of the actors - it is absolutely not able to pass most of the charisma that Biko was. large crowd scenes Attenborough ridiculous. The massacre of Soweto do not like, three neat lines of children (some do somersaults!) Marching happily rifles soldiers. With Biko dead movie quickly descends into farce. If the struggle against apartheid was anything, it was the struggle of black people still somehow we should all be covered by the escape of the white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man, and he would be the first to say that Biko was important while he was not. Penelope Wilton focus purely Hampshire, and she seems to be completely unaware that it is in South Africa, at all. at all. Wood family dog ​​gets more lines than black maid. As the family makes their escape one woman I saw the movie with - incidentally one of only about a dozen black men in a large, full movie - whispered, "It's like the sound of music." It was the point. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a film friendly, when some clumsy white liberal for the Suppression of radical black people. Indeed, South Africa needs well-meaning white liberal she needs a hole in the head.
