I was quite took, I saw this movie at the festival paving. The sidewalk was generally disappointing, and this film was the last nail in the coffin. Being a devout fan of Lewis Carroll's book "Alice" I was very excited about the premiere of this film, which just made it that much more uncomfortable to watch. Usually, I am delighted with today's transfer, if they are treated well. Usually, it's interesting to see the parallels between past and present in a familiar story. Unfortunately, this movie was a modern retelling of less and more pop culture perversion. Adaptation of the original characters, seemed juvenile and, as a rule, turns out terribly annoying. It probably did not help that the actors were not very good. Most of the performances were ridiculously over the top, which I believe was either due to a bad direction or efforts to compensate for the bad script. I did not laugh once through the duration of the film. All jokes are outdated references to current events is not so, who will surely lose their sharpness, as time goes by. Indeed, the only event of the film was the opening sequence, in which the white rabbit is on its way to meet Alice, but even then the evaluation was a bad imitation of the work of Danny Elfman in. Also, I have to say that the transformation of the croquet game in rave dance-off was awful. It was because of doubt, the lowest point of the film. <br /> <br /> What a joke. Nha see this movie. After his imprisonment, I was really angry.
