A typical Troma-thrash this grimy 80-Flick is considered one of the "highlights" of the notorious production studio Lloyd Kaufman, along with «The Toxic Avenger», released a year earlier. "The Toxic Avenger" is much higher if you ask me, but it's crazy splatter-flick, yet tolerant, and; just make sure you leave your full potential of the brain at the door. Events taking place in Tromaville, a small town, which proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world, and they certainly do not lie. Precautions at the local nuclear power plant substandard to say the least (even Homer Simpson has never been this easy-going) and toxic waste seeping into the nearest school. The first victim was drunk stereotypical nerd who starts kicking green material of all his body cavities, but his death was considered an accident, because he did not have at least two microwave ovens in their home! Oh, the humanity! Shortly thereafter, however, the nuclear leakage is also influenced by the school plantation weeds and things really start to get confused. After smoking a joint at a party, a cute couple at school produces a giant worm monster that dwells in the basement and feeds the teenage scale. "Class of Nuke« Em High "is at the bottom of the barrel of a horror film-making, with the dialogue so dumb they hurt the ears and make-up effects that give a whole new meaning of the word tasteless. If you love to watch the face melted, crush or splitting in two times, it is definitely a must-see! In contrast to the above-mentioned «The Toxic Avenger», the film suffers from a couple of very dull and long moments, when in fact nothing significant happens, like when Chris and Warren are trying to find out what happened to their hormones. Crude humor are not as effective as in «Toxic Avenger» and effective performance unforgivable amateurish. Continue only if you are an avid Troma-fanatic.
