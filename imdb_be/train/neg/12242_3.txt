I was expecting a bad movie, it is a bad film. But I could not imagine in a terrible fantasy of how bad this movie was. I do not even want to try to explain what a Blood Surf. Not the blood of surfing, but the big $$ in crocodile. They complain about the fake shark in Jaws, but Spielberg was wise and did not show the shark until the end. Here crocodile shown many times, and this is the worst fake crocodile I've ever seen, and they are not trying to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile watch Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> Director had the opportunity to make a decent surfing / shark movie, but he had to make a bad B-movie monster. He was able to make an original surf film, but he wanted to make a movie monster. So you need to understand how bad this film, he has some good parts? In fact, he received some nudity and sex scenes, which is taken directly from the movie playboy. Act is not half bad, and Kate Fisher looks good. It is a pity that it does not accept its top. The leading actors are not bad. They had some potential. The place was nice and a good start with some good surf scene of the film. The blame is on the untalented writer and director. Conversation some of the worst I have ever seen, and the script is really poorly written, and directed not got no talent what so ever, and not so much fantasy, too. <br /> <br /> Do not look it. Even if you want to see the beautiful Kate Fisher. It's not worth it. View Sirens Watch nude Kate, and watch Lake Placid, if you want some good action crocodile. <br /> <br /> 3/10, because I'm in a good mood, and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked, and Kate looks good (but it's a bad actress) and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borleni did a good job with a piece of sh # t they had to work.
