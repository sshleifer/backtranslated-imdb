movie sucked, it was not funny, it was not interesting. They tried to do it so badly that it would be good, but it did not. and think it's cool to like this film, next to the hype, the only reason that this film is a success ... <br /> <br /> the fact that currently 50% voted 10 out of 10 for this film seems rather it is concerning me or the film publicity going crazy or unrealistic it is the voice that can have many causes, and should be considered. in any case it is less than the average movie which has blossomed through the mouth advertising mouth. This success can only be described as a marketing miracle.
