I saw it late at night on cable. At that time I did not know that the girl was billed as "Shannon WilseyÂ» was actually a porn star Savannah, but she was so beautiful (and got naked so often, thank God) that I actually sat through this brain-rotting drivel . I like cheese clicks as much as the next guy - more than any other guy, in fact - but it was far more than in cheese and rancid. Really annoying replay mad scientists and writers and special effects almost complete incompetence directed people detract gratuitous nudity that only saving grace of the movie. Savannah, before it turned into a plasticized Barbie dolls, she became like a porn queen, really fun to watch - it is stunningly gorgeous, bursts into uncontrollable giggles at times, looking away from the camera and laughing and just generally seems to be a very good time, which is longer than can be said for the audience. After all, even though Savannah and her colleagues carried out a sufficient amount of this naked, she still can not hide the fact that it's incredibly stupid, poorly made and annoying film. If you know someone who has it on video, or, in the case of cable one night to check it out, but do not spend money on rent.
