I saw this film for 2 reasons - I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor people had to carry quite dumb film. I liked the idea that Dracula is in fact a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, because he explains his disdain for all things Christian, but there were so many camps, that this idea has not been implemented as well as it could be. I see this film more as a way for talented Gerard Butler pay dues before honestly recognized and method for the legendary Christopher Plummer, to remind the public (me and 5 other people who have seen the film), it still exists. I really enjoyed the special features on the DVD more than the film itself.
