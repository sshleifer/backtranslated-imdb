I usually like zombie movies, but this was just a bad <br /> <br /> The good part :. swimming topless girl with straps floor, topless Sonya Salomaa, and tits Ona Grauer in the restructuring of poor top as she ran. <br /> <br /> bad part: too many cuts video matrix too much slow motion (it drags the action), not enough blood and guts, bad acting, and no history. The only person in the theater was smart and left immediately after bathing topless scene. A total waste of time and $ 6. I give him 2 to 10.
