If you can make it through the "classicÂ» Meyer titles / intro, you can wade through anything. But you want to? I did not find much there to dig their teeth into. I believe that if you go into it with low expectations Enuff you will be delighted (a la Charlie's Angels.) But for my money, I would like something more visual, move more. More. I feel like I'm begging for gruel @ host feet. on the men received the goods. but it just will not share.
