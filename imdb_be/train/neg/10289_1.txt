It really needs to win the «O» rating, or even negative ten. I watched this show for the ages, and the show jumped the shark around a series of 7. The episode, however, it is proof that the show jumped the shark. . He writes, lazy, absurd, self-indulgent and even garbage are as Beavis and Butt-head <br /> <br /> It may be that funny and still be fun - Pirates of the Caribbean, mummies, The Count of Monte Cristo - all the "fun" movies, which are not to be taken lightly. However, there is such a thing as funny as in "this is the worst that I have ever seen." And in fact, this is the worst episode of Stargate I have ever seen. It is absolutely terrible, and it comes from someone with a gate in the basement of his house. <br /> <br /> I want to sell all my Stargate props, the most serious.
