Rich ditzy Joan Winfield (Bette Davis woefully miscast) in engaged to a stupid selfish Allen Brice (Jack Carson looking lost). Her father (Eugene Palette) is determined to stop the marriage and her kidnapped pilot Steve Collins (James Cagney. Seriously). They crash land in the desert and hate each other, but (sigh) begin to fall in love. <br /> <br /> It seems to be getting good reviews here because Cagney and Davis in it. They were both brilliant actors, but they have been known drama not a comedy and this film shows why! The script is just awful - there is not a real laugh in the entire film. Joke this is, Cagney and Davis drop in cereal first cactus (it is done in three times!). Only their considerable talents to save them from total humiliation. How did they both do their best with lousy material. Cagney's trying his best with his lines and Davis screams every line in full force, but it does not work. Carson has this "what the hell" look on his face throughout the film (perhaps because his characters emotions changed in seconds). Only Palette with his distinctive voice and readings above the upper Manges, to name a few smiles. But in the end, it was boring and laughless - a real chore to sit through. It gets two stars only for Cagney and Davis' actions and some beautiful cinematography, but in fact - it is not worth seeing. Cagney and Davis hated this film in the coming years, and you can understand why.
