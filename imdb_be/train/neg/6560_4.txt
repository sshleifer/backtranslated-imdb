«Shadrach» was not my favorite type of movie. I found it too sentimental and action has been below par. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good, but some of the other actors were not very believable. I do not believe that Paul's parents would go away and leave it to the Dabney family, especially if they had a housekeeper who lives in the house. Their social classes were too far apart to consider it plausible. It seemed that life style Dabney was too exaggerated. It was the scene early in the film, which featured Andy McDowell out of the car after having sex with someone. Who was it? Her son? Which was the scene should show us? Why even included a scene? It has nothing to do with the rest of the film was in fact never mentioned. It seemed gratuitous and does not fit into the story at all. There were too many inconsistencies in the film for me. History regarding Shadrach was good, but I was not sure Dabneys would be as kind and generous as they have been drawn.
