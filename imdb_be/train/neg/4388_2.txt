About the people, I know what your thinking: "With a name like this, I can not go," Uh, yes you can. I also liked the title, but the person I hated the stupid kid who played "Satan's little helper" I also hated my mom and sister / daughter, and her boyfriend - I hated all these people! Man, it was excruciating to watch it sometimes! The only reason it gets a 1/10 condsidering to spend to look for a low budget, they're fine. But the person did I hate the actor, so stupid! I knew it would be bad, I guess they saved a lot of money for just using Halloween masks for the killer, and Jesus costume at the end was really stupid, too. About agony, do not watch!
