Endless frenzy of smart visual paradoxes does not necessarily create an attractive film. "Blonde wig" half of the film never took off, probably due to too much self-indulgence on the part of its creators. <br /> <br /> Wong Fei half (with a very playful when Karen Carpenter looks, Faye Wong) has a much more attractive. All the ingredients are there, however, the girl meets boy story takes a backseat element fanciful ingenuity. Character development is uneven. The emotion is absent. <br /> <br /> For music lovers, "Mash Jung Yong" Wong Fei (Cantonese version of the smash cranberry "Dreams" hit) is effectively used in Chongqing Express. Faye Wong also recorded a version of the Mandarin language called "third wife." Both are on the CD-ROM, although only "Mash Jung Yun" is the official soundtrack CD of the film.
