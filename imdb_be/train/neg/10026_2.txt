I had some expectations for the film, as it was a good star cast and a return of the duo Akshay and Saif. Well, I was hesitant to watch a movie, because it was done by the same person who wrote the story for the Dhoom franchise, because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared with Tashan, I would say, Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt good because it was put in a good way. Well, the very first scene itself Pis * ed me. Then, the main drawback of the film sequence. My friends and I laughed our guts by watching this crappy fights. It was like Akshem against some 30 bandits and thugs of all and even got guns! Uh ... you have to see it to understand how bad the sequence is. <br /> <br /> Another thing about the movie is too predictable story. It reminded me of some of the early '80s films. <br /> <br /> Well, the only thing that the movie is worth it sexy Kareena, who looked very hot in this one.And for that, I give the rating of 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Guys, please. ... .please do not see the one thinks it's a real gangster film. Well, you can look at it in order to have some laughs at the terrible scenes of combat. <br /> <br /> That's all.
