This is absolutely the worst piece of shit I've ever had to watch - in fact it was so bad that I just had to watch :-) <br /> <br /> CGI sooo bad, it's fun! It's not even close to the crappy CGI animation Spawn that is how bad it is, Har Har Har ... <br /> <br /> I'm surprised at the fact that some distribution company actually put money down to to release it on DVD, but I believe that they will receive more money from him so "because the manufacturing cost can not be more than a few hundred dollars. <br /> <br /> so badly that the class could do it in kindergarten. <br /> <br /> Watch it and laugh!
