I tried to sit through the bomb, not too long ago.what disaster .the action was absolutely helpless atrocious.there some scenes that fell flat as lead balloon.this mainly due to the fact that the actors are not simply a reaction called true.supposedly modern remaking Hitchcock's original "Lifeboat" .i think Hictcock will spin the wheel in his grave at the thought of it.from, that I was able to suffer, there is nothing conclusive in this movie.it has several sex big names, but they did not put no effort in their characters.but, you know what would in the fair, it was really.i no one to blame, so I'm sure that the script has blown in the first explosion, LOL.it possible that this thing ends up improving the way it goes along.but for me, I do not want to spend at least three days to find out.so, if you have at least a three-day weekend on the horizon, avoid this bitch / 1/10
