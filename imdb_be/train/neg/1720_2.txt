Several non-professional actors terrorized by prehistoric creatures. This creature is in about thirty seconds marginal animation stop-motion, but about how you will long for this region, when the rest of the film animation replaced by production assistants waved around the inside of the pipe with teeth. A lot of time for terror, when this film stole halfway through this comic doofuses boat rentals, which have suddenly become the protagonists; but again you have to admit, watching as they try to be funny rather than plodding around after the sheriff. Only at the end of one of them gets eaten, and the other left sitting on a rock, calling for tears of loneliness - it's not fun!
