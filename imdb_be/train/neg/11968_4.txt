This is just typical of Bruce Willis action movie one-liner. Be careful with some popcorn and friends. Hire it to save money. <br /> <br /> None of them is not realistic. Battles are not realistic. Soldiers are not realistic. Victims are not realistic. And why is the character of Tom Skerritt is talking to Willis with deck CARRIER? What to do? He can not do it from the inside of the ship? <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce B. gets a machete wounds. There's a bunch of secondary explosions. <br /> <br /> If this film is precisely Navy Seals, it does not get stuck in Africa waiting for them to come save you! <br /> <br /> Noble attack on the village of bothered me the most. "Front row seats to an ethnic cleansing '... as Bruce looks at the slaughter takes place in the city. So what does he do? He creeps into the city on his stomach. Yes. How many were killed while they were putzing around? Oh well ... the body count was needed, I think. <br /> <br /> And when one African guy was so important, why did not he get on the chopper with the elderly and children? Can he say "spirit?Â» <br /> <br /> In the end, the film was very dark. Not only in the story, but it happens at night it was difficult to understand what is happening. <br /> <br /> hire him.
