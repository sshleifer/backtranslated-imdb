I can not believe I wasted my time with this film. I could not even call it a movie. It was so bad, with nothing to recommend it. <br /> <br /> I love the low budget films and weird clicks, but it had to be I'm bored to death. Poorly made and bad acting destroyed him from the curious. You have to wonder what these people think, when they spent the money to make this film. Interestingly, I thought, watching it to the end. I recommend this movie to anyone. As they release it? Were viewers who love this kind of movie? There should be, because you can find it in almost any video store. But why? <br /> <br /> deserves to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> If you like bad movies, then this is for you.
