I try to be generous giving this film 2 stars. line about "you have even seen The Wizard of Oz" was the best part for me! with terrible writing and acting as reflected in this film, it is not surprising that many of them fell into a miserable tv reality show. do yourself a favor and get out of the house and got into the game Royals baseball, your will be glad I did!
