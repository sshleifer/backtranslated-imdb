Of course, one of the most ill-considered remakes of classics in film history - the more so that the promise of its tag line, "The most beautiful woman of our time in the erotic adventure of all time," not even the correct operation! Despite the fact that this film is regularly shown on television in my timber neck, since my childhood, it is known (for terribly erotic content, mind you) keep me away from him so far - and I only relented because I recently It enjoyed Derek's previous film, 10 (1979), and watched a lot of fancy things, as well as during the Christmas period. <br /> <br /> The leading actress / producer Derek It is quite funny plays a schoolgirl-ish sexy bunny (witness inept banana scene) and, as you might expect, it is made to get her clothes several times, but as the reception how these scenes were, it came off as much more sensible in 10 than it does here; Richard Harris, then chews the scenery continuously, like a man possessed researcher Jane's father, but John Phillip Law hardly registers as his assistant, who dutifully shows some initial interest in most of Jane; newcomer Miles O'Keefe has a major role, and it only makes its entrance is 45 minutes in the film, is completely silent during his famous yodel (which probably raised with Weissmuller anyway!) and, in addition, except as vague, as one of the trees it hangs at regular intervals during the second half of the film!; for the record, he later starred in two films ATOR (or potential CONAN simulators) for Joe DAmato and many of King Arthur era, glorious SWORD (1984). <br /> <br /> If another actor and director John Derek (who also serves as his own cinematographer here) has worked with some good filmmakers (DeMille, Dieterle and Robert Rosen) and a few large (Preminger, Nicholas Ray and Don Siegel ), but he obviously learned zilch from them, its direction is one is one of the key commitments: terribly pretentious at times (witness quite disgusting sequences python attack) with meaningless excessive slow motion technology transitions and cheese; It was the seventh film of Derek as a director (and his second of four with his wife Bo) and, in the end, he would only get to do two more. <br /> <br /> complete failure of the film need only be judged by the fact that the legend of Tarzan was permitted again in the film - in Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes (which, oddly enough, I did not see myself yet) - just three years !! Nominated for six Golden Raspberry Awards (including John Derek, Richard Harris and Miles O'Keeffe) and win one for the very fact Derek Tarzan, the ape MAN was co-author Harry Goddard, the future director of another long-awaited but ultimately disappointing transposition the silver screen (this time animated) heroic figure, Lord of the universe (1987), which I will come back to the present, as well as (s)! Despite the magical closing credit sequence showing Tarzan and Jane are playing with a circle with an orangutan and a score that is not half bad actually and absolutely amazing about or belated good intentions defeated extremely stupid climax with the participation of the natives completely After painting the white and fatally, John Derek clear lack of interest in the character of Tarzan, making it off as unimportant supporting character in his own self-titled movie !!
