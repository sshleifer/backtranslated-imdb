Blank Check is a film that I've seen on TV one day and, like most films, they air on TV blanche was not so good. First of all, no one I have ever met has seen blanche and that includes the people who grew up in the 90s. Also Blank Check will not remember in the 00s, or simply due to the fact that it will be overshadowed by the movie from Pixar. I would not call blanche bad film, but it is not really any entertainment. (Or at least, it is not for anyone over the age of 6 years) blanche wholly entertaining film, because nothing about it is not original. Everyone just makes you go "I have not seen this before?Â» Blank Check tears and trying to make money on everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (which oddly enough, both have Culkin it) Blank Check is not a bad film, but it deserves to disappear into obscurity.
