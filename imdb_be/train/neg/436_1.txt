If you've ever been harassed at the Underground Christian who says, "Jesus is the answer. What's the question? ", Then perhaps you should give thanks to God, if you have never met Lacanian. Zizek, is the Gospel of Lacanians undoubtedly exchange the word "Jesus" in the statement for "varnish / Hegel." <br /> <br /> Zizek star burns brightly at the moment, no doubt, because we usually consider movies and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption. So, it seems impressive when someone - anyone - comes and says, <br /> <br /> Zizek's ideas in this film teaches "true" only because he says, "Hang on, movies can say something about Me. "for example, Zizek explains that the three Marx Bros are the ego, superego and id (God knows what happened to Zeppo and Gummo ?? maybe they sinthome ... or is that the films themselves?) . It's just what they are. The output Zizek, culture does not have to be investigated, but simply to be held as an example of its ideology. People may argue that it is, of course, have something to say - but what is different is that he speaks of Christian attributing everything to God's will <br /> <br /> What's wrong with taking examples from movies or anywhere, to illustrate a theory ? Well, nothing. As it seems, Zizek believe that they can even serve as evidence. However, it just cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from the context. Without context, we can say and prove that you want. For Zizek, the answer varnish ?? so he goes and makes an example of this. All but reminiscent of the teachings of the Master and the culture is to carry it to serve this ideology. For example, the sample position in Zizek fantasy voyeur taken from the scene in Vertigo, when Jimmy Stewart spying on Kim Novak in a flower shop. But, in the context of the film, it's not a voyeur fantasy position at all. Stewart intentionally brought to Novak. This view examples isolated from the context continues for Zizek two o'clock and a half of cinematic sermon. <br /> <br /> His analysis of "child wants to f ---" scene in a blue velvet ridiculous. Touching lightly the fact that he seems to think horrible (male) of the truth "female pleasure" Zizka said that the character of Isabella Rossilini not only requires its degradation, but unconsciously, meet the situation. This is an example of its "pleasure". Well ... maybe. But - I'm sorry to be prosaic - where is the proof of this? In the film, it is partially exposed her to humiliation because Hopper kidnapped her son. Zizek might argue that it is too obviously loves rough sex with Kyle MacLachalan. But it may be due to any number of things. Not that the point of the so-called women's "delight"? According varnish said female enjoyment Unlike phallic pleasure, can not be formulated, it goes beyond the phallic castration capture and language. If so, none of the examples may not be out of it. This also means that the whole concept is not completely meaningless to the mystical. It can only be assigned to dogma, such as Zizka "There feminine pleasure for you Why is feminine pleasure Because I say so !?". <br /> <br /> What example can really going to these movies? Only psychology Zizek. Why does he keep inserting yourself in your favorite movies, to the point that, if in a boat on the Gulf Botega, he says that he wants to f --- Rod Steiger, too? Is not the fulfillment of desires who spends his life in criticizing movies? As they say, Freud would have a field day with the Guide to the Cinema pervert - but by Zizek, no one else <br /> <br /> Zizek theory that the movies show us how we wish, can be directly on the face. about it, but these films can not be strictly universal examples of psychoanalytic laws. This film shows how Zizek wants and only a very vague - almost useless - like the rest of us desire. In fact, as any psychoanalyst knows what we want and what we want can not be completely separated - and can not easily be universalised, if at all. Zizek love to do all the examples of lacquer response confirms this: how do we want? as this is how I do it. The problem is that, in Zizek desire, everything, and all others to rationalize in their desire. But Zizka Leninist, and they certainly do not like, allowing the "subject" speak for itself. <br /> <br /> Pervert's Guide to Cinema love summation Zizek dogma and completely non-philosophical, even though he is still very political (that dogma is not?). Zizek never doubted what his motives may be, when the approach to the analysis, it tries to detect, because the conditions for its study and, therefore, his ethics in this, never questioned. <br /> <br /> Zizek is extremely prolific, but his book and the film say the same thing. He kind of Henry Ford cultural theory: mass production and in any color as long as it is black. It is ideal for modern high consumer society: that critical, giving people the same from al over again, and pretending that it is something else. It is popular because people mostly prefer ready-made answers to their problems - that capitalism always claim to provide - and not to investigate the case with any serious consideration at all. Something like the brain dead. For me, the third matrix tablet Zizek is suicide Capsules <br /> <br /> PS: I loved the solemn remark Žižek - presented as the opening of the cinema and humanity - the music in the films can strongly affect the sympathy of people .. Maybe this will happen only after he watched Zizek's jaw?
