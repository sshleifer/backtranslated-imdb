The film with very little positive to say about him. <br /> <br /> First of all, it has a zero tempo and positively lacks any drama. <br /> <br /> In addition, surprisingly slow Empty Acre, seems dedicated to using the same footage over and over again. I've lost count how many times I've seen "what" field in the night or a little cracked earth. <br /> <br /> He also has a fundamental flaw in the belief that if the audience does not know that they will capture and not just confused. Therefore, without any indication that there is any question, we all of a sudden marriage is not what it seems, despite the impression that it was good. We believe, James, possibly the worst farmer in the universe, he does not seem to spend time on the farm, as well as, it seems, bought land with a completely useless on. Beth has a key to the storage of books? There are countless other issues, some of which were resolved later in the film, much later, in fact, too late. <br /> <br /> And in place of an acre. Horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects in nature are not scared ?? and if they are intended to be env is large, make it so. <br /> <br /> There is also a frightening lack of reasonableness, Beth (the best performer in the piece, and then Jefferson ?? cop) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because it is on the "medicine". <br /> <br /> of ten minutes plus running around the field in search of a missing child (he did crawl out of the window? It is six months), the film goes into poorly written scene after scene badly written. Bad plinky Plonk "horror" music adds atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Most bad movies can be fun, but do not empty Acre, which is simply bad.
