The problem I find with this name, I'm not sure when the director tries to make a documentary or film. The combination of these two genres just does not work, and that leaves it all hung in the middle of nowhere. It's more that the director chose the most extreme, that is supposed to be what is happening around our daily lives, making it inconclusive documentary. If it's meant to be a thriller / drama, it's too boring and monotonous. In any case, what it is moral or message, the director tries to convey to the audience? Around us there are people who are bad to others who want to abuse? That is a lot of crazy lunatics around us? .......... So what?
