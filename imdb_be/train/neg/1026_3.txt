Wow. I do not think I've ever seen a movie with so many great actors who have such a key role so miscast. Justin Timberlake is, perhaps, the worst actor to land Bigtime role in the film with the star power and money for him, Edison. <br /> <br /> His action was painful to watch. The story was in order, and all the other characters are played by professional actors, damn it, even LL Cool J has been good, as he had many small parts to cut their teeth. As a director and film company decided that Timberlake was ready for this role, there is no way to understand. <br /> <br /> His character destroys the whole experience because every time he's on screen, you're actually the introduction to the corrupt cops crown his sorry ass, and he shall be a hero ... I would not spend money on it in the theater or on video. Chances are, if you have HBO and have nothing else, at 2am on Saturday night, and you're drunk and stoned, it may be in order. <br /> <br /> Watching Timberlake in the role was like a man "Kerman act FrogÂ» Hollywood blockbuster, just does not work.
