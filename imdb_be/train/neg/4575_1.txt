I admit that I'm just a college student in this present time, an English major in it. At that time I saw this film, I was a high school student - I want to say that junior year, but it may have been older, it is difficult to remember. My experience with quantum physics is pretty much unlike my physics course, interest in quantum mechanics, which led me to read on this subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of this field, as well as any article I can find in the Discover and the like . I'm not a doctor of philosophy any means. <br /> <br /> However, ... <br /> <br /> This film is simply awful. It is designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average New Age guru who desperately wants to believe how it all special. My mother is such a person, and since then it has seen this film, she was trying to get all of your friend to see it and bought a copy of the film. I tried to show in the various shortcomings and the problems I've seen with the logic of movies and science - and they are many - and she rejected my claim, because "oh, a high school student knows more than all these people with PhDs". In this case, apparently, yes. <br /> <br /> Leaving behind what is earning a PhD does not necessarily require that a person be right or, in fact, intelligent. Leaving behind what my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half of the film. Leaving behind that, the filmmakers fully manipulate their interviews, at least one of the participants, to make it appear that he supports their beliefs when, in fact, it is completely against them. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I think intuitor did a very good job of exposing the film so that you can read that, if you care to do so. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
