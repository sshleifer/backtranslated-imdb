"Omen 4: The Awakening" is a made-for-TV for the original film "The Omen." Instead Satan has a body of a little boy, he has the body of a little girl adopted by wealthy parents who are bullied at school, and who eventually becomes a revenge against those who are doing it wrong. The film seems to fight any fear factor, and the many events that take place are just stupid and not particularly scary, and it's hard to believe that this little girl is Satan, even with all the events that surround it. I just have not found this movie very disturbing and frightening, especially in comparison with the original.
