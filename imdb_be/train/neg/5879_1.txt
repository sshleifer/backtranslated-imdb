I wonder how the actors were in the movie. Annette Bening was really herself, half in and half out, she was pretending or natural? It does not matter, considering that even if she had to walk on the ceiling would not have changed the picture of the film. Brian Cox acted very well. I almost thought that he had always acted so crafty, unscrupulous, in a dirty environment where no one cared about hygiene. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is, what she does in this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is quite sickening and disgusting. Who will pay to see this shit?
