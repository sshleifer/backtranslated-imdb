Definitely the worst film I've ever seen ... Can anyone tell me where I was supposed to laugh? There is no hint or shadow of ideas. Three leading actors are harmful, especially one (I think that's Aldo) from Sicily, who do not carry a Sicilian accent !!! Not say enough about the fabulous insert Dracula ... just another expedient, shown from the worst traditions of theater, to do this "film" lasts a little longer. Massironi Littizzetto and do what they can, but this so-called film was really too, too difficult to save. I would give a "0" / 10, but the lowest score was 1/10, and so I had to re-evaluate one brand.
