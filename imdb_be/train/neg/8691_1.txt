If there was a zero rating, I'd give it in this movie. Today was the second time I tried to watch it, and I still could not make it through from beginning to end. I can not believe that a lot of stars, and other data can only assume that they either know an actor or writer in disguise! Brutal act all around, la script Nichol kid playing shows zero emotion, even if it is threatened. "Southern" accent of the actress playing Mama Amber ridiculous - I'm from Georgia and friends from Texas - I do not believe anybody says, like this! None of her emotions did not seem real at any stage. The subject is very serious and deserves much better treatment.
