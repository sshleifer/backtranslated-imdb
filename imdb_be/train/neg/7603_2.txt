I'll be blunt. I'm not one for the politically correct movies where the woman plays a bad ass who is not going to take any crap from anyone. If any one of the actors wanted, they could just take her to the heart. It was interesting to MST 3K, but leases the real version. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
