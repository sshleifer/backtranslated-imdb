I've seen every episode of this department. I thought that the first season was a decent effort, considering the expectations after such success that Gray's Anatomy. So I continued to watch. I am afraid that the second season is not enough charm, chemistry, and, more important drama of his predecessor, Gray Anatomy. Relationships seem far-fetched, and the current so-so. Writing lacks intelligence and comedic cues seen in the TOE. There are shows that template, but do not feel contrived and formulaic, unfortunately, PP is not. I loved the presence of Kate Walsh to GA. I'm afraid of life, Kate Walsh in Los Angeles, just not interested.
