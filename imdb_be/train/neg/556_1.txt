In my book "Basic Instinct" was a perfect movie. He was a great actor on the part of the stone, Douglas and all the supporting actors to the smallest role. It was amazing photos, music and noirest noir scenario ever. All these add to the film, which is as good as it will ever be! <br /> <br /> This is the sequel is the complete opposite, it can not get worse, bad acting and lame script, combined with a fully unsuitable direction, it is very bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that keeps you concentrated a relatively short wait for the next stage, which is an exact re-reproduced copy of the original. These copies are so bad they make you laugh, and I laughed a lot, in spite of myself, because it was like a shining monument demolished. The only thing good in this terrible mess are the fragments of the score by Jerry Goldsmith with BI1. Michael Caton-Jones and jerk in charge of the script even included "There's no smoking in this room," Dialogue in the interrogation scene so she sends her lawyer (who is now the attorney) away! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I've seen this horrible film that should never have been made! This makes damage to the original, so that it is bad. The only merit is to realize that cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure that Ms. Stone gives the surgeon the best money can buy) can do a good job, but obviously can not restore the original perfection. As for the human body relates to film-making too. There should be a rule: Never make a sequel to a perfect movie!
