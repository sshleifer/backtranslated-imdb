For those who will decide whether or not to watch the movie and read the comments to understand, I was the first to offer these four words: Do not waste time! "Chungking Express" was poorly shot, slapped together quickly and it seems as if it were conceived in its entirety by someone standing in line at Burger King in Hong Kong. I can not remember ever watched a movie with a range of one-dimensional characters trying to find their way through the script is worldly! This is an absurd attempt at philosophical funny dialogue (man wanders in his flooded apartment and offers excellent revelation that "tears can be dried with a cloth, but the water takes a long time to clean up"). The same character is also reflected in the carrying out of a deep, meaningful rapport with his towel, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. shaky, wandering, handheld camera work was another annoying feature that I could have done without. And if that was not enough to make you puke in your popcorn, we hear the old 60th ode «California Dreaming» by Mamas and Papas ditch on the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly long sequence. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino was responsible for ensuring that a failure in America through his Rolling Thunder Productions company, although I can not for the life of me understand why someone with his talent would bother. He was known, he said: ". I am happy to love a movie that's a lot," Many of us, though, I hope that it will focus on building its viewers rather more worthy discoveries in the future.
