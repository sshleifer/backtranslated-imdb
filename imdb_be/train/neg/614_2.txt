I watched it on the channel Sci-Fi now. It's so awful, I can not stop watching it! I videography and this film I'm bored. I feel bad for anyone associated with this film. Some of the camera well. Most of it is doubtful. There are some decent actors in the film. It is a pity that they are surrounded by what should have been directed by the relatives. This is the only way that they could be qualified to be in the film! The music was a little better than the action. If you are around to see it, I hope it's because there was absolutely no other option! Continued (yes Continued) comes now .... I think I'll skip it! Jason
