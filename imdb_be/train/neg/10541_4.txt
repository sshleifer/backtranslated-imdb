I jotted down a few notes here on the first power on, Lou Diamond Phillips Lambada 1990 satanic serial killer yuppie hell festival ... <br /> <br /> 1) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently accused of beating his wife and could serve in prison . I just hope that he can find Armani prison clothes to go in style with: One of the guilty pleasures of the film sees his police detective wearing a $ 4500 designer raincoats, designer silk dress for $ 7300, and seeing his $ 3,500 / month Los -Andzhelese bachelor pad loft with interior design by Mies van der Roeh. <br /> <br /> 2) The leading lady Tracy Phillips has a magnificent porcelain skin, flowing red hair, who always seems to be stylized, even if confused, and amazing breasts that greeting-lighted in the 2nd half of the film silk designer pullover, which unfortunately, it remains in place on her body, even if it is willing to sacrifice to Satan. At least as early as 1970, our demonic killer stripped their victims before finishing them, although there is something to say, why a little to the imagination. For the last 10 minutes of the film, I could think of was that her breasts will probably look like this. <br /> <br /> 3) Professional psychics lives in Los Angeles can afford $ 4 multi-million dollar condos on Mulholland Drive overlooking Los Angeles that would make Brad Pitt decided that he was roughing it. In essence condominium, which is used in the film is exactly the same as the one seen in David Lynch MULLHOLLAND al., Which at least had the good sense to make it a successful condo resident director. Only professional psychics I ran outside the film are all currently serving a prison sentence for fraud. <br /> <br /> 4) I forgot his name, but the villain in this film perfectly, and his "As it happens» Buddy Boy? »line may be best to overlook the movie phrases as" THANK YOU RIDE, LADY !! "from Creepshow 2. <br /> <br /> 5) Under the major metropolitan cities have huge vats of boiling acid, which explode into huge balls of fire when someone throws a lit cigarette lighter in them, so the major public waterworks installations all have no smoking signs plastered all over them, even if the idea of ​​smoking around the water be dangerous, of course, irrelevant. And as Zippo lighters must be manually filled with lighter fluid, which can often leak out and be absorbed by the other clothes, the idea of ​​holding one in your pocket $ 7,300 Gucci silk suit strikes me as far more dangerous. <, Br /> <br /> 6) The stunts in this film is impressive, to say the least and one of the fun things about watching it ostayuiesya yourself that you do not read the computer automated special effects, but really stuntpeople risking their lives and health in order to contribute in the film earned nearly universal bomb ratings from critics when released <br /> <br /> 7) film Satanists always amazes me :. Here is a guy who knocked in a Luciferian power, and yet, instead of using it to make something useful, how to make yourself rich or making a mannequin to participate in a free form, have sex with him, instead he has a bag ladies and they flew outside the apartment people. Speaking of which there is a person who is not indestructible, able to fly, and can put his whole being inside the bodies of other people - and yet it requires a star Lou Diamond Phillips with the usual fights in the film's conclusion, but does not have the common sense to inhabit Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed, to make sure that he will win. <br /> <br /> and on and on ... in order to observe in the company of wise cracking friends consuming beer. You'll have fun as long as you persist in refusing to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> 4/10
