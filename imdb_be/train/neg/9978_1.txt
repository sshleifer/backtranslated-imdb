My girlfriend and I were surprised at how bad this movie was. After 15 minutes, we would call it quits, but us was too interesting to see when the film could redeem himself. This is not so. <br /> <br /> I can not understand the praise given by this film. The letter was absolutely awful and delivered some of the worst acts I've seen in a very long time. <br /> <br /> One thing that particularly irritated me about this film was the fact that often when people talk to each other there was an unnatural pause between lines. I understand using the pause to create a sense of unease (as in Happiness). It was not that type of pause - it's just a bad direction. This film could actually be much better with subtitles, and possibly overseas market is the best option for this movie, because it would then innane dialogue and a bad game is not noticed as much. <br /> <br /> In general, I love these kinds of little bizarre films (The Real Blonde, walk and talk, beautiful and amazing), but this one failed on so many levels that I think he's one of the worst movies I I stayed in over the past few years.
