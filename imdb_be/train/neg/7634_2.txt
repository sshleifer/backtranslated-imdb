This is a film that shows the poverty of French cinema when it comes to making the desire thrillers.The director of "American sound" is so egregious that you will not be deceived by the minute, when you have not seen a serial killer movie since "radar". <br /> <br /> Two male cops (or one and a half, more like, as you'll see), the terrible murder, the plot more complex than complex.Charles Berling had no luck with the genre (see astoundlingly dumb Â«l'Inconnu de Strasbourg "a couple of years ago) .The scene with his pregnant wife -What should be an analogue for another noir atmosphere of the rest of the site, they are among the worst ever filmed.Add obscene love scene between them and a bloody autopsy to get a PG 12 and thus to attract a huge teen audience.A violent and absurd etc. Again, accompanied by a silent epilogue that would make a good advertisement for the blue beach, it's really quiet chromium.
