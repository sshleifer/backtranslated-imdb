I could not believe how awful this film was; I rarely watch TV commercial, but thought, "Well, Diane Keaton always worth watching." I corrected. All participants should be hanging their heads in shame. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are not many good roles for women of a certain age, but the script for this was so incompetent, templates, and embarrassed that I was surprised that ever got in the development or Ms. Keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of the ear of the mater. None of the characters did not have a shred of credibility and were incredibly unsympathetic. Actions looked like exercises in the class start - I looked into the open mouth of terror through most of it wondering "What were they thinking?". Very, very sad that it has come to this. Do not waste your time.
