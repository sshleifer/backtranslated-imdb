Where is it written that sequels should suck? Scream 2 did not! Others did not! But this one sure did ... problems include terrible actor (Christopher Walken could only act in the whole movie), bad writing (you will never understand what is happening, and I even conducted a study on the idea before the Nephilim), and just terrible choice for casting. Eric Roberts makes a silly Archangel Michael that I have ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague if you have not lost hope of seeing Christopher Walken. In this case, simply fast forward to the part where he is in the movie, and to avoid others. <br /> <br /> Yech !!!
