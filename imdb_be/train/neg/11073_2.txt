It was frightening and poorly terribly disappointing for Canadians. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the best in the world. National Ballet is ranked among the top five companies in the world. BUT WE bloody awful movie! This one is not particularly bad. This is especially characteristic and typical bad shot in two bit hotels and public parks with a good direction, the level of the secondary school of acting and "gee whiz ... let's see what does this button on the camera ??" picture. When Michael Moriarity was so keen to make the embodiment of Jack Nicholson, could not he at least made the embodiment of good Jack Nicholson? And if the film was shot in Vancouver, it is truly one of the most beautiful cities on earth, as well as the center of yacht building (part of the "story"), why in God's name we allow that endemic Canadian inferiority complex dictates that he disguised Seattle ??? Not only that, I'm crazy about this movie, I Embarassed and more than a little embarrassing. Australians have produced some remarkable things. We produce bad manners pretentious second rate. Gawd !!!!!
