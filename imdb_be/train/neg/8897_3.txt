I remember when I first saw this movie, I was in sixth grade when it happened. Before I saw it, I listened to the recording of the original Broadway and I really loved it! But when I saw it, I was like, what the hell?! This film is not a lot of songs from the musical to call out loud! Who decided to do it all? <br /> <br /> I'm really a big fan of Gene Kelly, but this film is probably the worst of the musical, which he has ever done! The film is more like a Hollywood set than the beautiful mountains of Scotland. And who the hell decided to cut all the songs from the film Meg? <br /> <br /> I'm willing to bet that when they saw the film, Lerner and Lowe are probably wondering: "Who in the world decided to do it on our masterpiece" Well, they were right to say that if they did, they are likely to mind the fact that Hollywood has made them a great musical in this film is quite empty. <br /> <br /> songs and acting wise, Mr. Kelly, you accepted to audition with flying colors, but you are in the film, which is not a lot of text. <br /> <br /> In short, if you want a good movie based on a musical Frederick Loewe and Alan Jay Lerner, this one is not so! <br /> <br /> 3/10
