The fourth feature of the "Shiver" thing of the past, in 1889, "The Legend Begins" in a small town "Perfection", which was then "Rejection, Nevada." As the story begins, Seventeen miners were killed in a terrible «Graboids». Some of the characters in the current "Tremors" films have ancestors as figurative and literally, in the past. The most obvious is constantly returning Michael Gross (as Homer Hiram). Unlike its descendant, Mr Gross inept with a firearm; . So he hires Gunslinger Billy Drago (as the "Black Hand" Kelly) to shoot «Em Up Some" Dirt Dragons "<br /> <br /> This one will take some getting used to - as is the case in the past. It's like a western with miniature versions of the original monster movie «Graboids». These tamer «Dirt Dragons» is nowhere near as terrorizing as their "Tremors" (1990) copies. Thus, in this film, the characters spend a lot of time on the ground, which would not have happened in the original film. And it was strange that the citizens give up so quickly when Gross temporarily decides to leave town. Why are so helpless? Why not Brent Roam (as Juan Pedilla) immediately to rally people to fight without Gross? . Disappointing <br /> <br /> **** Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004), SS Wilson ~ Michael Gross, Brent Roam, Billy Drago
