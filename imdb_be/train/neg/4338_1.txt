really awful ... leading actor made KI ... movie plot, etc. was totally crap and inaccurate it can also be a continuation of the well ... everything that he had little or no relationship to the Carlitos Way ... and should be avoided like the plague, any fan Carlo methods ... no mention of Gale in fact it does not end with any other bird, no mention of Klienfelt, there is no mention of how he was, nothing is said about how he ended up in prison. .. they tried to make it as original with flash-backs in the beginning ... but to be honest, when I sought his approval rating zeroed ... unfortunately, I had to evaluate its high ... <br /> <br / > his terrible attempt to cash in on what was one of the best films of the 90s ... all in all it was about Â£ 6 and 2 hours of my life wasted ... for all the "action" in it, it was really sad slowly and predictably ... again any fans Carltio wade avoid this fiasco ...
