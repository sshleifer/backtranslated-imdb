The plot is not original. If someone saw Â«L'Ultimo Bacio" there is nothing new. Rich family lives in Rome daily lives that it is boring and lie to each other asking what they think of them. Really sad after half an hour, because it's easy to understand where the story is going to end. This is because it is easy to see the kind of moralistic Muccino in this film, so that even the most hard parts appear normal. To summarize in the first 2 minutes of the movie would have been enough, and the purpose of the film has already been said. family saw 30 years, I did not want to see a film that wants to show the reality, but to be consistent in your thoughts should push more than the normal situation. Really good as Muccino put the camera in the right place, moving from carathers, and this is the only reason that I will not sleep in the movie, though always in the cinema screaming from the beginning. Perhaps it may be good to see the family as they really are and not put the blame on something out of it. Morante was intense and great, as usual, but miserable for a bad movie!
