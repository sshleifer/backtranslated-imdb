I felt that this film was a good thing. The action was a spot, and I felt for all the situations the characters, though real family unit has not been fully revealed. We never got enough information about his father really feel his pain for the whole of its participation, or built up his feud with you. I mean, in one scene, you see it, admiring her strength and elsewhere, he simply takes it on his head. Another problem with the film was she just collapsed and lost focus towards the end, and I asked him to just get on with it. Any movie with such a protracted and painful finale should never receive an automatic rating of 7 or above, only for the action. We are looking at increasing the quality of watching movies. In the case of this film end is so bad, I seriously considered just leaving the theater. The film pulled me then just spat me.
