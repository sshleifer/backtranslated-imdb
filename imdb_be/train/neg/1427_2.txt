British claymation series put a "clever" conversation tape with "average" people in the mouths of "cute" bizarre creatures, at least, had the advantage for non-UK viewers imaginary beautiful and rarefied cultural type of humor you could not get on US television. Someone made a mistake by putting it on American television. <br /> <br /> Something like a sad version of the American miscast elevated the Brit-com connection, who died a month on NBC when the same basic scenario does not "translated" from British English to American English, then, it seemed funny and cultured (and just boring) in England, it comes in Zhetsony, the American version, but simply boredom with dolls. There section through the line and no signs after one and a half watched episodes (three ultimately in ether), there is no reason to suffer more. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing to say about the new summer series, and mercifully short run it was that claymation, at least professionally and suitable as a setting for the single worst show on the CBS schedule, New Adventures of Old Kristin (or "how to be a terrible mother - five people - one infinite, not funny lesson"), children who want to stay in the past, their sleep happily ran to the bed, instead of sitting through this show, and adults could wait to tune in to 9 pm, when the "Two and a half Men" (guilty pleasure) and "How I met your mother" (fact chnae quality of writing) cast.
