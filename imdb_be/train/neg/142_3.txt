Firstly, there are some good things about this film, but it's a cliche shredder material in conjunction with the teenage movie. The advertisement of the film that I saw a lot of emphasis was placed on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but it's a bad actress, and not as good looking as people try to make it to be (not that nothing It has nothing to do with the movie). And with this look she gives everyone? Maybe it's part of the character, but, as I said, the current ... However, good writing. You know what it's all throughout the film, and you can almost predict what will happen, but not annoying way. I think that the book is based on is probably good, according to the storyline, but next time I'll read a book to learn, not to look at it.
