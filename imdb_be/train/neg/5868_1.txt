Absolutely one of the worst films of all time. <br /> <br /> Low production values, scary story ideas, bad script, dull action ... and I can not even come up with a suitable adjective descriptive of how poor guide Joan River there. I know that there is a special place in hell for people who financed the film; Prolly directly below the level reserved for genocidal maniacs raping children. <br /> <br /> This film is a Trainwreck. <br /> <br /> (disastrous) x (infinity) = Rabbit test. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> it's so bad, it's not even funny how bad it is.
