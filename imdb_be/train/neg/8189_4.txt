It is always difficult to have to do better related to his life than you, always a struggle to get out from under this shadow and do not allow bitterness to keep you away from your family. So, imagine that your older brother, Santo, and then imagine how difficult this must be. This room here. <br /> <br /> Vince Vaughn plays the titular Fred embittered loser who spends a lot of its energy, to ensure that people do not go around expecting good things to happen to them or giving his brother Santa (played by Paul Giamatti ), too much praise for simply being in the spotlight hogging, fame hungry, a bit horrible guy that Fred would like to submit it. Then would not you know it, Fred needs a financial benefit and, therefore, has to do for him, helping his brother on the run up to Christmas. And fun, and the lessons of life come. <br /> <br /> Well, that is what should happen. The reality is that we get a Christmas movie with a few good moments patented fast-talking Vaughn, ridiculously out of nowhere a music video the moment, Kevin Spacey playing the auditor to cover the operation of Santa (as he is one of the weakest villains I've seen in some time), lacks the beautiful Elizabeth Banks in a beautiful Christmas outfit, too many John Michael Higgins in his elf meetings (to be fair, it is a highlight, though) and the film, which is also bathed in bitterness feel good seasonal fare is too sugary in his second half to feel like poking fun at all the bad things about the commercialism of time. <br /> <br /> Rachel Weisz along for the ride too, like Kathy Bates, but it's really nothing more than a movie to Vaughn, and if you like his style, you will find something to enjoy here . Unfortunately, very little else to recommend this seasonal bitch. Beyond the swearing Vona script just throws anything decent with the exception of one particularly good scene with a fun group of business support with a very specific problem. <br /> <br /> The direction of David Dobkin is so mediocre and balanced as 20p Christmas card that you send aunt you have not seen for 10 years, and he seems to think that just put the ingredients without good mix or decent care guarantees a delicious Christmas pudding. No, we get burnt, soft lump with too much sugar on top. Forget it and paste cheerful elf again, if you want a large, modern comedy Christmas <br /> <br /> Watch it if you want :. The Santa Clause 2, Santa Baby, The Santa Clause 3: The Escape point.
