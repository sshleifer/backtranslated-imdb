Another Priyadarshan / Vohra film another movie that was seen on the TP, rather than an actual desire, the only reason I saw this film was the fact that the regulars were not in the film (Akshay Paresh and many others), but it goes without saying I had low expectations for this film. <br /> <br /> I was pleased with the cast as a whole, except Razhpali Yadav, who once again plagued nor to what extent, he nevertheless get some laughs, but it was by the standards of non-original slapstick jokes in fact, the whole movie is playing dhol, I mean, it takes almost no talent to make a loud noise, or even play the odd good blow to the dhol in a short time to do it ?? His only those who can carry a variety of rhythms in good sequential order over a long period, it is considered to be large. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to another tool, the Dumroo hardly needs any talent, he has no variations, and it can be fun for a while the monkey dances (hmm sounds like Razhpal Yadav, good analogy), but not a tool that will entertain you for a long time or even make you dance like Dhol does. <br /> <br /> This film was like dhol and dumroo played, sometimes Dhol played sometimes dumroo, sometimes both together, but mostly dumroo played one and a monkey dancing. And, like any 24-year-old sooner rather than later, I missed you. <br /> <br /> There's a few good DHOL (good) things, but after a while all I heard was annoying Dumroo (initially entertaining, then we suffer, irritating), a large part of the ordinary really provide this film mostly good for a few funny videos on Â«MERE BHAINS KO Anda Kyun DREAM" (if you have not watched it watch filmy, he comes in the evening, and it's really very funny). <br /> <br /> This film had its moments, the actors did an excellent job, except Razhpalo Yadav (who can act, though, I saw him in the Main Meri Putnam ??), which is more annoying than entertaining, I spoke it many times and I'll say it again, I really think, Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a great career ahead of a few stellar especially comedies. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes were really funny example, aborted attempts to impress the girls' father, funny attempts to seduce the girl and take her away from each other. <br /> <br /> But after it was over there was af ill try to make this film in a much more with the mystery added, which means that once she was in the next 45-60 minutes all the more painful, the climax was "so bad its almost good CATEGORY", I mean that they were thinking when you were supposed to be tense ending, at least make some attempt to make it acceptable. <br /> <br /> film too very predictable, it is unlikely there is a scene, you can not predict, and you will not break into a spontaneous rush of laughter that , The more you see of his closest and almost starts to laugh in front of the plug. <br /> <br /> movie worth gradual decline for movies to an odd hump, except, up or down, and then quickly falls down the hill once they became friends with the girl. <br /> <br /> Most of the really bad scenes were towards the end of one film tries to be more than a run of the mill comedy, and many jokes were very very musty smell and repetition, especially the last 10-15 DISTATEFULL and fully It spoils THIS MOVIE. <br /> <br /> I have not found Tanushree Dutta pretty siren she had to play, and her acting talent in a serious matter, especially in the light of it, is not an attractive look, if you can not be HOT and cant act how long you can survive. <br /> <br /> Technically, and this film was weak, with a constant view of women and poor lighting and camera work. <br /> <br /> the song, except the title track does not fit when the song played in the 2nd half, I could feel the collective gasp from the audience. <br /> <br /> In all the movies that just plain simply because of the throw, and very low expectations. <br /> <br /> How to avoid it wont be a bad idea. <br /> <br /> And if it has to be viewed to watch on TV for free or very cheap matinee or something to be binding, if you pay the full multiplex bet you'll feel disappointed. <br /> <br /> -s many outdated jokes Razhpal YADAV, for the last 45 minutes and last 15 minutes, especially bad technically, bad songs. <br /> <br /> +/- s trying to be more than he was a regular cast (I'm happier), Tanushree Dutta. <br /> <br /> + S some good scenes to begin with, the title song, good acting and actors, except RY. <br /> <br /> the total of 4.5 / 10 (I am trying to be objective here, I do not like Razhpal Yadav or Tanushree Dutta and this film did meet a very low expectations, so I give him the preference is doubt on absolute expression of this film was no more than 4)
