For a long, long, pointless film. I am sure that, historically, this film is wonderful, but how fun is it just does not make class. Ralph Fiennes was in some science fiction films, The English Patient, Schindler's List, but this one was such a let down. It did not seem to go anywhere, his character in the beginning was so small and worried it surprises me that his "sister" would not be interesting at all ever. Do not bother to pay the rent this movie, buy a copy of The English Patient instead.
