I feel lucky to have what is known as the worst film of Steven Seagal ever made. I knew that something special when Stephen opened his mouth, and the voice of strangers came. By the middle of the movie my eyes start to hurt, and I almost fell off his chair with uncontrollable laughter. <br /> <br /> Stephen Stephen (with the ever-changing voice) and absolutely incredible in their roles (as always). Who the hell allows people with bad nappy-hair ponytail mullet in power anyway? In addition, he always writes himself in a totally incredible love interests with women at least 20 years younger than him. Supporting actors all look like they were shot in the dark - the way they shoot this film in the dark with only a torch to illuminate the finger? <br /> <br /> This is really disgusting in every way. Invite all your friends around and make a social event out of it - this one is really special.
