Have you ever, that just itching to kill an hour or two doing housework and watch a movie so bad it defies reason? Well, to rent movies in one weekend I can see the box art for this purpose, and to see the T-Rex. Knowing full well that the dinosaur on the package was T-Rex from Jurassic Park, I knew I had to take it just because I was in the mood for a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed in the least. <br /> <br /> Mad scientists, secret formulas, the company is more concerned about his fate and shareholders than life, and, of course, a large, poorly animated, sock puppet T-Rex. This is me our account of the film there was a scene clearly splicing of other films? Not to mention Rex hungry is never satisfied ... ever. As he was hungry for me, because it really has no throat (In fact, if you look at his mouth, when he roars, it is a solid ... like a toy or something). Now I like to look incredibly bad B-movies from time to time, because it reminds me of how much better the blockbuster film. This one was hilarious. I'm not even sure it was supposed to be a thriller or a comedy, because there is a scene where, not to make a mistake, you will laugh. <br /> <br /> Should I blame the budget of the film ... Yes, but the action did not help. Well, Tony Todd was actually very good, as well as for some female roles ... if you should not cry "tears" come about? Meh, I'm not angry at this film, I knew what I was getting into, and if you are looking for a bad movie to watch with your friends, that's what I recommend: watch this movie, and then immediately see Jurassic Park and then Lost World Spin to back. You will write letters of thanks to Mr. Spielberg on the next day.
