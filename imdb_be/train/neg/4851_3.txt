watch a team of experts on bomb disposal in Iraq count their time before they can return home. <br /> <br /> This in itself sounds boring. Every time a small headline came up to talk about how long they were gone, he just called this film without a plot to drag on and on. hurry up and finish my time there so we can all go home. <br /> <br /> I must be missing something. I'm a big fan of war movies, when they are done well. It was the "Jarhead" syndrome. The film, which sometimes was beautifully filmed, but the cinema does not stop him from being quite boring and pointless. <br /> <br /> And get slower mo 'rounds coming out of the cannon "shot already. they could save the money and just got a stock footage from any other movie with a gun in it. <br /> <br /> I did not have any sympathy for the main guy there, I kept hoping that it would be folly to make him die. In fact, the film would have worked much better if he had. <br /> <br /> I've read some reviews and seemed to get the impression that those who were in the military, did not like him, and everyone else loved it. I've never been able to, and I'm with them. This artsy chatter. 3 stars of cinema.
