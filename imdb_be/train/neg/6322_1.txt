It was one of the ridiculous i PREACHIEST with anti-Nuke films from the 1980s. <br /> <br /> The idea that a child and basketball star can "change the world" is rather far-fetched, considering how many "children's peace marches" and "celebrity protests" were and are. <br /> <br /> But the idea that the Soviet Union would agree to complete nuclear disarmament, because some apparatchik children learned about the "silent protest" in the west, is ludicrous. <br /> <br /> The cold war is over? America is tough, dare I say «Reaganesque» position and internal failure of socialism. It was not the world of hiking, "die-ins" or films like «Amazing Grace & Chuck», «Miracle Mile», or "will".
