Anyone who has seen the original 1970 film knows how great the cast, script and director can collect comedy masterpiece. In addition, it is easy to see how the contrast that can create another tasteless Hollywood bore-a-thon! This film was pathetic! If it were not for John Cleese (comic genius), I would have walked about 15 minutes into this awful waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> Neil Simon would not want to write another script for this version (he said that he could not improve on the first), and I am surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he did not sue for defamation of humor! <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis did such an excellent job in the original, they were manufacturers to think about when they threw it? How could the director and editor to look at these scenes, and think that any of them funny? I do not know, but one thing I know --- it's no wonder why foreign and independent films are becoming more and more popular .......
