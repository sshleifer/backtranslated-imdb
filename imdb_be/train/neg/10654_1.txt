Big hair, big boobs, bad music and a giant pin ....... these words best describe this horrible film. I love cheese and horror I saw hundreds..but it is to be of the worst ever made. The plot is paper thin and funny acting abomination scenario is ridiculous (the better end of the showdown with the police and as he worked, who the killer is just so damn badly written), clothing sick and funny in equal measure, big hair, lots of boobs rebound men wear these cut Mike, who show off their stomachs (sickening that people actually wore them !!), and the music is just garbage synthesizer that plays over and over again ... in almost every scene there is a bad musician, tits and paramedic taking the body .... and the gym had not closed !! Mourning All jokes aside, this is a really bad movie, only the beauty, to look back on the disaster, which was in the 80s and have a good old laugh at how bad it was then.
