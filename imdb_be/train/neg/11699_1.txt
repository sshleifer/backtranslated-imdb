The plot is very laconic solvent. And gross. Thick lawyer travels to a Gypsy and Gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight ... to the bone. OK, Gypsy curses should be interesting but unprofitable weight spoiled? No. Apart from Stephen King thinks so. And Michael McDowell, another horror author and screenwriter of this bottomless movie, does it, too. The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible, it is too thick, ha ha! The solvent as immature piece of shit for a man moans as he / she had nothing vile than fat seen. Hey, I can only say: Well, look in the mirror.
