If you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as a co-star, you are expecting to find a well-made horror film, but it was actually quite different, representing as it did what I would describe as an early effort in the scientific fiction. Karloff and Lugosi both play scientists (and Bennett movement, respectively) - the competition to such an extent until the NRU will not win over Benet with a demonstration of what is proving to be a great theory. Science was here - to put it mildly - a little rough around the edges (this way, science fiction, with an emphasis on fiction), but somehow movement using a beam of Andromeda, which allows him to look at the land "a few thousand million years ago," This. pre-historic times, a huge meteorite crashed in Africa, leaving deposits of matter, scientists called "Radium XÂ» - that can heal and destroy. Much of the film is set in Africa is quite tedious, in search of meteorite fields that movement eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon, unfortunately, infecting themselves with some kind of disease, which makes it great guns as well. <br /> <br /> Karloff and Lugosi were both pretty good here. Lugosi pulls a role in which he is a good guy is pretty good, although I frankly found it a bit unconvincing - especially in the scenes set in Africa. History also stretched a bit, and while he held my attention that does not captivate me. Given that this is actually a sci-fi, not a horror movie, and the sci-fi was in a very early stage, I believe, need to cut a little slack in the film. It was OK - nothing more, nor less than that. 4/10
