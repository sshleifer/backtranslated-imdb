Romanticize and thoroughly false vision of unemployment from the middle class "artist" with a comfortable upbringing ... It is clear that the author of the script and the director never suffered unemployment directly and, of course, has no personal experience of it. If you were to believe it is absolutely ridiculous story, unemployed people of all ages behave like teenagers who do not have any anger, fear or frustration, etc. All the characters live trough the day, carrying antics, boyish jokes. They never look at the work, failure to do almost never experiencing or suffering, etc. Life on the dole is something like a summer vacation from school ... Funny. Especially if you compare it to modern masterpieces like Ken Loach, etc.
