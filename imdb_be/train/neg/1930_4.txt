Some praised _Atlantis: _The_Lost_Empire_ as the Disney adventure for adults. I do not think so - at least, not for thinking adults <br /> <br /> This scenario assumes the beginning as a live-action film, which hit someone as the type of shit you can not sell more than an adult .. "Crack staff ", many old movies, adventure was made long before (think _The Dirty Dozen_), but _Atlantis_ represents one of the worst films in this motif. Symbols are weak. Even the background that each member pulls seem shares and awkward at best. MD / medical People, monkey mechanic father always wanted a son, when at least we have not seen this before, we've seen the combination and the match quirks before. The story of how one satellite, Winnie plays Don novel (Fr. Guido Sarducci), went from flower shops demolished completely unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Only the protagonist, Mila Straw young Atlantis possessed academic voiced by Michael J. Fox, has no depth to it. Search Miley Atlantis continues his grandfather, who raised him. The opening scene shows a much younger Milo giddily sat on his knee, as his grandfather puts his pith helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And while the characters were thin, at best, the best part was _Atlantis_ voice talent. Maybe Miley depth is not thicker than the charm of Fox. Commander Rourke has nothing to lose time voiced by James Garner. Although Rourke is rather a type of military actions, Garner shows his ability to breathe life into the character just deliver it. Garner vocal performance is high point. I'm sorry to say Dying King Leonard Nimoy nothing is ever required. In addition, Don novels as demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also marked by one or two well done, funny lines - but I've always loved his father Guido Sarducci, anyway. <br /> <br /> computer animation was also well done. BACKGROUND animation, ie. Animation character is not so bad for Disney with minimalism, which drove Don Bluth from the door. Character animation does nothing if you do not have to make flat characters appear even flatter. In addition to landscapes, buildings and vehicles there is not much to impress. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say that the shot down or trite. I'm not sure. Any defective portion may be something new with the correct treatment. Shakespeare often begins with the well-known story and plot, and was known only for putting on a new coat of paint. Thus, treatment thing. And _Atlantis_ clearly not enough of it. <br /> <br /> I can not go into all of the logical gaps without spoiler. The plot was bad. plot bridges in a snap, as the cords and the end does not make sense. To add to this, the script and the animation is filled with irritating nonchalance. <br /> <br /> ** spoilers ** <br /> <br /> 1. In the beginning, when Milo shows that Runic or Celtic symbols were incorrect transliteration and "coast of Ireland" should read "The coast of Iceland" , we begin to experience problems. Script writers need to know to take the British Air or Eireann as "Ireland" and completely ignore the old Latin term Hibernia. But more than that, they need to know about the Vikings conspiracy to call Green Island icier Iceland and Greenland. <br /> <br /> By doing this deal with MIS-tranliterated Â«letter," the authors condemned themselves demanding a runic version of the English language and the post-Roman date in the script. Since this long after Atlantis was moved to its underwater cave. And no apparent evidence and less technology than Miley, made the inscription is much less reliable. <br /> <br /> 2. The Journal of Shepard can not be written to the destruction of Atlantis, or he will not know anything about the cave or crystals lying "in the eyes of the King." It must have been written after the sinking, but even without technology, expedition Maile was like hell, who receive from Leviathan. Since he could know more about anything after that? And why should it be written in Atlanta? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and vision, or astral travel can explain these things. However, vision and astral travel do not require write Shepard in Atlanta. Thus, it should be some automatic writing. Since no one left in Atlantis can read, it must be crystal perfume shining posts to the surface. It would make more sense. But it can also be explained in the film: Milo could have found that this force was to call him his entire life - appeared in a dream, etc. It should be explored in the film <br /> <br /> 3., Atlanta should just not be able to understand modern languages. No one expects that the original Indo-Europeans could communicate Europe more than the Romans would have realized that the hard "c" s or their day was the French "of CH 's (pronounced as" sh "with no less!) <Br / > <br /> 4. currently Atlanteans were alive before the cataclysm - if they seem * could read, but is not able to read what they are working similar machines. <br /> <br /> 5. Mass ignorance shows a critical error in the film. Nothing seems to happen with this culture. It seems suspended in the air until Miley could not save him. Despite the fact that it seems that life is a constant struggle for survival, no one wants to write poetry or writing novels, and perhaps a combination of school systems Atlantis rolls down to the end and the lack of good fiction, which caused Atlantis to get into illiteracy. <br /> <br /> 5. Kid could be forgiven for not knowing how to read or work with the machine when she was so young when cataclysm Folly is set in - but none of IT ** almost ** qualifies her father deification !! Stupidity Kashakim in almost single-handedly wiped from existence of people. Killed a bunch in disasters, stalled progress (not much killed here, but he watched the massive slide in the culture and progress), as long as someone can take a crystal to kill everyone if they were not boiled in the lava first, because the giant robots We were there to protect them. <br /> <br /> blue bolt of electricity have been destroyed similarity Kashakim, when in the Kid tried to join a way the parents to the circle of the great kings of Atlantis! <br /> <br /> 6. While Miley was the only one who could read Atlantis Rourke and others knew enough to look through the book of nonsense and find the page on a chip - that he knew that the crystal rather than a stylized astrological or "VS phase" diagram. <br /> <br /> 7. If Milo grandfather told Rourke about it, it still does not explain that, as Rourke would have suffered from Maile read it as part of the book. Vomits page - that was dog-eared in hand Rourke, even though Miley did not find any signs of a torn page in the book is obvious - just there to tip off the audience that "something was not quite right." If the word "crystal" will have set the alarm in my head from Milo that someone tries to steal it, Miley would not suspect anything. It's just a thick-headed omen. <br /> <br /> 8. Crew "outsmart" there was no change in the character. We learned that Winnie, Sweet, Audrey and Cookie were to go along with Rourke from the outset. Nevertheless, the "change of heart" provides a flat. This change, it should be better motivated. It's hard to do with characters that do not give anything to start with. <br /> <br /> 9. bit trifling, that the lava flows up over the dome, instead of filling out the rest of the region, which we consider a sequence of. It is a liquid; it will not flow through the protective dome until it fills the entire lower area. <br /> <br /> 10. Ending stinks - and it makes no sense, but to appease political correctness. not with his restored PowerSource, Atlantis is no longer the weak force, needing to nurse. Giant robot guardians and sky blue lightning shooting cycles suggests that they have less to fear from us than they could. Technology is superior to ours, and certainly before the beginning of the 20th century. In the end, Miley has to learn to read the Atlanteans, for what? The whole idea is to leave his little quiet, necklace culture alone, not to send him to the hyperdrive. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Maybe the plot of The Lost World and installation of turn of the century have to give me a hint, it's more of a tribute to the pulp. I find the failure of the film agree with this idea. But I'm at a loss, why should I pay to see the subtle characters and plot holes, simply because many of them had a shocker. And the story is part of the flesh "crap they can not sell more adult", anyway. We have become a little more sophisticated, and our pulp needs to grow as well. Raiders of the Lost Ark has not lost any of its pulp feelings and to avoid as much harm <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 -. The film is enjoyable, but as I think about the plot, it can be traced all below.
