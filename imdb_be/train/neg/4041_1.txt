How to wear a hair shirt. Positively, absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt one of the worst movies ever. Pure torture. Zero stars out of ten. One long, tedious, complicated, pretentious, self-conscious, theatrical and pretentious leadenly scenes for others. Designed to be fabulous and impressionism, the soul naked, he, instead of depressing mess. <br /> <br /> half-naked, father and son to grope and whisper to each other like lovers. "Homo-erotic" is the point loud and clear. OK, so what? <br /> <br /> If you often more than once a son is a line supposedly rises from the "Lives of the Saints", "love crucifies his father. Loving son lets himself be crucified. "Parallel God and his Son, Christ, is the authoritative, does not matter, and pompous, like everything else here. <br /> <br /> Some of the landmarks on Russian sonship: "Mother and Son" (1997); "The Return" (Andrew Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev "Fathers and Sons"; and, of course, Dostoevsky, "The Brothers Karamazov." <br /> <br /> Loans English show is international distribution, which means that justification can not be used, you have to be Russian to understand this disorder. <br /> <br /> This is not nearly as accomplished or compelling as Sokurov's latest, "Russian Ark" (2003). <br /> <br /> As in his "Mother and Son" as a powerful sedative, some of the scenes shot of distorting mirrors, but not so interesting. The film is almost monochromatic shot from start to finish through the beige filter, making it visually, how it sharply numbness. Soft focus fog not only adds to the feeling of a narcotic. <br /> <br /> annoying soundtracks Dronov on, never ceases, as a tape loop. Old radio constantly playing in the background. Russian Romantic melancholy swells indefinitely, as "theme based on Tchaikovsky." The presence of "sound" (Sergey Moshkov) means, of course, that all these annoying little sounds, interference, noise, distortion, and those who "are.» <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe someone (Sergey Potepolov) on actually I wrote this thing. All this seems arbitrary, as a movement, as if sad improvised actors, pop out of nothingness into nothingness. <br /> <br /> Contemporary Art finally managed signifying thing, without being a thing, so that what we see is the idea of ​​ideas, empty like a shell, but not even the shell, and the shell is just an idea. You can ask for a better definition of decadence?
