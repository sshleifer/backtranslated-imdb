DVD version includes 2 episodes, Caesar's father's murder is the junction. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles. Thus, it is difficult for me to see in the depths of this film, because that because I did not understand what was said. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is a historical icon, part of a very hard, and I have found that for a beginner, Leonor Varela just playing well. She is strong-willed, but very supportive, gentle supporter. Thimothy Dalton Caesar is perfect, and the novel thing of the first episode. . Thus, it is not really a documentary, nor the Basques, but a great love story <br /> <br /> After the murder of his father, the new lover comes (Marc-Antoine), but the flavor disappears: we always remember our first love. Thus, I found the second episode of the dim and their tragic fate of Sun said powerfully <br /> <br /> However, the production of luxury :. Sets of large, tastefully decorated; Moroccan living arrangement of exotic and gorgeous cabinets. Manufacturers have a lot of money, of course, but they do not spend on special effects. They are so poor (blue screens, ships, Sphinx), it's funny. <br /> <br /> In the end, I would very much like to hear it in French or English, to make a final opinion on these two films.
