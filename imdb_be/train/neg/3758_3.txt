When I first saw this movie, I thought it would be a good movie Snow. Usually, if you have these types of films do ONE Snow, but in this, that is, how? 7 or 10 of them?. Acting was good, the area was good, I loved the scene where Sasquatch kills several first victims, a very good camera work. I expected that it will be a bloody film, but it was very small. This movie was a lot better than Snow. Channel SCI-FI really need to make more snow movies, I mean, I really loved Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal was not a good one, I consideration in order, but the film Sasquatch was not, but I do not see that so let me return to the the right way. This film is good for a rainy day Saterday, but also for any other cases not.
