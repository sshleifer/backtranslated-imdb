I kind of feel like a genius; I feel like I'm the only one who saw through this fake movie. I watched it three times, once with the comments, and I found that to be irritated at all only obscures the close-up, all the time of the screen, and worst of all, I feel that the film never solve anything. Thus, the priest dies, but he does not really seem to be at peace with the city that gave him so much grief, or with himself. That he was an idiot. If there were no comments by Peter Cowie, who is due to not only the movie, but the book it came from, I would not be able to digest it all. I love French films, but it is one that was completely absurd. <br /> <br /> Diary of a Country Priest shot in beautiful black and white photography, but that alone can not save this mortal stupid scar. Scene after scene of extreme close-up, where the characters do not say anything, as long as the camera cuts away and goes to darken do not interesting or relevant history. As this film someday become a classic incredible: it reminds me more than the emperor's new clothes <br /> <br /> So, the performance of Claude Laida is the heart and food for thought, if you're a sadist, but this film does not remain. I feel empty, because in general, a weak impression of the Catholic clergy, which is shameful and ignominious corruption institution. triumph over the pride of the young priest Countess weak scene, but 90% of the movie will pull you down with his bleak introspection and a window into the gloomy thoughts of the young priest. This priest does not come across so much as to be modest as it does just pathetic. <br /> <br /> Given that I do not speak French and did not understand, I look forward to doing English subtitles thing to help understand the movie. Well, the English subtitles are sometimes impossible to watch / read the text and slides so quickly that there was a lot I could not read (and I do not particularly slow reader - I just finished Dostoyevsky in 3 days). <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie. I try all the "reverse" the criterion collection, and yet I can not understand why, in many respects, this one deserves some critical nod. Nevertheless, I sat through this film is a taut two hours to feel some empathy with the main character, and he has never materialized. He just seemed to be a victim, not a fighter. And for that, I say it's smelly.
