OK, the window looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg, standing next to Danny Glover parodies the famous farmer and his wife painting. Then you pop this baby in the DVD-player and all hope is lost for less than five minutes. It supposed to be a comedy. And I must admit, I laugh just ten minutes before the end. This film has the following elements: beaten and abused neighbor, boring process, racisim, talk of lynching and death and arson. Hilarious, is not it? No, please, if you never listen to anyone's reviews, please here. You can not even bring myself to watch this crap. Shit! I've said it, Shit! Whoever put there name on it should really sue.
