I rented this DVD is for two reasons. The cast of great actors and the director, but Robert Altman can be hit or miss. In this case, it was a big mistake. Altman's attempt to create uncertainty fell on him keester. After watching Kenneth Branagh in a good film like Â«Dead Again", I do not think that it could contribute to a turkey, and I hope that this will not spoil his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen on the rails single most Oscar winners. On a downward spiral, which includes acting in eating money of films like this. Duval was once a great actor in a great movie, despite the fact that his best performance was "Tender Mercies," but "The Great Santini." This film was really a big waste of time. I give him 2 to 10.
