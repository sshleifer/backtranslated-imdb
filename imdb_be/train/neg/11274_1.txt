Just so that you fellow film fans get the point of this film, I decided to write another review. I missed a few things for the last time ... <br /> <br /> In the first scenario. Secondly, Actions. Third, Jesus Christ, that they thought that makes a piece of garbage like this, and then waiting for us to enjoy it, if you are unable to redeem any event from start to finish, except when Joseph Fiennes, finally gets blown off very uninteresting climax !!! <, Br /> <br /> I can not believe I wasted my money on this, if I could give it to a homeless person or a street musician or something! <br /> <br /> You get the picture?
