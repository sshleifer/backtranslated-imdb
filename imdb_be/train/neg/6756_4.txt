Devin Hamilton, probably better known as the new name in the legendary entertainment Full Moon. Unfortunately, his visit to the independent studio has occurred at a time when the budget and production values ​​are at the lowest level in recent years. However, in his short career, Hamilton established himself as a creative director, who manages to make the inventive and original stories. Now, this does not mean that his films are good, but at least they are different from normal in the horror genre. <br /> <br /> In his debut, «Bleed», Hamilton presents us with a creative twist on the cutter sub genre. Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a young woman who finally gets a job of their dreams. Not only this, but it seems to me that she, too, found a friend in the Shona (Danny Wolske), it seems that life is finally smiling on Maddie, after many unfortunate events. As long as at a party with friends, Sean, they do not tell her that they have created a "club", where the participants have to kill someone to enter. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that they were joking, but Maddy desperately wants to fit in, it actually kills someone. After this event, someone begins to kill the other members of the "club", one after another. it to Maddy to find out what was going on, no one could be a killer, including her. <br /> <br /> Maddie is a very interesting character plays perfectly beautiful Debbie Rochon. This is an interesting twist on the genre to have a lead actress as part of the suspects. The concept is so original and Rochon performance is so good that it's a real shame that Hamilton was formed entirely the whole story a little better. The film feels a bit slow at times and the overall feeling is one of the good ideas wasted on a bad film. <br /> <br /> rest of the cast amazing in the sense that all the female cast is very good, while the male cast hurts bad. Denis Wolske awfully wooden and his performance as a rather stereotypical yuppie. Julie Strain, Brink Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman appears in small cameo, and excellent in their small roles. In addition, there is a lot of nudity (both male and female) and the cast looks very good, so this is really a plus. <br /> <br /> It hurts the low-budget film in the department of effects, as very few bloody scenes and is not really a graphic (probably because they look bad); Nevertheless, taking into account budget, the film is at least looks good. <br /> <br /> Hamilton later efforts, the sexploitational enterprise "Delta Delta Die!», it is better developed and the whole film funnier. Although this one is not as bad as other more famous films, he still has a lot of shortcomings, and may be of interest only to fans of Debbie Rochon or fans of independent NO-budget films. 4/10
