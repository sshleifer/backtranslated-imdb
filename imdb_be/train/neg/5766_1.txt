It was believed that the flagship operation of the open source code, something that would stand up and shout in the worlds media to pay attention, we do not get stuck in the trap of marketing with our options in the production of fine work with the tools open source. After download the basic version (fans living here on the modem) finally got here I hit the first snag. Media Player, Mplayer and Winamp Classic unable to access it on my XP box, and then Totem, Xine and Kaffeine unable to access it on my SuSe server. Mplayer managed to run it flawlessly. The transition will be difficult to spread the word about this, when ordinary users can not even open ... <br /> <br /> film. Great soundtrack, great lighting, studio camera work and flawless texture. It looked real. And then the two main characters moved .... and said ... And the film died for me. All but the lip-sync animation and the actual two main characters (for Proog in the dance scene, with the exception of) looked fluid and fully alive. The two main characters are animated so bad that sometimes I was wondering if there is any game on the market at the moment with cutouts scenes that entail less realistic than that. <br /> <br /> Any frame in the movie fantastic .. as a frame, and the thing is great, if not the actors move. I'm so glad that I do not really recommend it to anyone. I would ruin my reputation. <br /> <br /> Yes, Final Fantasy was more followable and intricacies of the plot. <br /> <br /> This film received 10 stars if it were not for the tragedy, which sits directly on the screen.
