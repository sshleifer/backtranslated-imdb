"Hak Hap", or "Black Mask" (in English) was a disappointment. I was told that it was a kind of "Japanese version of the Matrix." Imagine my disappointment. The film was either poorly covered or soundtrack so good times with the film. Another thing is that the dialogue was largely bad. There was very little thought put in the English version of this movie, and it refers only to the "senseless acts" of the genre. Not a movie I wanted to see again.
