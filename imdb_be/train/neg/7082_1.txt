Well, I wrote a scathing review b / horror film. I was expecting another review (Derrida) my pop, I decided to check out the old reviews of this terrible film. Look at all the positive reviews. They are all, I say all, come from investors is not appreciated any other film than this. Crimminy! and wait for you to "bud" [sic] review. <br /> <br /> Checkout other films Rosebud inspection and had glowing recommendations. Oh, shoot! They will be common for two other films on writers and directors. Holy Window-wiper Batman. <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, you suck as a writer, and Tony, could you send a bad scenario. No job for you! <br /> <br /> Always check positive feedback for low-RATED MOVIES!
