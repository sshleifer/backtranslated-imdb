Please keep in mind: This film, although quite a bad story, was one of the worst movies I have ever seen ... EVER. Just remember that before settling on the couch enjoying a movie. <br /> <br /> So, officially begins with one of the parties. Just average party, but there is a guy there. It's pretty to Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. Remember his face; This will help later. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Kate comes out to find George Clooney (I did not say that the plot was bad?), and therefore picks up the phone. This London Underground in the middle of the night, but she's just stupid like that. Thus, the schedule says the following, and finally, the train will come in 7 minutes. Now Kate dumb party girl, she decides that she can take a nap in a spare 7 minutes. As a rule, she misses the train and finds himself trapped in a London subway. Alone. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the film simply carries out. Blood, guts, limbs, even some parts of the body, I will not mention would be cut and slashed and eventually amputated from the body <br /> <br /> In short, this is a typical horror. beautiful, but fat servant women distress type and disease awesome psycho. Or, as the case may have it, Creep. <br /> <br /> I'd say give it a go if you are in Saw, Hostel or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but for the rest of us, shouting to satisfy a condition of terror have to thank you very much.
