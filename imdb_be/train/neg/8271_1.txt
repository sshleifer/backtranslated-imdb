"Nice guys with a bad haircut !!" "Beautiful girls without any Clues !!" "Dull gangsters, who can not shoot straight !!" With Dragon Dynasty comes gangster drama Hong Kong, "Dragon Heat". For reasons that will probably forever will be completely closed, production and casting for the film "criminals-on-steroids" somehow I got like Maggie Q and Michael Biehn sign villains. But they do not get all that much to do in this terrible cork festival. <br /> <br /> They're two of the best actors around today, each with their own CV "and a list of achievements, and Biehn in particular, had the courage to take some fairly complex and heroic roles. <br /> <br /> Maggie Q was "Mai super-bad" in the "Live Free Or Die Hard,» yes' Nuff said. <, Br /> <br /> Bien, of course, is known for the fact that soldiers from the future-that made "Terminator" in 1984 a plausible science fiction / fantasy romp by crashing against the Grand Arnold, who now Governator of California! ! <br /> <br /> Michael Biehn is almost completely lost in this terrible train-wreck of a police drama. There's absolutely no reason for this as an incredibly twisted plot - given mostly in Chinese, as is the history of Hong Kong - could be better designed for non-Chinese audience with a foreign narrator <br /> <br. /> In other words, when Bien used as something like Interpol or the coordinator of the observer, or an agent under deep cover, which should get some «splaining given to him every five or ten minutes, that would be great. But no, he gave as part of an odd group of special forces such as the bad guys, who seem to be freelancing their own corrupt deals in the middle of someone else totally corrupt deal with the participation of the local king of corrupt deals. <br /> <br /> Yes, I said it all. Confused? So do I. "Welcome to the party, pal." <br /> <br /> In a truly wonderful crime drama Hong Kong, known by its English name as «Breaking News», there are also a number of interesting characters at work, but this is just one story line in the story. <br /> <br /> The bad guys against good cops. In this pathetic and overly rigid foray into the light of Hong Kong's triad or gang, it seems that the police force hot shots a little more than a parade duck in a shooting gallery, as criminals to mow them down. <, Br /> <br /> So, not surprisingly, that it is almost inconceivable otherwise the scene (a few scenes, in fact), where children try to shoot wood ducks in an arcade game to win prizes of stuffed animals. And so hot shot police officers a good guy is only natural intervene on their behalf, so that the owner of the arcade should abandon Kewpie doll. <br /> <br /> There's also a half-hearted attempt to create a "love interest" between one of the "visiting cops" and the only female "visits to police." <br /> <br /> business ments should be material witnesses against triad gang leader that gets stolen on the way to his court appearance, but not by his own team, but the mercenaries (Bien, Maggie Q, and some others). These killers all want to do something, but we do not get to know that it is up to the very end of the movie !! It was a stupid mistake in the overall story. <br /> <br /> You can not create intrigue in the crime drama without something to receive, or to obtain, or escape from, introduced very early in history. <, Br /> <br /> Add to this some of the "scene Business Cards" done purely fanciful effects, shows that all that is bad bad guys and the bad guys of regular past the past, and any fan of the movie, you can easily understand why this barking dog gets 1 ranking from this fan of all things cinematic criminals and conspirators, and Hong Kong.
