I'm a huge, huge fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, and Shalhoub. I'm a little less loved Stephen King, but I like some of his work. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I should have liked to 1408. <br /> <br /> *** Possible SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT **** <br /> <br /> I walked in impatient. I left disappointed. <br /> <br /> It's not the actors fault. Shalhoub and Jackson both have a very small role, as the premise of the film, Cusack puts in the "guy in a locked room" scenario. <br /> <br /> It was not a bad movie, but I can not call him anything good friend. It was muddied mess that had moments of "Uche, that's just wrong," combined with moments of "Uche, it just hurts," and moments, "Oh, now it's just an accident" with very little continuity bond between them. Father Eislin shows once, and there is no apparent connection with the rest of the personal life Mike, what we see is reflected while he tries to survive in the room. <br /> <br /> In the previous commentator described Olin / Enslin argument is worth watching, and I very much agree.

We have never seen evil defeated, although we can assume, maybe it was a defeat. <br /> <br /> And the ending is just a concussion, "What?!" moment. <br /> <br /> Wait for him to come to the cable. I would not mind paying for it, as a matinee, but I feel a little cheated for paying the price of opening night for him.
