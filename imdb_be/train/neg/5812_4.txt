"This story is dedicated to women," according to the introduction, "who are fighting for their rights, since Adam and Eve began to loose-leaf system." If the "Policy" was filmed, Nineteenth Amendment, which guarantees women the right to vote, was only only ten years ago. and the film deals with the political arms of women power as a voting group. By advocating prohibition speakeasies and closing, was a major problem for women at the time. <br /> <br /> Good-natured Marie Dressler (as Hattie Burns ) becomes politically active, after young woman shot out of the Speakeasy. She wants to close the joints of liquor sold and prepared in Mayoral prospects, after delivering a strong speech in the women's rally. Ms. Dressler supports its people, best friend Polly Moran (like Ivy Higgins) and her husband . stuttering Roscoe Ates (as Peter Higgins) Dressler run for mayor of Lake city has attracted opposition from the men in the city, so, Dressler instructs women to strike, denying them "all" in the "living room, bedroom and bathroom." <br /> <br /> The film sounds much better than it turned out. Humor, frankly, not very good; and it has some unfunny and moderately offensive situation ( "You look like a Madame Queen" refers to the character of Amos and Andy). And mixing shootings and farce do not mix well at this time. Manufacturers could be considered to make the film more dramatic, focusing exclusively on the characters played by Dressler and William Bakewell (Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (as Myrtle Burns). <br /> <br /> **** Policy (7/25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
