Encouraged by the positive comments about this movie on here I'm looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I've seen 950+ movies, and it's really one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, going, plot, 'acting out', the soundtrack (movie only song - a lame country tune - played no less than four times) . The film looks cheap and nasty and boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so glad to see the end credits of the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevents me from giving it 1-by Harvey Keitel - while it is far from his best performance, he, at least, seems to make a little effort. One only possessed Keitel.
