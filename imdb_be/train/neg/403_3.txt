Another strong, angry fantasies of Paul Verhoeven. Supreme mystery: it's hard to say whether he accepts his baser impulses seriously, with caustic intentions or works in oblivion. He also seems to be fully aware of the fact that all the brilliant visual effects in the world (and it has some great ones) can not hide the negligence of the story, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who discovered the invisibility and uses it to drive themselves to moral bankruptcy. Bacon is usually likable actor who sometimes shows its dark side ( `The River Wild") in an attempt to compensate for his boyish looks, given the material, however, Bacon was not enough hate to make the rest of the school's director Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin. none of which is endowed with enough to make a solid impression, and who, if forced to put a stupid dialogue, confusing themselves. The culmination of the study outweigh and unbelief should really be stopped.
