I was totally amped to see this movie. I've been waiting a year for it to be cleaned up here in New Zealand. I should not have built myself so much because it was so disappointing and, without doubt, the worst movie Clarke There is so much wrong with this film. Firstly, some great action, in particular Nick Stahl as a "bully" and a girl with curly brown hair (I can not remember her name), but most of them were so torn and incredibly unbelievable, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He's a veteran Clark movies now, and he was so brilliant in «Kids», but «Bully» he puts his lines with such solemnity, to turn it into a parody scene almost. The script felt like it was written in the first year of a student film. Sorry lot, a high school student ... the one who had never seen a film before. And I could not understand Clark's intentions. He tried to point out a meaningless existence of these children? He sure as hell did not prevent him to get in a hell of a good PERV. I'm not a prude, but I do not need to see the teen breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still maintain that the best film of Clark "Another day in paradise." It's fantastic and I do not think he ever top it.
