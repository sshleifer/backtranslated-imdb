Shirley Jackson novel "Ghosts Hill HouseÂ» is an atmospheric tale of terror, which transmits supernatural phenomena, in an old mansion. The atmosphere is well laid out, and ants are good. Pursues a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> In 1963 intercooler "Phantom" is close to the book, but adds its own plot details. Fortunately, it is very small, and therefore the fear of the book and a shiver run even better on the screen. Black and white picture only adds to the horror film. Excellent! <br /> <br /> And then Jan de Bont did it. In 1999, a remake of the Ghosts hit the cinemas - if you could call it a remake. Why did they have to do a remake of one thousand nine hundred sixty-three film is a mystery in itself, but for the moment, lets look at the same film. <br /> <br /> It starts on average, like most horror movies. The set is used to Hill House is beautiful, mysterious and strange, and within a few minutes, it seems that the film will actually be quite a fair paraphrase. And then, the first fear comes: free harpsichord wire slash a woman's face (assistant doctor in the bone marrow). It's fun, and, in truth, he was almost in tears me. <br /> <br /> Since then, the film is simply spiraling downwards. The action seems to be getting a bit of wood, as the film goes with the character of Owen Wilson be particularly annoying (so it's such a relief when he beheaded the chimney). <br /> <br /> special effects make this movie almost ,, which is a shame, because most of them are incredibly cheesy and looks very outdated. Examples of such a lot, so I will not bother listing them. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, I, along with hundreds of others, we strongly recommend you to see original chiller, or alternatively buy a Shirley Jackson novel. But please, stay away from it. And, if you choose to look at it, look at the TV screen (as many channels like screen this film, rather than the original), or rent it cheap, but please do not buy it, what you are doing. ! Do not waste your money <br /> <br /> Final rating: 4/10
