At first the film, on the spot said to have won the "Best Film" at the "Worldfest" Film Festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm had a quiet year. <br /> <br /> I would not call it the worst film ever, but it certainly sucks pretty much the same as scary as another Australian B grader «Body Melt», but, at least, the film did not look like it was shot on HI 8 video. <br /> <br /> I think the filmmakers, watched a lot of movies TROMA, and very bad B Class Gore movies, thinking that they, too, may crack in the business of releasing the film. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I like very low-class films, just the fact that some of the characters put on a fake American accent, almost as if it will give them a better chance to sell it in the states or something. In fact, the disappointment ends just confrontation would be way more exciting, and some good action scenes. You can totally see that the filmmakers are trying to copy "Bad Taste" with all car bombings, rocket launcher, and an infinite number of people shot, but in the final is not enough any over the top humor or style as "bad taste" . <br /> <br /> When you see how really bad movies gore, or are interested in any off-budget filmmaking, watch, or stay away.
