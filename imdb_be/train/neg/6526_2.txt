Hopelessly inept and dull film in which the characters are standing around in the room or space ship and talk endlessly. You might think all would revive when they explore Mars, but these scenes are removed through heavy red / orange filter that makes everything very muddy. Martian landscape / vegetation consists mainly of images and monsters completely unconvincing. There are echoes of the "Bride of the Monster", when the heroine carefully wraps octopus like tentacles into flesh eating plants around it before starting thrashing about, the difference is that the film Ed Wood, a hundred times more interesting. Better wear earplugs when viewed differently in the "sci-fi" score, repeated endlessly, will drive you crazy. If you find yourself unable to sleep one night just to slip this into your VCR and your insomnia will be cured in no time.
