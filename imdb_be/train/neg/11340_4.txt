This is definitely one of the strangest films ever made - even for Fellini. On just one more surprising is that it SATYRICON. This two and a half hours to travel through a strange nightmare world of decadence, wealth and sexual problems. Sutherland makes a surprising unsightly Kazan and odd goings on a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the autobiography of the great lover not to attract the audience. Art direction and costume design, but OUTSTANDING. Academy diverged even appointed the former, but it made her fairness Oscar award for the latter. Well appointed (oddly enough), it was disjointed, senseless and almost inaccessible by CEM. Go figure it out !! The film on video is a total of 150 minutes, 16 minutes short of the original running time. This audience was grateful.
