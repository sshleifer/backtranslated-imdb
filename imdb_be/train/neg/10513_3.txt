This film was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time. I generally like cheap horror type of monster, but the movie was a disappointment. The main drawback is the lack of explanation for being. When they entered the house and found that the man he could have explained to them in rent. He did not actually say anything about them except that they had killed his parents, and if I have not missed something did not say how he managed to escape somewhere ... Not to mention the fact that it does not give any hints or the reason why the only survivor remain, and in fact nourish creature after his apparent death. It would seem that it would have had an opportunity to leave behind "cross the incident."
