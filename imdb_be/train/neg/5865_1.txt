I can not say enough bad things about this train wreck. This is one of the few movies I've ever been tempted to come out of. It was a bad assumption to begin with, the first pregnant man, but then they tried to make a parody. That they substitute all these real men pregnant ??? It was the worst movie I have ever seen. When it was a sufficient number of votes would be at the bottom of IMDB 100. If you could give him a zero, I would, and I'd still feel like I gave him too much credit.
