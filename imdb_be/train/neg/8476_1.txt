this movie was terrible ... the basis for the movie. first of all, the casting may be better; Katelyn protagonist was nothing like her TV mom. <br /> <br /> In addition, the plot was pathedic. it was very cliche and predictable. the end it was very disappointing and the cheese. (But that's all I'll say about it). <br /> <br /> nail in the bag, though, was the scene when Caitlin (Jordan Hinson) was supposed to cry, but she could not cry on command! there were no tears streaming down her face, only a few incredibly sobs. it is not a dynamic actress at all. she gave a fake laugh identical Hillary Duff on The Lizzie McGuire Movie (sp?). then when the movie came out with not so good, just bad. it did look like it works. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: this film was very bad! is a kind of mixture of each child movie cliché of the 1990s, it all bothered - worse <br /> <br /> I give it the «F», because it was so damn hard to sit through (b / t / b, I was babysitting when I saw it). <br /> <br /> However, you can, as this is when your 9 or under. ;)
