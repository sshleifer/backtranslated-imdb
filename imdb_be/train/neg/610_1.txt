I bought this movie on the cheap sale, having read the back of the DVD case and assuming that somehow I can not lose that once was rubbish then lossless if it was good, the bargain ... <br /> <br /> Then I watched it ... <br /> <br /> I'm usually not a supporter of Christopher Walken, but in this film he commanded very little presence on the screen, do not seem to do much of anything, even the death of his friend closer to the top that sparkles from the "action" in the plot seems to affect it very little, and its possible place just a sad and dramatic. <br /> <br /> Usually, the film, which has the theme as grand as the revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and fettered them feel something for the characters, but watch this movie felt like seeing a number of intricate and almost random events, which are weakly linked to each other direction, you will eventually conclude ... <br /> <br /> at this point I started to cry ... <br /> <br /> I thought that this film was the most horrible painful lump view I eve g were subjected, on the stage where the pilot sacrifices itself, refusing to jump explosive loaded cargo IR due to not wanting to kill civilians is not so tragically sad as it is unnervingly horrible and painful, though not quite as bad as emergency surgery on a wounded girl. The current round was poor, the script and the story was weak, "action" was even weaker, and "visuals" were, but just not all that visual. In summary there are movies that are good movies that are bad movies that are so bad they are good movies, horrible ... <br /> <br /> And then a whole new level, "McBain"
