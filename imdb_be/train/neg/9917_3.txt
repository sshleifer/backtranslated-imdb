If the husband-to-be Stanwyck is killed before the wedding, she retreats to a mountain hut, where she slips (sort of) with rocks and saved a wealthy lawyer Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her, which leads to a determined one-sided marriage, held on the huge estate in Chicago (which seems to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck tempts excellent Cortes, but eventually returned to Morgan, in a very depressed and unconvincing resolution history. <br /> <br /> This film has a great cast (Morgan, in particular, one of my favorites) and a great director, but the script is tortuous and it seems pointless at times. I was so ready to enjoy this film, but I was ultimately disappointed. However, you should look at the actors, and it is good for those who love the movies of the 1930s.
