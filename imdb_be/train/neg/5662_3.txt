When I read most of the other comments, I felt that they were too lights for this film. I found that completely lost the spark found in previous films Datoiti and just goes to prove that, after a long absence from the screen, it is often better just to let things be. I fully agreed with the Star Trek analogy from another reviewer who compared the film in FIRST Star Trek original series --- to millions of excited fans waiting and waiting and waiting for the return of the show and had to look bland and sterile approach of the original. <br /> <br /> plot sometimes incomprehensible, it's terrible mountain (although lately NEW Zatoichi by Takeshi beatniks much more bloody) and lacks the heart of the originals. I do not mind the blood at all, but some of them can be turned off by it (especially the scene with the severed nose and chopped off their heads). In addition, the time was not good Ichi - he seems to be broken and boring person in this film (much, much more than usual) - and this is what fans of the series do not really want to see <br />. <br /> It was a sorry return to Datoiti. If you do not like me and want to see every Datoiti film, this is one very skipable. See one of the earlier versions or 2003 ALL-new version.
