** SPOILERS ** I rented "Tesis" (or "thesis" in English) on the strength of these efforts Amenabar directed «The Others». Based on that brilliantly measured and terribly effective creepfest, the film was, I assumed his previous efforts would be of the same quality, and I was in the mood for some good horror. Instead, I wound up with the most tedious, ridiculous excuse for a lame noisy chopper movie I saw a German film «Anatomie» (it reminded me a native). <br /> <br /> plot potential, but it is thrown in the first 20 minutes. It revolves around an innocent-n-pretty psychology student Angela (Ana Torrent - is Jessica Harper deadringer) thesis on violence in films. A few far-fetched circumstances are too stupid to go into here, it will be completed in the possession of "snuff" tape in which two men torture, maim and kill a young girl for the camera. Angela and her horror-fan friend Chema (Fele Martinez), both still in shock belts intrigued and decide to get to the bottom of who is responsible for it. <br /> <br /> This leads to ... well, nothing. <br /> <br /> They never give reasons for why they want to find the killers of women (as they resolutely refuse to go to the police for any of the unfolding events, even if their own lives are in danger) and the very mystery as limp as Graham Norton in a room full of bunny girls. There is only one correct "key" (the type of camera used to detect the killer), and it is) very weak and b) set out for the first 20 minutes. The rest of the so-called "key" is simply going through blind luck, more absurd plot twists and kill those terrible, transparent and thoroughly pointless red herring, which are thrown in just to inflate out of work time. <br /> <br /> Seriously - Amenabar can know your stuff about ghosts, but he had clearly not read a detective book in his life. The key to a good whodunnit is a large cluster of potential suspects and eliminate them one by one with a reasonable deduction and the gradual opening of more and more evidence before moving in for the final twist. In "Tesis" * POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD * identity of the murderer is guessed correctly dilettante "detectives" almost instantly, and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying to do nothing, to throw us off the smell, until he runs out of ideas, throwing his hands up and says, "Good I got mine, it was after all "as well as for any kind of logic or motive for the crime - no such luck. You are looking at the wrong movie, if that's what you're after. <br /> <br /> The only thing that attracts "Tesis" down away from just being stupid, poorly written thriller, it is actually trying to do some funny tangled up "point" about violence in the movie. I have no idea what position he is trying to take on this subject, but seems determined to cram in Washington misinformed, confusing psychobabble, among other nonsense, and say, "look at me! I am a political! ". The final scenes, in which the "point" of the film allegedly killed at home completely absurd and frivolous, one can not help but wonder if Amenabar feels awkward Now, when he watches it. If he does not, he certainly should. This is a common "Amateur Night grinder home" stuff. <br /> <br /> In general, I can not believe I spent two hours (he felt that at least six) to it, just hoping that something might happen. Urban legend "Snuff" (and it's basically all of them, in spite of how this movie is trying to offer them their native criminal phenomenon sweeping the world!) Is an area that can be used as seductive in a good horror movies ( "Videodrome," anyone?), but it is so easy to cross the line into childish "there would be great if the area with it (ie:!" My Little Eye ») ...« TESIS »strikes consistently low for a "snuff film" genre. At each level, it is one better left dead and buried. I will give it 1 out of 10, for some nice light, but that's all he gets.
