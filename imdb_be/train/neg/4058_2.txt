From the beginning, you know how this movie ends. It is so full of cliches your typical member of the NRA would not even like this movie. I give 2 out of 10, only because of the actions of William Benton. I can not believe that people have voted for this film 6+. This is so biased to "a certain point of view" (once a thief ...). People are not born bad. They also are not born good. They are born with a clean sheet. This society, parents and education that makes them who they are. And if they take a wrong turn somewhere down the line, it certainly will not be the American prison system that gets them back on track! In any case, avoid this film like the plague. I bet you have better things to do with your time than spend it on this piece of shit. <br /> <br />
