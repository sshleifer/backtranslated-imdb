Can I give it a minus rating? No? Well, let me say that this is the most disgusting movie I have ever tried to watch. It was painful. Boringus Maximus. The site (?) Well hidden in several sub-levels of the nebula. I made this film with a friend and, after about thirty minutes, hoping that it will be better, we decided to "fast forward" a little bit to see if things will get better. It never gets better. This film is about some dude getting abducted the two girls sound interesting, but actually, it's just boring. Nothing even remotely interesting ever happens. If you ever get a chance to watch it, do yourself a favor, try "PLAN NINE out of space" instead.
