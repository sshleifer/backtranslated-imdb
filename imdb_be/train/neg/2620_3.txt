After watching the 1996 remake, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Ville to receive her punishment for the torture of animals just for their skin. The whole movie was pretty fun, and in my opinion, better than animated. But there was really no need for another. First of all, if Cruela returns to cure her and make her mad again. Just get her to break away from the prison, and it's a rap. I thought it was very funny. It should have only one original puppy back. I expected him to be lucky, because he was the most attractive, and besides, with Roger and Anita ago too. Nevertheless, they decided to have a complete rework and the addition is not really a hundred, even a hundred and two, but three puppies, and a parrot who thinks he's a dog (smart). part of Gerard Depardieu was pointless. In the end, Cruella is suffering too much, too humiliating and too exaggerated to be true. She gets baked inside a giant pie. It was a desperate attempt at physical humor, trying to simulate the same effect as the first. It just does not work. It was too much over the top, and not too funny. I'm really sorry about Cruella.
