This film is about a Japanese woman who is obsessed with calligraphy on the skin. <br /> <br /> The story is absolutely amazing. I do not see any "sensitive" or "erotic" undertones. The plot turns an ancient art form in fetish pornography. In addition, the scenes shot in Hong Kong, of course, drawing the bad parts of Hong Kong, such as the airport in the city center, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the film, I continue to think that «The Pillow Book» offends Japanese culture and Hong Kong media. <br /> <br /> «The Pillow Book» is distorted, but boring film. Seriously, stay away from him.
