Varietal types (1996, dir. Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists are surprised when their cargo will hold live dinosaur. Commandos CSKA now have to think fast, if they want to prevent the extinction of the human race, not a reptile. <br /> <br /> You look at the cover, and you get your first impressions of the film. This is pretty much it. Valid only acceptable from a few signs. The history of the poor, with all the films based on the Army and Marine Corps, which is trying to kill the dinosaur. This film was released three years after "Jurassic Park." Instead, this film looks came out 13 years before "Jurassic Park." Dinosaurs costumes are so poorly made, and I mean the costumes. There are obviously people are dressed, and this film makes no attempt to hide it. The scene where the dinosaur running down the hall, created in such a way, in which he looks like someone coming creature. That's one good thing that comes out of this film. Short-time work. At only 1 hour and 15 minutes, it does not waste too much of your life, but still try to avoid it altogether. <br /> <br /> Â«It's like Friday the 13th Nightmare." - Officer (Brian Currie)
