Very disappointing film based on the novel by James Michener. <br /> <br /> Even worse was the performance of Marlon Brando. Its southern long was ridiculous. I have found that laughing as he spoke, he sounded like an old lady southern coming home to roost. Brando, so great in previous films, there has been reduced to a laughing stock. Tyrone Power in "Witness for the Prosecution" have been nominated for best actor, not Brando here. <br /> <br /> The film deals with racism, an attempt to deal with the US government to avoid marriages between American soldiers and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando was a straight face throughout the film. His movement with anti-this relationship to one happens when he finds love with an Asian woman. His emotions and saying it was difficult to understand how he could support such new species. <br /> <br /> Only the Lord knows why the red buttons and Miyoshi Umki received supporting Oscars for their performances. Nothing about the performance was not as impressive. Umeki the appearance on the screen was short and without a lot of things depicted on her part. Best performance in this film was made Miike So, he did well as a love interest Brando. She showed much emotion as anti-American, who found love with the character of Brando. Her face was etched unhappiness she had for the loss of his father and brother in World War 11. She understood that her dance was not her way out of this life, that she lives. <br /> <br /> Martha Scott went from mother Hebrew Yochobel in the "Ten Commandments" to the fanatical mother's love interest in the first Brando. Her performance with the one of Montalbano was wasted. Patricia Owens as first love Brando showed depth and conviction in her performance.
