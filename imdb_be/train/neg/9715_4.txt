This program is really overestimated. Detective as temper Danny Pino would be transferred to a "rubber gun" squads of years ago. The whole team consists of sanctimonious egomaniacs, who judge those whose actions are a decade ago by the standards of 2007, each of the Vietnam veteran character they have ever had turned the killer, if it was not another Vietnam veteran. There was only one black killer, and he was put on him his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was "dew traitor" who has killed another Hispanic to Hispanic Homeless frame for a crime (of course), two rich white kids committed. Which is a bunch of propaganda. Hey, writers: minorities and poor people commit murder, too. Only on this show are the most high-end white-killers. <br /> <br /> In addition, arrests of people in their 70s, 80s and 90s for the crimes they have committed 50-60 years ago, a joke. DA no real life would not insist on killing each other, because it means that the state will be delayed one Humongous medical bills until they finally push. The State will do their families and insurance companies service. The prosecutor would just beg them of manslaughter, and they will not serve a day. Only the really old offenders who go to jail, or organized crime or former Nazis, whose high-profile convictions increase of rennet career.
