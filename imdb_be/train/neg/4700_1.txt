I totally hated the movie. It was so retarded. They need to get some acting lessons .... no wait, that does not help, because people Naked Brothers band brakes. You know why I'm here, though I'm a hater Naked Brothers Band? In order to warn people before they watch a silent film, so that the NBB does not receive money from him so that they can not do more amateur silly songs that are so backward that any old guy could go and write it down for 10 seconds. Not only the lyrics backward, they sing badly. Well, I kind of landing a movie here ..... in any case, it was sad, and they acted badly. It was not funny, even if they tried very hard to be. I believe that they deserve credit for that ... Well, the film is not worth your time. Just look at his rating. The film (and the series) is very painful to look at those with even half a brain. Seriously, if you like, you have to go to watch movies where the actors actually act and not to talk of their lines monotone. I'm on the drama club at my school, and some people there are actually better than those guys Nat and Alex. Hurry, before it's too late! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece of poopie. I do not even know why I was even half of the film. I do not think he even deserves to be called a movie ...
