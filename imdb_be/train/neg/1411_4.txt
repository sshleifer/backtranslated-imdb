This film was a great first time I saw him, when it was called "Lost in Translation." But somehow Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson has become a strange Latino woman plays Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan turned to Carson, California. Instead, meaningful conversations and silence we used in the translation, we get meaningless ranting of 10 points, bordering on annoying. Instead of characters that were thoughtful and introspective, as in the translation, we have characters who spout nonsense advice on topics that they have not the slightest idea. As a character who is a hundred dollar t-shirts, and have never been within the target department is waiting to give the working class a woman advice on how to prepare for an interview as an administrative assistant? Do not think it stops. If he does not give her clothing advice, he tells her that she should have. The most annoying part of the movie for me was that, as they say, they were in a hurry to make an appointment, and yet the characters continue to find time to run another errand, be it a car wash, a stop at Arby's, or just laying around to the list of these 10 points or less lists the things that they love and hate. I still wanted to shout at them saying, "You do not say you were somewhere to be? What the hell are doing? A minute ago you were almost late, now you eat roast beef and pondering their lives! "So far, I have not seen this movie, I never really understood how something can" push on, "but I think that this film does just that, and undeservedly so. The dialogue makes the characters and stale cheese ?? with the exception that I felt sorry for both actors for signing for this project.
