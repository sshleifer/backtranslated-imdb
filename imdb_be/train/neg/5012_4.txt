I watched this movie on the grounds that the Amber Benson rocks and Nick Stahl, as a rule, pretty cool - I realized that any film with two actors I love and respect, can not be all bad. In this sense, I was right - taking into account the start of dialogue decisions, they were given, they both perform well enough. Not good enough to stop the movie from sucking, you understand, but good enough that I was able to make it through 75-odd minutes of the film (and this is the main sign of a terrible film, if the 40th minute the score, you 're already prayed that it was more). <br /> <br /> it's hard to know where to start with problems in "Taboo". Dialogue, as already mentioned, is appalling; wooden and completely unnatural. January Jones cast is incredibly bad, and because it is a symbol that we spend most of our time around the house after it is inexcusable mistake. The site manages to be so complicated that it does not make sense, at the same time being as a template to be fully predictable (in a literal sense, and not one of the main "bloat" in this film will not surprise anyone but small). Several interesting arrows at the side, the director is trying too hard with too little success, uncomfortable and nervous arrows tracking camcorder work distracts from what little history there is an element. <br /> <br /> Three of the stars of this film are awarded for the fact that it contains the Amber Benson, and the latter throws in on the grounds that one of the jokes made me giggle a bit. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, ever, under any circumstances. Avoid at all costs.
