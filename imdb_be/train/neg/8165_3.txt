This is a ghost story. This is the story of cannibalism. This is a story of revenge. This is a very poorly made film with a lot of violence. I believe that it is cheap on line each chopper movie you've ever seen. It has the usual isolated place, daring campers, go out into the wilderness. Of course, there are some pretty intense scenes. It's just so sad. Poor editing and whole piece. There are ghosts of children who sound like they are talking to the trash. I'm not sure that the rules of ghosts and crazy with a cap of seeds plays. It also has a gross of a scene where a person eats a piece of meat that is actually what is left by his wife. A friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of gratuitous suffering from violence. I am afraid that this is just another step in our evolution desensitized. Three no gumption here or tongue in cheek, but a sad waste of time. A lot of blood; a small patch.
