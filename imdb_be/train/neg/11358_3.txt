When I saw this movie on TV, I was surprised. In May 2008, I was at Six Flags in New Jersey, and it pointed to the involvement in the 4-D (you know, the attraction that the seats move). I believe that the version I saw was a shortened version (15 min.), As well as newly created, to add motion effects. It was a cute movie ... but it was. This educational and talked about the first mission, but the end CGI spacewalk seemed a bit ... well ... banal. I'm not a big fan of the movie, but I would recommend this film to any parent who wants to give their children in a fun way about the first moon walk. I will say, the nature of the actors were well chosen and the characters themselves were cute. So all-in-all, I would say, if you want to bring younger children ... go for it. But if you want your older kids, take them to another movie ... they will thank you.
