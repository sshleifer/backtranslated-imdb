Wow, a film about the politics of New York, it would seem, written by someone who has never set foot in New York. You know that there is a problem when one moment you expect loans to roll and the film continues for another half hour. The characters are sad, the emphasis of John Cusack ridiculous and scene balance between boring and ridiculous. Scary Movie.
