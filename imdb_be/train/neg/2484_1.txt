I still can not believe that Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of crap.This film worse than "Deadly Friend» .The plot is dull, mediocre acting and film fatally dull.I not know why Wes Craven hates his debut "The Last house on the left »-an absolute masterpiece of the genre and love (perhaps) it turkey.Don't get me wrong, I really like some of his films, but it was a real torture to sit and watch it.
