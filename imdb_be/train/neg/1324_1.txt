"The Second Coming of Suzanne" is another one of those surreal films, trying to come across as extremely complicated, but all it does is to put the audience to sleep. Like other films of this type, there is a limited dialogue. Everything is much more interested in the visual aesthetics of the shot. Nonetheless, the cinematography does not stink so anything to keep your attention. <br /> <br /> Video box says that the film is "one of the most exciting visual adventure ever seen in a movie." Yes ... of course. It's right up there with the view of enabling activities like a bucket of ice melting or sea turtle walking a mile. 1/10
