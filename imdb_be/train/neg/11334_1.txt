Here is another blasphemous European history, in which they undermine the religion of their country. (These atheistic filmmakers relentless.) Here we see a tough compromise between Catholics and / or the Catholic clergy (and I'm not a Catholic). <br /> <br /> It won actually won the Academy Award for Foreign Language Film BES. This is probably because the story was Catholic and religious faith in general looks very weak. One of the main characters is a priest, and he cares more about the food than anything else. He is portrayed as anything but an idiot. Not surprisingly, the secular- dominated the Academy loved this film. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is some overacting fool who plays a man who renounces his religion so that he could marry one of four daughters mentioned in this story. Daughter turns seducing "seminary" student (who claims that he studied for six years, but says he is an agnostic!). I mean, how blasphemous this movie ?? !!! <br /> <br /> This is a shame and is another great example of progressive secular fanaticism film business, all over the world (not only in Hollywood).
