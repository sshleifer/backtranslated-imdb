Irene Dunne finished his brilliant career with the so-so movie. It should be extinguished with a bang, being a classy actress, she was not so unmemorable, almost unknown movie. <br /> <br /> This light comedy is good, but nothing special. The first half of it much better as it gets pretty silly in the second half. Maybe Irene could see the handwriting on the wall and quit. Even her high-pitched voice was a bit annoying here. Rumor has it that she was not happy with this film. You can understand why. <br /> <br /> The story reminded me of a 1950s TV sitcom. Apart from the fact that I thought that David Nelson of TV shows of Ozzie and Harriet was in this film, but he was very young tilt. He looked and sounded just like Nelson. <br /> <br /> In general, so-so, at best, and a pair of sub-end to a great actress.
