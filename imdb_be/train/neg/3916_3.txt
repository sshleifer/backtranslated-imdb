We all know, the film never does full justice to the book, but this is an exception. Important characters were cut, Blanco and Alba were mushed essentially the same character, the majority of the plot and the main plot the main elements have been eliminated. clairvoyance Clara was very exaggerated, making it seem much smaller in nature than the one that I met in the book. In the book we learn more about their abilities and the important effects that she had so many people who, in turn, is a key element in the life of the family. In the film, she was no more than some special ladies. Relations between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero-third, by the way, has a son and thus come after Segundo-second) and its connection as between Esteban and his grandson of Punch Garcia (not the son, he did admit) is cut in half and its importance downplayed <br /> <br /> One of the most fundamental things about the book, the film all but deprived :. "The House of Spirits" is called Where's home? The story of the 3-4 generations of a family should revolve around "the big house on the corner," said line so many times in the novel. The house is in the fundamental values ​​for the story, but the film unfairly pushes it on a plain background. <br /> <br /> If I had not read this book, I would never have guessed that such a juicy, fine film could be based on such a rich and fascinating story.
