It is a relic of the short film begins with a teenager going through a process of trying to get a driver's license. He quickly becomes withdrawn with only about every conceivable topic related to cars. <br /> <br /> Things like dune gods, drag racing, custom paint jobs and showrooms are discussed. He often tries to be funny, but instead the film dull, drawn, and even sexist at times. None of the people in the film is not actually heard. Instead, it's all done in the stories and scoring. Sorry, but I can not. <br /> <br /> There's nothing educational or interesting, "Dad, can I borrow the car?". It's just another piece of meaningless filler take time on their "The Wonderful World of Disney" TV show. 1/10
