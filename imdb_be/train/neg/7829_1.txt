In the early 90's brought a lot of "quirky" and "off-beat" independent films, a special sub-genre, which is half of the spiritual desert of crime cinema. Other comments are "Wild at Heart," "From Dusk Till Dawn", and to a certain degree of "Natural Born Killers." The film is good, like the ones that produced junk like "Highway 666", "Destiny Turns on the Radio", and this awkwardly surreal anti-masterpiece «Under The Hula Moon». This is a comedy that focuses on a particular emotional tone, it reaches him, but continues to go to the site of irritation. while the pursuit of the spirit world of the desert and the casting of Chris Penn's a good idea, the film does not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime movie, and not focused enough on the see ex to really be a comedy, I will not blow the ending, but let's just say it was bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of cancer-genre. This waste indie-mania.
