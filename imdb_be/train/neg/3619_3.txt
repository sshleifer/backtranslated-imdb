Basically it is a family where the little boy (Jake) thinks there's a zombie in his closet, and his parents are fighting constantly. <br /> <br /> This film is slower than a soap opera ... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill zombies. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, if you're going to make a film, you have to decide when it is a thriller or a drama! As the drama film watchable. Parents divorced and wondering how in real life. And then we've got Jake with his cabinet, which completely destroys the whole film! I expected to see a similar Bugimna film, and instead I watched the drama with some thriller meaningless blur. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 only to play well parents and descent dialogs. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.
