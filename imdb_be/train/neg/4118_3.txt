While channel surfing, we found this film with his promising synopsis. We were alarmed at the actor's flat and formulaic plot. We found a funny scene exploding car, incredible shoot outs, and establish that collapse down with the weight of the Taira foam and cardboard. Even more fun was to see all the processed scenes from "Dante's Peak", where the church front falls on a school bus, shop fronts to break away from the main street, overpass collapses, and the red truck speeding down the alley way as bricks fall on him. It was a good laugh, although unintended, and leaves the viewer wondering if it was not originally conceived as a low-budget parody of disaster movies.
