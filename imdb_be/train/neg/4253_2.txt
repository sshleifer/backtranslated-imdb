This is one of the worst I have to take on vampires ever conceived by humans. How can I convert a hypnotic subject in a very boring story? Apparantly not such a difficult task ... First of all, a prerequisite of any vampirefilm dark and gloomy atmosphere with good sexual contact, this one does not grab all of these things .. Too much light - spots! Oh, my God, why in the name of Jesus / Judas that about <br /> <br /> Whenever Dracula happened he was absorbed light (in the script to keep it weak, for the record: only low)? There was only one episode, which made it almost worth watching near the end of the movie (beautiful dancingscene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first one, Judas the turn was Defintely the original, but this one is just not good, and not in any way. Let us hope that the third one will be Kerry Vampire signature I like so many other classics like Nosferatu Herzog, Coppola Dracula or Interview with the Vampire.
