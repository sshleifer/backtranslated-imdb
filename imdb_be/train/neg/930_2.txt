Some children hiking, and one of them turns into a large tunnel, and discovers some old mummified gladiator. He wears a gladiator helmet and spends the rest of the film kills all the other tourists. <br /> <br /> This thing just makes no sense, it's crazy. Here is a short list of things that make no sense: <br /> <br /> 1) The guy and the girl in his tent, and they think they hear something outside. A guy goes to investigate and finds another tourist on the street. Then he heard his girlfriend scream, so they head back to the tent - the arrival of the next morning?!? He was only 50 feet! <br /> <br /> 2) These two idiot hear another girl cry (what, 100 feet?), but does not investigate, because they are afraid that they lost. <br /> <br /> 3) Another guy and the girl go, and about their 10th stage with the girl tells the boy, because of the circumstances, the protocol does not require him longer to speak to her as a professor. I mean, what ...? Firstly, it's just a very silly thing to say, and secondly, he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they had together. <br /> <br /> 4) The injured girl attacks Demonicus, and he stops her, telling her that part of his gladiatorial training taught to hurt him, not killing. Hmm, yes, we've kind of noticed that she was wounded and died, because she and walk. But, thank you for this tasty information. <br /> <br /> 5) One girl tied in the den Demonicus', and if someone tries to free her, she instead instructs the man to go and get help. Um, look, idiot, when she set you free, which takes about 5 seconds, then there would be no need to get help. <br /> <br /> And it just goes on and on. The entire middle section of the film is carried out with the two idiots to get lost in the woods, they fight, they set up a tent and ignore the cries of their friends, they wander around some. It's just so damn boring and pointless that I turned halfway through the DVD. <br /> <br /> None of these characters is not like, especially the ones that get most of the screen time. Demonicus themselves made me laugh out loud every time I saw him - he looks like a kid in a Halloween costume, wrinkled his face to look evil. It works, or should I say scampers around like he was gay. Special effects comedy, which operates mostly awful, and nothing does not make sense. <br /> <br /> In general, it may be, this concept could be done in the campy film is pleasant, when they put a little more time and effort he is getting rid of the ridiculous dialogue, creating characters with real nice persons that have some logic flow to the action, and perhaps even make Demonicus female character in sexy outfit gladiators. But no, instead we get this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death.
