What happens when you give a free man just enough money to catch it in the rat race and watch them squirm for? Homeless to answer to anyone. They do not have a mortgage, lease payments or idiots bosses. Homeless people do not have to worry about the IRS or appraisals or credit card payments. But give them enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car, and suddenly they have to worry about entering the rat race, buying gas for transportation, to pay insurance on his car, and work for someone else. They get the chance to become "full citizens". This film was about how exploitative as the film can be. It is a way for the rich and the middle class Sheeple say "see what happens when you are trying to help the poor?" And to justify capitalist arrogance <br /> <br /> Why not a film that asks, "What happens when you uncheck all that the rich man has? ".
