Horrible and lascivious wolf. Young "Red" wearing full makeup and very short shorts and a bathrobe. There are about 20 minutes before the end and realized that this could be a dream come true pedophile. "Up-tempo" music sounds a lot like what I hear in a strip club. I actually think that this film is a sick joke - this is not a family film. Gross, I am glad that I watched it with my daughter, I do not want her to think that it is normal for families to watch quasi kiddie porn together. Very bad, very sad, it is sold as a family film, Joey Fatone, likely to be confused, he was there. And that advertising it as "spectacular effects" ??? Consequences do look low budget, Gawd awful.
