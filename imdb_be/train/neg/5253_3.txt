Name (Frau) protagonist is the German word for "woman". I do not know when it was done intentionally or not, but if you believe there are some giggles from the German audience at the Festival of Fantasy Film in the last year when it was revealed. <br /> <br /> But it was only giggles film received. Not that it was intended to chuckle, this is a terrible movie, for God's sake! Disastrous film in more than one way. It's a shame that the room was so wasted with terrible moments even unbearable for the viewer (not exactly for the faint hearted !!)! And it does not even need to show all the things that are shown. I'm not even going into the moral obligations (because the movie did not have that kind of task or function) to discuss what is shown here, but this is a new low for the entire "movement torture", which has grown in the last few years!
