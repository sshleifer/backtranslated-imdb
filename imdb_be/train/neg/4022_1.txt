This movie was terrible. I watched it three times, and not even all of it. It is simply impossible to watch, the story sucks, it's depressing, and totally disgusting. I do not write spoilers for something, so if you want to know why this is so shocking to see it for yourself. The only good thing about this film was John Savage, his dialogue in the beginning, and some funny parts in the movie. A small child in the film annoying, and the whole situation is garbage. I saw this movie in the cinema stores across America, so I assumed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I was wrong !!!! All acts badly, nudity itself is lame and disgusting. Another thing, Starr Andreef, another main character, has not been in such bad movies in the past, in fact, it was in some very good ones. The same with John Savage. This movie sucks!
