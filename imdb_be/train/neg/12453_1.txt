I've always been a big Lynda Carter Wonder Woman fan, so if Sci-Fi Channel launched this film, I had to see it.I was bitterly disappointed.This is a Wonder Woman movie named only.She not wear a suit of law, [it should refused or has ordered major changes] and the story works as either poor James Bond.There about the things that made the success of comic book character that is superhuman strength or determined will.It just one long bad dream.I not even think Kathy everything anyway.I will not be attractive to spend time on it.
