I do not enjoy this film. I thought that their actions are not very good, and the story was boring. 20year old computer to save the day? I thought it was just a bit far-fetched, even for the film. I could not understand why they can not just turn it off, why not take a sledgehammer to it. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, but after the original film from the 80's you'd expect a lot more than what was actually delivered. This film could be a version of the 21st century from an old movie, it was not. If this is what you want to watch, do not watch this movie! <br /> <br /> Even if your old computer is not turned around to save the day, it will continue to be, in my opinion, is very, very cheesy movie ..
