Normally I would never make a film like this, because you know that it is bad just by looking at the box. I rented seven films, while at the same time, including A Nightmare on Elm Street 5, 6, and Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I returned home, I learned that the video store guy gave me the wrong tape. The box Wes Craven's New Nightmare I found this lame movie. <br /> <br /> This film is incredibly sad, bad acting and the plot makes no sense. It's hard to write a good review, because I have no idea what the film was really. At the end of the movie you have more questions than answers <br /> <br /> The Â«Scale Max Power, from 1 to 10," I appreciate this film: 1. <br /> <br /> PS I'd like to review Corinth right (bottom right of the mine). He says that Robert Englund is tearing clothes, riding a horse naked, etc. The guy who did these things was Mahmoud, played by Julian Mer, not Robert Englund.
