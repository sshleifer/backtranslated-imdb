What can I say about Seven Pounds ... well, I was looking for a flight from Seattle to Tokyo, and how this flight was a long and tedious the movie certainly did not help. Will Smith's character Ben Thomas almost completely uncomfortable even with its redemption in the end. Film two o'clock plus running time waste most of the screen time with random garbage that just the story line along as slowly as possible. In defense of a movie character Rosario Dawson adds a little life to the film, but not a lot. I do not understand how someone could actually cry during this movie, when all I wanted to do is to turn it off. Will Smith also kills himself jellyfish in finished, proves that to kill yourself from the jellyfish is a stupid way to die.
