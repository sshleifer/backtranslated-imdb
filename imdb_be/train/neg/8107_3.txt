This film is quite boring. There are fragments of bare flesh tossed around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer's conscious, but they did not get <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film Lena Olin. - she does a masterful job of handling its character, but Day-Lewis distorts most of its lines. <br /> <br /> Kaufmann clearly had no idea how to remove it. The inconsistencies in bouncing between the internal matters of the household / marriage and political crises poorly coordinated. The nature of attitude changes without explanation at all. Poor separately.
