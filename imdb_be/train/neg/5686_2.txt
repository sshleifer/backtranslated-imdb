Hello this is my first review for any movie I've seen. I went through the trouble of doing it, to tell everyone that it is literally the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. I feel like the film was made porely that I will give some idea of ​​budget constraints on its preparation. I felt like I was watching a very bad remake of the movie Saw. What can I accept seen, and very graphic, but I did like the movie seen. <br /> <br /> The scene where he takes a hammer to the head of the victim tied to a chair is the most disturbing scenes I have seen. scene lasted almost forever, but in reality, it was probably about 5 minutes, but still. I want to mention that I like some horror movies and I really give credit, if they are good. the director Uwe Boll, and his group of people used to make this film has to think twice before making another one like this. One final note haha ​​!! For all people who like to watch animal BEATIN death, prevent ROT, women and children, as well as five-minute SCENE WITH WHOM then there head smashed in with a hammer, then you will enjoy this film, if not, and you, as horror, go with a higher budget films like saw, for example. I can not believe people actually make films like this. in any case, sorry for those who like Uwe Boll, and took it to heart, it is only my opinion of the film.
