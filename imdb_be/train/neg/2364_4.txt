"Dead Freddie" did the smart thing he could do after the disappointment of the fifth film. He started from scratch. Of course, this "final" film in the saga of silly, but at least it's original. Some of the visual, even a little bit breathtaking. And the history of the child, Freddie (Lisa Zane) return to the city to face her evil father is unique. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is not that other, as yet another cartoon made in order to get the kids in the theater. He has a bunch of good actors (Zane, Japhet Cat, and Leslie Dean), who basically look stupid and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter. It is one-sided, it is a magic trick, and, in the end, it's anything but dull, children's entertainment. <br /> <br />
