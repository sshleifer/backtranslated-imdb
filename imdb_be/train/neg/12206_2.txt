I do not see many reasons to get into the film in a large number of parts. Sylvester Stallone once again John Rambo, a writer and a survivor, "A Season in Hell", who are recruited from prison his only friend, Major tilt secretly to return to Vietnam, take pictures of American prisoners are believed to be still held in terrible camps and return without an enemy. <br /> <br /> Fat chance. What if he really did nothing more than to get, take photos, and get away? Who will come to see the movie? <br /> <br /> In fact, holiday Stallone muscles. Prepare for him a mission, we see it well oiled muscles bulging. (They oiled and bulging in all.) There is a binding ritual on black skin, ugly guns, knives and even uglier. Black gun cleaned, assembled with loud clacks, and almost the same as greased muscles Stallone. Onion is tested and, yes, he has enough to drive poundage bolt through the enemy head-on. The knife is sharpened with a smooth snicks. <br /> <br /> Stallone and one of his prisoners betray one or two suits from Washington, cynical politicians who, you can bet, were never even in a fistfight in the gymnasium. A lot of guts, you know? Just sit with your feet on the table and drink beer foreign. <br /> <br /> The film does what it is intended to do, but what he meant to do it for show. He deliberately cashing in on the popular myth in the mid-1980s, years that were countless missing quietly kept in squalid camps of North Vietnam. Bumper stickers are everywhere. (Free Our MIAS.) Why do they keep them? He was never fully motivated to, but perhaps to make prisoners as slave labor - in a country that has absolutely no life other than work. Or, perhaps, for their propaganda value as a tool to humiliate the United States -. Propaganda weapon that Vietnam is kept secret from the world <br /> <br /> As a prisoner, Rambo regarded in medieval fashion in the North Vietnamese. Immersed to his neck in pig excrement, and then pulled his wrists, his muscles still on the display. Then, not content subhumans Vietnamese, Russian officer brought to play the role of the Gestapo officer - "Wedge HAFF Weiss EXECUTE you remember. 'Type of high-tech, Russian uses psychology and electricity, and not just dump the pig. <br /> <br /> Rambo comes back and says that he is going to drift aimlessly until "this country does not love us as much as we love it," with the result that another myth that the vets who returned from Vietnam were evenly spat and cursed, so I believe that we have chosen so many in Congress and held other high-echelon positions. The last three defeated presidential candidates were among this despised group. At least Rambo aimless drifting out of the room open to continue, who arrived quickly. <br /> <br /> The action film featuring Schwarzenegger and Willis and others were leavened with jokes, but Rambo sense of humor. He walks through the dimly is illusory ideological swamp, killing without pity, hardly speaking, I could hardly speak. Say it is a sign of weakness.
