Coat of arms, Volkswagen that thinks like a man who has returned, now driven Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman who hopes to become the champion of NASCAR. The only thing that stands in her way is the reigning champion, Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who will do anything to stop them. <br /> <br /> Love the original error was not so good. Even as a child, I remember, I do not like it very much. I had some hope for a sequel, though. I mean pretty good cast and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty funny movie. Unfortunately, Herbie is no better than it was before. The film provocatively weak for people over the age of 12, he is likely to entertain the kids, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I understand that this is a movie, and all the children, but they could make a movie a little more interesting, there was very little laugh, and it became boring towards the end. Most of the actors seemed dead in his role, too. Lindsay Lohan was in order, as Maggie Peyton. It usually gives the best performance, both in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon, gave the best performance of all. He was very good as the bad guy, even if he did not have a lot of work. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton really just there, and they do nothing special. <br /> <br /> Angela Robinson directs and she does a good job. She tries to keep the movie interesting, but it works with a weak script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the script and is there any surprise to you that they were also responsible for a taxi and pacifiers? These two make light films until they really make the story interesting or enjoyable. This is not entirely their fault, but hopefully next time they will try. Eventually, Herb is a safe, predictable family film that is worth watching if you're a kid. All the rest is better to skip it. rating 4/10
