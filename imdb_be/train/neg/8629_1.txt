Dear Richard, I know that we all loved you on Home Improvement with Tim Allen. But seriously, you do not have anything to do, except for the lame to Air Bud? I would have thought Tim might actually give you a bit of the role now, or even to become his personal assistant. I know it seems ironic, but the benefit to pay much more useful. <br /> <br /> Everyone can see you and Tim immediately think "Tool Time». You even get the role of Bob Villa more often. Instead, you find yourself in a Golden Retriever and smiles for 10 minutes. I know it was not so much the script, but you could add to it. I mean, come on. Tim owe you one. <br /> <br /> But seriously, this movie does not do anything for the line Air Bud. Quite the contrary, the fake talk Cornier puppies than are actually seeing that dogs play sports. The original was better. And you, Mr. Richard Karn, I know that more than anyone. <br /> <br /> This is a «F» film.
