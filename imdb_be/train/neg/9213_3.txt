I caught this movie on a small screening conducted by the members of my college game club. We were warned that it would be "reefer madness" of the game, and this movie more than delivered. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man again began his career in college after a "rest" for the semester. What we, the audience, know as the film progresses, that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to role-playing game called "Mazes and Monsters," a game in which he gets re-acquainted with after the game group to recruit him for the company . <br /> <br /> This movie is ridiculous on many, many levels. One scene shows a group of "games by candlelight," which is probably the best way I can describe it. Although I'm sure it had to be "cult" in some way, as most gamers know, it's terrible inaccurate. Most role playing sessions are held in well-lit places, usually in a few Chee-tohs and a can of soda. <br /> <br /> action, not Oscar caliber, entirely gut painfully awful day, it is one of the first roles of Tom Hanks and inseparable friends and Stag another year or two above the horizon. The supporting cast, while not very memorable, even hands forward worthy performances. <br /> <br /> In general harmfulness it lies in the fact that it was made for TV movie, which shows the "danger games" worth a look if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
