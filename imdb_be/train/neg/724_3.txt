Sarafina concept seems sound one, that is, apart from the musical point of view. He tries to combine upbeat African music with the story, describes the brutal conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set. Contradictions of each of the two elements, too blatant, and the film never justify such rapid shifts between joy and terror. If it was just a drama reflects those conditions, he may have been a good film, but the school children of the scene, beaten soldiers did not sit well with a number of songs. <br /> <br /> In addition to poor facilities acting is not the best either Goldberg gives a mediocre performance, does the rest of the cast. On the whole, disappointing. <br /> <br /> 3/10
