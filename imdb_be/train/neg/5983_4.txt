I was one of those "few Americans" who grew up with all the beautiful works of Gerry Anderson. Thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would make a great action / adventure film, if only writers could figure out where to aim it. <br /> <br /> I was expecting that it would fuss, but I did or did not expect that it is aimed at such a low age group. Like Lost in Space, it could be both visually stunning and exciting. It should have been more focused on action / adventure and purpose of the original series ... saving people in trouble. <br /> <br /> Instead, he focused his attention on Alan saving the day instead of brothers (who were cast too young in any case, compared to the original). Breakdown part was Lady Penelope and Parker. I do not care too much for the characters in the original, but I was grateful for them in the film. They stole the show! <br /> <br /> I have always loved Thunderbirds more for high-tech than history, and even that did not get enough time on the screen, as far as I was concerned. I would have enjoyed seeing more cool gadget <br /> <br /> But then, I'm just a big kid ...;).
