I give this ambitious piece of debris 1, simply because I do not believe that this is the worst movie in the world. <br /> <br /> I hate this film, I hate acting, dialogue, setting, writing and directing. I hope all that participated in this film burns and rot in a dark circle of hell. <br /> <br /> Damn this disgusting waste of time. <br /> <br /> I pray every day that this movie is just a figment of my imagination. I pray that I dreamed of a movie, and that I would never see it on <br /> <br /> my local video store again. <br /> <br /> burn in Hell
