Okay, but what make it a good movie? Well, actually not my opinion.there little to recommend it.i was very slow, boring, predictable and in fact.it largely through .number one and two were more predictable, but not as well as much.I felt this movie was pretty cutesy sometimes, I really do not think that fits into this series and character.Jeff Fey plays the chief bad guy in this game. it is quite a decent actor, but I felt that he also played his character over top.i guess that is consistent with the tone of the film, which would be very nice if I had liked movie.plus, had some pretty bad liners .Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role, but given a bit of work in the preview of the film character is not really evolved since I was hoped.oh well.this is only my opinion.anyway, for me, while this film is not bottomless, it's pretty bad .my vote for Darkman III: 3,5 / 5
