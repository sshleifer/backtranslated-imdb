To be honest ... I loved watching the cut. That's why I <br /> <br /> gave it 1/10 stars because of its sharply sad <br /> <br /> story / filming / acting / all. This film was watching RIOT. If <br /> <br /> You like to watch bad movies to mock them, you will <br /> <br /> really get pleasure from a severed. <br /> <br /> The story really does not matter, it includes some guy that bald <br /> <br /> and a sword and goes around the beheading of random people. <br /> <br /> However, he has a supernatural twist ... no one ever sees, how he does it. <br /> <br /> Even if one very memorable scene, he comes in <br /> <br /> jampacked nightclub and developer of noodles a girl and <br /> <br /> no one sees < br /> <br /> a piece of not just look like it was shot on video it was <br /> <br /> shot on someone's home video camera. The filmmakers were <br /> <br /> knowledge of lighting (very thin knowledge) and composition <br /> <br /> really holds in some scenes. But basically you can not hear <br /> <br /> actors ... you can not understand what they are doing, and you're laughing <br /> <br /> If the next vicitm gets his pumpkins Good from his body. <br /> <br /> Go and make this film. Support movies like this- they whistle and <br /> <br /> Hollar!
