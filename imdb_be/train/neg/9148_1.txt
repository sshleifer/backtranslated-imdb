I looked at the bottom Imdbs 100, because I thought that id never nothing as bad as 9 from Outerspace plan or rollers remakes, I was wrong seen. Ben and Arthur knocked both. <br /> <br /> This is because many of countless movies that I've seen is the number one worst movie on I've ever seen. Directing Bad, bad characters, s picture Horrible debt, terrible story There's no reason, no one but Sam never says anything good about this movie. Sam was terribly annoying actor, but his direction was so bad that he can just overturn Ed Wood <br /> <br /> The director shall be ashamed of his work, unfortunately, I have to give it at least one star, but she It deserves. - in the course will be the star.
