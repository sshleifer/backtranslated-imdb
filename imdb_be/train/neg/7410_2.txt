I love horror movies, which produces the actual number of secrets, as they say, «Silent Hill» (which I found to be pretty good, but still lacks something) and films that keeps you guessing, I thought it was one of those movies. First, the film begins with some really good uncertainty and provides a good starting point for a good horror of the scene, but after that it just rolls down the hill, and there is only faster and faster down. I mentioned in the first Silent Hill for a reason, because I see a lot of "stolen" from the fact that the movie here .. In general, I would say, watch Silent Hill instead of one, it is better, it's more scary, it is much more uncertainty, as well as the ending is much better .. and best of all, you will not feel ripped off, as I did with this .. it just seems to be one of those "I love this movie, so I'm going to do it again in my very bad option "interesting movie .. Oh and one more thing ... .. Lordi horror movie ... That's like trying to scare di I bear care has "around me, and I will love you forever" written on her stomach it ..
