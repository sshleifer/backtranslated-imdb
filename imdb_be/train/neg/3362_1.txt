Phantom of another bad remake of the horror with false exaggerated special effects and a large cast of favorites and the screen has no quality whatsoever to buy, except, perhaps, for cinematography.Yes remakes are not all bad, but remakes director Dzion Da Bont determined. I believe that A-list actors (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen Wilson) is to distract us from the boring plot, laughable special effects and terrible attempts scaring his audience, but this film is not a tabloid, we log does not matter whose in we care about the characters and story are two things this movie missed.The story is like taking a classic novel Ghosts of Hill House and tears four chapters, and then use all that is left for the film's so boring and a lot of it unexplained.The characters rather thin and while the action good you really the right not to care about any of the characters in all.Lily Taylor gives a terrible performance, and it sounds like s 8 years old when delivering her lines not to mention some terrible screamer she is.Lily Taylor is not done for the horror genre in all.The ghosts stupid and cheesy, they look like a bunch of Casper the friendly ghost, and the ghost of Hugh Cain looks like a fat guy dressed as the grim reaper for halloween with smoke machine.There this creature on the roof of one of the rooms, it's a giant purple mouth, and it's not even funny unintentionally simply sad.The house is beautiful and well thought out, that This is probably the only positive thing in this movie, it looks good, but it does not save him from his brutal all else.I can honestly say I felt like I was wasting my time watching Ghosts on television without the price ago I would have been even more pi $$ th ed when I paid to see it, but fortunately, it was on the Creek Channel.Overall Ghosts is a sad remake, which is trying to crush you with bad special effects, bad attempt at terror.
