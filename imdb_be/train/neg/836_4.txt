A dedicated movie fan TLKA, the first of which is a landmark and the second is probably the best Disney released a sequel, along comes this film ... Now I'm not arguing with animation, voice work, the music, but it is nothing more than Timon / Pumbaa screwloose TLC in the atmosphere. Despite the fact that it is not bad, it does not add anything. Basically, this film is one big joke ... and that is all that saves him. Make a real TLK3, Disney! The potential is there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
