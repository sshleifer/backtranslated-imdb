I bought this blind film, and I am very upset that I paid as much as I did, but I'd say it's at least worth a rental for some cold deaths and ridiculous action. This is not a good movie in any way, but I must say that I was pretty darn entertaining. I believe that it could be called so poorly it-well. <br /> <br /> As I said, acting badly, I feel that I could do a better job, showing, at least, any emotion. History is nothing new and has been done better. I guess I'm just a soft spot for any carnival-type film squire. I would say, is to rent or to download it, but, of course, do not buy it. Not worth more than one hour.
