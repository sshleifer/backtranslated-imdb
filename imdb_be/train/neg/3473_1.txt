This is quite possibly the worst Christmas movie ever. The plot is virtually non-existent, the current (in particular Affleck) poor at best. fans of Ben Affleck, probably to protect the film, but in their hearts they must agree. As far as I could muster story consisted of Ben Affleck, millionaire seller psychoanalyst told to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and write down a list of things he would like to forget from his childhood. At the same time, he ends up paying the family currently lives in the house to be his family for Christmas ... and that's it. The film goes on and in the end he gets along with the daughter of the family .... blah blah blah.
