It is not just a bad movie, it is one of the worst movies ever. it's so bad that I found it to be very enjoyable. acting, my God, the script, you have to be kidding. as you can imagine, the writer comes up with things like: - baby, which makes fireworks in the school, fireworks SO POWERFULL, that if someone gets hit by it, they fly a hundred yards back and explode. -a girl trapped in the basement, the killer is trying to break the door. she receives a drill, but the cable is not long enough. it first makes an extension cord, horror of horrors, and then, when she did, it drills through the door and drill through the killer's head. WOW - and there are many more examples like this. Oh yeah, and what happened to George Kennedy, he used to be a large (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool Hand Luke)
