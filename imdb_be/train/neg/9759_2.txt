It's rare that I feel compelled to write a review on this site, but this film is very worthy because of how bad it was created, and how the bias of its product. <br /> <br /> I felt a clear test on part of filmmakers to portray the Palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy. We hear them discuss the grief that they feel from oppression, but the film is removed and positioned in such a way that we feel politically oppressed population of the Jewish population of Israel. We see no evidence that the parallel position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand the restrictions in place, but the political nature of the restrictions are intended to prevent the world. <br /> <br /> I left the film feeling that the mother of the victim in his selfish mourning and completely closed-minded because of her side of the fence, so to speak. She still does not want to see the pain of parents bomber, and its evil and obdurate words brought final assembly spiral out of control. This is more realistic, in my opinion, to see the Israeli mentality to be the root of the problem; ignoring requests for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for confirmation of a process in which the Jewish population gained ground. <br /> <br /> I gave it two out of selfish weakness of his mother, who typically would be well in the documentary, but in light of the lack of impartiality, it all seems operational. In addition, changes to the poor, the lack of background in the real court, and, finally, the lack of adequate representation of the Palestinian side. Ultimately, this is a bad bad movie and documentary. I recognize that it is partly a result of the political situation, but I am forced to note shortcomings in direction regardless of agonizing and boring topics.
