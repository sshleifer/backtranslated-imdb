Three of the "horror" movie with some guy in the house boarded up imploring the viewer not to go "there", and (unfortunately) gives us three tales to prove why. <br /> <br /> The first story involves a young couple in a car accident, which occur two loonies. This leads to two completely predictable turns. However, it quickly (about 15 minutes), a strong, well-acted and well done. Predictable, but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The second involves a man on the run after stealing a large sum of money. His car breaks down, he attacked the dog and stumbles to the nearest clinic. Clearly, poorly done, and very slowly. Even 30 minutes is too long. Good acting, though. <br /> <br /> In the third place, almost a horror story. It includes a beautiful, lonely woman looking for Mr. right. It has a beautiful set design, good passion and good sex scene. But (again) are predictable and not even remotely scary. <br /> <br /> It ends very stupid. <br /> <br /> In general, the first worth watching, but it's true. Tune in to that one and then turn it off.
