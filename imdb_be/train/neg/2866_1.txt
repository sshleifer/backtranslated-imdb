No words can describe my extreme hatred of this terrible killer performance side. Rate this movie one of the ten compliments is really disastrous occasion for the film. From start to finish, there was not a highlight. It was all terribly put together; script, acting, plot, lighting, direction, IV, factual information, IV, just to name a few. Several scenes literally loud laugh, funny for a brutal manner in which the entire thing is put together. This review may seem unfair and scathing attack on the low-budget film with, but it is not. Just think about the movie I just saw makes my blood boil to start. As this film has ever received the right to produce, I'll never know. I'm almost tempted to really recommend BCI, because it really stand out as to how helpless and exciting it is awful. I can honestly say that in all my years of film-going, this is the worst. MOVIE. EVER. I spent more than an hour of my life to useless garbage, and would gladly jumped into the nearest building in advance, if I knew I was in for. ZERO with TEN.
