I wonder why someone would try to redraw the successful parts of the film, which has already seen it in the case with this film. "The Wedding Date" is one of the best examples of why not to try to alter, under the guise of a new history, that should have been left alone. If the project as it moves forward with the approval of the studio, Big Boss, and then all with big stars and glossy production values, so that people will come to the stars. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is not what is happening in this misguided attempt to comedy. The problem seems to be how the writers story transplanted to London, where basically, it seems to be a typical American situation, not even the installation will be able to fix. Then there is a problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Mulroney? They have so much chemistry as oil and vinegar! <br /> <br /> Since Kat and Nick have no conflict with the very beginning, the viewer does not get involved in the film, as the creators think they will. It is clear that Kat will fall on Nick, and vice versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best asset «Junebug», comes across as a shallow girl who wants to be a lie, and there is not clear until the man who loves her and is going to marry her. <br /> <br /> For those who are interested in the end credits of the film runs for almost seven minutes!
