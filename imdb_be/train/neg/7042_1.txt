This should be one of the worst movies ever. Even for the cyclist a movie, this is rock-bottom. Minimum plot involves a gang of bikers who take on small town (how original!) And attempts to citizens, to fight with them. Why do not they call for help? Who knows? The fight scene is clearly a fake. Adam West and Tina Louise were there, but the two have little in common, and both look ashamed to be there (for obvious reasons) This film belongs to a pile of garbage!
