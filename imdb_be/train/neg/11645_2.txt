This is a review "Freddie Mercury The Untold Story," a theatrical release, Chicago Int. Film Festival 2007 One of the phoniest, inspiration and most tedious biographical documentaries I've seen. If a movie that I saw in a theater was initially released on television, I would ask him to producers and distributors is not fool-paying audience with the false promise of a decent cinematic feature documentary. Even both because of television documentaries, sentimental piano solo accompanied respondents, sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and pompous, pseudo-literary story rang more true of sleepapedic Infomercial bed. Only redemptive aspects of «The Untold Story of Freddie Mercury" - or, UHM, it was «The Untold Story of Princess Diana" is the original concert, video and TV footage - Unabridged Freddie Mercury and Queen. Thank-interviews with witnesses irrelevant to the idea, such as: "He was a free spirit" (actually .. I thought that Freddie Mercury was a man of the company ...) diminish those reviews Freddy from Brian May and Montserrat Caballe, shedding new light and affectionate in the complex life and the nature of Mercury. And ... that Harry Potter, as a segment of the boarding school? As an interview with the first girl-crush ( "... who now works in a travel agency") and members of the first high school band Freddie contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury? It is vitally important milestones of his personal life, his sexuality, his artistic style and growth, Queen, group remain unexplored. These creators of the film did not ask a single, provocative question, they do not participate in independent study or a visionary of his subject, instead of delivering a tedious installation politely clean and very empty comments about the pros gadkavuyu and brilliant rock-legend, who do not deserve to be remembered for this biography History Channel your grandparents can take a nap, so that on Sunday evening.
