Why me? Why should I be subjected to a massacre that would make an interesting story? At least, when I can warn other people away, it was useful. <br /> <br /> I had to look that awful film for college course. Otherwise, I would look at the synopsis on the back of things and shunned. The film was slow, was hurt a little character development, and centered around the idea that an awful little white man can become cool when he's hanging out with LA-style black man markers. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the stereotypical LA feeling dizzy superficiality - to watch a movie. Note, however, that the film does not show that we have come to think of as the Â«LA lifestyle", is a perfect example of products that are derived from it.
