This film is an abomination, and its creation was to be regarded as a crime punishable by death. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest mysteries of the shooting why no one has done a faithful film version of this wonderful mystery. This is a story about a really exciting mystery, a good old-fashioned romance, and dry English humor. Why do manufacturers have to change Richard Gordon from Scotland Yard police the amateur detective, enter idiotic caricature of the role and his English servant, to change the part of the storyline on charges of murder and circumstances of the struggle to save the accused Gordon, etc., etc. ? These producers and directors who always think they can do a better story than the one in the book should write an original script itself and not to force the product of another person.
