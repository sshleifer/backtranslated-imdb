There have been many films with the participation of Bigfoot, the majority of which are not good, but most at least, stupid charm them. Sasquatch Hunters even that going for it. It's just a glitch boredom. <br /> <br /> Sasquatch Hunters group of paleontologists, and primatologists foresters who venture off into a remote part of the forest north-west Pacific. Bones belonging to some abnormally large primate have been found in this region, and as the monkeys are not natural in North America to start with this is a scientific expedition. Of course, they soon find a cemetery full of skeletal remains of a huge ape creatures. I think we all know what happens to people who break the ancient burial grounds in the movie. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film consists of uninteresting, interchangeable assembly character of their equipment, hiking through the forest, stopping to rest, hiking through the woods a bit, pausing long enough to explore and discuss some conclusions along the way, even more hikes through the woods, looking for a team member who disappeared even longer hikes through the forest, digging mud, casual theorizing, and gather around the campfire to discuss what little they have done in the same day. If Sasquatch finally appears it just turns into people stumbling around in the dark, at the same time took off one at a time (it is made in a moment, and you missed it the fashion and the actual killing takes place away from the camera). All this is painfully boring. <br /> <br /> The film director wants to seriously and is clearly trying to build suspense, but there is no one to be found, so we were left with a dull, elongated scene people, wandering through the woods just to get somewhere and wander through the woods at night, trying to act scared. I'd be lying if I said that I did not make liberal use of the fast-forward button to speed up the scene to. <br /> <br /> As for the Snow, in the same way as any other character still in the film, it is not so much to do and not enough individuals. It seems shaggier version of King Kong, which is not so bad, except for the scene where they used CGI instead of a person in a snowman costume that painfully obvious during daytime scenes monster world. Part of me can not help but feel that even with the help of computer effects to bring Bigfoot almost blasphemous to life. If there is any one movie monster, which I believe should be brought to life only through the situation, it's Bigfoot. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that not many have a story, as does the room is all that there is in fact, the premise that the people involved in drawn out to make a feature-length movie, NOT taking care to add all the ingredients to make a decent movie.
