All naked torso woman in the world can keep me from pressing the stop button for about a third of the way through this terrible waste. With the ridiculous actions, just horrible scenario plus bad CGI FX, to match; this film is an insult to the genre of the werewolf. It must be serious, that in itself would have been funny if this movie could even make it to the level of being a bad joke. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where the people behind the camera, obviously competent, but too lazy to do something more decent quarter. Avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic Werewolf movies instead. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10!
