Incredible play bad, nothing good, confusing stories and catchy image and slow movement, where they are needed the least :. Adrenalin all movies should be <br /> <br /> Georgina Verbaan (so the Dutch soap actress who did not attend her English lessons) plays a rich girl Freya, who has a habit of "thrills" quest. What major do dangerous stunts, break things and annoy people. And not in a fun eccentric ways. Then there Dracko (Rivas). He is a kind of pile, but there are other illegal activities on the side. Then there is the father of Freya (Lockyer), which plays a dubious role. And in the end, we got Jason (debutant Fyall), boyfriend Frey. <br /> <br /> One day Frey gets disappeared, and everyone seems to be involved, but we, the audience does not really care about, since none of the cast or something pretty believable, and the story does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> Why is it even done? 2/10.
