Now I have never ever seen a bad movie over the years, but what with the songs in the film, that the physiological significance it has. WOW some crazy Pokemon show up, and they breed I can get fit from this. Animie meaningless creators did not have a sense of his great marketing scheme looks cut on songs, and they will get a good grade, I believe that this film would have been nice if they put out the message that you need to see all the episodes of Pok√©mon to understand what is happening, and it's not a movie. It just has to be the animation video <br /> <br /> PS :. I'll give him one, because I just got 5 bucks, I could not give him half because no one half.
