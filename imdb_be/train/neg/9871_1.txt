and shot in Vancouver with a "mountain" in the low country of South Carolina visible in the background. For God's sake, they must discard location. There are no coastal mountains in South Carolina. Period. <br /> <br /> Lama visuals. They were beautiful. And the story limped forward. <br /> <br /> I do not really understand why it was such a hit as a book, although I must admit that this is one I have not read yet. I usually read a book and give the film a miss. There was nothing in this film that I wanted to buy a book, or even take it out of the library <br /> <br /> The verdict. Mermaid Chair seemed pretty small for Moi.
