I have just returned from the "El OTRO» plays here, in Buenos Aires, and I must say I was very disappointed. The film moves very slowly (do not get me wrong, I love the slow moving movie!) Slowly point driving you crazy. Everything you hear, Julio Chavez was breathing heavily throughout the film. This badly made film, but more importantly, it is a film without a lick of inspiration, I do not feel anything for a story or its characters. <br /> <br /> «El Otro» was made only for the sake of making the film ... that makes him forgetful. I would advise you to go for it, if you want to see a good Argentine films, look Sorin movies.
