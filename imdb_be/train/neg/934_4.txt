Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were so great, as usual. Ritter was not bad. Her name is as good as usual. It might be a good movie. To bad the plot was brutal. This was predictable, banal and sad. <br /> <br /> With the first 15 minutes, the rest of the film has been laid out as a child paint by numbers routine. The characters were stock pieces of cardboard cut. There was nothing new or interesting to say, and that is quite outweighs the action, which was a pity. <br /> <br /> And finally, too bad the writer did not become a victim. Especially with the "rapid" line of children who were absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Again, this is just an actor prevented a much lower score.
