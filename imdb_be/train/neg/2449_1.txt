Baska is to be congratulated for trying to convert one of the greatest works of English fiction in the movie, and then hit stupid for this attempt. Animation was poor, the characters look funny, the music was completely rattled, and the film was old blitzkrieg through the first half of the book with Tolkien's masterpiece. I still remember my obvious disappointment and disgust for the film, when I first saw it. Now I understand that any attempt to turn the book into a movie is doomed to fail in many ways, simply because of the environment, but this film, regardless of the source of this story, it's just pathetic. Baska is capable of much more.
