What's the deal with the clothes? All of them were dressed like something from the late 70's and early 80's. Cars have even been out of date. School was out of date. Nun clothes were outdated, and the hospital looked like something from the 40s, with his wards and wooden ladders and things. Nothing in the whole film did not mean it was in 1991, my mother laughed, saying, «Geeeee-od! If this film do? "When we pressed the« INFO BUTTON »on our panel, we were confident that 1991 was to be a typo! Has anyone else noticed this? My favorite part, though, was when a woman says her husband blatant filth, by phone, on an inverted cross on the mirror, and he just says, "Well, look, I have a meeting in Congress. I'll talk to you about it later. " This line was just classic. Just like a man! Mom's favorite part was when they gave the "fiend child" of her own Rottweiler. My mother said, "Just what Spawn of the devil needs a Rottweiler ..." She also enjoyed all the people who destroyed churches, clutching his chest. Her second favorite part was the guy in the school parking lot, driving 5 miles per hour, administration directly into a garbage truck / tipper / loader for thingee. He had about 20 seconds to just stop the car ... but he just kept going, with a real dumb vacant look on his face. I mean, how fast you can go to the school parking lot?!?! Anything!
