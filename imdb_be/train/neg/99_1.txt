Some of the movies that you choose for the pound to be pretty good - the twenty-third century, movies have released dozens of obscure Italian and American cinema, which were great, but at Hardgore produced several films Fulci among others, a large part of their product is crap Like Zombie Chronicles. <br /> <br /> the only positive thing I can say about this movie, it's not nearly as annoying as the stink of the flesh. In addition, it is very awkward anthology film with technical competence Lego house is built on the spot. <br /> <br /> This has been noted elsewhere, but you really have to worry about the film, which inserts Prevost action in its credit sequence, so that by the time it gets to attack the zombies, you've seen it all already. <br /> <br /> Bad moviegoers will have a ball watching the 18,000 errors continuity and devilish current cast (especially hitchhiking, which was so bad that he make me laugh a little), and Hardgore kudos for getting and the spirit of things, releasing the seal so bad it felt like I was watching some beat home videos in a campaign. <br /> <br /> terrible, terrible things. We've all done things like this, when we got into the hands of the camera, but common sense prevails and these films languish in our closets somewhere. Avoid.
