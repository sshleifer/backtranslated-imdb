... but I'm not one of them. Caro Diario, at least, was watchable two-thirds of the time, but boring and self-centered the third section of this film has given us a taste of what was to happen in this very self-indulgent mess. Moretti says he feels the need to make this film, but does not want, while the viewer feels that he should stick to it, but in fact does not want to. A film about Italian politics and elections can be exciting, but it's not the same movie. At one point, Moretti and his friends stand outside the headquarters of the Communist Party, discussing the interview, they are going to spend with the leaders of the party inside, but this is typical for this film, which we never get to see anything of them. Inserted with the political nonsense Moretti is an event that led to the birth of his son, and the next shot home movie about it with the child, and later Pietro baby (the film takes us in a few years, and more than one election period). We continue to expect to see some finite sequence or a convincing argument, but they never come. For example, I doubt that I would have the patience to ever sit through the film again Nanni Moretti. He manages to do an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity.
