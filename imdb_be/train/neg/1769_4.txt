First I watched 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): Campy vampire, like Stephen King film has so many amazing and goofy items that you start laughing at the strangeness of about 3/4 of the way to the cinema and you wonder where the film may have a cult for King supporters. This story of a mother and son who are lunatics (form changes the type of cat, meat eating, life needs, near-extinct breed of humanoid), moving from town to town in search of virgins to eat to keep themselves alive. They fall into a fairly normal upper class people, except they are secret lovers and cat hanging around outside their home, day and night. Cats are harmful to them, so they have set traps in their yard to try to keep the population down. We'll see them break the neck a couple when they attack (which is also the first in my movie-going experience) --- hope no real cats were harmed in the making of the film. Boy after a sweet girl, that he has a crush until it becomes a "lunatic" and then he just wants her body. There are so many mannerisms uniqueness of this film, it might be better if it was a total satirical comedy about suburban life, but the director instead of trying to scare you every few minutes, until you do not want it to just get over it and to bring dried blood . In the end, what's going on, and the film is winding down a typical Stephen King bleak ending. The film is interesting because humor King comes through more than usual, but his strangeness is also present and you have a movie that his fans will probably like and need to have in their collection, but also as a learning experience cinema it does not cut it.
