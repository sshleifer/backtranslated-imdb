Hooray! ... I think. It is hard to say. It is difficult to have the emotions of a film that has no emotions. This film is as sterile surgeon's scalpel. To set up, it has several stone columns, some of the stone seat, a pair of stone crosses and a few stone cast. They have no emotions! The only thing that saves this film is the fact that Hamlet and Hamlet strangely written piece of literature. Dubbing is really not all that bad, though. Voice stuck right stupid, gloomy, sad, life sucking the atmosphere of the film gave. I saw this version of Hamlet at the fabulous Mystery Science Theater 3000 three times, and each of the three times I was on the verge of eliminating television, despite its MST 3K. <br /> <br /> I do not go up the production of the drama that deserves much better.
