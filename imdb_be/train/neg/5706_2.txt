This film, as thousands of films "cat and mouse", which preceded it. (The following may look like a spoiler, but it's really just describes the great films class) There is a hot-wise the main character, his blunt, but well-meaning sidekick with his ridiculous attempts to humorous comments, initially hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who is the inevitable " hardly "a love story, favorite people were taken hostage, and of course the evil enemy careless with his tough henchmen. Everyone has seen a ton of movies already and the "National Treasure", as well as any of them, only slightly modified packaging. Each course of history was easy to predict (and I can assure you that I am not the sharpest tool in the shed). I'm tired of feeling tricked out of money after leaving the theater of a Hollywood movie, and if you ever feel that too, heed my warning; stay mile from this film.
