The last couple of weeks in the life of a dead homeless women say in retrospect. Like a tramp, movie aimlessly and rather pointless. Mono, lazy, gloomy, and drug addiction title character, entirely cute and Bonner does little to make it interesting. Although there are some pretentious dialogue, trying to explain why Mona chose this miserable life, her motives have never entirely clear. The episodic nature of the film, with some random characters, it becomes tedious after a while, making it seem so much more than its duration. In addition, it is difficult to believe that an attractive young homeless woman will not attract more attention from men.
