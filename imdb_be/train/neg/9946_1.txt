SPOILERS The MI <br /> <br /> My High School have done everything possible to try to motivate us for the exams. But the most memorable method that they used to get us in the right state of mind was a guest who was none other than the beloved son of the Australian kickboxing Stan "The Man" Longinidis. The first mistake they made was to give this guy a microphone, because he cried half the time, despite us sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away. Now, his speech was full of the usual "if you fail to prepare, then prepare to fail" things, but there have been various occasions when I got really worked up. Man standing in front of us a sermon as throughout his life he did everything for himself and no one else. He was offered a lot of deals in the past, to give up kick-boxing, but he never took his eyes off the prize becomes the greatest kick-boxer Australia. He said that he was not a full house, he was happy, and retired, he had never been involved in any other activity except kickboxing ?? Then he hooked his film. Yes, you heard right, he plugged his new film. When he talked about it, he got a woman to come and delay the poster advertising, and then he showed this crappy 4 minute clip this abominable movie called "Trojan warrior." (All this time, before he was defeated by Gurkan Ozkan in his last fight career (for now)) <br /> <br /> Stan plays the Ajax, kick-boxing ex-Special Forces agent who is drawn into a seedy underworld Melbourne. Ajax cousin, Theo (Arthur Angel) has recently sold out (well, at least, Stan Sun deviate too far from all) the feds, and as a result of the course from all walks of organized crime. Ajax and Theo get into all sorts of absurd situations, fighting in kebab shop to drawing playboys into slavery party. It's pretty funny, but if Silverstein was actually tends to make a reliable film here, this person should never be handed over to the camera again. <br /> <br /> I'll admit, I was really pumping, to see it. I love action movies, even if they are banal, and especially if it is installed in my own backyard. But the fact that I was introduced to the film was the action that was horrible from the word "go", and continued to do so after the words "for the love of God, please make it stop!" Podagovory have been introduced, and not even touched again after they came out in the open air, the characters were just thrown in for absolutely no reason, and the majority of over-the-choreographer fight scenes, which are not even remotely reflect the actual talent STE kickboxing. The cast consisted of useless cameo appearances only on remote known (Dermot Brereton, Ma RK «Chopper» Reading and Greg Matthews). All the while, you sit there and play a guessing game as to who stands there in the background. It is a pity that the film strongly depends on split-second appearances of former celebrities. Remember those plot holes, I told you about? Ajax once a time, apparently, closed, wrongly accused of murdering his wife. Now we hear that Ajax was in the special forces in one sentence in the WHOLE film, and then leave it for sodomy. This is followed by another proposal that urges the Ajax, to help the same people who mistakenly blocked it. Then, get it in the end, he showed Ajax that his wife is not really dead, but was sold into prostitution. Do we see it? No. Whether the Ajax, to find her as soon as he hears it? No. Now this marriage! <br /> <br /> Among all this annoying child's shit, some website described this film as "?? a cross between Jackie Chan & Guy Ritchie ?? ». Was this man ever sat down and watched the movie Jackie Chan? Chan shows more dexterity to dump than Stan did do ??, well, NOTHING! And Guy Ritchie crime movie is the Messiah, and you compare it Salik Silverstein!? This film is more like a mixture of "Pizza" and «Enter The Ninja». <br /> <br /> Now that you have that all the name «Trojan Warrior» comes from? Ajax fierce fighting skills as a warrior in ancient Greek? No. union gangsters to find Theo how in the Trojan Empire? No. This is because ?? wait for it ?? Theo has a condom around with him. Yes, that's right, because TEO is always ready with a Trojan BRAND rubber in your pocket, it is a Trojan warriors! <br /> <br /> I had the displeasure of seeing "a Trojan warrior" on DVD, as well as a "special" features: <br /> <br /> ?? The video clip «Chop Chop», rap song Brand «Chopper» Read: Chopper did it for the sole purpose of proving that everyone can knock. The funny thing was just knocked on the chopper for 30 seconds and then threw it on the two albino teenagers with Doncaster, using words such as "DIS" and "nonsense", etc. in his Australian accent. Face it people, rap has been developed in the United States, leave it there! Clip looked like a channel 31 on the cameraman ecstasy together. <br /> <br /> ?? Bloopers: There was no difference between them and the actual film. <br /> <br /> ?? Stan "The Man" Longinidis kickboxing Featurette: It was not so bad, considering that there were only 6 or 7 different fights are shown from different points of view (I think I saw Dennis Alexio fall by about 15 times that 3 minutes of installation ) <br. /> <br /> I do not want to say that this film helps because this country is going to hell, when it comes to movies, but ... oh, wait, I just did. My advice to anyone reading this is for you to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of "Trojan Warrior", tape them together, and use it for a paperweight, because this movie is just too damn bad.
