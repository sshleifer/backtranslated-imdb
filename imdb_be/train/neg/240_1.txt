I never wanted to comment on a good movie, but when it comes to a bad movie, I have to come very hard at it. Speaking of Vivah, this guy, Sooraj Badjatya, it seems, completely lost. After the success of Hum Hain Aapke Kaun, he thought that he could make money out of cheese wedding video. Vivah so so cheesy that Badjatyas Johars and Chopras left behind. <br /> <br /> There was not a single moment in the course of the film, where I can say, "Oh! at least, it is a good thing. Aloknath makes clich√©s as the girl's father, Shahid Kapoor looks fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita Rao, another disaster in the annex to the ugly looking set, bad suits, hackneyed plot, terrible stepmother, trying-hard-to-act actors cacophony of background music, cheap audio tracks. <br /> <br /> Now the spoiler, I warn you guys that, as it happens in all his other films, after the disastrous fall of the film ends on a happy note.
