This is largely a low-budget, made for television, such as the film is designed to capitalize on the success of the original. I'm a fan of B-movies, and this one would have been good if they had not attached the name "Cube" on him, because as it is, the director and the story of the original have been better, and this movie just about ruined the taste for the entire series . The characters are annoying and template, there are problems with continuity, as well as several open windows Manufacturing screw. History is unlikely to be able to develop because of the extra dialogue and suffer from it. They are more or less used the same horror tricks over and over again throughout the film, and because the first one was so good, it just turns out as a disappointment. <br /> <br /> If it was a standalone b- movie, I'd probably give it about four. Evaluation of "1" I have given it was pretty much a statement about how she really paled effects and intellect as compared with the first.
