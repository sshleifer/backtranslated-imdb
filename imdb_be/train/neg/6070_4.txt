Tony Scott directs sports thriller film that should attract even unsportsmanlike fan. And some say that a dead baseball sport ... sad ... too damn slow. Well, take heart! On the outside it seems to be unhappy with the seller (Robert De Niro), while the inside is a psychopath fan San Francisco Giants. Along comes a new discourage (Wesley Snipes) and appointed savior of the doldrums. Our dealer carries a lethal obsession when a hard blow all the stars falling into the worst slump of his career, and the Giants were afraid to be showered with him. De Niro terror personified. Snipes seems very natural, as a professional player. Other notables in the cast are still attractive, Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patty DArbanvill. You are a free agent ... so enjoy. Violence and very strong language may be expected, and you get your money's worth.
