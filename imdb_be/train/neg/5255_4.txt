Visually speaking, this film is stunning. It has some great black comic moments. But in general, the plot is very formulaic, as his imaginary message. If you are a fan of over-the-top violence conventional films like Hostel and Saw, you'll love it. If you are looking for something at all highbrow, stay away. I saw it in Edinburgh during the festival 06 films, and I just picked it up, because I was looking for something alarming. In the end, it does not bother. Just grinding and frustrating to sit through. If you really want to be challenged, to go and see something like The Lost. If you want to be dirty, or tell your friends about the movie is really messed up, then this is for you.
