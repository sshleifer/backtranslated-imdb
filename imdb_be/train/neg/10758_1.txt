This is perhaps the saddest, and worse than useless film I saw last year. The plot, which was supposed to have some philosophical aspects of having me as a very bad copy of a hollow matrix, with a lot of clich√©s: the lone wolf cop, a good look, psychological disorders, sleep with a gun ... + good worker and shy, but looks good she- scientist, add 2 cents of land and you have I, robot! I was very concerned about the apparent advertising brands such as FedEx, Audi, reverse, etc. This movie stinks commercialization and usually poorer commercials, which, unfortunately, did not finish in 30 seconds. I would not recommend it to my worst opponent, if you have free time, watch a good TV program in place or better to read a good book.
