Not only do they get it all wrong characters, not just the voice suck, not only writers seriously need to get a girlfriend, not just images really raw, but it seems that it was mainly designed for ages 1-6. The only episode I've ever seen a show that kept me watching was Â«Mattter Of the family" because I liked the character of Robin. And sometimes I think that it's just a total copy of Batman The Animated Series. Example: In BTAS, Bruce friends with Harvey Dent, is not it? For the two episodes of the story, it turns into unlikely villain, TwoFace. In the "Show" Bruce Ethan friends with this guy, and within two stories episode, he introduces in the unlikely villain Clayface. This is just a small example (it may not even be true), but in general, this is the worst attempt Batman series. And that's saying something.
