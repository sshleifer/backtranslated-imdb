It became a blockbuster? My God, I do not know where to start, why this movie sucked too much. The film was predictable and there was no originality. The only thing that I admire is the acting of some characters. The film was too bright, they have to do something with light, for example. making the environment more dark. They make up some dead characters make this movie look like a horror film in 1970. It's 2006! People are not frightened by other people who wear heavy makeup. Most horror scenes we are from Asia or other Hollywood horror movies. Total rip off! That's why I do not watch Filipino movies. The only reason why so many people "screaming" while watching this film because of the match. How many times do we have to copy scenes from The Ring and improvise is that, instead of a girl who comes out of the TV, it is now coming out of the window in the neighborhood? No matter how you put it, it is still a rip off. If you want a good horror film, go watch the 50 best horror film listed on this site.
