When I refer to as the Malice noir I am not likening him to such masterpieces as Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity and The Maltese Falcon, nor I comparisons Becker director Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer and Luis Bunuel. I simply registering a protest against the darkness that permeates this film from beginning to end, to such an extent that most of the time you just can not understand what is happening. I understand the darkness in night scenes, but the film was dark even in bright daylight, for whatever reason, I'm guessing to understand. As it is, however, would not make a big difference when the director Becker shot him in the dark.
