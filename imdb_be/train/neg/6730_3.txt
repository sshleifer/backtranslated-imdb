This film is about how men think women think about love. No woman describes a one night sexual encounter and declares his love story. <br /> <br /> Out of ten monologues, I felt really only three had any truth rings through them. I kept waiting for the film to get better, and it was not much, but better than never enough. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting concept, and I wanted it to be good, but it never succeeded. Maybe if they were it would work really love stories.
