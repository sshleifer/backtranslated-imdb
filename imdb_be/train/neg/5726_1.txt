An obvious attempt to cash in on the class Hostel / Saw noise, my expectations from this film were low (very low!), And yet it still managed to disappoint on every level. Actions so bad that not even funny, the story line does not exist, and only fear was to realize that I wasted 1 hour 21 minutes to watch it! I am surprised to note that 34 people gave him a rating of 10 stars. I can only suspect that 33 of them Cast and crew. 34 I might Director mother? - although I'm sure it will be even difficult to go higher than 2! Additional facilities include a DVD for an hour, "the product" feature. The question arises: "Why?" (Though perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do!). Avoid at all costs.
