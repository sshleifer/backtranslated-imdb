Remake themselves, and it can not come close to capturing the charm of the original. The extreme length is more than a few yawn inducing parts. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film lacks style, and mostly it is not enough talent, not only the current, but the direction, sets, costumes, etc. are all below par. It has a blatant disregard for period detail. Vanessa Williams is the only cast member showing any sense of smell, Tyne Daly is not so bad. They were left alone. singing ranges well (Vanessa Williams) to poor (all others). See the original one thousand nine hundred sixty-three version and skip this one. There is not much here to recommend.
