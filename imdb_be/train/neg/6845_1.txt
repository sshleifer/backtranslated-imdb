"I went to the cinema to see" Beat Street "/ it was not bad, it was a sort of" neat / "Krush Groove» was a movie that I do not mind / but when it came to the "Rappin ', I drew a line ". Word to your mother. <br /> <br /> He wants me to stop? <br /> <br /> This is just a small example of a stupa-style ash Rhymin 'on display in this film waste and location permits, this film seriously wack (Thats 80th only speak f * Cking terrible). As an entertainer, Mario Van Peebles is one hell of an actor. And as an actor Mario Van Peebles is one hell of bodybuilders. <br /> <br /> Any movie that calls itself «Rappin» is better put on the highest level of the genre at the time. So why is a 6-year transition in the aisles, even in those days, when the standards were so socks-to «Webster» -LOW? Since this weak rap. So weak that not even Beth or Comedy Central will touch it with a 10-foot gold rope chain. <br /> <br /> Blondie «Rapture» is the definition poetry next to the Dr. Suess bit in the hood. So do not be Boobie, avoid this movie! <br /> <br />
