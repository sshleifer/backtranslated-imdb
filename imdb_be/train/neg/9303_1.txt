I am writing this review after seeing it a few months ago .... trailer looked quite promising for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie. It's a complete joke .... and literally spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror, as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), they even had the audacity to compare themselves on the back cover. The producer, who played Brandon to go flip burgers and serve greasy hamburgers .... hell, he can not be a good thing, either! The lighting was bad bad bad, and big annoyance through the film out, you could not even see the face of the actor time. I do not even remember the rest of the actors who really sad, bad they did impress you, to make them memorable not. That's all the time I'm spending on this review Please stay as far away as you can from this heap of garbage, even if you get it for 25 cents to do this is to buy her a piece of gum at least it will keep you entertained! <, Br /> <br /> If you want a low budget to meet good quality, much better than this ... then check out the film Jeff Hayes .... because it takes talent to make it in horror, and the child has it! <, Br /> <br /> I gave it only 1 star for the cover .... that's the only thing worth abut loving this so-called "filmÂ» <br /> <br /> -Rick Blalock
