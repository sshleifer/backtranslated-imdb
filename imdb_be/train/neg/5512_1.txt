Put this DVD Flick in the time capsule, and this is definitely illustrations for future generations a perfect example of a friend who will ensure that the minimum rating on a 1-to-10-star scale. <br /> <br /> Bill Cosby, and Ray Romano was at the top - in the ratings, and tens of millions of profits per year - with their TV series. However, one does not have success in the big screen offers. This is also true for other TV personalities - perhaps because many of the stories that are presented for two hours or so, it seems, are more suitable for either 10 minutes of the monastery or in the best case, 22 or 23 minutes of drama during the half hour program. <br /> <br /> This film, however, does not have a single item that would justify two or three minutes of time on MAD TV, SNL, or elsewhere on the screen or on stage. <, Br /> <br /> its emergence date is listed as 2002, but the release date - only on DVD - shown in 2004 and was filmed shortly before the death of Rodney Dangerfield, so his friend merit is that he, probably provided in the lease several hundred thousand dollars for his successor. <br /> <br /> I've never heard about it, but did not find it when you turn on my set, and sincerely carried away by it. Some movies are so truly terrible that they estimate a kind of top rankings in the opposite direction - so bad that you can move the disk back to 9 or 10. "Plan 9 from Outer Space" is the best example - and Bruce Jenner / Village people opus, "can not stop the music," is quite different. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film does not even there. even if the earlier work of Rodney (as well as some of his fellow cast members) are not justified "Citizen Kane" or "Casablanca" there were many moments of humor and history of security by m nshay least a modicum of interest. <, br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this presentation does not seem to have a single minute worth up to two of these materials.
