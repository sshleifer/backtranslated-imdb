When I borrowed this movie from one another (fortunately, I did not buy it) on the packaging (which really looked bad and ugly) it was published "The ultimate vampire horror". After seeing it, I thought that the marketing company is likely to be more expensive than the film itself. "History" begins when a teenager (surprise!) Pursues some vampire / zombie creatures. <br /> <br /> Lighting, sound and everything reminds me of my first attempt to make a holiday video to a ten year old VHS-system, if not worse. I gave the film 2 out of 10 and only because a promotional t-shirts look cool. I do not want to di≈ü film student or splatter-movie as a whole, but I've seen and I've seen Braindead 20-dollar budget film of the students, which was ten times better than this crap.
