Like most of Ben Affleck, comedy is dry and the story is predictable. That is, if you want to call it history. Many items were left connected without any thought at all. I want to thank the director for not explaining the points better. I say this because it would have meant torture would last longer. As for the failure of any of Ben Affleck, this one is no exception and vitality only other actors. Even then, acting for the most part was far-fetched and not believable. Trip down memory lane with the actors I have not seen is not worth the price of admission in recent years. Everyone thought that it must be said that they too rapidly joining the ranks of the "have-been". My choice was to wait for my car to be fixed or watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. Overall, I would give him a laugh ... mainly because it's all I got out of it.
