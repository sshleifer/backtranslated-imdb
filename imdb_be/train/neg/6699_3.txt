"Elzhi, Miner" is one bad and unfunny comedy silent. slapstick timing is completely off. This kind of humor with specific sequences that make you wonder if they need to be funny or not. However, the actual quality of the film has nothing to do. It is a must to view the movie buffs, mainly because it is one of the earliest examples of gay cinema. The protagonist Elzhi is an effeminate man, acting much like a stereotypical "violet" common in many early films. The film has a total time of homophobia. "Elzhi, Shakhtar" pretty awful but exciting from a historical perspective. (3/10)
