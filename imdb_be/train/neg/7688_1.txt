Scary movie, made on a budget of about $ 9.99. Very obvious miniature sets that are used, the poor action and terrible plot against foreigners who use discarded meat from the butcher shop as a fuel for his spaceship. The film contains blood (not enough to bother) and the symbol of a Eggbeater replaces one of his hands. (Yes, you read that right.) <br /> <br /> One saving grace was the song performed at the "Talent Show" (how's that for irony?) According to the punk / new wave band that I think was called "I of "m Thermal claim MissileÂ». In addition, it is not worth your time, not even the "so bad it's good" level. See if you're in a cheesy alien movie, but someone else has to stay away. <br /> <br /> Qualification: 1 of 10
