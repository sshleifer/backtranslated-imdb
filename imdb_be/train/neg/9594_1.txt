I checked on the IMDb only comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> I just finished sitting through this movie, and the only thing that struck me was that I somehow had the strength of will to stop it. <br /> <br /> I've seen quite a decent amount of movies and what not, but Princess Blade has some of the worst fights I have ever seen in a movie. Most of the goals includes mindlessly swinging swords back and fourth, and hoping that the opponent does the same. I have seen many good student films with the best action and strong plots. <br /> <br /> So now that we have a "futuristic" thriller with a bad action, and almost no signs of the future. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is not even any action and shows the developing relationship with the princess and farmboy / terrorist and his impaired sister. The film has a few subplots, and none of them are really not very good to be worth anything. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem, it is possible that I was watching the dubbing, which was pretty bad. He muttered the whole cast all their lines, so it was difficult to follow what is happening. But I got the general idea. (Knowing exactly what was said, would not have saved the film in my eyes) <br /> <br /> If you have heard about this future futuristic action / Ninja movie, you could not hear. What I thought it was when I heard about it, and now I lost 90 minutes of my life. Do not let this happen to you. Stay away from him.
