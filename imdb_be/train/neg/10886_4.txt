I just watched the monastery for the second time. I enjoyed it before, and I realized that it would make for a good movie drunken Friday night, some gore, a style, a little humor and the like. I was disappointed to find that I could not evaluate it a lot. It seemed that someone had intended to return cheeseball epics like Night of the Demons for a modern audience, but lost the things that made the original meaning. For the record I'm not even a big fan of Night of the Demons, but there are some things that I really dug it. Monastery makes cheese, but not so much goodness. In addition to the main girls (nice performance by Joanna Canton), the Gothic girl and sweet Barbie cameo from almost all the characters have been painfully unsympathetic, purulent in absolute low levels idiotic, offensive jockhood. The film is then severely hampered by a complete lack of gratuitous nudity, which means that, given the terrible dialogue, it is difficult to observe and difficult to evaluate the good moments of the film. Evil nuns original in design and get a lot of good scenes, but not scared them, of course, cool, and the film is also a fair amount of careful field gore. Toward the end, when Barbie on stage the film becomes a very interesting reason for all the disgusting men are dead, but his evil nun scrape madness. Stylized direction and sometimes gives good results, although sometimes the camera is simply moving too fast. In general, it was a film where good beaming moments for me simply can not do for what I hated. Want more like this kind of film can also enjoy a lot more, but it was not a good time for me.
