If it is based on the relationship of the present life, as alleged, between Ms. Curtin and Mr. Levinson, I am very happy, I do not know them personally. It is painfully slow, and both characters take stupid pills freely throughout the movie, and the song is played on the ground. Many stupid scene with people acting stupid does not make for a comedy.
