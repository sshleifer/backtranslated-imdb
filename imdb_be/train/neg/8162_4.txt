Your attitude going into the Prom Night II will determine how much pleasure you take away from the film. If you expect a masterpiece of horrors, look elsewhere. If you like movies mannerisms, which are quite fun to watch unfold, you'll like it. Lisa Schrage has the time of her life playing the best channels for Mary L and Wendy Lloyd rage Schrage perfectly during her "possessed." <br /> <br /> I do not classic cinema, but a fun way to kill a couple of hours with the wicked isolation. <br /> <br />
