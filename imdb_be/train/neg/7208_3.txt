I grew up watching the old cartoon Inspector Gadget as a child. It was like Get Smart for children. Bumbling fool can not solve a single case, and all the work is done talking walk dog's brain and his niece Penny. I heard a live-action movie was decent, so I checked it in the library. I made this film for free and felt that I had to pay to see this. <br /> <br /> Broderick is not in any hummingbird Don Adams acts as the voice of the gadget. His voice was not the case. The girl who played Penny looked nothing like the cartoon Penny. She is brunette, where the cartoon version was blonde with pigtails. But it really does a decent job considering the fact that she had to work. Dabney Coleman gives a good idea as Cheif Quimby. Saldy he never concealed any odd places, or explode messages gave him a chance for Gadget. <br /> <br /> Gadget Mobile was wrong. He never told in the series, and it was great. Why do they do it? <br /> <br /> The gadget was too smart in this film. In the show, he was a complete idiot. Here he was half-decent intellect. He would have worked better if he was an idiot. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is butchered phrase. Borderick says "militant teetotaler." It should always be «Wowsers». It sounds lame from outside "with". I was upset when they showed previews, and they do not have the correct phrase. <br /> <br /> The only decent gags were in the credits. Lacky for the claws is in front of a support group for recovery Henchmen / assistants. Who is sitting in the audience, Mr. T, Richard Keil aka Jaws Bond fame, Herve Villacheze like, Oddjob, Kato and more. We are talking about a single part, I laughed. <br /> <br /> The other end, where Penny check here gadget hours and tells the brain to say something. Don Adams dog's voice says, "The brain is not in right now. Please leave your name at the sound of a duck. Woof. " Of course, it's not funny to laugh, just a nice piece of nostalgia to hear Adams in the film. He should have at least voiced by the stupid car. <br /> <br /> The children like it, who are over 13 years old will not be. <br /> <br />
