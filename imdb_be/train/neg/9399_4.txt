Trinity Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong, and James Gleason play Coney Island carnys competes arm Ginger Rogers, a working gal who sells salt water iris. With the outbreak of World War II, the trio recruit and pursue Ginger afar. The first half of this production RKO Pathe is hard, with three men lead chewing scenery from digested jokes and "instantaneous" dialog, which is rapidly growing tiresome. The second half focuses on the sequence of actions the US Navy pursued the German trade cruiser and submarine. These sequences are alive and well filmed, but in general it is debt and poor comedy drama with a flat ending. For lovers of all-star.
