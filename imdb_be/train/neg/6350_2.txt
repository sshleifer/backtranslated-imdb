I've seen my share of Woody Allen's films, and while they are not always great, you can usually be sure that you are going to have fun. Probably the last really good was Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - since the ones I saw were non-uniform, but watchable. And so when I was invited to see the new film by Woody Allen's Melinda and Melinda, I do not even know has been released yet, I went happily. I have not heard much about it, so I was hoping that I would be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> What I got was definitely the worst film I've seen Woody Allen. The room above explanation, cast a terrible, slow and lifeless script. . Too many scenes, he said nothing, and have not yet been laid out, I suppose, to fill what would otherwise be a 15 minute short film <br /> <br /> I am not against the concept behind this film - two directors discuss how a simple situation can be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and, obviously, the film goes on to show us that, playing for both scenarios. The problem is that none of these "two films," no good at all. Comedy is not funny, and the tragedy is not very tragically. It seems that Allen came up with a good idea, but then fizzled out, or the time to actually finish the film <br /> <br /> Overall acting noticeably bad and -. Will Ferrell is the only brings nothing to the table, and it is basically Woody Allen impression. Previously, good actors like ChloÃ« Sevigny just come off as annoying, and the worst of the bunch Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which is a shame, because her character in almost every scene!). <br /> <br /> In order to be fair to the actors, the script they are working with is not scarce, if not absent. Definitely away from Elena we know and love from the classics like Manhattan and Annie Hall.
