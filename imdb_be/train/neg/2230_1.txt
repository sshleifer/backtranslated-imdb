If you want to see the retarded homosexual karate expert beat a bunch of wannabe Mexican gangsters to try several times within an hour, this film is for you. if not, choose another DVD with hopper 20c, which is the only place that belongs to this film. action has been so badly that I had to force myself to watch it until the end. The cover makes it looks so cool, but it's just another cheap, b class gangster movie through 2 g, key, Bloody Streetz and threats. I would not buy or rent the movie if you want to get high and story editing and action does not really matter to you. it really is the worst film in the history of mankind !!!
