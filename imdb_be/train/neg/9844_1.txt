it was one of the worst films I have ever seen. I'm still not sure if it's serious or just satire. One of those movies that use a stupid who dunnit clich√© they can think of. Arrrrgh. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson has been very good in this case. But otherwise it sucks. That was over 10 years ago, I saw him, but he still gets sick and stops are stored in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line in the film really sums up how stupid it was. I will not spoil it for you, if you want to tempt fate by viewing this film. But I guarantee you * nghya * point at the end, with a few in between. If you do not have anything better, and you would point and laugh, then perhaps it might be worth your time. In addition, if you are forced to go on a date with someone you do not really like it, offer to watch this movie together, and they are likely to leave you alone once they see it. This is a fair price to pay, I think.
