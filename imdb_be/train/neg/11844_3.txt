Any who sucker for 1920s jazz, 1920s, dress Charleston, and ultra-luxury yacht (eg, me on all counts), want to like this movie. But the sad fact is that this is all there is. The plot is banal and obvious, which operates mostly either awful or play a farce habits aside, and when this is over there is not much left, but the impression of smoke and mirrors. It is beautifully done a bad movie.
