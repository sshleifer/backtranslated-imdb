Kojak meets mafia. Tel Savales is one of those guys from the past that seems pretty forgettable. I never thought that his show was all that great. This is his one-dimensional characterization of the criminal, with very predictable results. If you take the car chase and the general unintelligible output, there is not much plot development or action. I believe mafia movies to be boring, because I do not have no respect or interest of common criminals and their actions. Hollywood, in this case, Italian cinema, refers to these guys like heroes. I saw the film, and after a few days I will not remember it. A lot of shooting innocent bystanders die, betrayal, and that the patient loyalty. The film is photographed quite well and acting well. But as bad dubbing (because of the voices that simply could not get out of these bodies), that I almost began to look for Godzilla approaching the bay.
