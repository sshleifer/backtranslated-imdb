Great CGI effects and a truly Oscar worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is a one-trick pony in this film, he received the Best Actor Oscar this year on the Morgan Freeman was a crime. <br /> <br /> This film is a love letter syrup pandering to a generation of baby boomers, with barely concealed right the damage from Forrest service in Vietnam all the way up to the "solution" with Jenny in the end. <br /> <br /> With that said, though, it's very interesting and thoroughly American film. I found some parts of the film is extremely offensive, Zemeckis dumbs down this film almost to the level Gump themselves. , .Maybe, that was the point he was trying to do. <br /> <br /> Look at this film, and ask yourself: "What is Robert Zemeckis talked about what makes a good American," <br /> <br /> Forest seems to have done the "right" choice was? in "the right place at the right time" for the last 45 years. Those who are not rights in accordance with the vision of the director, seems to pay a high price. After all, Zemeckis says idiocy disguised innocence and naivety patriotic, even AMERICAN quality?
