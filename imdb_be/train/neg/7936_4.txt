Another film about a group of less than intelligent people on the trip, traveling from their original travel route on a reduced or, in this case, visit the side show attraction coasts. The results, as expected, not very good, because this particular side of the show is home to a bunch of crazy, in thoroughbred residents who escaped the prison for many years before that. The father, who is apparently a professional photographer, you just have to stop and take pictures of the place, only to discover that she was still living. Various members of the family to wander, to see the various sights, just scare. Thinking that they made it safely on their way, van tires explode (surprise!), Causing them to seek refuge and shelter in a small town, which we know, populated exclusively freaks (surprise!). <br /> <br /> The film plays out as expected, with the family, to be persecuted and killed by monsters. There is some fight back on the part of the family, but it is probably one of the worst scenes in the film, because they are poorly implemented. There's nothing remotely original, except suddenly ridiculous soundtrack that is played during certain scenes, which completely destroy the atmosphere and mood of the film. Acting is about as bad as I've seen in a while all participants (this is very bad, if your plaster to act on the composition of «Camp Blood). Lousy special effects and the ending I wanted to punch my tv. <br /> <br /> However, although, in spite of all the negatives, I liked this movie a few. it certainly is "so bad it's good" vibe to it. I made it through the whole movie and was even nice to have fun, once I got past the clichéd plot funny, scary action, special effects and cheese. Although the ending left me feeling cheated and angry, especially because the film is not so great to begin with and end makes the entire movie pointless. <br /> <br /> In the end, I could list countless movies, if you saw them, you saw it. difference big part of this movie is better. Although it is not a waste, this film is very bad and. not remotely scary <br /> <br /> My rating: D
