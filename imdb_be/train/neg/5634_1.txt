The poster, who called it "plotless and pointless" literally took the words that I would use in your theme. The only thing I would add, "indifferent." For the film, made in real life, the young and showing a lot of graphic sex scenes of this film manages to do what needs to be sultry situation in one of the ice. Dafoe and Colagrande look bored during sex scenes, and the audience could also take a Valium and get it over with. In addition, please see the women in the audience too much used tampons at the time, and anyone who is included seeing Willem Dafoe pull the bloody swab from the vagina wife really need to get treatment. <br /> <br /> I think the key to the film (if there is one) is the restaurant scene where the waiter explains silly Defoe that this "deconstruction zhambalayi" is. (All the ingredients of dishes even separately, rather than together on low heat.) This film is a "deconstruction of a thriller." All the elements is: a ghost, insulated house, the dead husband, the terrible violin on account pervert warden who comes and goes as he pleases, loss of a car accident and near death, characters with a secret past. Basically every thriller cliches you can think of, but nothing comes along. Everyone just sits there and does not engage in a coherent plot or even artsy mood piece. The restaurant Defoe goes to "deconstruction zhambalayya". Prospective tenants of this mess would not interfere leave this deconstruction thriller video store shelf.
