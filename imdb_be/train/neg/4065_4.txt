... through like-minded antics of Eric Stanze. A particularly nya-nya helmets talented director, a particularly good movie, but I still found that I sit through it in the credits, if nothing more than to see what happens next. <br /> <br /> rapist escapes from prison and demands his old flame. After the capture of her (even if she went voluntarily) and threatening her for sex (another event, she was ready to do so), he shows that he has stolen the three guys who wronged her in the past. Then he decides to kill her (huh?), but fell and died instead. . Sense latch girls (or something like that), and she takes out her anger on the hapless guys in the basement <br /> <br /> Well, writing sludge: it is long winded, loaded with words and a dime there way too much <br /> < br /> Act sucks :. what minute that acting? <br /> <br /> shooting sucks: home video is bad enough, but 20 minutes cemetery footage just fucking insult <br /> <br /> And the budget joke :. get it ... "budget", which was the culmination. <br /> <br /> And yet things had charm. Back in the 70s this kind of films were in theaters with real budgets and talent attached to them, not in this day and age, though. If you want to see this kind of violence, sexually exploitative garbage (not to lie, some of us are), then that's all you were going to get now. <br /> <br /> Some of the short arrows in hardcore sex scenes, torture in the faeces, fun with axes, anal rape stick brooms and a long shot of a crazy chick masturbates with the same stick brooms, some of the best menu items. <br /> <br /> This is not good and it will not be remembered, but not as much as in the heyday of Joe DAmato there are people from the film as it is. <br /> <br /> 4/10
