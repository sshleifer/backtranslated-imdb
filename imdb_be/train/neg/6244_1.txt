Mario Lewis Competitive Enterprise Institute, wrote the definitive 120-page point-by-point, line-by-line refutation of this false film, to be called convenient FALSE. The website address where his debunking report called "An Inconvenient Truth at Skeptic's Guide" can be found on the site is: www.cei.org. A shorter version of the 10-page can be found at: www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf After you read these to bear, you will realize that the alleged "global warming" is no more real or dangerous than Y2K fear in 1999 that Gore also expressed support, as he did the pseudo-scientific film the day after, which was based on a book written by a UFO allegedly kidnapped Strieber. James "The Amazing" Randi makes to psychics, and Philip Klass does a UFO, and Gerald Posner makes for JFK theories conspir-idiocy, as does Mario ~ d Lewis does in the film of Al Gore and all the "global warming" scam.
