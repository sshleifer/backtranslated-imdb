Oh boy, where do I go about it? Herendous action, weak plot, stupid deaths, pointless nudity ... <br /> <br /> This is not fun ... it's hell. <br /> <br /> Hell. <br /> <br /> do not waste your money, time, or life on these pits evil. <br /> <br /> it's just ... damn this movie is awful! Meanwhile Savinykh, WHY?! Why waste your life on this shit? This film is not worth it. I would like to sniff crack and smash my head against the wall than watch this ... sinful act again! <br /> <br /> Please take my advice and stay f # @ K on this elephant turd of a movie. No, you know what? I should not even call this thing a movie! A simple approach!
