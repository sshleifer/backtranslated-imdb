This film is really incredible. I have seen so many cheap trash films, especially many «Full Moon'-pictures, but" Dollman "really hard. So many come together: a funny story, actors are always on the edge of parody and special effects! How long can I talk about them! This is a very bad movie, but also one of the funniest of them. If you are a fan of bad movies to laugh, you should see it. And do not miss «Dollman vs. Demonic Toys." It's really funny, and worse.
