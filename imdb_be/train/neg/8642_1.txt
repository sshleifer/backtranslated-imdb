I must say that this is a terrible film, for the fact that when you see this film guide, it is listed as a documentary. As I watched, I began to laugh, thinking about myself, this guy really expect me to believe this is real? So I had to look for it, but now I see that it is a movie, but now, since it's not a documentary, it is now a movie with bad acting. Of SO, anyway, that's too bad. I do not really make it to the end. I had to shut it down. I'm a police officer in New York, and I felt that someone is trying to mislead people into thinking that it is a documentary, with the intention of making money from a terrible day for me and my colleagues. So, I took it a little personal. Maybe I was blinded by that, and it's not as bad as I personally believe that it is. Everyone has their own opinion.
