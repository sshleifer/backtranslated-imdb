I loved the first "Azumi" movie. I saw Mrs. Ue in its various television appearances, and I've seen my fair share of samurai and ninja clicks. I have to say that this film was a lot weaker than I expected. <br /> <br /> Given the cast of the film and set in "Azumi", they should have been able to do much better with this film, but instead it was a slow, plodding piece by piece, and sprinkle with the very poor, lame, and wooden acting. <br /> <br /> If they took the time to refer to the first film, they did it in a way that was quite loose and weak. In "Azumi", the title character is the best of the group of higher murderers. In "Azumi 2" It seems somehow diminished and less impressive. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that it was a complete loss. There were a few decent fight scenes and some over-the-top characters. Unfortunately, the film suffers as a whole from the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Kavadiri are not Ryuhem Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The last two really captured the "mango" feel in your script, while the former will never "get it."
