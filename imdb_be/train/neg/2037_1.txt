If I could give it a zero, I change my mind and give it a -10 instead. Absolutely terrible movie without the plot of the film does not make sense of what is happening. Simply boring. Please do not waste your money on it. Pleaseee !!! This film could have done so well if it is really the story of the real drawing of the zodiac, but nopes, I felt nothing but disgust, watching him. Do yourself a favor and take some classic movies instead, it is better to watch a movie that you have seen, both in the 3-4 times than watching this shit! I do not understand why people even bother to make such films, when they know that it will not do well. Zodiac should be called Â«Boriac killer" instead !!!
