Leap years stars some heavyweights in the local and regional film and television scene. Nevertheless, they can not save this film. It's so many things that go against him - through actions, too melodramatic, bad script, inconsistent direction; and too few things going for it - a decent music, good cinema. This comment is mainly for those who oppose all local movies in one basket after watching this film and says that all local movies are bad. Please do not judge the rest on the basis of this one film. This TV soap opera disguised as a romantic movie. My hopes were high when I bought my ticket and my hopes for five minutes in the film were broken.
