I understand that this should not be a BSG and I can cope with the slow pace of the show, when they are interesting, but I find myself completely objective and sad with this series <br /> <br /> Formula BSG seemed :. Action + Adventure + + Gripping the SciFi + + Mystery Drama <br /> <br /> Formula Caprica seems: a blend of drama + Moderate Scifi <br /> <br /> Maybe it would be more interesting, but as I Episode 3 I can barely see. In fact, it's at the bottom of the list for an hour during the week. This sad state of affairs. Channel Syfi destroyed them in the lineup Friday night. Whatever happens in the glory days of SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG on a Friday night? They had a good thing there.
