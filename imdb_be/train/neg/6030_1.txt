Well, now I know that there are millions of Americans who believe in the Rapture: at a time when all men born-again in Christ will be stretched out to meet God and all the rest of mankind remains on the earth to die in plagues and fires and the mountain of psoriasis as the Antichrist battling it out with Jesus (in uncharacteristically voinstvennoge mode). And I know that the books were bestsellers. , Among the Believers, anyway. And I mean no disrespect to everything. <br /> <br /> But I must say that they stuffed this film in the bag and beat him with sticks Suck. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the book is much better. In fact. <br /> <br /> The story does not need a sequel. If you watched the movie, chances are you've read the book. Maybe I'm one of the few people on earth who actually watched it just for the pure experience of making a bad move, and I was not disappointed. Especially not Kirk Cameron, horrible little «Growing Pains» gnome, who came of age in the show, found Christ, and decided that the show must reflect its Christian values. Well, Kirk, your career has gone to the dogs, but now you can be happy that you spread the word of God in the movie is so bad that they never make it to the theaters. Well, that's not quite true: I believe that it was the only film ever made, that went to DVD FIRST, a voucher for a free preview of the film, when he was briefly released in cinemas! I still have a voucher! How many people do you think showed up? I do not know about you, but it never came to my city. Of course, I live in New York, where we godless liberals sit around tearing pages from the Bible and use them to roll joints. So there you go. In fact, I'll bet with three million people on the island of Manhattan, no one will be captured. <br /> <br /> Check out additional materials on DVD, where you will learn of the horrific scenes details of these films. , .T CA CREW and all must be of the same religious thinking. They do not come right and say this, but listen carefully to what they say filmmakers. It's like a bunch of Pod People come together to make a movie Pod. As creepazoid it? Honestly, this stuff is simply converted preaches, is not it? Can you imagine who do not subscribe to the whole apocalypse thing to look at it, he slapped his forehead and said: "Holy Hoover Dam! I'd rather save PRONTO! »Anyway, I was hooked. I have to see the rest of these Christian debacle movies, especially one with Gary Busey, which I think adversity. At least Busey has a reason for taking part ... .he waved his head at some sidewalk when he crashed his motorcycle. <br /> <br /> Oh. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing. What with all the arrows of the poor, innocent dogs whine, their habits are pulling aimlessly on the ground, because their owners have been called up to heaven? What to do? Should we feel bad for the dog, and if we do, what we should do, God? Is not that the IGC people that there is no place in heaven, man's best friend? Foo. <br /> <br /> This is another reason why I'm agnostic. Good night and good luck.
