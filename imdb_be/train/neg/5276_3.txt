No, it's nothing that a fairy tale pumpkin carriage, fairies and glass slippers, but if I were to develop, I would spoil it for you, I will not. But do not let curiosity get the best of you, as this film is not fantastic. This is one of those movies that start promisingly, before betraying his audience with cheap tactics of intimidation and incoherent plot. And it's a real horror. <br /> <br /> Yoon-hee (Ji-Won) and Hyun-Soo (Shin Se-Kyeong) are ideal mother and daughter. One is a successful plastic surgeon, while others your humble, obedient, and beautiful teenage daughter. Their relationship is like a hand in a glove, so close that you think of them more as brothers and sisters, and not father a child. But things start to go wrong (not always), when Hyun-COO friends that Yoon-hee is working on, start to go crazy. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is a warning for the audience and for those Koreans at home who do not bat an eyelid if you go under the knife, when news reports are to be believed. The only truly scary moments in the scenes of plastic surgery, somehow, I thought it was Kim Ki-Duk time actually had more gore if he has a description of what happens during the actual operation. <br /> <br /> This is a story of two halves, the fist to be an attempt to shock the audience with the standard of intimidation tactics, which, I confess, was to get to me now and then. However, the second half of the film has degenerated into a meaningless fetish melodramatics, and was quite far-fetched him forcing his ideas in his throat. Some things start does not make sense, and while attempts are always presented to explain, you probably will not buy, not what horror it is logical to start with. <br /> <br /> The chiefs of all the beautiful, and there is a distinct lack of male presence but minor role of the police. But hey, I'm not complaining, though the story could be improved. I recommend that you look at it, but if you're a fan of mediocre Korean horror on VCD. Make sure that the compete-ish moments!
