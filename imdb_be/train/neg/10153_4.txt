Choppers (2 Outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> I do not do a very good movie ... but I like the idea behind it ... and the creators of the film so that it looked pretty good considering they had a tiny budget work. The film is supposedly "episode of" living Japanese reality show that sends a few rivals in sealed from the "danger zone" and has three costumed creeps sent after them to kill them. The survivors, if there is one, winning fame and fortune ... everything else is just dead unwound. The main drawback of this film is that the action is very bad. None of the "real" people who did not seem real at all. The actors playing the killer kind of fun ... because they represent cheese and more-top caricatures of popular types of modern horror movies ... and this is exactly how they will do when it was the actual show. The film claims to do everything in one take ... there is one statement that follows the contestants around the "danger zone" and you can see everything from the point of view of his camera ... but the fire still flickering on and off constantly (hide "cuts" from one take to the next, I would have to ie present).
