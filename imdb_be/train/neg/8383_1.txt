... Someday. This is the bottom. I'm not kidding. The theater had a warning of some sort. "Abandon hope all ye who enter here" alone would be appropriate. <br /> <br /> I do not have enough words to accurately describe the hell that this movie. His grueling stupidity is not even able to please. This movie is definitely directed at some of the slow turtle sandbox. History was obviously stolen from 10 minutes Bugs cartoon bunny, and then stretched like Mr. Fantastic 90 excruciatingly painful minutes. <br /> <br /> I remember when Wayans's were fun. I believe that the pressure of Hollywood for their production make production blame stern that churns out at a constant speed. I feel sad and hurt that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of kick-in-the-balls jokes with a thin storyline based on the cartoon. <br /> <br /> I loved almost everything about this film, I will not spoil anything, but the baby is actually a dwarf with a person in a bad Wayans superimposed on the body of a dwarf in. What I did like was the end. Nha resolution of the film, but the actual end, where we all got up and left. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a star, but it is certainly worth less. I do not feel like six minutes they spent writing the script should be a star. It really deserves the Razzie, and I pray to God that he gets it <br /> <br /> When people are going to learn. if you stop paying to see this idiocy they will stop harass him. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film. Avoid this at all costs. You have been warned.
