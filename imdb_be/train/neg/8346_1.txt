The title should be a walker. Man spends 90% of the film walk. He does not know what he wants or what he is. Go through life identity theft peoples in vain. It does not get any benefit, no money, nothing pretending to be another person. <br /> <br /> No body has not been able to understand why he pretended to be someone else. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was clear in this film is the fact that he loves his father and was a good son. But the rest of the crap. <br /> <br /> Maybe the director loser, that would like to see someone else. But what it really has to do to get a real job, because after his film, I do not think he has a chance to make as a producer on the film.
