I really despise this film, when I saw her at the age of 6 or 7, I was a huge fan of Robin Williams and can not do anything it was not bad. By this. This complete rubbish ruined Robin for me for a long time. I just recently restored with its ridiculous, but a serious part in the Fathers of the day, but then he went on to create another mistake, Bicenntinial Man, I think it was called, but the thing is. Robin has to get much better jobs now, and now he's back to the execution of the mucus, which originated with the "classic".
