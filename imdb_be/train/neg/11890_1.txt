From the first time I saw a little box of film and stretched pictures I thought this guy, this friend «Scwarz» should be as 6 feet or 6 feet 2in. <br /> <br /> Nha 5 feet high. Not that it was his fault. <br /> <br /> In any rating, I turned on the movie one cool evening in Tucson, on the second floor deck with a good cigar and let him roll. While my wife was having an affair, and things went down hill for me, so I need a good distraction. But as bad as the film was ... I thoroughly enjoyed it with a bottle of Merlot as I could recognize. <br /> <br /> In fact, I watched this movie many times. It always makes me feel good !! This does not mean that it tries too hard to be "cool, or that" it's so close "to hit the mark for the gunman .... is furious. And then really ignorant. Then obsessed again. This is the best of the best when it comes to slow speed chase scene. Wow !! I never felt safe in my life. A warm and happy. I was grateful that they are conserved for gasoline during the chase, because of the lower production in the summer months ... Anywho <br /> < br /> The direction was "uninspired" action and fight sequences had to be choreographed, or p vtorna choreographer and tougher, the sound was turned off delivery does not hit you, he just kept going the other way. The "locals" of the village, they were in the city, most were «Off ki", they also seem to be not to follow what was going very well, it will look like and even "look" into the camera. Like a deer in the headlights kind of thing only some of them with a smile, deer smile. <br /> <br /> I feel bad, because "Colombo" I just bet has a good heart and caring spirit of the people in America, as well as for piles x compatriots. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the "Island Baretta» is very sluggish and incredibly. Even still I like it a lot. My current x-wife hates it, but I love it! <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, I'm very picky when it comes to movies, I like or even "love". In general, I like Franco. So it is. <br /> <br /> As the film by adding the addition to this, if you like killing a few hours with really interesting to watch, directly to video-B films, or "bad" for your little movie collection library, if you can find this, check the "big Pot" (1991) with Robert Z »Dar..you know the big guy with the" TANGO & CASH ».« big pot ", a bomb in the history of the police, without opening a real plot and action are so lame, it might as well be "on crutches" and at the end of "Big Pot" I think they ran out of money, because they have an idea of ​​Mr. Ipsus and just set it on fire and let it burn in the credits. cheerfully. <br /> <br /> But in general, not as good as the island in the Baretta "I gave him a" 1 "and the overall rating of" terrible "for Bed and serviceable terrible "movie. I look forward to continue, perhaps as a" revenge on Baretta Montazuma »(Franco takes a Mexican vacation and sick on the water, that declares war on the water w.) or" Baretta in powder war ", where he will stake out a big drug lord in his own country, and chemically and genetically splicing to create a hybrid super bug (insect), which will be displayed and fell into cocaine field and have to Oakes and passes through beetle, it forms a chemical reaction which converts to coke pure powdered sugar. Then another sequel, he would have to get young people saved from excessive sugar addiction and so on. He could get a large tooth paste company to maintain and partially finance the project with careful product placement in this function. Right? (*)
