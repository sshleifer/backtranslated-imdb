Frankly, it's easily in the top 5 worst movies I have ever seen. Partly because it takes itself so seriously, as opposed to the regular garbage light heart, this film wants you to emotional to get a feel for the character, and take care of the alleged plot. None of this had even come close to happening <br /> <br /> **** Moderate SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br /> There are 3 main reasons why this film is so scary .: 1 .) and absolutely incoherent story would be meaningless. 2.) annoying style over substance «MTV» filming. 3.) moronic characters and plot holes. <br /> <br /> Let me stop. <br /> <br /> 1.) It seems that if this movie was done, they could not decide whether to make a film about religious conspiracies, stigmata, or possession. Thus, guess what? They have joined them! Aetheist gets get a dead person, which then makes its way to exhibit stigmata to open a church conspiracy. As an ordinary person can overcome death and have another person through his rosary is never explained, they did not even speak. Now, instead of just saying that he wants to say that he gives her the stigmata. WHY? Why not just spit it out? Instead, we get treated to the scene screaming things sharp voices carving out cryptic messages on the cars, and to write messages on the walls. Apparently, this priest was also a violent man, because that lady had also wigs in one e O characters during a call in this template, sharp, "Devils' voice, that we have all heard countless times. It also begins to bind to my second complaint, because every time the lady receiving the stigmata, it also defies the laws of gravity, floating in the air, and throwing everything and everyone around her, as if they were in an earthquake? Why is this happening? Who knows!?! I think that the director thought that it looked "cool." <br /> <br /> 2.) It contains several dozens of video shots, slow motion, of course, the birds are not showing up from nowhere depart and most annoyingly with dripping water. apartment of the woman constantly dripping water! Constantly! It is logical that a place likely to fall apart with it a large number of holes. To summarize this complaint, towards the end, and absolutely no reason, the camera cuts to shots of dripping water, in slow motion, in the opposite direction !! WHY!?! I have no idea! It has nothing to do with anything, and once again, I bet it's because the director thought that it looked "cool." <br /> <br /> 3.) One of the main characters he says that he became a priest to explain the holes in science. It does not make sense to me. I think I would go to church would be enough, but no, he has to go through the whole rigamarole to become a priest. I just do not buy. Secondly, there is a lot of plot holes, some of which I will discuss below. To begin with, when it first receives the stigmata, the scene ends with laying unconscious and bleeding. Further, she is in the hospital. Someone called an ambulance? Another is near the end, when the previously mentioned "scientific priest" character speaks to the spirit of having a girl. He says, "Take me as a messenger!" Do not quote verbatim, but you get the idea. His response? "You have no faith, but doubt!" Thus, because of this, he has aetheist! Aetheist does not believe that it is much smaller than any scientific ass! And then there is the fact that the object of the conspiracy of the film, is Lost Gospel (St. Thomas, I believe) is available in local stores. Symbols are willing to kill in order to suppress the document, but you could go down to the store and buy it. Maybe this should be done in an alternate history where it is not widely known, but the film never tries to tell us about it, or even hint that this alternative there is an opening. <br this document /> <br /> in prison, this film terribly exciting degree. This is my arch nemesis that I feel the need to insult every chance I get. I hate it. Final grade: F
