Channel surfing and caught it on the LOGO. It was one of those "I have to look at it, because it is so terribly bad" moments like Roadhouse without joy. Drafting brutal; completely meaningless and the acting to throw up in your mouth badly. <br /> <br /> There's a low budget, and then there is an abyss, which is where this saga should be abandoned and never saw a repetition. I mean that the main characters go to a ski retreat in a rented house and in the house, well, normal, which is not a big deal, but they decided to show all houseguests pouring over him, as it was the Sistine Chapel. I'm sorry, but look smotryut 6 guys in each 10'x10 'boring room with a mattress in it and the fountain is lame. I believe that they are nothing of the bad news bears preparation of refraction (see hotel scenes checking numbers) does not know ... wow toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I do not buy it all over the top, so that something is routine. If it smells ... and it looks like ... well, you know the rest <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague <br /> <br /> Edit: Apparently .. other more close-minded reviews They believe that since I did not like this film, I am, "evidently a hater," which I can only assume means that I have a phobia, which of course it is not. I decided to do this stupid, crazy things and judge the film based on the actual content of the film, rather than its mere presence (ie, it's nice to see ...) <br /> <br /> Of course, it might be nice to see but this is not tantamount to a great movie, just give them the best material to work with and tighter areas. In fact, I welcome the efforts. Frankly, I would prefer to listen to my kitchen Distinction directory than to watch it again.
