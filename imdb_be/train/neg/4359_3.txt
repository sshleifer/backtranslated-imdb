Wow, after destroying the disc Timo Rose "Defeat of the City", after about 15 minutes (South Park is more than just mindless slander ... I believe some people just do not get it), I was interested in this film. I've read quite a few positive things, but the packaging and appearance of the film seemed to be far away from the general garbage, I was expecting after the "defeat of the city» <br /> <br /> Surprise :. The film is not total garbage, but the problem it seems to be just that. Timo Rose tries to follow in the footsteps of German Horror / Splatter movies like Olaf Ittenbach and love. this means ie, that the "Barricade" in terms of a very bloody and detail. gusset FX is not very plausible, but good acting is OK, but in some cases the usual crap. Highlander chicken in the opening sequence is funny and does not get better until it is fired. < br /> <br /> So what is the problem ... movie Mount is a typical German underground vibe (including the classic mine arrows in the blood), OK FX and modern feel to it, as the packaging has already promised? <br /> <br /> 1. Scenario total BS. You get the typical mountaineer / lost in the history of the forest with some guys + Gal camping and meetings degenerate family HillBilly. Everyone is leading towards torture / mutilation scenes and seems incredibly random and meaningless. This is the first thing that makes the "Barricade" half-hearted. <br /> <br /> 2. Random is also the perfect description for several camera work (I liked repeating incision forceps in the advanced stages of torture mines ... or they were not material or editor works in a hardware store). Even worse editing ... of course, it is modern and much better than many other films in the genre, but it random. You got overrun this typical action effect everywhere and without meaning ... its just there ... all the time. Then there are some grainy / noisy look of the film, which is also just thrown in here and there, for the sake of this, I do not understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> 3. As the front mentioned effects have a lot of repeating things here. For example, most of the edited kills multiple repeats stabbing and punching. Its OK once, but here it is annoying and fake, especially towards the end. Irritating also attributes "music", which is constantly used without any changes in the background. It did not take long until it makes the film almost friendly. <br /> <br /> 4. From all this comes the biggest problem of this film (and many others, in my opinion). If you make a splash movie with a bad feeling it pretty idiotic polish special FX and the new school edition. It seems that they are taking it too seriously. no it fun because decent gore FX are not clear in vain in this context. And where the classic of Gore FX OK Computer FX scenes like stabbing in the mouth or in the final shots look pretty silly (and 3D splash basically sucks me even in a movie with a budget and a decent 3D-artists). <, Br /> <br /> I often wondered when the time is serious splatter movie finished and "Barricade" is another example would be the time to put it in a tomb. It's not fun, has no character and too bad for his appearance. The script is cheap to try to «Wrong Turn» and «the TCM" not lead absolutely nowhere. You can take that literally ... the ending is only there as a casual, like so many other things here ( "I love you" to dabble Flick ... come on !!). "Barricade" is trying to incorporate a lot ... and not sure you can fast forward through this movie for some broad evisceration, acid melting face, nipple pinching and classic Friday the 13th stabbing style couples while drochat tent (damn boobies hurray!). But it is very difficult to get through this. complete failure of the least Olsha, you can see that this could be something.
