Director F.W. Murnau wisely stayed with the silent film medium he knew so well, to cover the history of the native islanders in the South Seas. Documentary style works very well for the first half of the film. The scenery is beautiful and the daily life activities of the islanders interesting to watch. The film loses momentum, though, when she begins to focus more on the narrative story of two lovers condemned. Subject just never gets that interesting, even though handled well Murnau. He won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, although the premium is probably supposed to be for the best views. You can not really credit the DP for shooting in such a beautiful place.
