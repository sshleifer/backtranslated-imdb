When I got this movie for free from work, along with three other similar movies .. I watched then with very low expectations. Now this film is not bad in itself. You get what you pay for. This is a story of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but it's not bad for a cheap thrill. I will probably never watch this movie again. In a nutshell, this is a movie you will see either very late at night on a local television station that just wants to take some time, or would you see it on Sunday afternoon at a local television station that tries to take some time. Despite the bad actions clich√© line and south of the camera pairs. I had no desire to turn off the film and make it appear as if he had never popped into my DVD-player. History has been made many times in many films. This one is no different, no better, no worse. <br /> <br /> Just your average film.
