My husband and I were the father of an autistic little boy who lives in the same village as the screenwriter of this film. We were very upset that the PCC brings the film Jewish Film Festival because of the way that the mentally retarded character portrayed Frankie. We went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out. We demanded a refund. We would encourage the writer to donate part of the proceeds to the program Ahad OCC to apologize <br /> <br /> We do not want to see Frankie -. Mentally retarded, and possibly even an autistic teenager - as part of a prank in which he keeps dropping to look at the breast nurse. <br /> <br /> There was no sense of character Frankie, except to say: "Hey, being mentally retarded ridiculous" Problems like Frankie serious matter.. Families like mine really suffering. <br /> <br /> writer should explain themselves. She knows families with children with disabilities? She sees families with children with disabilities week after week in the OCC pool?
