One of my best friends has brought this film for one night with the words "Wanna see the worst horror movie ever? I always love a good laugh over a bad horror movie, and said yes. I was expecting your typical cheesy B-slasher, but it was B. above is Z-slasher, the lowest of the low. with obviously low budget, very bad, bad acting lightning, there is no plot, really bad so-called "special effects", shaky cameras and terrible soundtrack that makes movies like House wax figures look like the Oscar-winning masterpieces. United to Bray thing about it is about 15 seconds, one of the characters who get topless - she was very beautiful tits big part of what I said in this film was on the line, "Wow, it's really that bad," "This is the worst. movie ever "and" I'm not drunk enough for this Therefore, in conclusion. Do not waste your time (and money!).
