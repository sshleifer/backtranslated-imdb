There are some items that save this film from a total disaster, but marred by bad acting, plot holes, Deus Ex Machina discarded modules, silly dialogue, weak script and predictable clichés ... <br /> <br / > what we have here is a horror film with a plot that goes nowhere for most of the time. The group of unlikely heroes, including black guy who gets it first (yes, it's a cliché, it seems, is still very much alive even in Finland), seem to have problems when trying to get out of the mysteriously empty hospital. There are squeals of ghosts (very creative), zombies (at one point I thought, at least they did not use the zombies, but they came from), and the Finnish glam rock band from demonic makeup on, getting on its way . There is also a time shift of a fool is present, but it does not add anything to the story line. Autistic girl and a vagabond, seems to have a deeper understanding of the situation, but they have never written it to the viewer, or other confusing. Their line consist only of profound life lesson ideas, such as: "What happens is ..." or "Light can not live in darkness ..." or the ominous "I need a red pencil red pencil ..." Thus. all these characters (including anxious father and sweet doctor in the types of disasters) ultimately make them run around the dark floor, as well as demons or wrongly. Sometimes a ghost or a zombie is a group, and if it seems keyboardist daemon can not determine a group of six people came to him, waving a lantern and talking, he just pretends. And, perhaps, this demon can break through the wall without any trouble, but the opening of the elevator doors beyond its capabilities. <br /> <br /> In the end, we even get "it was all a dream" sequence Twist. Or maybe it was not. Oh, boy, I want this film to be, and the kind that makes the time seems to go faster, so that it all played out in just 10 minutes or so ...
