This film is just awful !!!! Slow action slows to receive up to a point and wooden characters that just have not been there. The best part was the show Iron Maiden sing in some video in the theater and it is so. the ending should watch and wait but it was !! The characters in this movie put me to sleep almost. Avoid it !!!
