Given that I felt like picking up a new movie Jet Li, to see some, but the legs and mindless melee combat, I grabbed the title. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film contains a shootout (ala Chow Yun Fat but not nearly as good) than Jet Li and acrobatic fighting company. Thus, it was a let down. <br /> <br /> cock fights were interesting and even amusing, considering it was something unexpected in the total movie Jet Li for me, more on the lines of say Jackie Chan. <, Br /> <br /> But, unfortunately, I would recommend Fist of Legend, Tai Chi Master Enforcer or even over this dissapointment. <br /> <br /> Evaluation 4 3 Rating for martial arts for the general evaluation of the film
