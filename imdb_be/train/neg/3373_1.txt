I was lucky enough to see the chorus when he came to my city .. I was younger .. but it was a great game .. so someone please tell me why in the name of heaven did they have to make a film with it .. and why Michael Douglas ??? He did not fit the role .. this movie really sucked big time !!! <br /> <br /> My advice is NOT to shoot this film .. save your money for something better, like "Cats" ....
