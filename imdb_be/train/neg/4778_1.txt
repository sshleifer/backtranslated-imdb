It's the worst show I've seen in years. I believe that it must be removed because of the TV it retardedness. It's so stupid I could lose consciousness when I watch it. (Although I never watch, because it is SOOOOO poor) <br /> <br /> inconsistencies: If McIntosh says he can, t eat sugar, in another episode, he eats sugar. Almost everyone in the world has sugar in it !!! In the episode "Eddie Monster" when Whirlpool yelling at Terrence he gets into the box twice PLUS seconed time he falls, he does not get in, it falls to the side. What nonsense. I can not even say the word Brings Home. I even did a song with my band about how retarded this show. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
