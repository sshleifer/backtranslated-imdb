drss1942 really took the words right out of my mouth. I loved the early films Seagal and feel like the only one who is still loyal to him. I just saw this movie (well, slept about 90% by the end, so I did not see the end). When I woke up and saw that I was in the DVD menu, I was grateful that I do not expose yourself to more of this film and did not dare to find out what happened in the end. There was something strange about the voice Segal and others. Interesting reminded me of the original Mad Max, which dubbed his voice, but in the same language (Australlian English, right? :) Anyway, if I had 10 good, they all show down right now for this injustice Segal.
