Anyone knows about the original 1973 British lion film "The Wicker Man", no doubt, have left the cinema with the impression of "Unsatisfactory" and «Peurile». <br /> <br /> As a supporter of the original I was impressed especially the poor. <br /> <br /> with the grim reality Haggle toothed inbred drawing force of law and order in the web of paganistic barbaric ritual on a remote Scottish island named Summerisle (original) in an almost Amazon-IC colony on the coast of Maine in the US, called Summersisle, alteration hardly hits the spot. <br /> <br /> It's pretty boring, the case that "may" be a classic remake of the classic creatures forged to meet the simple minded public. no more and no less. <br /> <br /> God (or reworked considering the context of the film) House of participating ... hang their heads in shame.
