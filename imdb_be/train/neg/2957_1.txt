What a mess !! Why this film was made? This, and other films of his "caliber" should be training manuals on how to do the film. Children may like it, but anyone over 10 can either reject. To make matters worse was the fact that so much talent as Whoopi Goldberg and Mueller-Stahl were completely wasted in the film unworthy of any notice.
