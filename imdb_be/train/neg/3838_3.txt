Terry West had a good idea of ​​w \ the film. He just did not flesh it through. There are endless shots of the exterior of a horrible looking school going forever and will probably blow up the work of the film. Also in this school there are only 2 students. Misty Mundae good as usual, but this film will always belong to the Ruby Larocca (which is the only reason to watch the movie at the beginning). If the script is in the middle of her interesting character, we have to watch the film. It is so gorgeous !! Good news for DVD buyers before (and better) film «Blood For The Muse» Terry West is by design. One thing I would like to say that this film feels like someone who is not as good flavor delivery at the end of a long joke for the ending feels very much the same way. Again, just look at it for Ruby Larocca.
