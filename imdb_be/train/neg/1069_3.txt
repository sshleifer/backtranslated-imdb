I saw this movie at the festival AFI Dallas. Most of the audience, including my wife liked this comedy-drama, but did not. It plays Lukas Haas (brick, Alpha Dog), Molly Parker (kissed, the five senses, Hollywoodland) and Adam Scott (First Snow, Art School Confidential). Directed by Matt Bissonnette, who married Molly Parker. All three actors do a great job in this film about three friends, two of them married and unfaithful with a third. All this happens in a house near the lake, and it looks great. The film wants to treat the subject as a comedy, a drama and then, and I thought it should have been the other way around.
