I have serious problems with this show, several actually. A simple list will suffice for now, I will go into more detail later :. Shallow character, laugh track and boring humor <br /> <br /> If you do not want to look at the rest of this exam and only read it so you can feel superior (like when you see something in this show I not committed) to the often irritating teenager from Canada, I summarize: Friends sucks, not only because it is unfunny, but since he destroyed the television audience for new, good shows (Arrested development, Dexter, etc.). Friends as much to blame for the reality show "Two and a Half Men" and Â«The King Of Queens", as television executives. Now with the inspection. <br /> <br /> These characters do not have souls, they are exactly the same in every respect (regardless of gender and hair color). They react the same way as in the unfortunate situation and are completely safe in their own bodies. Where conflict and humor that goes with it? Why is not Rachel's assault on Monica when Monica begins to hang out with Rachel's enemy? Why not Joey contemplating suicide, because no one seems to take it seriously? Oh right, because he's a dumb one, and he is comfortable with that. It is a curse to have committed code :. Durable conflict and (God forbid) a person becomes impossible <br /> <br /> The laughter track is one thing that must have died shortly after he was born. Any show that has one almost certainly the opposite of funny. How can I make such a sweeping generalization? If the show, which states that "comedy" requires laughter from someone other than the classroom, this should mean that the audience will not laugh without it. Laughtracks destroy humor, preventing rapid responses. Humor becomes a construct, not a free-flowing object (see Office, Arrested Development) <br /> <br /> This leads to the next item :. humor sad. There is no way to make the perfect character is nothing more than a little humor (no laugh track seems) just because our everyday humor comes from the recognition of our shortcomings. So if Monica from 17-year-old? She immediately recognizes that it does not, and breaks up with him. There has to be some kind of conflict, rather than an immediate decision. Maybe her mother finds out, or one of her friends trying to get rid of it, and eventually seduces him. That would be great, I would like custody battle! So now, I filed a proof of their position. Many of my friends love this show, because they have not heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development, many of my friends hate that show, because they have recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or retardation of development. <br /> <br /> I have watched very few "friends" in my life, but I have seen enough to notice the huge shortcomings that make the show, in my opinion, it is unwatchable. If you've read this far, thank you and I hope you will at least begin to see some shows that I have mentioned.
