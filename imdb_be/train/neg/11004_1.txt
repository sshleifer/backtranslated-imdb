It really impressed me that he got done. Director / screenwriter / actor must really be charismatic in real life. I can not think of any other way, etc. stage run the script. What I want you to consider this ... while watching I wishing to cast films. He felt like to stand in a comedy club where the guy is dying on your feet and your sitting, do not like it, just feel really bad for him coz HES attempts. Id really like to know what the budget, I think it should be low, because the quality of the film is really poor. I want to write, "jokes do not appeal to me. But the reality is for them to reach out to you, you must be the person who wrote them. Or retard. So, imagine that in a script form ... and this guy got that green lights that is impressive, is not it?
