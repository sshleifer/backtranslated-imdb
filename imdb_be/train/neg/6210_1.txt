This is the worst movie I've seen since "I Know Who Killed Me," with Lindsay Lohan. <br /> <br /> After watching this film, I can assure you that nothing but disappointment and frustration Sun is waiting for you, if you decide to go see. Hey, Tim Burton, I used to be a big fan of you ... you even screened this film? I mean seriously, that is,% # yeah? <br /> <br /> Without giving anything away, here's the story in vague words ... Nine wakes up, he does things, his actions and decisions are irrelevant. .. and the movie ends. Oh wait ... here comes a spoiler ... <br /> <br /> Spoiler alert! Spoiler warning! At the end of the movie .... rain. I think that part of my soul died while watching this film.
