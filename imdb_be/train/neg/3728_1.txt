As shown by some of the other comments, this movie can scare you when you're a little kid. (And it's probably all it is good for.) <br /> <br /> However, if you are older, this film is not just one thing: to suck -And important, so I do not mean acting, its soundtrack, cutting or s.th. like this. I'm just talking about the "conspiracy" (if you can call it that). <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ahead ------------------------ <br /> <br /> I do not want to give any more spoilers than necessary (if, after reading this, you do still want to see this movie), but if you have completed any school, it is just a big insult to your intelligence. When watching this, I was stunned, most of the time, because that only happens that stupid <br /> <br /> This includes :. <br /> <br /> -The formation of UNITE (evil UN Association) <br /> <br /> -> we just have to believe that it is evil. it is even bad at all? if so, why is evil <br /> <br /> -The sign of evil in the form of a tattoo <br /> <br /> -> no need to introduce these people, huh? why the hell (no pun intended), they do it? <br /> <br /> -inviting Christ into your heart just as the words <br /> <br /> -> because there is nothing no one in this film is considered a "real Christian", never does, moreover saying stupid prayer. so ... just to say a prayer in front of the charm and you will not be saved - no matter what! <br /> <br /> Thus, rating 1/10
