This film is an odd mix of music, romance, drama, and crime with a sniff of film noir to him. It is basically a dirty bunch of different genres, of which no one really does not work as intended. <br /> <br /> This film is an attempt to Mickey Rooney to take more seriously as an actor. He is a former child star, which is always happy to star in comical- and musical performances at the beginning of his career. In this movie, he chooses a different approach (although the musical aspects are still present in the film). But his role is actually quite funny in the movie. I mean Mickey Rooney as a hard player? It is very small, boyish-looking man. In fact, he was in his 30s already in the film, but he seriously looks like a 16-year-old. Hearing him say women and infant hearing is difficult to speak of gangsters, which is about 3 times more than it just does not look or feel right. He simply is not convincing in their roles. <br /> <br /> Since the film mixes so many different genres, the story is also really feels like a dirty one. Somewhere there is a crime site and somewhere in it a romantic story line and one on the life of your dreams, but none of them really work because the random approach and process all this. It's just not interesting or convincing film look. László Kardos and director who made only 10 films in his life, despite the fact that his career span from 1935 to 1957 he was struggling filmmaker who had a hard time getting a job in the industry, instead of to once in a while was given a smaller script to work. His films are all little-known and, as a rule, is not very high quality. <br /> <br /> Let's also not forget that it '50s movie, but it is a great feeling, like "40's one, or perhaps even as one of the in' 30s . This, of course, mainly due to the fact that this film was shot in black and white. Generally speaking, the black-and-white films from the 50's often cheap looking not feeling over it, and this film is no exception forms. <br /> <br /> This is a rather strange sight, seeing Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and his group as themselves performing together in sequence. It was not the only film Armstrong appeared in although he often emerge in this type of films, often just as he did. I think jazz lovers can enjoy watching a few of the film because of his music, as there are quite a number of his present in this film. The film is actually received an Oscar nomination for best original song. <br /> <br /> awkward small film and access to Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> 4/10
