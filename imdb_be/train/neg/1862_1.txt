This is not only a story that makes this film an instant locking for bored spectators. This is a terrible area with a terrible script and mistakes left and right, making it too painful to watch. I'm sorry, but I do not see the "fun" of it. Just the thrill of showing a lot of mistakes and stupid jokes. Well, I wonder how dumb filmmakers think about their company's products, if this film was first introduced. Probably as dumb as Sheriff, which is plunged into a pickup truck with a full antifreeze gaping bloody wound. Sorry! I forgot to mention not only bad actor that sheriff, but can also shrug off stab tattered with loads of antifreeze pouring naked flesh? I think he would forget when he won not so thrilling victory over snowmen.
