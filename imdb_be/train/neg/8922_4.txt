Two old sitting on a park bench. I Don `T does have a problem with this scene - only problem is that you do not ona` stsena` s entire movie <br /> <br /> Yup movies Don` T to obtain a lower concept than that. In addition, they are Don `T get sadder than that, too, but tam` worse to come, because the two old people chalk and cheese. One is the Nat Moyer, who Yiddish communist, and the second Midge Carter is a former Golden Gloves champion Who`s also black. Let me see now, a Jew and a black man sitting on a bench in the park to arrange fine. Well, I think it 's possible, though unlikely, but if this film has such a harmless scenario, why play up to the stereotype of the Jewish? Why are they loud tribilistic rabble rousers, taking Hebrew vows? A bit ironic that the Jews saw in the beginning of the film exactly the type of Jews saw in Nazi propaganda films in 1930 <br /> <br /> Stereotypes aside MOI dearz problems I`m NOT Rappoport is the fact that it is part A. `s written for a very different meduim, than a movie, it`s based on the play, and it shows. Matthau sleepwalks through his role as Nat while the commentator almost slept through the whole movie
