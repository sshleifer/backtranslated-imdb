I just rented Creep and was not impressed. I do not feel anything in this film. I felt sick because the blood alone was a shock. <br /> <br /> I got out of her living room several times in despair that something happens with this film. Did not we seen it all before? I do not like any of the characters in Barra guy in the sewer cell. I felt bad for him. But then again, I could not think of why he was still alive, and killed Creep? So many questions need to be answered. <br /> <br /> Someone mentioned links to PS2 games Silent Hill, and I see the resemblance is uncertain. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, not a good one. judge for yourself.
