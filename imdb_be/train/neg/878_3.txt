I can only believe that Garson Kanin had two people. Whoever wrote the brilliant "Double Life" and the funny "for Born Yesterday" and co-wrote such wonderful scripts like "Adam's Rib" and "Pat and Mike" with his wife, Ruth Gordon, and then the one who wrote and / or directed it is tedious, boring nonsense like "Bachelor Mother», «Some Kind Of A Nut", and it is. The cast tries, but the script is so tired and formulaic that even the effort is always a great Brenda Vaccaro defeated. The script is deposited in Nadir really offensive sequence in which tests the character of the character Janssen Drivas, to make sure he is not gay. Ugly sequence, but, unfortunately, one that can easily play in a movie today. "Ethnic" jokes now fully Verboten, but "FAG ·" joke is still "good, clean, family vacation."
