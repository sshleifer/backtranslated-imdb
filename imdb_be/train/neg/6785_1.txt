> You are warned that this spoiler! > This movie is so bad that I doubt that I can write enough lines. great direction arrows were well thought out. the actors were very good, especially Richard Pryor tho I would like to see him more. Madeline Kahn and John Houseman were classic. Dudley even God could with him to do better. John Ritter once again I would like to see him more. In my opinion, a failure due to the failure to fully writer. Maybe the manufacturer would plug pulled out as soon as he saw that he created. It's just too bad that so much money went into the pot if it is with a little change here and there would be, in my view fixed it.They have to pay the standard rate writers. To make one laugh.
