When I bought this DVD I though: "It seems to be good light comedy about love and relationships made in the Portuguese standards ?? let's give him a chance ?? "I was completely wrong! What a disappointment, the film! Firstly, it is not a comedy; a cheap drama, which can be so melodramatic that it is even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Secondly, the story is so boring, and leads nowhere ?? He has no structure, it just flows like the wind in one direction or the other ?? Manufacturing too bad! Mixing sound awful, because sometimes the voices are disabled. It made me recall some of the old Portuguese films with the 80s ?? Actions should be better, too ?? Well, to sum up, this is not a movie like this, that the Portuguese cinema will improve! In fact, it was one of the worst films of the Portuguese that I have seen in recent years! Bad argument, bad action, bad production ?? I did not have high hopes for this film, but it was much worse than I could have imagined! Just forget about it!
