I really tried to like this movie. This is an important issue in any society :. Sex addiction <br /> <br /> In this story, we learn that you can lose everything if you are addicted to sex. In this case, our protagonist and hero, for having non-stop sex with all kinds of women (crazy, weird, neurotic) jeopardizes his marriage, work, and even his life. <br /> <br /> production values ​​are terrible; mostly action. Oh, you will not use any sex scenes, most of them made in very bad taste, and you would think that you see a homemade movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the story just does not feel. How could such a smart and beautiful wife are all bad things from her husband? How could she believe him? Trinity situation is priceless and make you giggle a while. <br /> <br /> In addition, the scene with the black theater on duty simply senseless and leave you thinking «WTF?». <br /> <br /> scenes like the ones you'll find a lot. <br /> <br /> To avoid this movie. Please avoid it; it's not soft core, it is not a documentary, it's not dramatic feature. This ambitious attempt to form a so-called documentary film director, or any other. <br /> <br /> Only Mrs. Kinsky legs on the display stand watch. I caught him on HBO, and I'm glad I did not waste my money on it. But these 90 minutes will not come back in my life.
