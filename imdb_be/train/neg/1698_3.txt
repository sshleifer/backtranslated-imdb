Lynch. Man has some really great stuff! He knows how to hinder us, then reward us, getting us to think differently. This, however, is quite another. rewarding blunt Countries 1% absurd comedy earned by transferring 99% stupid. Maybe I laughed once, but somewhere around 4 episode, I just started to look at fast forward. Do not miss. I was relieved when it was over, and it's part of the point of this series. It's annoying series of annoying characters in annoying situations, rounded off with annoying animations, voices and sounds. But recognizing this, and his other absurdist quality is still not able to do DumbLand worth.
