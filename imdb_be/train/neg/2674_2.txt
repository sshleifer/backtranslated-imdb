Someone had a great idea: let's Misty Mundae make your own, the R-rated version of Lara Croft - firing two guns not only in open dresses, but topless as well. It's really a great idea. The problem is that people who could not think of any scenario or budget to maintain it. Thus, we get the "film", which is barely average length of replaying many of his part (in slow motion), and, apparently, completely filmed in the garage. Attractiveness Misty Mundae more obvious: it is incredibly cute and has a natural beauty girl neighborly. However, her two female co-stars here, with which it shares a long lesbian scene, nowhere near her league. If the "Mummy Raider" was presented as Youtube videos, I would rate it higher, but as a "film", intended for consumption DVD he can not get more than 1/2 * with 4.
