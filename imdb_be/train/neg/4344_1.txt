If you hit your head with a shovel, to write a script with your feet, you can approach the level of intelligence of the film. There's nothing in this movie that has not been done a thousand times in other gangster films and did much better. Those who think that "Scarface" was a kind of hero to be looked up and saw «Goodfellas», «Menace II Society» or "Dead Presidents" and thought MMM "That's the life for me!" Like this movie. I thought that I would give the film a chance, as the room was perfect for the prequel. I should have known better after watching Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs have been involved. Anyone above the 4th grade education, see the original with Pacino, a real actor, and be satisfied.
