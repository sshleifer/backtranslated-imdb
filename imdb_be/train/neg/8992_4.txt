It is worth the effort, but the guy who wrote the script, it seems a little bit in the dark about what makes a zombie movie cool. No, it's not CGI errors and software company. In fact, I'm not sure whether it was a software company - I have seen it without subtitles, so I had to guess what they are saying. In any case, my point was - instead of wasting your time, revives a little goofy ass mistake, why not throw in a few zombies and more action. 2/3 of 20 minutes consists of news bulletins, bugs, some guys yelling about something. And making matters worse (more boring), most deaths occur outside of the screen. I understand that it's all decided to focus on what is too common for non-budget films, but then there were some very impressive effects (well, sort-a), which left me wondering why the director (or writer, whatever) as the epidemic began - it will be caring for a short, no one in any case.
