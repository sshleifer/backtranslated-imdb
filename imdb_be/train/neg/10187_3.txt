Silly, meaningless chatter about jets assembled in a few hours with the help of the mechanics, who have never worked on aircraft (manned Burgess Meredith) chasing Porsche racing car that runs on petrol perennial cuttings, driven by Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace as a quick techno -wiz which can McGyver parts in radio receiver that can pick up all frequencies at the same time, and someone learned acquire and use chemical substances to make explosives in a totally peaceful society. As stupid as it sounds. A terrible waste of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace can at least clemency on the grounds that it was only his second film.
