Since its opening long shot, seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a Chinese factory, Manufactured Landscapes is trying to show the devastating effects of industrialization on the environment and traditional societies. His chant the story suggests that the development of the industry in China and in other countries quite unprecedented as if it had never been the industrial revolution in Europe and America, and Karl Marx never visited the British Museum. Then there may be a link between modern Asian drive for industrialization and wealth, and the earlier experience of hunger and terror are never mentioned. <br /> <br /> At the same time, there is an attempt to present photos in Burtinskaya of industrial waste, such as "beautiful". Much of the film is a slideshow of those images. They are well made, the museum's size, and apparently appeared in several exhibitions. For me, however, they only show that almost any photo can be made to look beautiful, if well presented. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The relationship, if any, between the photographs and the voice message of the film is unclear. <br /> <br /> I do not mean that there are not real, and sometimes desperate problems if the country rush to industrialization. Industrial landscapes, however, offers only a surprising and bitter hopelessness. It is two o'clock lecture Noam Chomsky. Maybe it has some value as a demonstration of what happens with the US (and Canadian) Lev.
