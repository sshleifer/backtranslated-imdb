I saw this cinematic misery in the dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (so if tickets are actually sold for $ 1). This is the only film that I ever went to (with my friend while the idiocy that is the "Laser Bra 2000" sketch was on the screen). It is obvious that my response to my friend and the film was a general one. This is not what I found offensive film (or 18-year-old or now), and that the mind numbingly stupid and patently unfunny, devoid even of unintentional humor that makes the film Ed Wood watchable. This is the real reason why NBC refused to broadcast it, and not the inability to understand the "vision" g shirt (unless, of course, his vision was to manage the patrons for the film before the bankruptcy). <br /> <br /> I was surprised, to this day, that does not seem to have made any published "10 worst movies of all time" list this film. It certainly makes my. You have been warned.
