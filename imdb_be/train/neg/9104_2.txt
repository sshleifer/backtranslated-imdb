<br /> <br /> When I first started watching this film last night on Cinemax, I was shocked that this was done. Hard, in my opinion, it was one of the best teen-oriented films made in recent years. This prequel were certain things Incongruent original. (Father Sebastian had married wealth, why he has a rich aunt on Long Island?) <br /> <br /> Then I learned today that this is not really claim to be a new movie and the TV series Manchester Prep. Hearing that it makes sense to me that this is not the same as in the movie, just like Buffy the Vampire Slayer in different TV shape. <br /> <br /> I think Roger Kumble is likely to add an ending that the film was, after the series was not picked up by Fox. It just seems like something that would happen too quickly (Sebastian becomes male Katharyn version), and I just do not know where they will go to the next chapter, as it will not lead to 1999 film (which is newer than the end point straight aside.) <br /> <br /> One thing I did not like that he proposed to Sebastian and his father married wealth, which is usually not looked good at in this area of ​​New York and the mother sine Katharyn was just an adult its version, it does not seem like something a woman in her position would do, marry a man not of his social class. <br /> <br /> As a prequel is pretty lame. But I would be interested to see where it took in the series.
