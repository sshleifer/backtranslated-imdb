I loved this book since my fifth grade teacher read it to our class many years ago. And I read it to each of my third and 5th grade classes during my last 18 years of education. Presumably, the film was made in the past, but I've never been able to find it. Well, my students and I were so excited when we heard that Disney has brought a wonderful book Madeline L'Engle on the screen. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I had the highest expectations. As the movie came out, I became more and more depressed. They failed it badly! Never before have I been so let down favorite adaptation of the book on tape. I understand that films can not adhere strictly to the book, but they do not change things for him! Most, if not all, deviations from the book were completely unnecessary! <br /> <br /> I kept my opinion to myself for the first time and listened to my students discuss the film. Well, it was not just me. Almost every one felt the same - to deceive with great stories, Madeline L'Engle was so well-crafted! <br /> <br /> Why, they wondered, even Aunt Beast look like Chewbacca from Star Wars movie? Why Calvin's hair was red? Why Mrs. who is without proper "witch as" costume, which was such a clever play on her name? In principle, we all wondered - why almost every detail has to be changed? <br /> <br /> I have always dreamed about how cool a movie, this book will do. I am still waiting for this movie. This was the only wrinkle in the broadest sense. I'm going to write Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take on the challenge!
