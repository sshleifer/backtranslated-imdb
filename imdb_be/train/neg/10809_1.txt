This is the worst movie I have ever seen.I watched this movie with my friends, and after 40 minutes we had enough. The plot was bad and there was not a single pretty character.I could get more fun to watch static. I gave this film 1 because the scale did not go into negative numbers. Avoid this movie at all costs.
