This should be one of the worst films I have ever seen, without a doubt. The only thing interesting in this film is the cameo appearances from some great genre directors, and the king himself. The film has a large room, but falling apart about 15 minutes into the story. I did as m√§dchen AMICO in this film, and I think that it can have a very good career in the movies.
