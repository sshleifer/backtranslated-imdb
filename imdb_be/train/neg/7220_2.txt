Where do they get the money to make films like this? I mean, there's nothing about this film sacrificial. None of the participants did not know, writing is horrible, blurry photos, the story wanders between being a bad version Konfiskatora and nicklodeon western and acting is incredible. For those who are watching all kinds of movies, good and bad, I must admit that this film is about the worst I've seen people's eyes from the attacks, even in the 50th year. I do not like to smash the efforts of people who are trying to create some fun or, God forbid, the arts, but this film seems to refer to either. History leans on the mystical human contamination, which is a bad option eater Celtic Soul, although it functions more like a succubus men without sexual overtones. The bad guys have to unite with the good guys in the city, where they can not get out. Take it from there, unfortunately, it is the best part. My advice is that if you're not in bad mythology, amateurish letters inconclusive actions and tedious setup, you will be better served by leaving it on the shelf, if you rent a video.
