It might be a good episode, but I just had to turn it off. The British representative was scary to watch. Was manufacturers have stepped in Britain to shoot? At least, I stepped in England ?? I do not think that a British man had such a focus, in addition to the comedy of the monastery of the royal family! In addition, from 2 English boys ... well, I do not think any English boy acted, he said there dressed like any English child in the history of the British nation, as Prince William and Harry preteen public speaking. For American filmmakers .. There are more than 1 country in the UK. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland .. 1 point more culture! I can deal with some stereotypes, but it was so bad that I could not look. The fire looked cool, though!
