This documentary (or should I say mockumentary) is an excellent example of how funny people can be when they have a full enthusiasm for something like this. Honestly, I hate Cryptozoology. It unscience, he just destroy it. Nevertheless, something positive in the visual effects (dragons were beautiful), but some of the information contained in this mockumentary were completely bogus, and that really disappointed because it comes from the scientists, so that's the reason why she deserves January 10 and 0. the example of false information is hydrogen idea: it is true that, according to Chemystry opinion, hydrogen is produced in the stomach, but it is impossible to produce in the same proportion, so that in this case, you need a good explanation for the fact that the Indeed ODB etsya in the stomach of a dragon. There are many substances, no hydrogen in nature, but do not aloud to the animal so that the fly, and hydrogen does not arise out of nothing, so it's impossible. In any case, there is actually something worse platinum idea: This is harder to find than gold, and I can not explain to myself how dragons survive depending on it. It's funny, they are dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet Earth, but with a rate of at least explain why they got extincted. Perhaps cryptologist call themselves scientists, but they are not. These people, they speak lies, in this mockumentary, and worst of all, some people buy them. But I do not think that a person who cares about science will believe in dragons after viewing. These fake scientists spend their time.
