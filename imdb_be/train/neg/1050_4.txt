Nathan Detroit goes running illegal games for high rollers in New York, but the heat, and he can not find a safe place. He puts chronic gamblers Sky Masterson that Sky can not make an important missionary Sarah Brown, go out to dinner with him. Sky accepts the challenge, but men have some surprises in store ?? <br /> <br /> This is one of those expensive fiftieth MGM musicals in the cast of color, with large sets, loud music, larger-than-life roles and performances to match; Broadway photographed for the big screen, if you want that sort of thing, which I do not. My main problem with this type of film just music. I like all kinds of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but Broadway show tunes while rocking with infinite pah-pah-tahami d'tube blooms at the end of the fourth bar is not my cup of tea. It was written in the tag team of Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on a pair of Damon Runyon stories), and while the story is quite polite lyrics are weak. Blaine two numbers, for example, are identical, unnecessary, Sun advance the plot and grate on the ears (and also challenging misogynist, if this sort of thing bothers you). There are only two catchy melodies, Luck Be A Lady (played by Brando, not Sinatra, as one would expect) and sit down, you Rockin 'The Boat (well done Kaye), but you have to sit through two hours to get up to them. The trump card of the film is a young Brando giving thoughtful, relaxed performance; he also sings very well and even dance a little, and with uneven always interesting Simmons. Sequence, where the two of them to flee to Havana at night is a welcome respite from all the noise, bustle and vowel murder his Yawk. Fans of musicals can dig, but in my opinion, the musical has to do something more than just a film stage show.
