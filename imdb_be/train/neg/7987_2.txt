I'm sure it was one of those «WOAH!» Landmarks in 1982 when Epcot opened, but now it's just nonsense. message of the film is a cliché. Circle-Vision disorienting. And this terrible song eventually lattice. And I really wish they would install the seat. After so much walking, all you have to do is to sit down for a few minutes. And if you hear that there is a film to see this sounds pretty glamorous! You have fun, sitting down, do not you? Wrong! You stand 18+ minutes, leaning against the railing short little. Disney should make a new Maelstrom, as engaging to liven things up and replace the dull, dull film. Not fun. Skip it. In fact, Canada skip at all if you do not eat there. Moving directly to the United Kingdom.
