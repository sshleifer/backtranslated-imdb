This amazing production waste of money is a film proof that the rich and famous can be as silly and wasteful, as a policy. With the (stupid) plays of Tennessee Williams and director (with a dead arm), Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff-top mountains of the island mansion in the Mediterranean, it must have seemed a sure fire winner if represented Universal in 1967. The outcome is so absurd and tedious, that it almost defies belief. Visually, the film is exciting, but it's a force of nature, which allowed the installation and the fact that this house is used instead of a set. Shrill screeching antics Taylor, half asleep travel Burton, crazy dialogue, Noel Coward to laugh at himself, ridiculous plot and the plot device and absurd simply annoy the viewer costumes. BOOM disgrace, a waste of money and talent and precise evidence that the praise famous people can be idiots as well as in the rest of the plebs of the world. Not even interesting. Just awful, and crazy shocking waste.
