I was excited to see the movie Catalu√±a's in Berlin's competition. But after the presentation, I was full of disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too much so for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like any war, was terrible. Revenge, a very human behavior, not much at all, manifested in countless films and plays, as well as the relationship between homosexuals and skepticism about Catholicism in Spain. But try Mr Villaronga, a pseudo tragedy, which may relate to the worst of the film's story. It's really a pity to see Angel Molina in the film. I do not advise anyone in any case go to see this film.
