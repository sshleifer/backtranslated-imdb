To call in the movies as «Thinner» bad as calling a third grounding or Pauly Shore un-talented. No news, but how they got that way, that people want to know. HN <br /> <br /> As far as the movie .... The book was good, even though it was a bit of history with other derivatives "be careful what you wish" of the genre. Burke plays a lawyer excess weight, which kills the daughter of a gypsy curse, and her father (Konstantin from the TV "Room 222") to several pounds per day. <br /> <br /> As I said, it starts well, but why bring bandit (Mantegna) Why fire automatic weapons so much? Why turn it into something so much depends on the FX? I thought it would be much more effective if it focused more on the subtle ramifications of weight loss obsession, disease, death, gypsy lore and the like. <br /> <br /> But no, it should not be. Remember that this tyven King, we are talking about. <br /> <br /> And the ending ... almost the same as in the book, but a little too Talky. In fact, the whole movie is too much to say, feeling that she must explain each part of a turn to us. not what I expected "dead zone", but I could do without the second "pet Sematary", thanks anyway. <br /> <br /> One star, at least try to make halfway decent make-up work. However, the rest of the film is left to be ... to say that to me ... «Thinner».
