It may not be very worst film of Peter Sellers ever made (I think laurel goes to "The Prisoner of Zenda"), but it is certainly the most depressing. Sellers, especially without makeup as Nayland Smith, looks like he has just been subjected to chemotherapy. As Fu Manchu, he looks a little better, and spends most of the film (with the exception of the alarming scenes where he gets rocked with electric currents) on the verge of collapse under the weight of all this makeup. Supporting players look tired and run down, and the presence of Sid Caesar is offensive, even without his constant references to «Chinks!» (One bright spot: it will be one of the last time a major motion picture will reflect the Asians so insulting ... or, on this issue, the star nya-Asian one!). The film seems to be surprisingly cheap, with tearfulness photographs and homogeneous set - even whistle blasts Elvis number at the end of the course looks cut. Just stunning Helen Mirren and a tall, thin, nervous man, get his pants wet to add a spark of life to this sad reality. In general, the film gives a terrible premonition of death of the great comics, and even eerier documentation of his dying.
