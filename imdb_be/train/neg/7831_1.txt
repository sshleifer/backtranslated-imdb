Since its companion piece horror Masters, nightmares and Dreamscapes only be considered as an absolute nadir genre that started so encouraging a dull area and external boundaries. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the problem is that he does not do anything to be of any interest to a relatively mature audiences, rather than the purpose of TEN-year-olds, who are only able to count the body bags, and Does that hardly. And so Rudeness King, and the King of Rudeness. <br /> <br /> Stephen King just illiterate ?? in general, he has a penchant for speaking Bart Simpson. Since he can not read his only inspiration in the cinema. <br /> <br /> However, in the movie is not such a bad place to start, because he generally avoided pressing the "realism." But these films are just a rumor, not a thing, and if you want to write, you have to dig deeper. <br /> <br /> Of course, Pickman was only monsters are close friends. But even in this case, it should be clear to any student that vampires Dracula and Lugosi entirely. <br /> <br /> At least Autopsy Room Four is a clear indication of what is wrong. One can almost imagine this miserable fool sits at his desk, trying to think of something terrible. <br /> <br /> Whether or not, mind you, trying to accurately describe the system of terror, of which he is an integral part of what makes stupid stupid, but trying to come up with a terrible story to his little nephew. I suppose you were paralyzed, and people thought you were dead, and began to cut the opening as they do these things autopsy! Whether it will be complete? And that, boys and girls, is history. <br /> <br /> And what about the performance? Oh yeah, he's one of these suits, who never valued life, you know, and now it's too late, is not it? And he screams ?? Well, they can not really hear it, you know ?? he says that he is going to sue the hospital, but he was not such a big shot anymore, you see, lying down (or is it laying, I never remember) and all. And he thought: Oh, no, please, please do not cut me, and it's horrible, lying (or lying) as it ?? Now, there would be a great story? You know, I read somewhere that a snake bite can do it, I think it was that big a medical authority Agatha Christie. What was the name of the snake again, oh yeah, Boomslang ?? It has quite a ring to it, do not. <br /> <br /> Let's make it a Peruvian Boomslang! Of course, Steve, it's great ?? except that the Boomslang is Afrikaans, moron! But how can you say for sure that the target audience of children, not just mental defects? It's easy: There's no sex <br /> <br /> Well, there is, but it's kind of glimpsed through a crack in the door to the bedroom our parents .. Modern filmmakers really big on the erotic aspects of the genre, a monster, a female victim to the chase . <br /> <br /> But unlike UNIVERSAL Lewton and they have no idea about what's going on. All that is really left giggling beyond the SM club and the fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are inherently evil. <br /> <br /> Despite the slight discrepancy in size, King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay Wray. Freddy Krueger can only kill her. <br /> <br /> And since there is no real tickling that he must first try it ?? in any case, that can take it, you know, so would violate our puritanical mood. And yes, horror and romanticism become a nuisance and Grooming psychopaths. <br /> <br /> Our hero, you see, rubber fetishists, and can only get a boner when someone touches it, you know, there you know ?? rubber gloves (Giggle). And this is what they use in the revelations, and that's how they discover that he is, in fact, you know. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the author is at the height of his inspirational powers. Too bad, they cut it, as it might disrupt the five-year Olds watch the show!
