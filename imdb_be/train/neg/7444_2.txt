If you do not petrified Russian people or wild boar, this film is a snorefest. In fact, I fell asleep for about 40 minutes and had to fight the urge to just walk out of the theater. I would like to. Waste of perfectly good Saturday night. <br /> <br /> Even «Silent Hill» was terrible. Heck, even the "Pan's Labyrinth" was terrible. I'm still not clear on what should have been scared in this flick. <br /> <br /> To begin with, I'm very suspicious of films that use "pizhin Russia", as did the one in the opening credits. It is inconvenient for me, because I brought a group of my Russian friends, and we all have shrunk. Oh, my God. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Well, luckily for me (and maybe you too), this film was already running my brain and I just got out of it an hour ago. So I do not have any specifics, only muddy visuals that go nowhere, and some slack now deceased hope that something will happen. <br /> <br /> Maybe I saw a completely mutilated version of this film, because I can not believe it got such good reviews here (which is why I saw him) and eventually be so completely devoid of not only the horror or Suspense, but overall entertainment value as well. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2, because, yes, I went to sleep and wanted to leave after 40 minutes, but I woke up and did not leave.
