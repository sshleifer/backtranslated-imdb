This makes the third Errol Morris film I've seen, and I no longer like his style. He seems to have found a very interesting and diverse characters, large face to create documentaries for, and then edit insincere ridicule they all gather. He never actually direct caricaturation of them and Morris, it seems most of the time to be saying, "But no, these people are really exciting, really!" But there is always the slim little beveled corners and not so subtle editing techniques showing that Morris seems to be teasing them behind. <br /> <br /> This film tracks the four people who break the traditional boundaries separating organic ... person who studies African hairless molerats find that they are surprisingly ant, like a lion tamer, a man who keeps a garden full of animals in the form of a bush, and a robot designer. The main theme of the movie seems to revolve around the question that refers to an animal, a man, and a feature of life? So that the name of fast, cheap, and out of control does not really seem to mean anything in terms of the film ... is not it? Except, of course, Morris seems to be just a little bit disturbed when the heat of these individuals (it could be called their "obsession"), which makes synthetic design to life. I share this fear and not honestly did not appreciate some of the compounds Morris does in the film. <br /> <br /> But I emphasize its fineness. If there is no voice-over, leaving the word completely respondents, it is not, when Morris never pounds that anxiety on the collective head of the spectator. Instead he mixes circus shots and shots ant together often in the moments when they are taken out of context and ant circus, showing something like a collective absurdity of what these people say. I do not consider them absurd, I think they are all very neat and interesting people. <br /> <br /> Of course, if he does not intend to such comparisons, which means that it is just a bad craftsman instead of a silent person engaged in subversive activities. Considering none of these films I've seen so far is not particularly struck me, I really do not care to find out what he is trying to do. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
