This show is incredible in this. ,, What it is and what it focuses on and on. ,, Words can not describe how crazy ET. They will tell anything. If a celebrity even remotely indirectly connected with the history ET report it. If you feed the dog in the yard of Tom Cruise, they will report it. When a celebrity dies. ,, They will talk about it for a few weeks at a time to a point where the public envy, celebrities. If a celebrity on the court. ,, ET will report it for several consecutive months. There is no end to what this report shows, and there is no time frame, which determines how long they will focus on the story. Is this even considered legitimizes reporting? Reports so annoying as hell, with a sharp voice and chaotic end to the unnecessary pause to convey the feeling important. I can not watch this show, without calling into question the existence of mankind. ET is one big reason why I avoid before the evening show as a whole. I'm sorry IMDb may allow only a minimum rating of one star, not a zero or even negative. For this show deserves -10 stars.
