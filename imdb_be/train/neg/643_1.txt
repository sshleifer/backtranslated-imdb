I'm a big fan of the series Largo Winch. This film was the pain for me. I had to use fast-forward, so as not to fall sleep. It was a sad! As someone who can destroy this title so much? History was the only good thing. Actors were Sh.T. They can not live the role. The main actor (Tom ...) is zero. See other roles of the actor. The fight scenes were incredibly boring and not followable, for some reason they did not have to follow the development of the situation. As another reviewer said the low-budget film with poor actors.Maybe next time, if someone can do a better thing of this title. The French can not do the right thing with big movies like alien 4. It was a little Brrr, after foreign 1,2,3.
