I really wanted to like this movie. He has a good setup prison, conspiracy theory, bloodthirsty zombies, really disgusting 80s touch, and is directing the efforts of actor John Saxon, which also plays poorly (you guessed it) the bad guy. It reminds me of some of the (favorite), Italian horror films. But the direction is very wooden and no nightmare / scary moment there. He just goes on and on and on, and then it (logically) should end. More uncertainty and more daring visuals, and his fate is sealed like a cult.
