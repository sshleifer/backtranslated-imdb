The only reason I'm bothering to comment on this film, to save you all 97 minutes of your life, and possibly your money. <br /> <br /> I bought his former rent for Â£ 3,00, it was interesting, so I took a chance. <br /> <br /> After a few minutes, turn it on, I realized I made a mistake. All actors should be stored away for the winter, and then thrown in the near the campfire, where they could meet more of their kind. <br /> <br /> As for Devin Hamilton (writer and director), it should just be shot, unfortunately, it had to be done before he made this garbage. <br /> <br /> Avoid this film when you see it in the stores run away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
