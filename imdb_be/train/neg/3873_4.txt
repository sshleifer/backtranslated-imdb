Alicia Silverstone (previously "Clueless") plays the modern crime-obsessed teenager trying to solve the brutal murder of a local girl. Pat Verducci wrote and directed this B-movie that is not particularly well done, but, but, surprisingly serious-minded in relation to its leading character. Silverstone attractive and successful in carving out an interesting young women here, despite the undermining of vulgar images. supporting cast (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad, although violence in the last act goes overboard. Nha cheesy camp-festival, but nothing very memorable day. * 1/2 ****
