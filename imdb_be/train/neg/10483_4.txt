I saw this movie on American Airlines westbound flight. It was so bad that it actually made the flight seem longer. The site had the potential (who would not love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every Elvis impersonator she is responsible?), But he got screwed up a million different times really bad writing. Toward the end of this strikingly bad scene where a gang of Elvis impersonators on the roof of the casino Reshipping sky thinking that he is going to return, the group of stars moving together to form "Elvis" constellation that lightning bolt shoots quickly imitators, sending them crashing through the roof. Bad ... very bad. What is the theme for the film. I would avoid this one at all costs.
