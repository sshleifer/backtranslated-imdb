Do not waste your time with this film. This is a common trash in terms of acting, directing, sound editing, soundtrack ... It was such a waste of productivity are some of the very good actors. The film does not give credit to Paresh Rawa, which is probably one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar, who is also the star did a pretty poor job. John Abraham, what happened to him? This is what you call the act? I mean, he should thank God that he has a pretty face otherwise it will be a winning Razzie award in India, there are such awards in Bollywood. Asrani great talent, but overdoing it a bit, as before. <br /> <br /> The script, which was not to mention plagiarism from 1965 to Boeing Boeing was a very bad frame. First of all, people in Bollywood just can not do something original. In addition, they do not even know how to copy well. Jokes in the film was so exaggerated, it became painful to sit through them. Priyadarshan can be a star in the south, but it just is not suitable to make a decent Hindi film. Sound Editing surprisingly bad. I can go on this issue, but the bottom line is that Bollywood should be ashamed to make such a film. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that some people seem to love this movie. What's wrong with you guys? This is the reason why Bollywood is where it is. Did you know that Bollywood makes more movies than Hollywood every year, however, most of the films are unheard of abroad, because of movies like this. I am an Indian and I fully infamous Bollywood to produce this piece of trash. Movies like Dil Hai Chahta and Lagaan were simply stunning. They are world-class films that are timeless ... among the best of the decade. Garam masala, but perhaps one of the worst in this century. Period. <br /> <br /> I give it a 1 out of 10.
