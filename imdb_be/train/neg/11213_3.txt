Well ... I see a lot of bad movies. I am proud of this fact. many times there are some gems in B rated bombs. But this film is one of the worst I have seen. I like a good horror movie ... but one with a plot and a sense of movement. Opening scene looked pretty good. Decent music and images. Then it goes down hill from there. One of the main characters has a disability (ringing in the ears called tinnitus). Now this, in turn, threatens to reveal his secret. They have done that too much attention to the film. So it rings in his ears and accidentally left ear plug somewhere where he was not supposed to. There is no need to bring it up. So what this guy has to do with this girl at a motel and she falls and hits her head on the edge of the table. So, instead of letting everyone know of his case he decides to dump the body. Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her. Well, after seeing her sister again and again (like a zombie, like a ghost), and even pointing directly to the location of the body, she finally finds her. Now the body is restored, and it is set to deal with one and only suspect that killed her. The bad news is that it did not have a lot of plans. Just pretend its twin and met the guy, where the bodies were thrown. The idiot does not even believe that he killed her. Thus, all is revealed there, and even if she had a gun .... somehow she manages to get herself strangled. Thus, the final scenes of the film are the "spirits" of her and her twin emerging from the water. So you want me to say in this movie bad guy wins. And not one, but two innocent people die <br /> <br /> The good thing about the film :. Shots <br /> <br /> The bad thing about the film: long music and sound effects drawn Misdirection scene of low-grade acting on some not all the actors
