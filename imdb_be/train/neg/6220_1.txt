This film was a real disappointment for me. I was a supporter of Gram Parsons for a long time, and when I learned that they were doing a movie about it, I was very excited, I got the film on VHS, when he came out, and sick from what I've seen, this film is not about her life, it was about after his death. I thought that this would trigger a film about the life and music grams, but they had to make a film about his death. I'm tired of hearing about his death in books and films, I wanted a film about his life, not his ignominious death. I was very disappointed. I want people to look at his life, more than his death. The only thing good about this movie was the soundtrack to it. This film is a disappointment all Gram Parsons fan.
