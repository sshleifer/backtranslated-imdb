I have almost every Seagal movie (yes, even those, like this, that are low budget) and I have to say that this may be the worst, and not just with his films, but of all the movies ever. The only highlight of this movie, and the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that AA is Segal, B. Segal have some sweet action sequences, in particular, in the store, as well as kogda else it takes a whole army knife. The next time you give me 90 minutes with Seagal kills people, and do not even bother with a story line, because the story is not only smelly, but so do the action, the fact that the F-18's and F-14 somehow changed F- 16s, and the fact that invisibility was as fast as the F-sixteenth In addition, Stealth never had to refuel ??? And so, if Afghanistan is considered to be a hostile territory from the Air Force stand point. At last I checked, Afghanistan has no air force, we (the US) do not control the sky. In addition, the top-secret mission was played through the dynamics of all crew members in the room, but the admiral still whispers the other guy, it was a secret. In addition, as the Segal go from the bottom of the truck at the top? Explain why they put it, as if the Air Force pilots a large commando (if they are not Owen Wilson?) And from the time when they drunk in the Arab countries, taking into account the Muslims do not drink alcohol? In addition, on top of that, because when the Arabs listen to orders from females as # 2 meet? The highlight of the film is determined Seagal killing people in the store, and the other 50 people he killed with a knife, as well as very short and quite accidentally lesbian scene, which appeared out of nowhere.
