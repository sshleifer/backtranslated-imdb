If you appreciate the renaissance of Asian horror, do not bother with Gawi. The film barely deserves a mention along with the A-list of the works, such as Ringu, A Tale of Two Sisters, Cure, and Ju-On (or even a good material as the eye or inner feelings). These films are filled with subtleties, unexpected images, rich characters and decidedly non-Western take on what scares. Gawi strung together with the other limbs and organs of all that has made the US a lousy horror over the past twenty-five years. <br /> <br /> The film tries to blend Asian ghost story and Hollywood slasher film, but it is ill-suited. One aesthetics inevitably strangle the other; guess what? Not having his story to say that the creators of the film Ringu loot for evil child's story, but the situation is hopeless. Clich√© crap symbols, drawing brainless, dull ghost ho hum.
