What can I say ??? This movie was so Dumb & Stupid I thought it was Psychotic DRAG Comedy - They should rename it "whine Pregnant Cat Fight!Â» What a stupid waste of time if you want to see (DIE DIE !!! "I want your child transvestite) Jennifer Tilly as its own Freaky, just rent one of the "Chucky" film about me, "Bride. Chucky "It's more fun watching the two ugly plastic dolls (one of them is Jennifer Tilly turned into UGLY Female version of Chucky) having Squeaky plastic rubber flooring, then watch Daryl Hannah was pregnant, dumb and stupid, and Jennifer Tilly Crushing Husbang to it in a food processor reminded me of my mother, trying to do the job at home! OK it's just BAD !!!
