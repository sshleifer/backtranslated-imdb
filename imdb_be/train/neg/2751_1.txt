I hate to even spend the time needed to write 10 lines to the crime. Hyung-Rae Shim lucky that bad filmmaking is not a capital crime, or he will be put to death twice for writing and direction of this disaster. I am surprised that this film had a budget $ 75m, but really happy in the sense that it was such a huge failure that Shim would not, I hope, will never get to make another film the rest of his life, and, therefore, does not take away from the longer film enthusiasts. I think that the actors would get together and lynched him now. <br /> <br /> With the resources of effects available for them, a great film could be done with this budget. As usual, the failure was seen at the beginning of a terrible script and story. "Transformers" was another visual feast with a weak script, but it makes him look like "Citizen Kane."
