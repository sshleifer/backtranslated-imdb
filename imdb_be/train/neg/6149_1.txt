I will spend a few days dedicated to Ron Howard, before I vow my job completely. Having, unfortunately, the case with Lucas at such a young age, Howard is now engaged in so many Lucas features. How else can you explain it a riot of natural disasters? His only useful film, of course, was the "Willow". Everything else, including this one, too dependent on the surface debris. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers. <br /> <br /> He can not even half-intelligent focus, as Peter Weir. No, because the poor Howard stayed on his Spielbergian forgery qualities that he will be quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> There is an old saying: "love conquers all, even a disease." Too bad for Howard, that Lynch has already gone through all the implications with great skill. Heck, even Disney has done better than this. Ron even roped in on the opportunities provided by the imaginary realities. <br /> <br /> Comment Newer Howard just awful. Not even rent a DVD. <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud
