"I'm Curious: Yellow" is risible and pretentious steaming pile. It does not matter what their political views, because this film can hardly be taken seriously at any level. As for the assertion that the frontal male nudity automatic NC-17, it is not so. I have seen R-rated film with male nudity. Of course, they offer only a few fleeting glances, but where R-rated movies with gaping vulva and labia flapping? Nowhere, because they do not exist. The same applies to those of bad cable show: schlongs swinging in the wind, but not the clitoris in sight. And these pretentious indie films like The Brown Bunny, where we were treated to the site of pulsating Vincent Gallo Johnson, but should not be seen on the pink Chloe Sevigny. If a naked actresses, and the same can not nety genitals on display: Before you cry (or meaning), "double standards" on issues of nudity, mentally dull one should take into account the inevitability of the obvious anatomical differences between men and women say, for a man. In fact, you do not see the female genitals in the American film in anything short of porn or explicit eroticism. This alleged double standard double standard is less than the admittedly dismal ability to come to terms with the cultural internal female organs.
