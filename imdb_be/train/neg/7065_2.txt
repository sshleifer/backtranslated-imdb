Ok well I found this movie in my old dad heaps of movies, and it looked pretty good on the cover, but the movie really sucked !! OK the first story of the swimmer was pretty good, but it took some time to get into, the one with the boy was completely retarded! It was not even scared! His dream sounds like a bedtime story of a young child. Then the news one girl was very backward, too. I'm sure someone will call news guy and ask him to go out with you. But this one ended perfectly when she stabbed him, and she was in the hospital, and she saw him on t.v and he said all that junk to it. The next thing is quite a funny story about a guy who brought his dead people..OMG so stupid, I'm not even going to talk more about it.The latter was the best. It was not so bad, but the idea of ​​the story was quite cool..uh girl gets so obsessed, and she kills all her classmates or something. When they did tell their dreams to each other losers in the bus (TO HELL AHAHAHAH), and they see all the people from their dreams by bus (Ha). End.
