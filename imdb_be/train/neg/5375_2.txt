Just watched this movie, I feel almost spent 2:00 of my life, but I believe there is some good in all: <br /> <br /> If I had to evaluate it like any other movie, it It can only get 1 or 2 top, but I estimate it as a low budget IND. film, it can get 3 or 4. That is, the film should be "full" and not too long passages of boredom or a waste of time. This film is not. But I think that a lot of independent films, some showing a movie skills, and with this in mind, the film has a few highlights. When I comment on what managers need to take with them to their next project, I think, distorted sound effects are some of the qualities. They also failed to build a few characters, this, however, takes me to the fact that they have to leave in his next project, as the symbol of the building takes a long time, since it is basically irrelevant to the film's plot. Not worth the long stretches of time devoted to the walk will continue to the next project - what's the point? I think this movie is trying to be a little bit of everything (the construction of the characters, and the plot is unknown), and ends up with nothing (not a lot) <br /> <br /> This movie tries too much and too hard, and I believe that it had to cut back on short film. I could easily manage to find one o'clock to walk around or mindless dialogue to cut from the film. <br /> <br /> There is too much irrelevant stuff going on in this movie. History should be more streamlined. I know that there must be some mystery in this film, but some wonder who the killer is, makes no secret. The story behind the "secret" does not receive almost no attention at the time of the film, which leaves the final "point" as emergency unsatisfactory reports. <br /> <br /> So I would say that this film was a good try, but I can not. I hope that the directors learn from their mistakes, and produce a better product next time <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in learning the bench from getting low budget films, there is no need to look at it. - I not even too understand why everyone thinks it is bad. <br /> <br /> As we have already said that I am sure many 10 gave to this film from people one way or another involved in the film. This movie can not get "10", according to any remotely objective point of view.
