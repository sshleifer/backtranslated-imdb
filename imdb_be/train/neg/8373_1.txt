I was not impressed with this movie, especially for the fact that I went to the movies with my family in good faith, to see the film, which has been certified rated 12 here in the UK. To my horror, this movie was full of awkward sexual jokes. (But this is not a problem for me, as an adult, but not very good for watching the children). This film is sometimes very crude sometimes fart jokes, getting hit in the groin, etc. ... and for the most part of the film is not very funny. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is that Calvin Sims who is 2inch dwarf, is released from prison and kidnaps giant-sized diamond, but then have to put it in her purse WOMENS. Thus, the rest of the film sees that he is posing as abandoned child, getting into the market at home, so he could get the diamond back. <br /> <br /> So far I really liked at the outlet of the Wayans Brothers - but this film is definitely taking the biscuit <br /> <br /> A bit of good advice. - wait until it comes on TV or cable
