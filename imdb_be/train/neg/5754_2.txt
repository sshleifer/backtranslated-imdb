I watched a mask in the 80s and is now showing on Fox Kids in the United Kingdom (very late at night). I remember thinking that it was a kind of cool in the day and had a few toys too, but watch it now I'm sad to tears. I never realized before how difficult and BLAND this cartoon show really was. It's just awful! It is no where near the same league as the Transformers, he-man or Thundercats, and quickly forgot about everything as soon as he ceased to be done. I just look at the Fox Kids, because Ulysses 31 comes on immediately after it (if this mask does not put me to sleep first). One of less the 80 cartoons, which I hope to completely forget about again, as soon as he has finished airing on Fox Kids!
