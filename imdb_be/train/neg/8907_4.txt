I rented it on DVD yesterday and realized that it was a type of "character study" of the film, so I did my best to watch it for about an hour to pressing the Stop button. <br /> <br /> Even with character study topic, I just could not get into the movie at all. maybe it was my mood of wanting to see something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but setting that aside, I tried my best to move on to watch, but gave up. The actors played their roles well, but the combination of the global Sun come together to keep my tick properties. On a single interesting thing was a gun sergeant steal, and he hurried to buy another, and spray painted black to look like a question of police. I think that this film should have the right, "Who stole the gun sergeant?" The scenes are well made, but put them together, I again felt robbed of that close-knit to keep me watching. <br /> <br /> Since I do not watch it, I would say that there is some merit to rent this film. .. possible. For me it was a waste of good time and effort to see. I'll leave it up to you to try, but this is not one I highly recommend.
