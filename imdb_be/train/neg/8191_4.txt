"Fred Claus" somehow avoids becoming this year's "Santa Claus", at least, has a bit more funny moments than Tim Allen in the lead role, but that does not mean he's got enough going for it, it's worth a trip to the theater. <br /> <br /> The holiday films go, this is a contrived and sentimental. But in fact, that may be less than their concern as "Fred Claus," showing off, having David Dobkin ( "Shanghai Knights», «The Wedding Crashers») at the helm, it contains virtually no drop really funny moment, he clumsily tramples line between boorish Vince Vaughn vehicle and inaccurate Christmas movie. In the end, it is not much different. And with a cast that includes Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz, Kathy Bates, and, moreover, that leaves one disappointed. <br /> <br /> That plays Fred, Nick (Giamatti) and estranged older brother when the time left him and their parents (Bates and Trevor Peacock) after it was sufficiently strong favoritism to his parents of his younger brother. Nick grows Santa Claus (and, as the voice-over tells us, time stands still for you and your family if you become a saint), while Fred became the man Yuletide-jacked repurchase in Chicago, which barely remembering his girlfriend (Weiss) day Wanda was born. <br /> <br /> It works in trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother (who looks terrible, with at least ten years older than him), to save him from prison. Nick agrees, but only when Fred agrees to help in the toy business of wrapping up at the North Pole. Fred reluctantly agrees, but his cynicism clashes with Santa and the elves always cheerful nature, even as an expert efficiency (Spacey) checks on the toy factory operations, only too happy to have the whole operation in the Arctic covered if something does not. <, Br /> <br /> film, it is said, it has its moments, but it laid the stroke length stretches them thin in duration. Between a pile of Christmas clichés of movies that have been handled better, say, "Elf" and an attempt to sentimentality as submits, as last year the cake. <br /> <br /> Vaugn, as usual, brings his rough charm to the table, but the script neutered Dan Fogelman actually keeps him from doing his job. Giamatti, a poor fat suit, brings a cheerful old charm of its iconic character, but, unfortunately, have to play second fiddle to Fred. Spacey brings his game face, but it turns usually end up as unfunnily bland. <br /> <br /> In the end, "Fred Claus" becomes a forgettable film that falls lower than those involved in it deserve. Of course, there are worse ways to start the season in the movies, but there are certainly much better ways.
