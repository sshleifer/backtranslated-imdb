I can understand why Laurel and Hardy purists may be offended by this rather mild "re-enactment", but the film would be a great way to introduce children to the pleasures of classic L & H. Bronson Pinchot and Gaylard Sartain reasonably justified as a comedy duo is enough a good supporting cast. I enjoyed it.
