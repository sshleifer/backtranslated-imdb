It looks like a brilliant team of Shonda Rhimes outsourcing the writing of this one somewhere in the sea, perhaps to MediocreLand? "PE" reminds me of some one of the many tedious, promising at first, but predictable for 1 David Kelly clicks season (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal, and now Boston Legal). Crazy cases they are so absurd that they hardly cause sympathy or sorrow. And this is what actually makes a good medical drama tic - dramatic situations you are afraid of, "It could be me" mood. They're not too funny. <br /> <br /> The actors are pretty good, but the storylines and the dead can not be brought back to life. I am a therapist, and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays the most incredibly incompetent, unethical, untrained therapist. Anyone who writes her things piled ethics and transference / countertransference courses at Stanford. Someone should give them a code of ethics for reading (the episode with his wife nosebleeds and physician participation in it). Many physicians are not so bad <br /> <br /> The women longing for men who have moved on -. This was done to death, we all finished, "Sex and the City." Addison in his youthful aggression towards the guy, she likes - a very ridiculous age, looks unnatural to women older than 40 years and this is another talented actress does not feel and does not deliver it very well. Only successful / unpleasant events are Addison struggles with her decision to move to Los Angeles, and "Voodoo Doctor" and his struggle with widowhood. <br /> <br /> This concept can work with a completely new team of writers.
