Did I miss something here? This "adaptation" is all that Brookmyres first novel had. All except stories, laughs, black humor, political intrigue, in the characterization, plot, and a kind of feeling <br /> <br /> Spoilers ;. <br /> <br /> Godamnawful, with from start to finish. They ridicule the plot, they had a romance between Parablane and the police, and that it was all about, Dr. Slaughter was depicted as a passer-by, and who the hell Annette Crosby should be? <br /> <br /> It looks like they did three o'clock adaptation, then cut it down to 90 minutes. (Despite the fact that 90 minutes, it seemed, forever.) Please, please, do not do it on any other of Brookmyres books (especially "The Land of the Blind.)
