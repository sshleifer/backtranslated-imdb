There really is no way to beat around the bush in saying this, Lady Death: The Motion Picture simply sucks. In addition, the main character is a well-endowed blonde running around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional bursts of violence, the film seems to have been made with the mentality of 1980 cartoon based on a line of action figures. Bad guy he even talks like a wannabe Skeletor, is binding bumbling henchman, and lives in a den that looks were patterned area villain from the old Saturday morning cartoon Blackstar. Just do not expect any humor but sometimes howlingly bad dialogue. At other times it feels like the kind of anime tale is best suited for Gento, but there is no sex, NO tentacle rape (Thank God!) And very little tight, despite the physical appearance of the protagonist. There simply is no adult edge to this material, except for a half-naked heroine and bloody deaths. In fact, we have here a full-length episode She-Ra, Princess of power, but with skimpier clothes and more gore.
