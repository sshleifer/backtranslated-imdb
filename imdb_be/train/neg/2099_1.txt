WARNING: Possible SPOILERS (.. Not that you have to take care of as well, sorry for the caps) <br /> <br /> Since the overly dramatic voice that is all the more regrettable talk nonsense, it is a foolish and unnecessary drama, it's bad, but surely put. <br /> <br /> We know that space travel is a risky business. There is a complex system with lots of potential for failure, radiation, symptoms associated with stress, etc., and unexpected things inevitably occur largely unknown conditions. They knew that the material can go wrong. In fact, the material went wrong. This is called learning. Of course, Appollo 11 was not safe by today's standards, and there was a huge political pressure, but the overall performance of the technology on a mission was impressive. <br /> <br /> A variety of errors / comments I did not even look up to: <br /> <br /> 1) Nixon had prepared a speech in case something went wrong. Well I do not like him. This is what I would do. It was the peak of the propaganda war in the end. <br /> <br /> 2) NASA gives green light, despite the fact that Appollo 11 is likely to explode. (It is "only" an implicit, though.) Yes, that's why they allow people to click and hours in almost real time. <br /> <br /> 3) Release of the capsule will not work. As it did not work while the chimpanzee was in it. The one who survived? It was the start of the test and the rocket exploded capsule accelerated away and landed with a parachute. There's a video of it, you can probably find it on YouTube, or at least see it somewhere. <br /> <br /> 4) One man interviewed said the explosion would have been destroyed just part of Florida. I can only assume that it was intended as hyperbole, because if not, I'm just shocked, how could he get it so wrong. <br /> <br /> 5) The technology then was primitive compared to today's standards. In fact, the relatively primitive hardware and software is used even today, for the reason that it does not crash. It's even worse for spacecraft because of their computers to be built with more or less large components that are not that susceptible to radiation. (And the ship itself should be pilotable still by hand, so a complex control system as a B2-e will not do.) What with the fact that they used the "television screens" and not "computer screens"? It's the same damn technology. In fact, TV monitors were produced with a significantly higher resolution <br /> <br /> 6) "If the object was not part of the rocket, it could only be one thing.". We can see where this is going. In addition, it is not true, who says that it was a missile part? At least, the interviewee explains that if the thing flies, and you do not know what it is, it is, by definition, an unidentified flying object. <br /> <br /> 7) Voice-overs, as well as some are doing wrong is quoted, it seems as if the radiation foil lander was actually his body. What would make it thinner than the armor <br /> <br /> 8) for the death of Neil Armstrong during a training flight personnel I can appreciate. I have not seen it before. As I said before, any piece of technology manifesto can go wrong, especially if it was not sufficient to verify the account, you know, unprecedented. <br /> <br /> 9) downward trajectory discrepancy lander (due to density perturbations of the Moon) was promptly acutely life. There was in the "fifteen seconds of fuel left," which was, in fact, "fifteen seconds of fuel left before the order to abort the mission and return to the command module." <br /> <br /> 10) "catastrophic chain of events", generally leads to a catastrophe. I do not really know how to put it is easier. This, however, is a prime example rhetorical. <br /> <br /> 11) There's a short sequence of one of the astronauts go and jump around aimlessly like a gleeful child, followed by a voice-over tells us that the reason for this strange behavior "now can be revealed." It turns out that he was going and jumping around aimlessly like a gleeful child. Hilarious stuff. <br /> <br /> 12) He noted that during the re-entry, all contact was lost. This is a completely natural phenomenon, and it was, as is well known, while it can not be avoided with modern technology. Again, the burden of an implicit but very deliberately so. <br /> <br /> not 13) There was no shuttle lost in the space, while the voice-over is the "fact" as evidence that the Appollo 11 was a bunch of crap. Appollo 13 was almost lost, but two real disaster occurred during launch and re-entry, respectively. In any case, compared to the shuttle rockets Saturn somehow ... well, well, just plain stupid. Even ignoring that successful mission route does not seem to have been recognized interest of the audience. <br /> <br /> 14) With regard to hell with a UFO? Even in the context of the film, it does not make any sense. If you do not assume that it was done for entertainment purposes, aimed at a specific audience (which seems to include people with next to no understanding nor history, science or rhetoric). <br /> <br /> Even the film's point of few clear. Catch phrases like "not covered until now," "publicly expressed here for the first time" to come up, but the film does not put any guilt or offer a lesson or anything that one might expect from the film so emotionally done in the good old tradition of sensationalism, there are numerous interview footage and fragments of records, which are often taken out of context or with people we know nothing about, except for "NASA scientist." wow, so that the astronauts were very worried about before getting started? Fancy that. it should be done with the point of the movie again? Oh yeah, this time. < br /> <br /> Thus, in addition to being incompetent or intentionally inaccurate, it's not even good fun and believe me, I'm a guy who loves his bad documentaries;. this movie is not funny, witty, whimsical, it's nothing .
