Sorry, but I will spoil both the story line and the end to avoid the holiday for you in the hope of a fiasco like the one that I now face. His father died and his mother asks Santa in the letter, to return it to the family on Christmas day, and Sant ... does. Pope rosy, happy healthy and totally unaware that he had died. All ends with thick sweet. <br /> <br /> But, like his father, who recently watched my five year old to lose your best canine friend, it was a horror movie. Now my son is convinced that all he needs to do to bring his friend back to ask Santa! Do not underestimate the power of the will of the young heart- no persuasion will convince him that this is just a movie, and that his dog did not come back for Christmas. It was heart breaking to watch his joy only know that on Christmas Eve he will have to face his loss again. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, on behalf of all the faithful, who have lost a loved one recently. It's hard enough to deal with the loss of one time for the child, but there are some suggestions that we should not even represent an opportunity.
