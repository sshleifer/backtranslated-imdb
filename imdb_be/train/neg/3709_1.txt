Firstly, I would like to say that I'm a fan of Chris Rock. I, like his other movies, but this film is the same as my resume. The biggest bag of buckwheat ever. In the beginning, Chris Rock plays an aspiring comedian receiving stage fright in the comedy The building named Apollo. On the way home from a concert, while riding on his bike he sees the woman he loves and crashed into a truck. After some time, it selects the old body, white and selfish millionaire. Then he dresses like a music group Outkast, trying to reproduce the original scene where he comes out as a jockey. Secondly, it goes back to the Apollo, and aims to be a comedian, he was trying to be in a preliminary body and starts dissing the white population, and trying to be black. You get my drift? This horror film he tries too hard to be like the original, and in the process comes, looking like a bag of shit. Just take my advice, do not watch this movie.
