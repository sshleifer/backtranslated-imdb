I must admit that I do not remember much about the characters or the story, although I'm not sure if there was one, I'm soooo annoying this film, I had a bit of a hard time focusing on it. How can you call a movie "Keys to TulsaÂ», and then shoot it in Texas? Flat desert country around Arlington (I think that this place is) in no way resembles the green hills around Tulsa in Tulsa and celebrities will have a much more pleasant neighborhood to live in. It is obvious that no one in the film has never been in Tulsa, otherwise they would have understood how anything in the film does not even look like him. If no one has seen at least Rumblefish or foreign? I know it sounds demanding, but I can not do anything. I watched it because I love Spader and I usually Eric Stotz interesting. But even these two intriguing actors could not revive this meandering, and have their own story involving people who are not in Tulsa !! I'm sorry I could not be more expensive to film in Oklahoma. What to do when the "To Live and Die in LA" was filmed in Toronto? Did it suck? Well, it does.
