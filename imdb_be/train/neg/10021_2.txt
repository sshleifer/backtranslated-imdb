Worst movie I saw with Tera Jadoo people Gaya. There's no history, no humor, no nothing! Action sequences are more like a series of random Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up advertising stitched together. It is highly dependent on the influence of the Matrix and Kung Fu Hustle, but very poorly executed. <br /> <br /> I did not go to a lot of expectations, but watch this movie is annoying experience that makes you wonder, "What are these guys think ?? !! ". <br /> <br /> The only thing you may remember, after seeing this anorexic Kareena in a bikini. <br /> <br /> the reason why I did not give the rating of "1" is that every time I think I've seen the worst Bollywood proves me wrong.
