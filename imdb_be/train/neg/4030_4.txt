I remember watching «LOST Missile» (really did not throw a tantrum until my brother and several cousins ​​in the house where I was a guest night agreed to watch it with me - I, from time to time, Eric Cartman from the 1960s - I'm sorry, guys) and was a little confused when supported by a wave of millions of degrees of heat appeared as a device of the plot - even as a second-grader, I knew that a rocket just can not bear the energy around this much heat or damage for more than the duration and limited the radius of the nuclear explosion. <br /> <br /> May causing that turkey on loving relatives was on my own to punish the crime. <br /> <br /> production values ​​of the film were very good. Acting is not bad (except Shatnerism actor who played the governor's assistant, someone here mentioned). <br /> <br /> But the idea of ​​missile Easy-baked surface of the Earth by means of the heat exhaust ... no. <br /> <br /> As much as people on the «Mystery Science Theater 3000" miss "lost missile" anyway? <br /> <br /> This is a great classic of unintentional comedy - watch, when you want something to drink beer in a weekend.
