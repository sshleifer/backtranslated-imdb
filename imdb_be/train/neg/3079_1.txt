My favorite quote from the blood was when the car went over the cliff, "The film is so bad, even the car wants to get out of it!Â» <br /> <br /> This was to be the funniest movie I've ever seen. It was seriously there to scare you, which makes it even funnier! If it were not for Mystery Science Theater, I would not be here today! :-P
