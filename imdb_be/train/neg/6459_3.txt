Such great actors such disappointment. Marlon Brando plays a terrible temper, the movie is not funny, subliminal message can be seen "THIS DAMN SHIT !!!», «IT SUUCKS so bad !!", "throw the TV out the window," and so on. It's just disgusting and tiring. Attached to bad story, sense of humor, there is something else. Path room has color. It makes me sick, all so colorful that it can cause epilepsy. I usually do not care about the decor in the movie, but it is of "free money" made me angry Avoid at all costs "Free Money" -.! Likely to Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but the viewer does not get anything one looks to the cost of sanity!.
