I noticed that this film took the brunt of a lot of abuse. It probably earned some of them, but it was not so bad. Well, I'll be honest: I never want to see this movie again. It was a bad movie. But I do not hate this movie, he was trying to tell a story. As drama, this film can work very well indeed. I just think that the filmmakers misgauged, which road to take, when they did it (they should be added more funny bits, if they want it to be a comedy). Since rewriting, it could be a great movie. But as a satire, it does not work in its current form - many scenes did not fit in the context of the story, for example, robbery scene has little meaning in history. However, it was not the worst independent film ever made - it's in the top 10 worst? That's debatable.
