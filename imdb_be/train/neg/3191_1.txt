There are movies that are terrible, and there are movies that are so bad they are long forgotten and unwatchable. In addition, a lot of violence and bad stuff (not only cheesy thing, you know what I mean) add to the mix as well. What is the result of bad movies with raunchy content? Why "Final Justice", of course! <br /> <br /> Remember, "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the star of this film, and it was riffed Joel and Boots on Â«Mystery Science Theater 3000." At present, this time with Mike happening Joel satellite Love (but with the same boots), the trio was making fun of the second Joe Don Baker MST3K film "of Final Justice." of course, most of the naughty things I mentioned was filmed for the production of television, but still, I want to watch this episode (and the "Mitchell", a) because it's Joe Don "hate "More? Why, none other than "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> P.S. If you have a Big Lots nearby, be sure to store the director's tapes! LOL What happened to someone else!
