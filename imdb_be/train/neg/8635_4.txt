This is definitely not one of the best Fulci movie by any stretch. The plot is quite bad, the millionaire was killed, and his distillery encourages his daughter to find out who did it. But the biggest problem I have with this (besides knowing who killed him for 10 minutes watching the film) was wondering why someone should even care? Father comes off as a really big jerk to everyone he came across (including his daughter, he asks for her help), which made it quite difficult for those who do not care who killed him. But nobody looks Fulci film for a good storyline to make it would be like to watch porn incredible scripting and actions. Usually his films try to compensate for this by adding redundant scenes of gore, but even that is not enough in this film. If you are looking for a good Fulci film, check the Beyond.
