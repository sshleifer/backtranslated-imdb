I saw this "hot" movie when it came out in 1986, it was rated X for short scenes involving oral sex, but played in conventional theaters (it was the 'art' film). Presumably, this is the first film ever to show a respected actress in the explicit sex scene. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a sad story about a high school boy (Federico Pitsalis) in love (for obvious reasons) with an elderly woman (Maruschka Detmers). As mentioned earlier Detmers very nice with a good body, but it also gives very good results. Pitzalis was (to put it mildly) is quite poor. It is not surprising that he never made another film. Nevertheless, despite the infamous sex scene (which obviously, but pretty short), is a slow moving goofy story that bored me silly. Good acting by Detmers only helped to a certain point. Basically, I was looking at the clock, waiting patiently for it until the end. If he had not, the sequence of this film would have been forgotten long ago. Stupid and slow. You can skip this.
