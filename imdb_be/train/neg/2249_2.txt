This is a terrible catastrophe film. From start to finish, it is filled with bad acting and even worse, and editing. The only redemption of the film a few rooms for Streisand, Kristofferson because of the impossible to watch or listen to. The main problem with this film is that we never see the character Kristofferson at the peak of their form or nature Streisand struggling. The first to be seen in the doldrums, and the second is growing. The final number Streisand _could been_ have one of the greatest finals in the film when it was directed and edited properly. Single frame shot of her face for the song has been a terrible mistake. If a group of spectators and wide shots of the scene were shown, this number can be dynamic and interesting. This film should be directed and edited at NYU film school dropout. The only thing that could be worse than unfortunate scenario. The final musical number is the only redemptive part of this movie, and even that ruined completely misguided technical solutions.
