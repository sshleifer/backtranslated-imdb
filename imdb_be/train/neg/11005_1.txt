This film shows a series of sketches, which are partly transformed into each other. I knew that going into the end of the film, at first it just annoys me. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes of this film come without any known punchlines and just trying to distort the facts around this by using the absurdity and obscenity. Attempt to stay his comedy without any funny bits can not <br /> <br /> My staff and possibly subjective result after watching this movie (my God, it hurts in my head every time I call this "movie") .: bold attempt to turn nothing into something big. But this was not possible. At least the director has done something out of nothing. But it is not something good. <br /> <br /> Many of the films did not work as funny as they were planned, but this one tops them all. This is real life manifestation of the worst-case scenario of the film. No. In order to correct itself, it's even worse than that. a funny movie is so bad that they are not funny. It's not even interesting to look at lead-actor, screenwriter and director (all three of the same guy, by the way) are killed by drowning in a sea of ​​bad movies. The film is too bad for that.
