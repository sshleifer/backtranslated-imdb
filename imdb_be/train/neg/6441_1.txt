When I looked at the years Wrestlemania card of the match, I was so stoked and can not control myself, because I was full of excitement. <br /> <br /> It begins ... and ends. <br /> <br /> I sit there, angry to hell because of how much I wanted my money back. I mean, you watch Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites), which go down in history as a classic, then you would expect the same thing and get the average litter they have every now and then. One moment in the whole show, which ruined it for me was when HBK burst !!!! This is the moment with John Cena HBK losing !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is a loser / a poser. He was almost completely destroyed Wrestlemania 22 for me, when he beat TRIPLE H! I could not look after watching WWE WrestleMania 23. I'm starting to watch it again (fortunately). Again, I believe in the WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the biggest I've ever seen), which was a pure classic Wrestlemania. It certainly made for Â«Mania 23 and has given us many memorable moments as well. <br /> <br /> If you see any with WrestleMania before it, like those that make you fans (Wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan), please do not look at it and make the same mistake I did and leave behind the WWE. And if you make it look angry and start watching it again and watch Wrestlemania 24, it is absolutely classic.
