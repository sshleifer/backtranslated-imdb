Why do I waste my time with this film? There was not a funny joke or a line around. Fars did not even have a little fun. I mean really, out of control vacuum to suck up the phone? Why the name National Lampoon has been attached to this film? Even the Christmas holidays better than this (I actually thought the film was very funny). <br /> <br /> AVOID similar plague!
