I watched this movie last night and hoped for the best after all the cool DVD cover trailers.Even looked good.As soon as I started to watch it, I thought, as well as other "oh my goodness, it was" .There was some moments, which was a little creepy, but then the mood was shattered stupid music.There were a rock opera in what should be a warning right there scenes.That spoiled for me, and I shook his head thinking damn, I wasted money again to hire and was deceived by the cover art. Nothing against the music itself, it was just in the wrong parts of movie.Whoever edit amb movie has no idea what they doing.The cover showed lightning, providing they have been caught in a storm in sea.That would be more interesting, but it never happened. Act was not the worst I've ever seen, considering all of them are unknown, and it is obvious, their first film.Another reason I was disappointed was the story did not start sense.In 2 men seen all teens get on a boat, at the end supposedly only one girl there, and the rest were either of her imaginary friends, or ghosts, I'm not sure, because it was very bad drawing. WhyteFox write a comment here states that this is a real story.He or she believes in ghosts and spirits, and says that there are ghosts of the boat near the film was filmed.There there was no mention in this film that the real story. I have never experienced something like that, but personally I'm not saying that it impossible.I think if anyone is interested in renting this film, do it at your own risk.if you as an amateur horror films student you may like it.
