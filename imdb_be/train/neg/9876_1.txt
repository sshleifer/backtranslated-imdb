I went to nothing about this movie, not knowing I went out in half an hour, knowing all about it. It was one of the worst films I have ever seen. I do a good person, but if someone told me that he liked the film, I would probably never speak to them again. Anyone who loves him well, are likely to have very dry, like a hermit personality. I will also include that they think they are very smart as well as selfish and fart bags that make voices for movies. I know that everyone has different types of humor, some people may not like me, but that's okay; I do not think it covers any range of humor, though. This film is flat and boring, as the mind of Wes Anderson. Go in and get ready to go; it's better to get your money back as well.
