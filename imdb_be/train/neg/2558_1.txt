I had to see it on the site, and I watched it with optimism, that perhaps it would be at least more entertaining cheesy rip off, and it's not even doing well enough. <br /> <br /> "666: The child" is probably one of the most frightening supernatural thrillers I've ever seen (even worse than the "Godsend") with scenes that break with the "Omen" without shame. Even the ending is very similar to the way «The Omen» ends. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the fact that the acts of writing and the story is just beaten. If these films make money, I am sad to see where the head of Asylum. This is inconvenient.
