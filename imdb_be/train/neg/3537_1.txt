Was convince the world that it does not exist ... <br /> <br /> This is the line, which is likely to remember a lot of people. It is known from a suspect in relation to Kaiser Gold..I have SOSE .. <br /> <br /> I've got another way: -The stupid stunt director ever pulled was trying to convince the audience, he was actually storyline- < br /> <br /> This film is one of the saddest parts of the film that I have seen in a long time. It starts as good, with exactly the fantastic cinematography, great action and very reasonable room. But, unfortunately, the only way this movie is going to go self-destruction. And it does so, not by one blow, but with small trailing wrist cuts. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to the comments here, that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain it to a donut. With enough booze in my mind, I'll probably be able to explain very plausible degree of the very existence of mankind. I have seen and read about a dozen completely different ways to explain the history. And they range from the history of kit completely in the head of someone playing chess with ourselves, a cunning way for the criminal to play with their enemies with the help of chess-like games. <br /> <br /> And it's all oars swells. But at the same time, it is a painful giveaway that there is something terribly wrong with this story. And besides, it is in any case a blunt rip off of dozens of books and films like "Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, Suspicious person vagina, magnolia and Shachnovelle. And we are not dealing with a polite borrowing here, it is a blatant rip-off. <br /> <br /> that ultimately goes wrong, here, in this film it is that the storyline swirls like a drunken bum at speed. If this film was to ride a roller coaster, you would hit the involvement with him the baby after takeoff. there are so many twists and turns in this film, which will never be solved, that if it were a cocktail, you'd be needing a stock life-throw buckets for nausea after drinking it. Nothing is ever explained, and when you finally get some idea of ​​the direction you think is happening, you are engaged in another. <br /> <br /> I think this story is not going to go away on paper and Ritchy must have thought that it was strange to make a movie out of it, in any case, being the next David Lynch or something. <br /> <br /> 1/10 F or completely breaking their own work (Ritchy: seek professional help). What could have easily become a jewel instead frivolous art whole, the food for the pseudo intellectuals for discussion at sundayafternoon discussion clubs. <br /> <br /> liberate the soul and stomach, avoid at all costs!
