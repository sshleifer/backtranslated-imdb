Actions Gregory Peck was fine, as one would expect, and the cinema is very great, even if you play right in some melodramatic "moment." But the rest of the film was replayed and hard to watch for me anyway. I tried to like it, but I had to fast-forward through the last thirty minutes or so. I feel like I wasted a couple of good hours. If it was not for Gregory Peck, I would not have lasted fifteen minutes. 4/10.
