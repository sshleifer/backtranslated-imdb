I thought the movie was ok, but very disappointed that they did not capture the true image of his life. I was so anticipating to see his mother was the actual Jamaican, it's driving me crazy. Just observe the beginning of the film told me that the film was not accurate. I totally lost interest in just a few seconds from the beginning of the film. I am very disappointed that it's like watching history biographies on Mark Antony and Arnold play a role. I do not know what the author had in mind lacks a valuable piece of the film, which I'm sure his mother played a huge role in his life. I will say the movie was okay, except for the main Fla !!!!!!
