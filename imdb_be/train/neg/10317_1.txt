Prior to this new season I was a big fan of "Little Mosque". However, the new season has been absolutely ruined. <br /> <br /> New Christian priest destroyed the whole idea of ​​the show. He was always the life together to overcome prejudice. New vicar ruining this assumption and shows Christian in a very bad light. <br /> <br /> I am not a Christian or a Muslim, but he loved to watch the show and see the camaraderie between Omar and the Monk. Not anymore. <br /> <br /> Just cancel it and be done with it. It is not worth watching anymore. <br /> <br /> He can still be saved, but a lot needs to be done changes. <br /> <br /> Bring back the old format.
