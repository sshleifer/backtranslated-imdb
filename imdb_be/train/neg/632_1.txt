Well, that was fun ... the most interesting is the exception. <br /> <br /> This is my second least favorite so far, I even thought that it was worse than the "Lazarus" and "Ghost in the Machine." <, Br /> <br /> Let's start with the good. Teaser, it was incredibly well done, as well as emotional. Being a great animal lover that I am, it was fun to see so many beautiful animals in this episode. <br /> <br /> But there are bad, and believe me, there are many. It not only made sense, so that these animals have been abducted by aliens and soaked? whaaa ??? dialogue was also pretty awful. There were about one or two Quotable line. <br /> <br /> and what is worse, with almost all of these animals die very unpleasant for me. In the end ... what is the point? they are all pretty much dead. We did not learn anything, that we are not entertained, and I could not find even the death of Sophia boring ... just very difficult. <br /> <br /> * star. a shame, because the season 2 does it well.
