This film was very well advertised. I am an avid movie goer and saw previews for this film for months. While I was a bit skeptical about how funny the film will actually be, my friends thought it would be a big and bloated me about it. Then I went and saw him, I sunk down in his place almost fell asleep, until I remembered that I had paid for this film. I forced myself to laugh most of the material in the film simply because I Wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood I was in, plus I wanted to get my money's worth from the movie! I always go to a movie with an open mind, not trying to get into too many expectations, but the film was not funny. Now he was not the worst film I've ever seen, but it certainly should expect HBO. If you do not have a lot of eye on the preview for a movie or you want a very slow and banal comedy you can enjoy it, but for the true fans of comedy Id say pass. Maybe even check out Kings of comedy again. Something told me to meet with the parents to see, not !!!
