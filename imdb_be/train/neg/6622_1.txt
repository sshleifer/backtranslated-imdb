I, like many others Bachchan fans, having been looking forward to remake Sholay. This film was not him. Thank God, they did not allow them to use the name «Sholay» in the movie title. remake of Ram Gopal is not worthy of the title. The camera work, locations, in costumes, completely out of place dance, dialogue all combined to make the worst film I've ever seen. You wonder if the actors cast agreed to do this film, because they needed money and Ram Gopal had to pay a lot of money for the actor. Just not paid actor, ant was the only similarity with the first film. Abishek role was totally inappropriate, he needs money to pay for the wedding to Ash? Save your money, your mind and your time, do not bother with this film or DVD, if it comes out.
