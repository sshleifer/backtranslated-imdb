Oh, my God. the idea that this film is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. except for the point that seems to have written 5-year-old. plot, actors and even props and shooting of this film were all for the confusion. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually so critical of any film, causing each person has his / her style. But this film, however, was probably the worst film I've seen in 2008, I sincerely believe that this film is not known, and I think he should stay as it is, for movies, as does the thriller genre of jokes. <, Br /> <br /> I advise everyone that is in favor of a thriller movie, or even just a movie, to stay away from it.
