Yes, I just want to tell you about this one, so do not read if you want surprises. I got this one called Christmas Evil. There was also another Christmas horror on DVD entitled Silent Night, Bloody Night. While Silent Night, Bloody Night (not to be confused with the Silent Night, Deadly Night) had a lot of potential and was very close to that, well, it was not so good. It all started quite interesting to watch the villain (if you can call it that), watching the neighbor's child and write books about who is naughty and nice, but after a while you're looking for some action, and this film does not deliver. It is necessary to develop the character, but it goes overboard, and you'd never know why the hell, the guy catches. About an hour later, he kills three out of four people, and the whole crowd watching in horror, and the guys he kills are not even its aim, they just scoff at them. This is one of many unsuccessful attempts to assassin to knock out naughty. Then he continues to try to kill the other guy, and he's trying to break into his house, squeezing himself into the fire. He quickly stuck and barely manages to get out. He then goes through the basement, and then trying to kill the man, his life is in the bedroom. He can not seem to kill a man in such a way that it captures the star of the tree and cut the throat of the guys. What features would make the tree even in a bedroom in the first place? Ah yes, the killer still killing stopped at the party, and had some fun too. Well that's about it for the city people chasing him with torches and unresolved part with his brother and the music he wants to play, except. What was that even about? He went on to talk about something that is never really explained. As it is the end of you ask, and since I have the spoilers, I'll tell you. He ran off the road in a van, and continues to, and lets just say that it was a lame !!!!!!!!!!!!
