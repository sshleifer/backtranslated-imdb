It is for this reason that many people remain homeless. ,, Because blunt producers pay their money to make terrible movies like this, instead of to give, if they can be confusing! <br /> <br /> This movie is worse than white chicken! The little man is a lame excuse to create a dwarf character as a child. The history of terrible given that six people had written. The idea still has not been too bad, though, if it was the original, and not a rip-off cartoon episode. He has funny moments, but some of them are way over-done, and some of them are just plain silly. The action was very, very bad. So I was directing. All those involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves. it is very racist and offensive to the Lilliputians. I mean, instead of showing compassion for them, the filmmakers pinning! It really angers me, how they do it. They see the dwarfs to be just like babies. And for a character who is a dwarf pretending to be an abandoned child just to get a diamond of a certain family. That's his excuse for showing something of the sort. It's just not worth it. Do not watch this movie. This is a huge waste of time and money.
