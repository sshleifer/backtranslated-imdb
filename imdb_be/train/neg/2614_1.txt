Continued (in fact a remake) 1996 live-action remake of Disney's 101 Dalmations. Cruella DEVIL (Glenn Close) is released from prison after the "cure" her obsession with fur psychologist named Dr. Pavlov (ugh!). But "treatment" is violated when Cruella hears the loss of Big Ben, and she again goes to the mad quest to make a perfect skin coat with Dalmation. <br /> <br /> This film is bad on so many levels, starting with the fact that it is "Thanksgiving family schlock" film is intended to suck every last available dime a Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close nad nad nad nad acts as Cruella. With all that she had to put up with in this film - a lame script, great makeup, getting baked in the cake at the end - I hope they gave her a very big salary <br /> <br /. > (By the way, where in the world you are going to find a fur factory, a bakery production line Rube Goldberg and a restaurant with candles all located in the same building - like you're in the climax of the film?) Of course, the real stars of the film must be a dog. They serve as "Culkin in" this film, involving the whole stupid "Home Alone" bung on the villains. (. The bites them in the crotch, is working with his own hands with luggage trolleys, squirting their icing, etc., etc., etc., ad nauseam), I must admit that the dogs were pretty good actors - much better than people. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is completely lost in this film as freaked French furriers. Two people "dog lovers" - paraphrased from the previous film, but with different actors - very sad. If they have a spaghetti dinner at an Italian restaurant, movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers and their dogs at home, watching the dinner scene from "Lady and the Tramp" I thought to myself. "Oh, please, do not go there! "I half expected people to make a satire on" Lady and the Tramp "dinner scene - like Charlie Sheen inÂ« Hot Shots: Part Deux "- makes" spaghetti strands kiss, "pushing meatballs with his nose, etc. <br /> <br /> and do not get me started annoying parrot voice. <br /> <br /> Eric Idle costumes were nominated for grin p, and the costumes in the film * are * good. But they are only good in the movie. The rest of it is unbearable dreck.
