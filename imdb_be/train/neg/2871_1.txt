I take this horrible film. Worst of all I think that I have ever seen. I believe that the first class of the class could do a better job. The worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen some bad. Nothing terrible but I paid 1.50 to rent it out, and it was 1.49 too much. Actions awful, worse than the characters and the film is just a piece of garbage. In slauther house scene is so low budget that makes B movied look Oscar nominee. All I can say is, if you wnat to spend a nice evening and a little money to rent this horrible film. I prefer to look clown-killers from space, sitting in a bucket razors than sit through this flop again
