Really bad shot on video "film" has not one, not two, but three amateur video producers. <br /> <br /> If you are going to make a bad horror movie, at least throw in some blood, blood and nudity. There's some blood on the condition latex cut off the hands of props bought in a Halloween store. There are lesbians and prostitutes, but no nudity or sex. Lesbians spend a lot of time in bed, but just talk. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no editing effects- fades, wipes, etc. Once in a while a little black is a separate scene. <, Br /> <br /> Terrible bad music heavy metal bands whose sites occupy a large part of the end credits.The werewolves presented rubber masks that are attached to a person of "actors". They did not even bother to apply brown makeup on their necks, arms and wrists. <br /> <br /> I guarantee, 10-year-old with a video camera can collect more general cause movie.No buy, rent or watch this movie, other than as an example of how not to make the video a low budget.
