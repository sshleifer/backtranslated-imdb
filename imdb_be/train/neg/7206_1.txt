Well. Where to start. Let's just say it; avoid this film at all costs <br /> <br />. It is based on the cartoon series. The film does a cartoon appearance <br /> <br /> Hamlet. Filled emasculated actors who seem embarrassed to be <br /> <br /> Here, lousy camera work, horrible music, and enough product placement in <br /> <br /> you want to do, never to Visit Yahoo! Again, this film really <br /> <br /> bottom of the barrel. I quote from The New Yorker, Matthew Broderick and <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett mug their way through this picture with gay abandon <br /> <br /> men who noticed rare salaries at a distance. "<Br / > <br /> they have to pay us to some of the millions they earned to view it. <br /> <br /> Awful.
