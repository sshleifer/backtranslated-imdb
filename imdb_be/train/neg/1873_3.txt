You must be kidding me !!!! Let's entertain the possibility that Parker Posey really an actress, not just some of the entries in the "strangeness of the month club" actors. Indeed, if it is not meant to be a satire on the insincere David Mamet-- laconic, confusing dialogue comes at a time in a machine-gun rapidity or monotone (think Ben Stein), lethargy - or flat out dry comedy; This film should be in the running for the award Rotten Tomato --- or worse. <br /> <br /> As if hard and uncomfortable Posey were not enough, we got tighter and more uncomfortable Jeff Goldblum. There's more wood in this film than a toothpick factory. <br /> <br /> Adding to this already bizarre casting, several other roles, all populated by forgotten actors who look or sound like refugees from Next Top Model America, Don Pardo, or even a child who pronounces the word "was" as "Bob", which only brings our attention to the fact that as little as about this film, we analyze his accent to guess if it is Canadian or not !! I think I laughed heartily at places that have to be serious, and serious about the sections that are meant to be humorous. Even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature Alarik music Jans for Mamet's "House of Games". If viewed as a parody, the film almost beautiful; Seriously, just shy of a piece of Drek.
