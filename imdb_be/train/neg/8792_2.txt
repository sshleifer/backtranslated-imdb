This film is another example of curse Eastern Asian Film: two or more separate stories in a single woven film. Other observers have clearly picked up on it, and because there are several references to the "first part" and "second part". How can you have any deep character development or plot, when the characters and plot are the signs in such a short period of time? I I enjoyed the first part, until he suddenly stopped (it's not "the end", he just stopped, seemingly the middle of the story) to replace nonsensical and utterly incredible the second part, which seemed to focus around the girl regrouping and apartment cleaning guy ( nothing e) I'm looking forward to the day when Wong Kar Wai is given a decent script to work with!
