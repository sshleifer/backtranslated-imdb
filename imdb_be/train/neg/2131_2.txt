I wanted to see action comedy with a satirical Twist (and this film advertised), but this one let me down with a bang. For me, the story was a bit confusing to follow, and I quickly lost interest. I feel so sorry for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hilary Duff to get involved with this film. I will be a fan of all of them, but only time can cure my feeling on it. The only thing I can say positive about the film that Hillary played the character Yonica so well that I did not even recognize Hillary; it took me a few scenes to see that it was her. Fortunately, I rented for $ 1 through the Red Box; if I give to see him on the big screen, I would be very smoky !!
