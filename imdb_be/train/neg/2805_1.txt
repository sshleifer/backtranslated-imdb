This adaptation positively butchers classic that is loved his subtlety. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no idea about the various nuances of the character of Rochester. I get the feeling that he had never read a book, just walked on set it too tight breeches, and was transferred to a short character that read "grumpy, brooding, dark past." He plays Rochester no longer as a character or a real person as well as the over the top curmudgeon who never cracked a smile until after he got involved at this point he miraculously turns into brothers. There's no chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation excited I had suspiciousness and sympathy to Charlotte Bronte, who most definitely turns in her grave. GO and re-read the book. ROCHESTER has individuality. And by the way: A «PASSIONATE» LOVE scene DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO EAT her face.
