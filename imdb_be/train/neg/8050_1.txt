just below the surface is that? simply connected a terrible film that. <br /> <br /> like other viewers reasonably noted storm sequence ridiculous. chopping wood has soaked in the pouring rain? Now it's smart. threaten? premonitions? sexual tension? for those who read boring and contrived, dull and pretentious and dull and too contrived. <br /> <br /> I want to say, thank God for the soul scene Mia Sara, but in hindsight I think that the producers of the film, seeing complete mess realized that they had to put something to make it halfway worth it at all. so it just becomes one more fudge. do yourself a favor and give this a miss.
