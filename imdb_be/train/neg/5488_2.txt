Why on earth Colin Firth in the film meaningless? Was he really that strapped for cash? <br /> <br /> The film is not clear that he wants to be on, the grief? Exotic locations?, ghosts?, agent for Mr. Darcy? . It is messy, muddy mess <br /> <br /> There seems to be some idea that Italy should be good in itself, and that has something to offer Italian as a language - but in the end the girls just want to go back to yankland < br /> <br /> have meaningless episodes on the beach, in churches, on a busy road - .. but it's all about, or why someone should care just is not clear, <br /> <br /> was also tugging woman film. It was not clear that the work was here, but it only seemed to be there to do boring, stupid and whiny comments to the girl. Was it should be about paedophillia ?? <br /> <br /> Quite a terrible mess, all in all. I gave him 2 and not 1 because he has no charm at all a terrible film.
