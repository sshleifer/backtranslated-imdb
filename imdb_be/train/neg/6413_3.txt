My friends and I went into this movie, not knowing what to expect, but hoping for the best. When we left, we were just a little bit more aware of what was in fact the film's plot. Although not the worst film I've ever seen, I do not recommend spending the money to see it in theaters. Maybe one to rent it to you (it is not even worth the cost of rental or) if you really want to see it. <br /> <br /> If the movie is so confusing that you have no idea what is going until the last five minutes, there really is not much that can be said in his defense. The acting was decent, more than you would expect to get from this film, and some of the shots were good, but it was bogged down with a lame story and a bad script. <br /> <br /> This film really so bad that as soon as he left, I went and bought a ticket to see a good film only to clear your mind. I recommend that you just skip the first step and go see a good movie instead.
