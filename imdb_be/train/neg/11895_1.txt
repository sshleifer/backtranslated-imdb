My God, what happened here, damn it? !! I will not talk about it again, but the movie is retarded? Duplication is the way worse than dubbing in "King Kong vs. Godzilla," Linda Miller was supposed to be the worst actress in her and the costumes really cheesy.Its about some villain called Dr.Who, who gets to build improvised robot gorilla, which has the same effect as King Kong, but if this robot breaks down, he builds another, and then tries to steal Kong.When he does (when Linda Miller gets annoying), he makes his servant Kong, but everything goes wrong, and King Kong escapes .Zastet Dr.Who sends the robot after it. <br /> <br /> Later, when I watched the movie, I got a headache when Linda Miller and other clowns began moaning.As I sat through suffering, watching DVD while he was playing, I was hoping that Var 'yatstva in the movie was going through until the end of fight.The should not be too bad, because they could be shown Kong returned to fighting dinosaurs island again. <br /> <br /> Sun to watch movies in all circumstances, or if you ... Beware disappointm Ent you get.
