This movie is just plain bad. Weak story, poor direction and below average action. The fact that really annoyed me was the outdoor advertising - constantly - to the well-known Internet service provider. Obviously, some scenes were written to do just that advertising. This film is a slap in the face for those who paid for it. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it, not worth your time.
