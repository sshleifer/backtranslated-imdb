I had to watch a movie for my work, so I did not pay for it (on the contrary, I got paid), but I still found the film to suck a lot more than the average. no jokes were lame, two lead actresses ... well, use the "First Wives Club" separation of ages of women in Hollywood, they are no longer in their "Hot Chick" age, but more in their "district attorney" age. What is the biggest film made me angry was the main storyline, which is largely completely plagiarized "Beavis and Butt-Head do America" ​​(in which the boys all Jazzed up to some dude, offering them money to "make my wife", not realizing that they 're expected kill her.) In general, soft piece of shit.
