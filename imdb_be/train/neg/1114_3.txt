In this day and age of incredible special effects in film, this one was a painful disappointment. Actors, seemed stiff and uninspired, as well as dialogue. Westerns are not common fare for Hollywood so much these days, but movies like «Silverado» prove that someone else out there knows how to do good. Given that it is difficult to imagine that someone would go to any account at all in the release, much less the creation of such a weak film like this. If you like and are looking for a good western, keep looking!
