Im proud to say that I've seen all three Forcing films.Sure, stories like stupid, and they might be a bit bad, but I love them a car chase, and all the beautiful cars and the underground race north. and patient happy to see the fourth. <br /> <br /> Do you want to know what is the difference between these three and the Redline? Decent action, several thoughtful story, even if they are trash, and last but not least, the director, has clue.All three were made very competent directors, all of them are occupied by the films in the other direction, the same exciting.Redline looks like a manufacturer has chosen a dozen women, he slept with casting couch, and made them crowd and then took his lead from unemployment Hollywood line.And in script.Yikes.Its Mystery Science Theater 3000 bad.This 70 made for TV movie bad. <br /> <br /> So, the film had a few steep wheelbarrows, but you really can not see that many people in action, and action is directed so bad you can not get excited by chases, d, when the cars do not care about you why go to a movie like this? <br /> <br /> Im in the auditorium with a bunch of teenagers, and I can not stop laughing loud.Im getting dirty looks, but it's just a fiasco. <br /> <br /> Take the F & F movies.Go to Nascar Race.Go on the karting track and race yourself.Whatever you avoid Redline like bad cheese.
