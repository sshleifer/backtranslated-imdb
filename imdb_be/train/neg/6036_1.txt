Starring unknown cast, which is likely to remain so, this "movie" another cheap slasher film that strikes me, as it was released. I have no problems with horror and slasher movies, in particular, that they are my favorite. But if they did it badly, it does take a monkey and not surprisingly, his genre is not such a difficult time. History, as a template, and without imagination as possible with a bunch of people in a cabin in the woods to be slashed and hacked this zombie / ghost guy. It's not a story that sucks the most, his brutal action and dialouge, homemade directing quality and terrible soundtrack. Not to mention the ridiculous effects and some incredibly lazy filmmaking - these morons outside in broad daylight yet we are called to believe that this is the night ?? What the hell was the director thinking with this traffic? That he had only one day to shoot this? He is afraid of the dark? (Fun, seeing the cop walking around in pure daylight torch which acts as if his pitch, though) <br /> <br /> I think the positive side for the actors, they are like the people who work at the local supermarket so at least, they could never get out of this film noticed. I am sure that one of the "teenagers" playing bingo down the local pub - but it 40-45 <br /> <br /> In any event, good for a laugh, but it's just another waste of time and a film ..
