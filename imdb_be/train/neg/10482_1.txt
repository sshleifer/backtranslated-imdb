One of the worst movies I have ever seen. How to define "the worst?" I would like, if both eyes snatched balls, and then be forced to tap dance for them more than ever to see this pathetic dreck again. Anyway, One-Hit Wonder Nail directs the film, which also offends Elvis fans, Mary Kay saleswomen, Las Vegas, gays, the FBI and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with poor, untidy farce so forced it deserves to be left ed. Elvis Presley Enterprises may allow the rules of real Elvis songs to be used in the film with the central premise that seems to be "One good Elvis imitator is a dead one" me. The worst part of this mess - and that takes some work - it is a distorted scenario: In 1958, the words and songs that he will speak Elvis' / act in the 1970s cited! Worst special effect? This Oscar would go to the moron who decided that Elvis's grave, potentially the most photographed / a well-known tomb in the world, like a pyramid with a gold record glued to the top and in the middle of the park somewhere. Potentially the biggest audience for this film will be supporters of Elvis. However, rampant stupidity (Nixon gave Elvis a sign of the DEA, and the FBI is not the authority ... and I could go on and on) actually cuts that traditional wisdom. Ugh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid movie. It's really terrible, terrible film.
