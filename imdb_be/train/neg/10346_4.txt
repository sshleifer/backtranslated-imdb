You would think that with Ingrid Bergman Warner Baxter, this movie would have been much better. Unfortunately, the film suffers from is hard to believe the characters and storyline of the problem, which makes some of the characters seem to be confused brain. <br /> <br /> The film opens with Ingrid Bergman comes to work for the family Stoddard. All so very rosy and swollen - family loves Bergman and things could not be more perfect. Well, that is, until his mother (Fay Wray) dies, the stock market falls in 1907 (destroying family status) and Bergman had to return home to France. This part of the film slightly sticky sweet, but not bad. <br /> <br /> Later, after the family's fortunes improved, Bergman returns. These four boys are now all grown up, and it really is not like the reason why they hire her again as a governess. But, for a short time, still time to swell. But when there is a WWI, all four go to war - hell! In the midst of this, one of the sons (David) brings home his new wife (Susan Hayward). character Miss Hayward as black and white, like the others, although at that time they were all nice and swell, it is obviously horny devil. Worse yet, she comes to live in the family home while David is at war <br /> <br /> Now here is where the movie gets really, really stupid. - aching brain dumb. Hayward begins an affair with one of David's brothers, but when the father sees the silhouette lovers Bergman enters the room with another entrance and pretends that it was her, not with Jack Hayward! WHY?! Why would any normal person do this to keep the sample is clearly evil and treacherous woman? It was just kind of an excuse Bergman is necessary to get rid of the tabloid-snipe once and for all! It is simply a case of lousy letters and made me wisely ... and, most of all, did the same for the audience in 1941. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie consists of the possibility of failure after a failed opportunity for Hayward nastiness exposed. It just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess. As might be expected, however, the truth eventually comes out, and all the bloat again --- happy to be one big wonderful family minus loving whore, Hayward. <br /> <br /> The film suffers due to bad writing. Hayward deal does not make sense - at least in the way it was done. And, with characters that are so gosh-darn good or evil (with nothing in between) sinks the film to the level of soap a second year. The only thing that saves him completely valid --- they tried as best they could with the arrogant script. Suffice it to say that the authors of Columbia Pictures, who made this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken!
