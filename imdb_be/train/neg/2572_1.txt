this film delivers. Best when a clumsy teenage neighbor tries to ride a bicycle from the nurse in the background, it appears that he had never been anywhere near a bicycle in his life, as he tries to keep from falling. <br /> <br /> but this film does not stop there, when less than 5 minutes, it provides the stage is nothing but the hand that reaches over the fence and pulling a beer cooler. <br /> <br /> frying stereotypical dad, multiple storylines that do not go anywhere, and SeaQuest former actress with a Bluetooth mobile phone all add up to make this the perfect Saturday night at home.
