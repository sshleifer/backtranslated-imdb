For the life of me I can not understand the hype and blind devotion to this absolutely incredible movies ...... and I think that I have qualified to say so .... I am a former Special Operations soldiers from 14 years of "lifestyle" ... This film was completely absolutely unrealistic, and obviously written by someone that he did very little research into life in the army, in combat or as a team or platoon level. <br /> <br /> Three EOD guys trouncing around Baghdad on themselves ????? Get Real ... nope instances ????? Get Real ... EOD clearing the building ??? Get Real .... EOD / Military reconnaissance / Sniper qualified buck sergeant ???? Get Real .... Wait ... I shot and killed the bad guy, and then let the two guys taking me without firing another shot or injured at all ???? Get Real .... I CarJack Iraqi civilian, while I was only armed with 9 cute, break into another house civilians get punked his wife and then make it back to the camp on foot in the center of Baghdad at night without as well as the scratch or confrontation ???? Get Real ... <br /> <br /> There's absolutely no attachment to military protocol {} army and not the similarity at all to the power of the army, I even encountered. Absolutely incredible and disrespectful to women and men EOD, which are contrary to this poor film are not looking for a wild adrenaline Yahoos but highly skilled professionals doing incredibly difficult work.
