Katz got tons of Slavic play excellent character, Dato. Datoiti films were amazing and incredible thing - a blind man's greatest swordsman in Japan and conduct every movie requires reducing resentment and retribution to evildoers. He's a hell of a nice guy, and the films are exciting and addictive (I actually saw every movie). It is because of this, I saw the latest installment in the series Hanzo Razor, I assumed that it would be very similar .... and boy was I wrong! It turns out that Hanzo films are very sexual in nature, and they also contribute to rape "of women who deserve it." You see, Hanzo policeman with the Meiji period, and he regularly takes evil woman into custody and interrogates them forcibly rape them with his "penis of steel." As he made his cock so strong that it's something you have to see to believe, but it is certainly not for the faint of heart. <br /> <br /> In general, I just can not recommend anyone sees these harsh and misogynistic movies. However, looking at the other reviews, I can see that they are still very popular ... and it's very scary. Despite some decent acting and amazing fight scenes, movies just as the pollution of the brain - and I would not like to imagine how the films may have contributed to violence against women.
