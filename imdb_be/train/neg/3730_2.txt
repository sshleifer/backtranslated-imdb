Firstly there is nothing wrong in studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah and other prophetic writings. There, too, there is nothing wrong in making the film, such as it is to try to present the gospel message. So my qualms with this film is not in any of his sincerity or aspirations. As a Christian, although amillenialist, I believe there will be great tribulation, and I believe that Christ will return, as he says, like a lot. Thus, even if I have a disagreement with this film about ascension that is not why I rate this film is so low. <br /> <br /> No, it makes me appreciate this film is so low not his sincerity or his message, but rather its lack of production values, a terrible script, mediocre action and pathetic FX. This film ranks up there with some of the food Cheesiest SCIFI 1950. No, this film ranks up there with the Plan 9 from Outerspace. This film is not aged well, and probably dates from the time they made a sequel. <br /> <br /> apocalypse genre filmmakers could learn how to make an end is not just a movie of it, but they failed. Left Behind, a series of the Apocalypse, and a series of Omega Code they could not benefit from it, because they have dealt with FX and outdated look the problem, but the script is still poor, and their actions are wooden. <br /> <br /> there are large Christian films with very low budgets, but this film is not one of them. I am surprised that the MST3K crew never made fun of this.
