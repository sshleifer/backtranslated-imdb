Wow, I'm a huge Henry VIII / Tudor era and fan, well, it was .... interesting. The only one I saw was Catherine of Aragon one. And wow ... just wow. I've seen bad acting before, but it has reached new heights. When the actress who played Catherine umm .. crying? she yells and screams, and I must admit, I wound many times ... many, many times .... funny, funny things. The only person who even showed a little bit of talent was the actress playing Anne Boleyn (I might be damaged, though, I have a slight obsession with Anne Boleyn, she was actually boxing, woman, read up on it, it's worth it! ) also, I have read a lot about the Tudor period of time and I think that the characters were not very acurately displayed, they were all very stereotyped. Just watch this movie if you are willing to see a very important period of time, as well as important life of those involved have become a laughingstock.
