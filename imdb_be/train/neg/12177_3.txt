Since the 70s, the writer / producer / director Charles Group is responsible for literally hundreds of science fiction, fantasy and horror B-movies. Some of them are excellent examples of how to use a tiny budget for maximum effect; Many of them are pretty bad. Trancer (1985) was one of those rare gems. <br /> <br /> A Terminator style story about time travel and the actions trancer saw Tim Thomerson played Jack Deth, being a police officer was ordered to hunt down the bad guy Whistler, who travels back in time dwelling ancestor's body. Whistler is able to control others with his psychic powers, turning them into obedient zombies (in the "trancer" in the title), and attempts to change the course of history, the ancestors of killing leaders of the future. Jack follows him until 1985, we decided to stop it. <br /> <br /> In 1991, the sequel, Jack is still living in 1985, destroying the Whistler, he grew up and married Leena (Helen Hunt), a young woman who helped him succeed in the first film. But, Jack, things did not remain quiet for a long time, and the problem appears as a brother Whistler, E.D. Ward, who is trying to build Trancer army. <br /> <br /> trancer II lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and a huge disappointment, considering how good the original was. History is hard to find if you have not seen the first film (or at least not for long), and there are loads unimpressive action and some bad effects. Gone ingenuity and wit that made trancer so much fun; Instead we get some cheese sharpness and a script that feels like it was written on the fly. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can give for recommending this film to fans of the genre is a foundry that has a lot of names that will be familiar to followers of sci-fi and horror films: Jeffrey Combs, Crampton, Richard Lynch , Beswick. Unfortunately, most of them seemed to be having a "day off" while filming trancer II of, and the performance mediocre at best <br /> <br /> trancer series obviously has its own fan. Four of those were sequels release time. If it does not absorb the massive upward swing, I can not imagine them to be of any use.
