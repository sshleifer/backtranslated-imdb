As a supporter of Altman, I was looking for this movie for years, thinking that with such a large cast, it must be at least a little shiny. <br /> <br /> The big mistake. <br /> <br /> This is one of the large cast mishmashes Altman, thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally (or so it feels) with the hope that it will all come together in the editing room. This is not so. <br /> <br /> As Maltin shows this turkey distinctive only to debut Alfre Woodard, who overshadows veterinarians all around her. But other than that, avoid at all costs. (Which is very easy to do - it has never been released on video - to my knowledge - and rope phenomenon has a frequency of Halley's Comet.)
