Star Rating: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Marshall Lawson (Seagal) are assigned to France for a reconnaissance mission with three new young recruits strike team after the disobedience of direct orders from above. However, on the night before they were due to stroke, they found carved grusomely killer of seemingly superhuman strength. With the French police dallying around their own investigation, he goes in search of those responsible himself, only to reveal a corrupt group of military affairs in a deadly new drug that alters human DNA, and gives them a terrible new powers. <, Br /> <br /> Bad coating. Invalid name. Poor post-production fabrication. And a bad trailer. Pretty bad movie. But, I must say, I do not think the attack is completely Force it worse. I know that it will make me unpopular with most other reviewers here (maybe not Steveday!), But I think a lot of the criticism stems from all the bad news, which went before the film, rather than the actual quality of its own. <, Br /> <br /> I have to say that was not anywhere near as dubbing or editing ropey as I was lead to believe. Dubbing was (which made it sound like Martin Sheen with a groin problem!) It was pretty scary, and often, but not used as a large segment of the film, as I thought. The plot flowed smoothly enough, and taking into account all busy with the original finished film called Harvester, which went on. In addition, as noted by another reviewer, the film has a beautiful gothic look to it, a new shade for the film Segal. <br /> <br /> Absolute killer low point, though, was a complete and total absence of any exciting action with only a few bad shooting fight scenes for any pleasure. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest, although I would like to see it again, than Flying Fury, today you die or Out murder. **
