I watched this film after watching the other comments on the IMDb, even convince my wife that it was a "unique horror film." I wanted to like this movie, but could not. <br /> <br /> Â«Love Story" was good, but the aspect of horror was all bad. If this story was just a young man who fell in love with the girl, suffers from Parasomnia, it would be the best film. <br /> <br /> care center stretched credulity far beyond, was actually pretty funny. Doctor happily ignors laws on confidentiality and professionalism. The nurse comes into the room for the usual feeding dangerous patient (without being accompanied by security), and loses the tray and runs from the room screaming for no apparent reason. Forensic patient (and the villain of the film) due to standing fully dressed - apparently, for many years? None of them does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The film even in some of the actors that I liked in other things, such as detectives, but still I can not recommend this film.
