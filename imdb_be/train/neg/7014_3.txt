What a waste! This film could have really been something decent, but the letter, in particular, that shit, and the main characters, and small and uninteresting. Mike Myers has been a good and historic restoration of the late 70's decadence is well treated, but in general, this movie was a big waste of time. Instead, the film to see that deals with similar themes and the same basic frame time is great Boogie Nights.
