If it 2008 product from one of the largest film studios of the Indian film industry (Yash Raj), then I am afraid that is a long time in advance for us to achieve the required standards. <br /> <br /> If you can go wrong with this long with such a huge star cast of Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena, and then making the film has not been studied much harder all associated with this film. The film lacks almost all departments, except for film and Akshay Kumar. He has some good dialogue to help but alone can not make you enjoy the flick with great expectations. <br /> <br /> The first scene of the car down to the river from the mountain very cheap graphics, as in the cartoon. This in itself is a clear indication of the director of vision. Every actor, which otherwise is an asset to the film just wasted. trick Anil Kapoor in an attempt good English falls flat most of the time. Saif And, of course, hit myself wondering why he signed the film. <br /> <br /> In short this is the most waste of resources following "meetings that gave love." I would say that even «Aaja Nachle» was better enjoyable film than that. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how and why this type of script has been written and approved. The most objectionable was the sequence of retrospective love story Akshay in. After a failed script weakest point of the film is the music. Vishal Shekhar gave only a few aggregates melody for each song. The song starts very well, and suddenly the melody falls sharply. Only one song «Falak Tak person" as something good out of the party. . Possibility wasted Vishal Shekhar <br /> <br /> As for the continuity of the creators of the intellect is just a taste: Akshay and Saif on the road in the hills of a foreign location (probably Ladakh). In the next stage they are looking at Haridwar Karina, and then back into the hills Karinoj Dickey in their vehicle. I still thought, who wrote it. <br /> <br /> If you can sit until recently, the climax too long with stupid and unnecessary gimmicks. You can see all the characters, who are going through a storm of bullets do not hurt, as if they were GOD. We still see a movie in 2008 with all these technical heights achieved? So no more words on this helpless and lower the film, but the sincere request of senior actors are fans. <br /> <br /> Honorable Anil Kapoor and Akshay Kumar, if possible, please ask for a preview of your movie after the first copy is out. As artists of this growth, you have certain responsibilities towards his fans and viewers. People still clap for you as you walk into the screen of your first scenes, respectively. I think this movie should not see the light, as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie, the actors and the production house like.
