«Mojo» is the story of fifties London, promising world of rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. «Mojo» uses a technique for capturing the 1950s is often seen in movies that emphasizes physical differences in our time, but also represents a dialogue is a greatly enlarged (due to much so that it has been presented in films made in this period); I do not know if people really spoke the way this is a movie, but not films made today and install now do not use a stylized language. It is as if pompous discourse 1950s screenwriters is common shorthand for the past, which seems to be a consequence of a very distant land indeed; and thus stresses the particular rather than universal in history. «Mojo» has a strong performance from Ian Hart and irritating those of Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, the latter are still trying to build a career post-'Trainspotting »; but it feels like a period piece, a modern film incomprehensible structured outdated idioms. Rather sad, actually.
