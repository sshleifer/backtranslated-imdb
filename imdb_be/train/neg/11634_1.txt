I saw this film at the International Festival of Cinema Edmonton, with a large Dr. Uwe Boll in the line of duty. <br /> <br /> The film is, quite simply, very, very bad. And no, not in the usual Uwe Boll "so bad, it's really entertaining" way, but just bad. The site belongs to the person who leads a horrible life (due to previous convictions, apparently) can not get a job, and with a horrible 900 pounds cheating wife. This man turns to his cult leader Uncle plan to steal a truck load of toys that contain the bird flu virus. Al-Qaeda also projects stealing toys, and what it stands for just under two hours entirely unknown sex and violence. <br /> <br /> To act badly (for Dave Foley, who really tries with the exception, in spite of all this), the jokes never rose above the children shot in the chest in slow motion, and the people who take the shit. This should be a satire, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Think of "Airplane!", but made the creators of South Park, and no jokes.
