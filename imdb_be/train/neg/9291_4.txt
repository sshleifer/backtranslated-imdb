I can not believe that none of the formal reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two completely upset the sexual assault scene. It is as if our culture to accept this behavior as just sexual, but not hard. My biggest problem with the film is that it does not seem to condemn these attacks - as a woman who has repeatedly attacked and pressured and not holding people accountable for their actions, and neither does anyone else. One man stopped from storming completion when someone throws a dagger at him, but he chastised only "You can not make a woman love you" and not "you should never make a woman sexually, you moron" ... From the point of women view film announced. This kind of "throwing the bones" for women, allowing them to be both experienced fighters and leaders, but the film is much more determined by the romance - is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must include a power imbalance, with men dominating the woman they love. This amazing martial arts fighter does not use her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers. She never makes them apologize - rather, it seems, asked for forgiveness. Overall, disappointing and frustrating film, with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes, but not as good as the hero of a long shot.
