I went to visit one of my family members some time ago, and we jumped at the theater, so we thought we would go and give this film a go. What a mistake! This movie is terrible in every department. I had never heard of the movie before, and literally everything is still there. Not surprisingly, it is not rank as it gets. It's a comedy, so he says, and the only thing that is funny is the ability, or lack thereof, directed to make such a film. Getting so close to Christmas, it should be entitled as an under-cook the turkey in the nearly one and a half hours - or how much it was, as I went out. At the end of the film, you will leave feeling as if you were eating poisoned on a sick turkey, and regret that you spent your time on such digging. Who knows why things get done. Some people left the theater before the film was well over, and I blame myself for not leaving much earlier. It really annoys me that you pay good money to see something decent, and everything that you come and see the poor television film, which should be given at 2 am, in fact, it's so bad, in the daytime TV should not be showing it. What else can be said ... probably not enough bad words can do it justice.
