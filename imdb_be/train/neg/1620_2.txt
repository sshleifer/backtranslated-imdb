This film has little to recommend it, although it's a little exciting to be the spirit of landscapes, cinematography and direction of the wilderness, it is difficult to prove their weaknesses in the company of such rave reviews. It is these things, however, which makes the absence of a satisfactory site and its performance is so disappointing. <br /> <br /> I watched it with my children, and none of us was not too impressed with the finish. So, the pictures were great, wide landscapes through forest and mountains are great, but what happens in the foreground? Pretty sad story of stupidity vacuous girl who learns too slow very simple lesson about friends of wildlife - and receives from fairly easy, given the track record of this kind of thing. This, of course, not a new story, in fact, there is nothing remotely novel about how he said, and we've all seen it before, and, in fact, more eloquently by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. <br /> <br /> The only thing you can really learn from this film is to understand how to work with these remarkable lenses, lighting and forestry; the rest is a waste of time.
