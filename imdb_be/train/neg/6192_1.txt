Large ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is a bad movie in all respects. Scenario, the dreary pace, the lack of depth in any character, meaningless sub-plots, ruthless action, culminating themselves all make it, perhaps, the worst movie I have ever seen. I did not find anything nice, pleasant and intellectually stimulating way. <br /> <br /> I believe that the filmmakers thought they were doing something clever and dark, with moody lighting, long drawn-out silence and uncertain chase classic soundtrack. If so, they are not completely. I'm just bored, and I want to, I never looked at it. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
