They screwed up the story! Eventually Nelly all heroic and take for the team to save all their asses from the Hill House and a lot of stupid things like that! They added the head getting chopped, sharp wires peoples persons, and the ceiling is transformed into a giant hand! What the hell is that about ??? I have and I love the original film, I read the book, and I love it! The reason why the original film and the book is so great because it scares you so much, not even showing a ghost. There's no gore. There is no ceiling arm. It is only classified as a ghost ghosts can really kill a person. They can not kill us, they can not give us the room or fly opener in our head. No, they can only drive us mad. Taking all of our sense of security. Nellie was a selfish woman. She wanted only good things for themselves. Yes, she cared little for others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont took a shit on this great story! I hate this damn remake!
