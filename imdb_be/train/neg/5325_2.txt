A reviewer from Poland to be a feminist, because she believes "Young Catherine" to be a great film, and historically accurate. Nothing could be further from the truth. As a practicing Russian historian for many, many years, I objected to the YC at almost every turn, and, in particular, politically correct description of her boss, who with one hand hastening Russian dominance in direction. Really? She was taken only in St. Petersburg, to be a wife and mother, and found that she had to "communicate" with the nobility, the boyars, and the military, just to survive. As long as it does not challenge them she was able / allowed to engage in its cultural suggestions (filling Hermitage treasures of art, etc.). There is so much evidence that it was not "great", but in the field of post-modern revisionism, the evidence is not very popular. YC only costume drama, a little down with Ted Turner, who, as "Peter the Great" in 1986, is another example of how much Russia is portrayed in the West.
