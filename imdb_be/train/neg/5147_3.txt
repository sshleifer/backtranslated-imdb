"Blue Desert" could have been the potential to be even halfway believable and enjoyable thriller was the protagonist, Lisa Roberts (Courteney Cox) was not that stupid. If she is a victim of the attack on the streets of New York, comic book artist Roberts moved to a small town to the west. In her first days there, she meets a suspicious crazy Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer, playing the role of a well), which ultimately did not leave her side. Fearing for his safety after having been in a situation twice before she strikes up a friendship and relationship with suspiciously friendly city policeman, Steve Smith (DB Sweeney, who is a character does not seem convincing enough, leaving distrust among the audience, which should be different convinced of the red herrings thrown by the authors). Smith needs Roberts cooperation, because, as he says it, the Atkins and former prisoner convicted of sexual assault. But the police did not have enough evidence to put him away early. <br /> <br /> The film was enough tricks, at least, make an interesting film because it quickly enough, there is such confusion, Roberts who to trust. However, most of the estimated uncertainty is too forced, because Roberts' character never seems to react to simple things, we believe that any reasonable person would. And its slow reaction allow much of this unknown place easily and unconvincing, especially in the final. Perhaps Sweeney was the wrong choice for this role; too child faces in the relationship of such person reminds Kevin Anderson evident in his character in "Sleeping with the Enemy." Or, if Lisa Roberts was written as a strong character, it may be sufficient as well. At the same time, the film is not so great, even as a low-budget B-thriller.
