It is very soft and inert production of one of the most exciting plays of Shakespeare. I can only assume that the intention was to make the game as accessible and understandable as possible for the audience, which is not subjected to Shakespeare before. By doing this, though - making each and every line clear intention is obvious - they drained the game of life and turned it into a flat caricature. Anyway, it's really sad. - a very difficult feat with such excellent material <br /> <br /> Effective forgettable at best - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson, Don Pedro. Others, however, did not fare so well. Hero April Shawnham a pouty, breathless fool that often causes shudders. Jerry Meyer Don John nonsensical cartoon character on a maliciously Whiplash level (although Snidley was much more enjoyable). <br /> <br /> F. Murray Abraham (you know, the guy who killed Mozart?) Not in this version, if it was not in disguise and had his name from the credits. <br /> <br /> Given that producer Joseph Papp, is basically a god of the theater, this production is not only frustrating, but the head scratching as well. <br /> <br /> Do not mess with it. Clock Many Branagh noise instead - his version is full of vital energy and humor, not to mention the remarkable performances.
