I can not vote for it because I would not see debris from these people. They got their money with another film (Mr. Jingles), and I vowed that would never happen again. I feel it is my civic duty to help people stay away from this garbage. Go to the forum for this film and read where the actors try to act as they see the movie for the first time. One guy even answers themselves ... with the same name! There SHILLS in the forum, which say that it is as good as The Shawshank Redemption Citizen Kane ... and not even close (not far away). If this is the second movie of the company, it should be better than the first. This means that the third film should be much better. Not that I saw him. All I want to know how you distribute this garbage, using the same names, all the time. Have fun with your friends and make a movie over the weekend it was good ... but do not try to sell this garbage!
