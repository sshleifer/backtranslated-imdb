I must confess at once that I was never a supporter of Rodney Dangerfield. In fact, I have it does not get "no respect" I watched it only because my wife wanted to see him, and found exactly what I expected:. Stupid story without any real humor He is full of miserable, rude jokes. very funny story revolves around Developer (Dangerfield) plans to build a ski resort in Utah, who just did not grab my attention at all. <br /> <br /> in addition to Dangerfield movie was made weak cast, including the likes of Andrew Dice clay and completely over the hill, John Bayner (I did not even know that he was still around, pack eh I did not see his name in the credits for it.) <br /> <br /> Dangerfield This really is a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> 2/10
