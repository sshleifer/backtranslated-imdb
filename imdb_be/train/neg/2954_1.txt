I watch a lot of bad movies, MUCH !!!!!! It's kind of a hobby, actually. Almost every Saturday, the final group of friends and I get together and watch the garbage from around the globe - NOTHING. Turkish super hero movies, vampire movies from Brazil, the films of Italian gorilla transplants, Kevin Costner movies, nothing (except, perhaps, improve Helen), but Ihave never seen the worst of the film than Theodore REX. Never. And it's not even fun bad in Ed Wood sort of way - it's just crap. Now the film was known in Hollywood at the time it was done because Whoopi off his gloves and made it clear to the press and anyone else who will listen that she hated that piece of crap = she tried to get out of her contract, she whined, she moaned, but nevertheless, they pour her fat ass in those tight leather skin futuristic police uniform that terrible to see, Clap !!!! And you can just see it simmer while taking - doing everything, but looking at the camera for her agent, so that she can yell at him. Dinosaur has about three facial expressions and the script is so horrible third grade class could do better if promised cookies.
