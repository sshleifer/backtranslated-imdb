Just looking at the sets, staging and editing is easy to say that this project was not a proper budget. Perhaps, Bela Lugosi is meant to distract from things like this. Young brides drop dead at the altar after the word "I". Their corpses stolen a famous gardener Dr. Lorenz (Lugosi) and a couple of his favorite fancy his aging wife (Elizabeth Russell) in need of an injection of glandular fluid young virgins to stay forever young ... forever beautiful. Impatient local reporter (Luana Walters) understands that each missing bride was the same rare orchid to the altar; orchids, in which Dr. Lorenz will be the most experienced. A typical horror movie storm brew makes a visit to the estate Lorenz little scary; especially dwarf hunchback and slobbering on the premises. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Erekal and Frank Moran.
