:: Potential spoilers :: <br /> <br /> Man, this movie was terrible. Catholic / superstitious / thriller, it goes well already sweeping the ground from the previous films. <br /> <br /> doubting priest. Sex and the priesthood. Politics and religion. Church of hypocrisy. Conspiracy involving the Church. At the dawn of the new century, the evil one. All kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evil. <br /> <br /> Pretty stupid and poor with a weak plot enough. The story revolves around two concepts: Absolution, better known as the sacrament of the anointing of the sick - the last human rights may ask to clean their sins, but on the verge of death; And Weaning, the act of cutting a man from the Church. Basically, separated man can not receive Absolution. Thus, it comes in Sin Eater, and I'll leave it at that. Add all narcotic things that I have listed and you have the "order". <br /> <br /> I found a sex scene with the priest interlaced with images of the Virgin Mary shots and offensive to Catholics. It also ends with Heath Ledger said (I'm paraphrasing): "I am the Redeemer and damner sins, I live without love blah blah blah" / rewind his walking in a dark alley with a long trench coat ala "The Matrix." <, Br /> <br /> I made this film, not only a crappy and unoriginal, but also because he managed to offend the entire faith in the process. If you want to see something better, I propose «The Prophecy» with Christopher Walken.
