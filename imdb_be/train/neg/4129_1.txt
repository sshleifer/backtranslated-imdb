After watching about half of that, I was ready to give up and turn it off, but I endured to the end. This is a film that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails. Effective poor --- much worse than the current in the 80th T & A movie. <br /> <br /> There are some attempts of humor that fell flat and the film 100% predictable. Perhaps if you are a teenager, the film will hold a certain appeal, but also for those who have seen a lot of movies, you'll know how the movie turns out after the first 10 minutes. The rest of your time will be spent in agony expectations of end credits roll. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time watching this.
