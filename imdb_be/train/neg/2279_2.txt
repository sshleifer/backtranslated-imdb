Boy what a hopeless mess this was.But it lasts only an hour, and I only paid a dollar for it, so I'm going to live .... as opposed to just throw this one thousand nine hundred thirty-three clunker that all dust now. <br /> <br /> So in any case, a small village begins to be turning up the body, which had been exhausted all their blood.The local peasants starts talking about vampires, of course, a little louder after each body found.The town sheriff or constable or something he played an amazing actor Melvyn Douglas, trying to tell them otherwise.When he mentions that the dead have one big hole on each side of the neck, and two holes close to each other, the locals then just say, it is a giant vampire bat.The constable insisted that vampire IDN out, and he must be a person makes a criminal homicide. <br /> <br /> But Melvin does not seem too bothered either way.He spends most of his time trying to get into his trousers candy, played by Faye Wray.Also in this mixture is a town simpleton, playing Dwight Frye, you al ways seemed to play the same role in every film he did.He further frills townspeople catching mice and drink their own blood.Lionel Atwill plays the town doctor, who, it would seem, is trying to help solve the constable crimes.And boy does he always stinks like actor.Atwill as close as possible to the cardboard in this role, as he can, get.And Lionel Barrymore in these things .... a lot of big names to be such a pile of guano. <br /> <br /> In addition to the terrible wrong the movie title, alternative name, «The Blood Sucker» much better this film, too boring and perseverance, and sheer stupidity. <br /> <br /> For me the high point of the film is watching Fry, he nails the quaint town of pervert, but apart from him this film did not offer much.And when you find out the cause of the strange deaths and to see a special effect thing, which requires that all that blood will really miss down. <br /> <br /> Bela Lugosi made a lot of horrible pictures, but at least it was fun and interesting watch.Think of this film, in fact poor Lugosi Lugosi WITHOUT clunker and you get a sense of how unhappy bad it was a disgrace. <br /> <br /> If you can not make good the 1930s horror film, at least put it in Lugosi.
