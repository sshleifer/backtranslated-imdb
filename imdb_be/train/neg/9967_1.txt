<br /> <br /> This movie sucks. Ridiculous "school", the atmosphere is incredible students who are very bad and behave like criminals, and then after a "good teacher" Nick Nolte was teaching them, they have become so well and quietly, like kittens. <br /> <br /> If it works for you, not for me. 0 of 10
