Here's what happened: <br /> <br /> 1) The head of BBC3 should do a program aimed at a different audience to the BBC2 and BBC1, to keep the license and work <br /> <br /> 2) Lenny Henry offers him. unfunny friends up. <br /> <br /> 3) The head of BBC3 clicks them, completely ignoring the fact that they are not funny. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is that it could have a racist, because all the characters play up the bad stereotypes. If the white man has done this kind of thing, there would be uproar! <br /> <br /> Trash.
