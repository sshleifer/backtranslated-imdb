I think that the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know that I would not have had the courage to go even 5 feet away from the crocodile. <br /> <br /> But, everything in this film is bad. Farting jokes, people eat a receipt and a sketch of the President of all to make a film one of the worst ever. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad movie that you should stay away. All of the "joke" is so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing, because they are so stupid. The plot is so bad that you wonder if the writer 4 years. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised Croc Hunter did not plead the crocodile to eat it after he saw it.
