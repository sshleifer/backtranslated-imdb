This is a copy of one thousand nine hundred forty-eight Doris Day classic, Romance on the High Seas. <br /> <br /> storyline is more or less the same, but modern. Govinda plays a sharp-witted guy who replaces her husband on a trip. While Rani plays a college of his wife, who does the same service. They allegedly trying to catch each other while trying to operate the actual spouses each other in Bombay. <br /> <br /> The trip Govinda mistakes of another girl for a wife, and spies on her while falling in love with Sanjeev in wonderful Rani. <br /> <br /> Lever plays a dual role of father and son both lawyers specializing in divorce cases. They confront each other for the warring couple. <br /> <br /> This is a bad attempt to copy the original classics and songs are very unsatisfactory. Comedy slap-stick and will not make one laugh too much.
