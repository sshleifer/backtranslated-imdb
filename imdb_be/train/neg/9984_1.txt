It was Sunday night, and I was waiting for the movie advertised on TV. They said that it was a comedy! The film began 10 minutes passed, then 30 minutes, and I did not laugh, not even once. The fact that the movie is over, and I have not received even echance laugh. Please, someone tickle me, I lost 90 minutes of nothing.
