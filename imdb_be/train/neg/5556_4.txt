During the first 17 minutes Director Bradford May «Darkman III: Die Darkman Die», we have already been silly to summarize and accompanying voice-over in the first two movies, funny over the action, about three minutes of footage just ripped from the second film and edited a bit like new staff, and a long scar advertising and tormented title character of hours on the Universal theme Parks- Universal to be the company which distributed the film. So, «Darkman III: Die Die Darkman» quite a handful when it comes to cheap cash-ins on the success of the previous film <br /> <br /> At this time, the disfigured anti-hero Peyton Westlake (He, «Darkman»,. portrayed by actor "mummy" Arnold Vosloo) locks horns with an evil crime lord and lousy husband Peter Rooker (played brilliantly in the top performance of Jeff Fahey), and within a 87 minute film grows to develop affection for his wife and daughters Rucker, once again learn to care about the other person. <br /> <br /> Blah. Blah. Blah. <br /> <br /> This film is basically just a silly way to the studio to make more money from the original Sam Raimi film, which I believe to be a great action-suspense film. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, and there are also a number of silly sub-plots, including the thief, who was allegedly one of the first doctors to save Darkman after scarring, and she seduces our hero, thinking she 'it is an ally, before revealing her hideous plot to help create a more thugs Rucker super-human power, like Darkman. Apparently, she can not just do the same thugs procedure that she performed on Darkman. Why? I can not explain it, because the film is, of course not. <br /> <br /> There's also a murder of a sub-plot involving the district of Antalya, which threatens to bring down the organization Rucker, and some other very stupid things happening. <br /> <br /> But it really is not. This film feels like two or three episodes of the television show, edited together more than the actual film. The guide alternates pretty good and just sloppy (the scene where Darkman rides on the train, the car, and finished with a rocket-launcher that's just silly), and editing is a mixed bag. The film is simply moving too fast for those who really do not care what happens. And without spoiling it, the last 15 minutes of the film, in fact, the entire series is a kind of ... I do not know ... another 15 minutes of footage mixed bag. <br /> <br /> In fact, commenting on editing one of my favorite things in this movie watching footage reused from the previous films, and then looks for images in this film, which is repeated several times. Yes, it is so cheap. It is one thing to make a re-cap at the beginning of the film, and may repeat the shot or two, but in large amounts, they do it (minutes of footage from previous films repeatedly), it's just sloppy and amateurish. <, Br /> <br /> In addition, I must say that the installation of a psychedelic freak-outs DarkMan are a bit overdone in the film. They are so stylized and exaggerated that they work, but only in the light doses and in the proper context, as it did in the original film Raimi. There are at least four or five, and they feel very cool and out of place. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the film is not without some good points. Several scenes are well done. Cliché story Darkman tight for a real life working properly for the function of direct to DVD. Some of the acting is good, especially from his wife in Rucker, painted beautiful Roxanne Dawson. In addition, while if there is no Danny Elfman, composer Randy Miller is good music that builds off of the original Elfman in. <br /> <br /> But on the whole, the film is too fast, cheap and silly to take seriously. WFFL seems alternately bored and violent from scene to scene, and Fem, while a joy to watch as over the top villain, just do not quite fit into the series. <br /> <br /> As well as "Darkman II», I would recommend it to fans of the original, which is sure to get a laugh. Otherwise, you do not need to apply. Four out of ten.
