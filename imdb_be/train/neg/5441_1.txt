Of all the films I've seen this rage, you have to be one of the worst yet. Guides, logic, continuity, change the plot of the script and dialogue made me cry out in pain. "How can someone think of something like that shit?" Gary Busey known for his «B» movies, but it is true «W» cinema. . (W = waste) <br /> <br /> Take, for example: approximately two dozen FBI and local law enforcement surround trailer home with a jeep Wagoneer. Inside the jeep is MA and "confused" why all the cops about. A few seconds later a huge shootout occurs, MA was killed immediately. The police jeep to blast away at Gary and the company smoking in them. The police are falling like dominoes, and a jeep ride with Harry around and are not affected by a single bullet / pellets. MA killed Gary and does not seem to have noticed that guy fucking hard. Really a miracle, not as much as six-shooter held 300 bullets were such a miracle.
