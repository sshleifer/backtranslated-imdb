The premise of an African American woman in modern Scrooge, who is fighting the city was inspired by, but in this film is nothing there. Here Ms. Scrooge is a miserly banker who takes advantage of the employees and customers in the largely poor and black neighborhood it inhabits. There is no doubt the good intentions of the people involved. Part of the problem lies in the fact that the roots of the plot does not translate well to the urban environment of the film and the script is not able to do the job of renovation. In addition, the constant message of separation and feeding is repeated without end, the audience gets tired of it long before the film reaches its end of the familiar. This message is a film that does not know when to quit. In the title role, a talented Cicely Tyson gives too alarmed performance, and sometimes the line is difficult to understand. Charles Dickens novel has been adapted so many times, it is a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and up to date, in spite of his very relevant message.
