I was also misleading packaging. I, too, fell to the bloody package and DVD case, which says, "mourned a fan, each specimen was removed from the shelves." Although it was cheap ($ 6.99), it was not really all that is necessary - not scary, and very limited gusset. The final was very cheesy and not deliver the punch it should have. I actually do not even know how it became "Video Nasty" with the way it is very tame. History pulls characters obvious amateur actors ... he did not live up to the promises. Bonus DVD feature (the "interview") is very strange, as the director is very inconsistent and not all there. Lead actress says, she appears in a Shakespearean production. It's a great laugh.
