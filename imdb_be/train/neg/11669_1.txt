I believe that it is beautiful and fashionable, to see amazing things in an absolute vacuum of the film as it is. Over time, the senseless extravagance of many Hollywood movies, we can relax and enjoy the scenes deprived explosion foul language, and the banal one-liner. Minimalism has its place and can be very effective when used properly. However, this film is not one of those cases. <br /> <br /> Take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary scenery rare. I am sure that they must have a great significance and understanding, because of course a message wrapped in surprise. The current poor ... soft and pedestrian ... and has one of the worst screaming scenes in history (at the end of the movie when you can sit through it to the end). uniformity of scenery, and a ridiculously long sequence ends with the girl who is going through a barren park as welcome as a pulled tooth. I would call it anticlimatic, but the film is not based on any would climax whatsoever ... not even in the "erotic" scenes ... it would not be true. I am sure that there is a script used during filming, but with the amount of dialogue, I think it may have been written on a napkin. Basically, this film does not offer anything of interest to or not ... will strike no more stories, no mind-blowing ideas or visual drama, no excitement. Apart from two or three funny moments, this film is a waste of two hours. Tragically sad and boring film.
