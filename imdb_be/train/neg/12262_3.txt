Supporters of the creature feature films have to withstand a lot of horrible movies lately. Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid, redundant title pulp-horror about a ridiculously large animals, who want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles particularly successful, as we have already had to fight our way through bottomless "Crocodile" (directed by Tobe Hooper disappointment) and "Lake Placid". Blood Surf every bit as bad as the other films and ?? on top of that ?? she likes to exaggerate enormously. Salt-crocodile supposedly 90 years, longer than 30 feet (!), And he kills for fun! In the film he plays, eating a bunch of completely stupid surfer-dude and dudettes, who came to look for new acute sensation of surfing in shark congested area. Just beautiful aspect of this film is a tropical place. Despite the fact that it is absolutely unacceptable for the installation of the film as it is, and the nature of the lagoon look amazing. Any other aspect simply catastrophic. There's quite a bit of gore, but it looks fake and ridiculous. Dialogues quite painful to listen to! You would not believe some of the lines, these actors have to say! I know, surfers have to be mentally immature team, but I hope for their sake they are not so stupid! At the beginning of the film, one of the characters refers to Jaws as being "a mechanical toy", but a crocodile looks here at least 10 times less real than the great white shark of Spielberg. Visual effects «Blood Surf» are amateurish and massacres not hit. I will not say too much about acting as a secondary in movies like this. Girls look sexy in wet T-shirts and their tits bounce with joy, running away from the beast. You guessed it: Blood Surf very bad film. So bad, it becomes fun again. But "ridiculous" to a whole other reason than James Hickox designed.
