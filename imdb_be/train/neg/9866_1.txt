Do you want to see the movie "Gamer" on Dead gentlemen Productions. This is not that movie. This movie is not funny. It's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> All the good comments here, it seems, is written (poorly disguised) false third parties. The people who made this movie seem to be trying to synthesise a fake interest. <br /> <br /> This film is not well done mockumentary. Comparison with «Spinal Tap» Christopher Guest or offensive. <br /> <br /> The film is so vile that I can not imagine anyone familiar with the subject of finding it funny. Being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality, but if you are the ones who derided so you should hate yourself to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The film is not offensive because of its satire Grand taboo, but because of its constant pathetic vulgarity.
