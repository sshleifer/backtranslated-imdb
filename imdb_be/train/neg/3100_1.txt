?!? Hobgoblins Hobgoblins .... .... where I begin <br /> <br /> This film gives Manos - Hands of fate and the future of the war run for their money as the worst movie ever made. This is one fun to laugh, where, as Manos was just painful to watch. Hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere like the perfect film for disclosure, the term "80-CheezeÂ». Actions (and I use that term loosely) is brutal, the Hobgoblins some of the worst dolls you will ever see, and the battle of garden tools must be seen to be believed. The film was the perfect car for the MST3K, and this version is the only way to see this mess. This film gives Mike and boots a lot of ammunition to pull out some of the funniest jokes they've ever done. If you are trying to look at it without the help of T-shirts and boots ..... God help you !!
