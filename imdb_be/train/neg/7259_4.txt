This is definitely one of the country's 70 films out there, and this is the most typical of dumping decade Bigfoot hysteria. It should also be noted, for small touch frenzy throughout the film, especially if it is dark, moody first half replaced with musical interludes all things (the other user pointed out one of the songs dedicated to the character, Travis Crabtree, who paddles around in a canoe for a while and then ... leaves, never seen). Although it hurts now, I still fun horror movie, to show the children, and anyone who has knowledge or Bigfoot or 70-highlander culture are bound to get pleasure from it. My favorite part: the guy gets so scared that he jumps down my head through the door and the narrator explains that he lost consciousness from the "Choco" (!?). Well, I'd say, breaking the door with his head, probably why he lost consciousness, but still. <br /> <br /> 4/10 stars, or 7/10 if you like bad Americana.
