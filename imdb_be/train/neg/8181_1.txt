I went to see this film (in fact, I went to see the family portraits, which includes cutting Moments + 2 other short films of Douglas Buck) at the Mar del Plata Festival (Argentina) ... I just could not watch! I had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of the cutting moment and take a look every once in a while. By the time it was over, my stomach was upside down, and I felt a little dizzy. I just have to leave the theater a few minutes after the second short-started (by the way, of course, I was not the only one who left the room). It was WAAAAY too cruel and disgusting to me! I am impressed by the many courageous people who really loved her. I just do not understand how you can love this kind of movie! Shocking and bloody and horrible image that I saw were people stuck in my head, like two days !! I also try to analyze the history of (my friend has seen it all and told me about it), and I just do not think it makes sense. I mean that the amount of violence and other things, has no other meaning than trying to shock people. And it's not a good enough reason, I think. There is absolutely nothing in this film that I can say, "Well, at least, the" x "that it was good." But well, I guess I'll never understand that such films.
