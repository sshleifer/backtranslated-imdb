... but a lousy movie. As Maltin says it was an attempt Christopher Lee to make a serious horror film. Well, this is serious ... too seriously! The plot is stupid and slow (something about the old people living in the body of young children to attain immortality) ... film all the talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again. I actually dozed off a few times! The film is sooooo boring! Throw sleepwalks through this with the sole exception of Peter Cushing and Lee ... but it's probably a labor of love for both of them (they often complained about horror movies to be too strong ... well, it has no violence!). Avoid at all costs ... unless you have insomnia ... it will put you to sleep!
