At some point, Violet (Lucy Liu) says Neil (Cillian Murphy), which is why she is constantly looking for adventure. She said, "because I bore-phobic." This means that it can not really get on his life by making some mandatory measures. Well, I think its cause and the film go very ironic. Because "Watching Detective" is a cheer boredom. <br /> <br /> Did any of these characters actually do something exciting at a time? Neil bastard, runs his own very small video rental store. He and others of his geek friends usually hang out around the shop and watch movies together, discussing them later. But Neil life completely turned around when Violet comes to his shop. She is an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him. Anyway, after a few dates, they decided to see each other. The problem is that Violet is a man who continues to make jokes joke on the Nile and can not actually do something normal, while Neal completely opposite to her. The question is how. Whether they are going to be in love in the end? You bet. <br /> <br /> «Watching the Detectives" cliché romantic comedy based on it. And they made it even worse, pretending to be something else. From the first installation of a pair, we know that Neil is quite laid-back guy who does not really commit to anything. And then, Violet takes the stage, looking all weird and annoying. Thus, at this point, we all know that we will sit, although senseless situation, to find out how they are going to end up in the end. There are to be expected? I would say no. <br /> <br /> As I said, they tried to give more to the audience. "Watching the Detective" trying to talk about the attachment. In order to observe how far people go in order to achieve anything they want. We knew that in the end, what crazy things that Violet did it all test how Neil is ready to go to win her heart (or any other). Well, I think it's quite garbage. This film is over fairly quickly when Neil just told myself, "Forget about it, the girl is one of the nutjob!" After collaborating with many great directors recently (Danny Boyle's "Sunshine" and "28 Days Later", Ken Loach's "Wind that shakes the Barley "and Neil Jordan's" Breakfast on Pluto ", to name a few), it is rather strange choice for Cillian Murphy to make a film with one of the Broken Lizard comedy troop, Paul Soter. By all means, it's not bad (as usual), but such a talent actor, he should not waste his time in a film like this. On the other hand, Lucy Liu awful awful as Violet. Her acting mess. I mean, it's everywhere, and so over-the-top. Tony Montana would be proud. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, wrongly, that the film is made it does not matter the name. You just can not connect the dots between the plot and its name; and then you will end up thinking that it does not make any sense. In short, "looking Detectives" nice when forgettable film that you might have a chance to catch it on cable TV, so fast that you could not imagine <br /> <br /> BloodyMonday. Rating: 1.5 / 4
