This movie is terrible, if you pay attention to it. This is the perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance on the screen - each of them with no apparent connection to the other. I rented this movie because I am a supporter of David Bowie, and I really appreciate musicals. Finally, Bowie in the film for a total of ten minutes, and the song and dance sequences were scarce and poor. The moral of this story is really befuddling. I could not say when it came to racial problems in London in 1950 or not sold. In the first half of the movie I laughed like it was cheese, but I liked campiness message "not for sale". If negros began to be killed, I thought my tape got messed up. Maybe I take half of two different movies? No, there was «Keep Britain White» sequence of song and dance. I'm sorry, but WWII is not something that you can write a musical about. At least, not music, that can probably be described as "campy", as I have several times in this review. Overall, I would say that this film could have done much better if he had made up your mind and throw the best actor. (And he put David Bowie in it a crack) My grade: C-
