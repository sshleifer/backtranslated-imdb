Watching Smother were perhaps the most long is not quite 90 minutes of my life. There was no laughter to be had; in fact, I do not remember ever having cracked a smile. Diane Keaton was terribly unfunny as a chain smoking dogs middle-aged treasure domineering mother textbook character, relentlessly annoying woman, apparently suffering from some kind of personality disorder. She is manipulative, conniving, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic, and worst of all, sad. <br /> <br /> I guess I should briefly mention the other characters, but why? It was just a long string of movie clich√©s - Nutty, socially inept distant relative, who is just trying to get into the "industry" in the blunt and patience, but somehow even lovable father, mild- manners wife simply can not 't take any more (but eventually goes beyond discord and humbly comes home), unhousebroken herd of dogs that love to chew throw pillows while all this is, etc. <br /> <br /> Oh, that snoring. I've never been a supporter of Diane Keaton and Smother reminded me just why. Sun replays replays, no matter how many pictures you have done in his prime. Her attempts to physical comedy was particularly humiliating. That the director thinks? <br /> <br /> While I love Dax Shepard and can even sometimes tolerated Liv Tyler, and their performances were so dim and dull, it was clear that none of the actor gave a damn about this movie. It was good, because neither do I. Keaton endless egocentric chatter was unbearable, and sometimes it seemed to dislike Shepard present. By the end of the movie I wanted to hit her himself. <br /> <br /> Awful.
