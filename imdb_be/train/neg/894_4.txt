Just I saw him yesterday in SÃ£o Paulo International Film Festival. Just before I came here, to see how it was evaluated, and while it was 7.4, a fairly good rate ... <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, I was dying to come out (never I did not do it), but hesitated to do so as the film's producer was in the screening. <br /> <br /> I do not like at all, crayons and dialogues do not lead anywhere, the characters smaller than the dialogues, nothing to lead anywhere, and the worst, and the worst thing: a lot of Siemens and Organics advertising on cinema. Despite the fact that I had already paid to go to the movies, and entertain yourself, I still have to be filled in the main character chatting on the internet, and Siemens Mobile pops up all the time on top of the knee; or other symbol, which has a bath or cutting her hair just to be tremendously Organics shampoo is displayed on the screen! All this would be tolerable if the plot, characters, songs, everything was fine, but it was bad, very bad! A "do not know how to do it" sex-in-the-city. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and money.
