Almost everything in this film is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Myers, for example. He reached the point where you realize that his shtick has not changed since his SNL days, more than a decade ago. He does the same Cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voice. His cat painfully unfunny. He's trying so hard. He is a strange type A comedian, not a cool cat, he should be. The rest of the film is just as bad. Sets incredibly ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars. (Cardboard expression for the background buildings would make more sense than building a whole district and the main street.) Alec Balwin trying to make a funny impression Great Santini, but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent. There's even a moment innapropriate cheesecake with fake celebrity Paris Hilton --- that sticks in the mind, just because it has to be the story of Dr. Seuss. Avoid this film any price, man. It's not even interesting train wreck. (I hope that they will make Horton with Robin Williams. Then we will have a bad Siusi film starring comedian-spasitc- trilogy.)
