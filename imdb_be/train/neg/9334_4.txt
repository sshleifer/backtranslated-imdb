OK Flick installed in Mexico, a hit-man (Scott Glenn) who hitches a ride with the struggling American writer and his Mexican girlfriend after impact. He pays them to take him to the border ?? but things get out of hand. <br /> <br /> It starts well enough, but quickly fights and dies. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** <br /> <br /> The ultimate relations turn bad set and hard to believe. Lack of passion, and in fact entirely reasoning behind her leaving one person after the other, made it funny - and the end was predictable and boring <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br. /> Harvey Keitel is an American agent in the footsteps of HIT-man, but he seems a little confused as boring and slow script ...
