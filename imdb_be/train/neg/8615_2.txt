This movie was so bad, the elderly, and it's ironic that I had a hard time to see it through. I saw this guy in Rodney Congenital Killer, and I thought he was funny as hell in it, but this movie was shit. The "joke" was not funny, the actors were not funny, nothing about it was not even remotely funny. Do not waste your time on it! The only positive thing about it was the beautiful wife :) and Molly Shannon, who I'm sure tried hard, but the script was just too awful. That is why I rated it "2" instead of "1", but it is definitely one of the worst films I have ever seen.
