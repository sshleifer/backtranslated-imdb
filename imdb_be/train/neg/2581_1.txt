First, to get your personal feelings on the way, let me start by saying that I hate so-called comedies, where each character is written and played as a so stupid that you wounder, if they are the result of inbreeding. <, Br /> <br /> Now I say this, I've seen the first three American Pie movies, and while they were not the most amazing films I have ever seen, they were all right (and direct masterpieces compared three «American Pie Presents» movies), I still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie? <br /> <br /> I also have a few other questions too. <br /> <br /> Who would have thought that it was acceptable to use the studio facilities and production resources? <br /> <br /> which approved the final script (and that this person smokes when they approved it)? <br /> <br /> And, finally, why would someone think that he deserves to be released in the theater, where the average ticket price is $ 10 to $ 15 depending on where you live, if he had to go straight to the discount bin at blockbuster or Wal Mart? <br /> <br /> There is so much wrong with this film, I can not really write a comprehensive review because it would exceed the maximum allowable word on this forum, so I'll just touch on the greatest things wrong with it . <br /> <br /> plot generic uninspired and stupid and all the characters are so interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minutes, but the biggest thing that I see wrong with this film acting. <br /> <br /> while most of the cast are entirely incompetent namers, which will probably be forgotten in a few years, <br /> <br /> one and only big name in this film there Eugene Levy who spends most of the time he is on the screen with this meaningful grin on his face that tells viewers: "I know that it ISN" T funny, and I spend my talents, but hey I'm getting paid for it, so who cares "he does not even try to do any of his jokes funny (it really deserves better than this garbage). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, most of the other actors are terrible, even if some of them were in some really big TV shows, Tyrone Savage (from classical Wind At My Back Canadian series) plays a character who is so unbearable unsympathetic and annoying (there are things that he could teach a tropical skin disease), you almost want it to die a slow and painful death on the screen, Christopher McDonald (of NCIS, Law & order) just hang around on the screen and the waste that the talent he has, being in this film. <br /> <br /> maybe the next film in the series will be just soft core porn with a story line, so that they can get around and get the MPAA rating R, this film is all a pointless vulgarity and nudity aimlessly offencive sexual content, he had to get the X rating (ratings board should be drunk or drugs when they reviewed this film rating for it). <br /> <br /> Interestingly, twenty-five years ago, when Wes Craven introduced Nightmare on Elm Street in the MPAA rating for the inspection, they forced him to cut twenty-five seconds of video (I think that was part of the scene of death, which had casting silicone breasts in it) to avoid receiving a rating of X and he had no other choice but to do it or the film would not be released, <br /> <br /> but this kind of garbage with nothing offensive can get an R rating today, because it's all done in the name of comedy, when this film was a drama or a horror film with t who hails content would be a big stink over the content and it would be terrible havegotten X rating. <br /> <br /> The last thing that really annoys me that letter, the movie is recorded to play as a wet dream of a twelve-year-old child with a very hyperactive sexual fantasy of his rather juvenile and extremely dull, almost every narrative situation, which is supposed I move a corpse in this film calls the story together so telegraphed that any reasonable viewer can see it a mile away, and the so-called symbols just stereotypes stereotypes of stereotypes, not to mention the often disgusting sexual references and permanent is not bad desired scenes face sexual behavior, it feels like the film was written by some incompetent first year of Jaca in the low rent film school class writing script. <br /> <br /> long and short of this is his time to kill the series until he stupider than a stupid and offensive, the pie is filled with road apples.
