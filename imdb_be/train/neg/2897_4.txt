There's little to get excited about "Dan in Real Life." Firstly, the whole installation is incredibly unnatural. Do you really believe that during this very long first conversation meeting in a restaurant, Marie would not tell Dan, where it is going? And as Dan did all the talking during this conversation, why it will be so attracted to him? However, I never understood why Mary is so attractive to Dan throughout the film. He's very narcissistic, and not enough to convince us that he is a really nice guy (for example, it is Marie at a bookstore, mocks his brother about his past girlfriends and trying to make Marie jealous of the "blind") does. There's more tricks, such as a ridiculous scene in the bowling alley, where Dan and Marie caught making out with the whole family. Since this can really happen. Dan in Real Life is slow, juicy and manipulative. Even chicken movie as Jane Austen Book Club receive higher scores than predictable "sentimental".
