Apparently, this is what happens when the director allows his 14-year-old nephew to rewrite dialogue on the set, when he gave himself alcoholically at the same time; as I said before, although I've always wanted to catch one of the werewolves photos Paul Naschy, this atrocity served as my introduction, and as bad as it certainly is, I still intend to pursue the other entries in the series, although and very gradually. <br /> <br /> Despite some high-profile disappointments, like the roaring Joe Dante (1981), I love werewolves picture as a whole, but to be honest, I quickly lost interest in the "scenes" that movie and just stood there, staring at the TV screen believing it to absurdity, as it were. There are too many to mention them here, but I have to say, the two that seem to me particularly oars were schizophrenic character of the person Werewolf (ie going from a rabid animal in one shot with a dazed, zombie-like state in the very next - as if he were on an irregular northern walks in the countryside and sports a very different case for download ... and yes, I do not know the reasons for this in advance) and "Phantom of the opera" to search for character Wolfstein! But what I know - perhaps elusive full-length version of this confusion could very well have been a bona fide classic horror!
