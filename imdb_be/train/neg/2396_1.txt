Just I saw this movie on TV, and I must admit I was a bit surprised that even further. There were so many inconsistencies, table windows, and bad edit that old episode of Sesame Street would be better to look at. The acting was good, but, please, can you really feel "straight to video" feeling. The cast / crew made this film a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the film, but just wait until ten minutes before the end, to hear him. Trust me, you would not even notice the difference.
