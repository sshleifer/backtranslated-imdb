I'm sorry, but even TJ Hooker Adrian Zmed could not keep it going on. I went through half of the film, thinking that it was a hoax original. Then, that wild and stupid motorcycle scene (note that this is the only film that directs Patricia Birch); I sadly realized that they were trying to be serious. I really enjoyed the fact that the warring gangs, having lost its "wheel" because of their gambling habits in the original Grease, were forced to use motorcycles in the second film. Being ashamed that Putz character Carrington, I would hate to see that they will apply no later than: maybe Mopeds <br /> <br /> I also never bought a battered topic: hunky-Australian boy is not I finishing INTO-Outsiders dominated school-ergo-goes-for -tough-guy-with-stupid-biker helmet look. It was the story Disney has gone horribly awry. <br /> <br /> So, it looks like you can spoil a good thing by putting gum smacking Michelle Pfeiffer in the musical. The only thing that I took away from this film had an idea about how many points out of ten, to give him.
