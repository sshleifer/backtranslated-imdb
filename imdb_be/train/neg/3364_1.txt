So begins a beautiful old house in the country. Do you have a group of people who are asked to come to the house, and (not surprisingly) the guards always lock the doors at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, people laugh, joke, etc. This doctor tells them the story of the ghost of the woman and some children. They are frightened, they begin to feel things. Oh, no, the girl sees output S ghost. Some more to say, this huge ghost comes, etc. etc. This girl learns that the ghost of murdered little children, and that she should release their souls, yes, yes, blah blah. She, alas, oh no, she dies as she does. And it goes to heaven, while an evil spirit goes to hell. Two people survive and escape from the house. Scenario awful, because the guy gets his head chopped off and Elanor (the one who is dying, Save the Children) said: "Oh no." Wooden steps, the effects of shit and a lot is a pair of numbers is used again and again. Basically, if you love to laugh at the bad to make a movie to watch, but if your looking for a fright, then definitely give this film a miss. I was very disappointed when I watched it. Very big let down. My sister (who receives holy easily) bored in this film is terrible.
