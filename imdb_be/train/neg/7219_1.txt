I still find it hard to understand that a movie as bad as it can be done in Hollywood. The action and the story just helpless and terrible direction. I do not see the logic behind this garbage, except, perhaps, that the director did not have anything good to do. I took me ten minutes to realize that I wasted their valuable thirty rupees. It filled me with dismay, that I was going to spend more time on his life is shit. I bet that the film was made in less than one day. I do not know which category it falls into. Please avoid this film at any cost, just to do something, even banging his head against the wall, but do not go to this film.
