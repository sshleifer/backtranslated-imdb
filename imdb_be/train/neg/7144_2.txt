It was almost worth sitting through this whole god-awful "film" just to know that I could never anything as bad as this experience again. Duties - 0, the script - 0, battle scenes - 0, Actor - 0 (cheddar bob eight miles as the suave war hero who gets the girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (she's great and not terrible actress). This is the criteria that I have used on average to two. I've lost count, but I think if a movie clich√© ever in this film. If the driver, who was allegedly killed by her father miraculously appears at the end of the race against her, out of nowhere, it cemented the previous statement. Besides, it just shows, without cause. He never mentioned even earlier. I do not know what else to say here. Just watch him when he goes out on TV for a few years. At least, so some of them will be cut out for advertising.
