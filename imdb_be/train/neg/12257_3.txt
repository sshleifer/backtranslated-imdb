"It's not that big a mechanical toy," says a character early, commenting on the "Jaws". Well, "Blood Surf 'only wish is to have a pet, as conclusive as" Jaws "shark series. In other words, the digital special effects of this film terrible. Acting and direction are not much better, either; they seem to be more suited for a deodorant or commercial gum than a horror movie. The ratio of people who worked on this film shows contempt not only the genre, but also for the spectators too. I tell you "liked" this film only encourages the filmmaker to offer us more than this shit, further destruction of the poor horror genre. (* 1/2)
