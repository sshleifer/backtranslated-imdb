This film is one long Chiche after another. First of all, although they have done their share, there is unjustified dope scene where John snorts weed, like an idiot. Wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse than the old Beatles cartoons. John reverse, jealous, closet homosexual slave Yoko he is portrayed as discredited in Albert Goldman book. They even keep beating the name of the songs in ordinary conversation "has always been just the two of us!" John would not be mean to his fans as it is. As his death showed us that he was only too well, if anything. One funny scene where silent Beatle fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Yesterday Paul. Insulted John says something along the lines of «Sure, and while I sing, why do not you get on your knees, put your wife's wig, and lick my liggin». It made me laugh for a few days. In fact, this film is funny how seriously he tries to be a while away is ridiculous. John and Paul were also not preaching all day, they were fun, light hearted guys that even during the Beatles split, where it is much more representative then reflected here. Forget it.
