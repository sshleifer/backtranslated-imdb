After the release of the popular TV «The Andy Griffith Show», Don Knotts STARDOM gave the film a bold attempt with a series of meaningless, but a matinee pleasant car comedy. Unfortunately, the "reluctant astronaut", shot on the cheap (like most movies Knotts'), much worse than his other. Don plays a small town schnook, who gets accepted into the astronaut training camp ... but not as a candidate for space travel - they want him as their new janitor! Someone may say that the weak satire on the title while a fresh rush of Americans to a new era of technology, but the film is really just a dull excuse to keep restless kids busy. He goes to a good start with the installation OK and nostalgic places, but it is becoming more and more barren and idiotic. * From ****
