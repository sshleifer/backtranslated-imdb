I am among the millions of people who consider themselves to be Cary Grant fans, but I can not think of a single reason to recommend this movie.I not understand casting Betsy Drake, and no one seems to do if we are to judge from a small number of films after which she played. <br /> <br /> Most fans agree that Katharine Hepburn was beautiful in chasing and catching Cary Grant in Lifting Baby.Here director or writers seek to redraw the idea, but it does not miserably.I've read comments about as "terrible" Drake, but I thought it was too mild description. Franchot tonnes passed through it, as if he was casting hungover.A disaster thing.This one film is a total disaster. <br /> <br /> This one does not deserve the 10 lines of comments, and I do not know why it's bad requirement.Too this one survived when so many worthy films are rotting in storage. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to torture someone, give it a wide berth.
