Firstly, I am not so easily frightened ... Anything for my few phobias, except, but this movie is absolutely horrible. It is not suitable for children at all! I had my mouth open constantly it just shocked me I. I could not believe how bloody it was for children's films, bunnies brutally murdered! It's just no need to be so awful and to be evaluated G. I recommend to be more than 8 to view this content. But do not get me wrong, it's probably a good movie, if I had not been injured in his mind as a child. I can not believe that his father would allow, say, a 4-year-old child to see this. It's just an intense and complex, not to forget the mountain, for young children. I wayy more than 4, and I was shocked by the violence. I do not recommend
