There's no getting around it-- this horror film. I have seen old Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu movies, I am familiar with the characters, and it's the origin of the sequence, but it's still just godawful. However, the genius of Peter Sellers still shines with its image Nayland Smith, with echoes of sorrow, tragedy and force the boiling through stoic facade; this performance I put on the same level with the image of Peter Cushing's Van Helsing, but done in a tenth of the total screen time movie "Dracula" all Cushing. If the film was made in a Serio-comic vein as Bubba HO-TEP by the TV show The Avengers in 1960, it could have been something special. If you Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers completed, this is what you will see, but it's a pass to someone else.
