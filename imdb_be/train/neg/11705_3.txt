This sultry melodrama quite easily the worst movie starring Ingrid Bergman, who I saw. Even her lit screen presence can not save this unbearably slow and winding the film, which is almost impossible to sit without fast forwarding much of it <br /> <br /> Only for die-hard fans of Bergman. others are very likely to fall asleep. I suggest you watch "For Whom the Bell Tolls" instead.
