Why? !! It was bland, uninspired and uncomfortable film. The confusion comes from the city where they did this ... Pittsburgh PA! Why do they let these people make such a film BAAAAAD there? <br /> <br /> If this movie was originally released ... it was more of a romantic comedy ... and there ROBO-ever. It's all been changed, along with an attractive woman affectionately Disney. WHY ???? They made a terrible interpretation of the classic comic character. Seeing Matthew Broderick to ridicule his own films was not too fun. Sheesh !!
