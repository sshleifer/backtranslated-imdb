I do not remember "Barnaby Jones" is not no more than a very soft, standard detective show, which, like any show Quinn Martin, Act I was killing, Act II was the main character to find out the murder, Act III was the scene turn (another character killed), Act IV had permission and the epilogue was Betty (Lee Meriwether) with a request to her father-in-law Barnaby Jones (Ebsen), he realized, crime, and then someone said something witty to the end of the show. <br /> <br /> One thing I remember, it was too late, the great composer Jerry Goldsmith beautiful song. Oddly enough, the opening credit sequence I want to see the show on and off for seven seasons of the show was on the air. I also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen as but the Jedi Clampett despite Ebsen be badly miscast. I just wanted to show was more interesting than the first time I remember <br /> <br /> Update (2009/11/01) :. I watched an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through the archives of the American TV channel. Let's just say that I have been kinder than Goldsmith about the show "Barnaby Jones."
