Act bad ham, all the jokes surface and the target audience is obviously very young children, provided that they have a lower than average IQs. I understand that it was intended for children, but as Malcolm in the middle, but they still throw in the adult humor and situations. <br /> <br /> What should we expect from the show under the leadership of Bob Saget, only the existence of the comedian, who is less funny than the ball hitting the crotch man who is probably why he stopped hosting America Funniest Home Videos. <br /> <br /> Parents, do not let your kids watch this show, if you do not want to save money in college. Protect their children stupid, and they will grow Dumberer.
