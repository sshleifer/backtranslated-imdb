Anyone who is familiar with my reviews in a database on the Internet Movie Data will know that I can be a grumpy bastard at times. There are a lot of films that I do not like that, for some inexplicable reason, I felt the urge to reconsider. However, if someone out there is interested in knowing the name of the worst movie I have ever seen, look no further than Transylvania 6-5000. Without a doubt, it takes the name of all time there. 1 terrible film. I can not believe I actually did it right from the start to the finish of this clunker! <br /> <br /> He was obviously meant to capture the flavor of Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, but where this movie was funny take on the tradition of horror films, this one desperately tense and improper attempt to wring laughs from the embarrassment of a weak material. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley, Jr. looks ashamed to be here as a pair of journalists in modern Transylvania (perhaps they immediately realized that they were doomed to the trash). During their research, they are against all major monsters from the horror of recent favorites such as vampires, werewolves and mummies. <br /> <br /> Those who managed to survive the film until its end, can pray for the post to be guided through their heart, to save them from the pain of boredom. It marks a career nadir for all participants, and argues that, if the comedy fails in a big way, this leads to a frighteningly heavy entertainment.
