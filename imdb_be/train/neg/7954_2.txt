OK, this film was really "unique", say. Carrie Fisher was the most talented in the film, even if he says that it was a problem of coke during the film. but she says she can not remember much. but her excuse, but that everyone else ??? I can not imagine they all had coke problem.whatever it was not all that bad, I mean I think the plot was okay, and it was some pretty funny moments. at the part where the guy gets that thing stuck in his mind was a little too strong for my taste. oh well, I guess I was disappointed, because Carrie Fisher is so awesome, and the film did not do anything for her.
