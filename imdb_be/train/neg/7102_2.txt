Okay, I admit that I watched this movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which I'm a big fan), but I'm not one of those people that automatically gives the film MST3K 1/10 rating. Although I hate many of the movies that they play, and some of them are among the worst films I have ever seen, I was actually able to enjoy some movies MST3K. That being said, it is one of the worst films I have ever seen. (This is not surprising, in fact, the authors themselves MST3K noted that this one was one of the worst. Do not believe me? Check out their website.) <br /> <br /> For me, this film is a good example of what not to do in the movie. Dialogue is very bad, worse acting, cinematography miserable direction (though, perhaps, be the best in this film) is bad. <br /> <br /> stimulation worst part in this film. Several times in the movie, the audience had to wait literally minutes to make it happen. While minutes may not sound like a very long amount of time, it may be in the movies, especially in this. I'm sure it was to create a mood, but I was just really boring. It really felt like ten minutes. <br /> <br /> If the "suspension of disbelief" means "almost fell asleep during the movie," it has a lot of that. But shouts SKULL just awful, there's no way I could possibly even get interested in what was really going on in the film, and thus the "suspension of disbelief" is really non-existent. <br /> <br /> One of the worst, and probably the most boring film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1/10
