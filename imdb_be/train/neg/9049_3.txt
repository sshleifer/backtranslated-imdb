Presumably the "social commentary" on racism and prison conditions in the countryside south of the 1970s, "The Nightmare" full of bad southern stereotypes, complete with fake accents. Moreover, it would be an insult to the sensitivity of the majority of the American South, is a tasteless piece of work comes off as just a thinly disguised "baby in prison" films - especially the original version been trimmed. However, acting is usually above average and the late Chuck Connors, in particular, does a good job of making the audience hate him - despite the fact that he looks a little uncomfortable in a few scenes. There's also instant messaging to change the tempo of the role of the late Robert Reed, who is both depraved ruler, and Tina Louise (formerly Ginger from "Gilligan's Island") has made quite plausible sadistic prison guards. My rating: D. <br /> <br />
