After exiting Cube 2 :. Hypercube (2003), and playing with the expected success of the original Cube (1998), director Ernie Barbarash takes the liberty brings us the third installment in a trilogy prequel Cube Zero <br /> <br /> Deep in the bowels of a gigantic and impersonal institution, the place and it is not known, the two low-ranking operators, Wynn (Zachary Bennett) and Dodd (David Huband) sit and watch on the monitor the behavior of people who have been placed in a giant network of cubic cells, some of which are rigged with traps of death. He said that people they see convicted criminals who have chosen this horrible death and test over lethal injection, these observers did not have any problems with their jobs, while the Wynn, the mathematical genius, finds that one of the prisoners, a woman named Cassandra (Stephanie Moore) never agreed to place inside the cube. Suddenly he realized that he might have their "work" is not what they seem, and that they can be part of something deeply sick and twisted ... <br /> <br /> For people who have seen and enjoyed the original cube, this is a prequel, probably will not be to your taste. This does not mean that the story has no capacity; it's just that the first cubic meter of film should never expand further. Standing alone, it's a neat little psychological thriller with a very interesting concept and the confidence of his own message. In addition, it was nice self-contained. The problem with zero cube is that it destroys some of the mystique of the original, trying to answer questions with more questions, but in fact, as a result of making a mess that does not need fixing. <br /> <br /> What does it offer a new film that questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil, of course, good questions that will be raised, but it probably had to be made because, according to their own merits, and not as a continuation of the film, which was not such aspirations. <br /> <br /> Having said that, other features of the film, such as action and direction and writing, not terrible. There is a dark, dark look of the film looks like film noir such as "The Matrix" and "Dark City," and they certainly managed to repulse the claustrophobic feeling of the first cube. Unfortunately for Barbarash, it is not enough good qualities to keep it.
