I just got back from the movie, and I'm totally shocked. This film is an absolute mockery of the whole of humanity. The theater I was in, maybe there were 4 other people. This film has been recommended to me, and I could not believe that this man enjoyed. I can not believe that any sane person would want it. There was no plot does not land at all. It was a joke. How can you make a film about nothing. This film is just to show why Hollywood is in the doldrums. I can only look at the spiral of "horror film" industry and giggle. Which is a parody of all filmaking, this applies to all new "horror movie teenÂ» Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw series. It's all such rubbish. I do not support such garbage!
