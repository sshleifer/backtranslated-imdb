What do you call a horror story without horror and history? <br /> <br /> This is the most annoying thing about the film: I get the feeling that the authors had not decided what's really going on in the movie! It is another thing to know it, to give tips to the audience and did not fully disclose it, but here, you get the feeling that the writers do not know the movie characters do not know about it, and the viewer sees, nobody knows! (Remember, the "Cube"? Even this film know more about yourself.) <br /> <br /> I have consumed many horror / gore 80s films, and this film certainly has its deep roots in these movies . But a lot of important things that are missing. We really do not know anything about the characters. They continue to repeat empty lines again and again. The story is actually not growing - it never goes anywhere. B-actions in the order in this type of horror movies, but not so much to act in the script. We do not care about the characters. There's nothing to remember them. There's not even a cheesy humor or unwanted sex. And most importantly -. No thrills, no trembling <br /> <br /> You can get only a few commonly used elements of horror film genre. They show Lordi monster, one after another, but the characters do not really contribute anything to the story. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that this amount of history, character development and atmosphere can be achieved with a minimum number of crew and equipment. Ah yes, the filmmakers used to do this - and more - about 20 years ago! I felt a general unease audience as the film ended. Too bad really.
