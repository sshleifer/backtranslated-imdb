Working in a video store, I get to see a lot of movies, and sometimes I try to watch some of the not so great films. Proud there was one of them. The original idea to tell the story of a primordial black manned ships during the Second World War had some advantages. But in less than 10 minutes watching the film you will know that the main point of the film had to say about racial tensions during the Second World War. The main story of the ship, the crew and their exploits in the war. This primary point hammered at you to the point of excess during the whole movie. I appreciate the people who served on the USS Mason to triumph in the face of adversity and hardship that they endured. The film had to be made by focusing on the achievements of these people have done for themselves, the Navy and his country, and not to do the film, whose attention racism during the Second World War.
