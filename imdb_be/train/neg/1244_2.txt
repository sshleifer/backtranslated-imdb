It's a bit first, the first time for me when I was disappointed in the movie Tim Burton. Pot is not a bad film (large sets, costumes and odd higher productivity), but this can be done by any off-the-shelf Hollywood director. Walking was very strange, the last three spent just waiting for the movie to the end, he and the actors. Meanwhile Roth was excellent, probably the only fun in the film. Come Tim.
