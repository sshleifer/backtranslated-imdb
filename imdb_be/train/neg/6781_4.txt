Good roll (with one exception) breaks through the smart light satire Epstein. Mansfield has never been better, and funnier than she is here paired with Walston, which is a veteran who has decided to become a congressman, to withdraw from the war. He and his friends - including suave fraudsters Grant - head to San Francisco to rest and start swinginest party town while conniving to avoid service in the whole industry through speaking tours. The only thing in this film, it's not a great performance one note Susie Parker as the love interest of Grant, who takes too much time and the film slows down the tempo in the second half. Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry; the trick is that it is set on making love to each serviceman (to do their duty for the war effort, of course), but he is a married man, who, however, loved his wife. They steal the film with a small amount of trouble from Grant (which is funny here the first part of the film, if not related to his non-actors roles.
