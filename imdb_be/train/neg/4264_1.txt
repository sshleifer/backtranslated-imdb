this film let me strongly difficult. it was a great concept, which was destroyed by a terrible scenario. History is not just flowed and fragmented, at best. There were so many elements in the story that were not explained, or were forced to place with any real thought. elements, such as a love story could be extended for a little more, and the gun must be written better. all the main character grows, you need more about the training he received and less standing around. Everyone loves a good "little man overcomes' history, and it has shown promise, but with failure scenarios should not be there. While he had some fireworks in the final battle sequence was lackluster due to lack of choreography. this is done to irritate the sad hours <br /> <br /> This could be so good :(
