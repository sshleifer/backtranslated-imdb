I saw it at the premiere in Melbourne <br /> <br /> This is a shallow, two-dimensional, unaffecting and, hard to believe, given the subject boring. Actors terrain, but they did not have a lot of work taking into account the very plodding and unimpressive scenario. For those who might be concerned that Ned Kelly is too intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that it's telling a story completely without any literary depth at all, he said completely on the surface, and full central casting standards. However, it does not work like popcorn movie ever. His walks too failed and the craft, too, is not enough to satisfy even at the level of the banal thriller. <br /> <br /> I really doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to yourself, "this is the best I could do with the material." <br /> <br /> Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response. Perhaps people's genius, perhaps the warrior class, perhaps a psychopath, and probably all of these things, he dominated Australian real mythology more than 120 years. Once again, his story fell flat on the big screen. <br /> <br /> This kind of life.
