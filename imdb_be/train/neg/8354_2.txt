Any movie in which Brooke Shields because of acts like Fonda is an anomaly and horror. Shields in fact it is only bad because she is young, inexperienced, and obviously not well directed by its role. Peter Fonda is bad, because, well, because it is bad. I loved him in Ulee's Gold, years later, but the Lord above, he immediately awful. Not that anyone is good. There's not one play (outside beautiful cameos by Henry Fonda), even bearable. I've never seen a movie with this many bad performances. In the case of Luke Askew, the main villain, it is clear that this is due to poor communication and direction, as he did a good job in the past. But his playing partner, Ted Markland, uncomfortable ham. Drawing up a bloody awful, and the actors can not be blamed for the terrible things they have to say. But they say they are so bad! Editing and direction is worse than a pedestrian. Arrows held too long dramatic reasons, or cut off before hitting the stage can be implemented. This picture was much worse than I imagined, and would have been completely forgotten (and probably never even done) without the participation of several well-known names. One bright spot: the cinematography to the Grand Canyon gracefully capturing the beauty of this area so that even a large-screen Imax production is not quite as good. Finally, either a bad version of Paper Moon, with a cute pair of father-daughter type, or a bad version of Pretty Baby, with a much more unattractive romantic relationship between the forty-something and 13 years old. It offers more recent than the first, and thus, is quite disturbing.
