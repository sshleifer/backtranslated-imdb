Only Judy Garland fans. There are two (2) numbers that are really good - one where she does a series with an older cleaner (you have all seen the pictures), and a pretty good number at the end. There are a few scenes where the lines funny. But, in principle, the script is so bad, and the film is so dated that it is difficult not to crawl on the awfulness everywhere. But it costs 2.50 to rent a movie - just be prepared to fast-forward it.
