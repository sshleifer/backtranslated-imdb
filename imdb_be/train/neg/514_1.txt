This is one of the most insipid, faded, unoriginal and pointless movies ever! It almost feels like everyone involved in this project, not even trying to make the film attractive. It is nothing but a continuation of an exhausting series of films that are trying to cash in on the success of Smokey and the Bandit, which I think is the best film of all. With regard to this waste of films, Burt Reynolds sleepwalks his way through the film, Jim Nabors wasted other actor does not do a lot, car racing, obviously, stock footage, humor, annoying, and numerous scenes are more dull and lifeless than looking a wall for two hours. «Stroker Ace» just once a film is nothing unique or distinctive about it.
