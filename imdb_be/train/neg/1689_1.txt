Wow, what a result fail! The fact people think that this film is terribly funny. The special effects were a direct plagiarism of "The Ring." History? Was there one? Not in my opinion..Just bunch of demonstration images. The entire film was a sad, stupid mess. I think there is always a market for bad movies with good marketing companies. However, this is the worst horror movie I've seen in recent years. And that Buffy chick? Well, she's a bad actress! As the plastic, like Barbie and just as talented..No, wait, that would be an insult to the talents of Barbie! I think a lot of kids helped this film at the box office, as it was PG-13, and it has been estimated the R, it would be bombed IMO! Dumb movie!
