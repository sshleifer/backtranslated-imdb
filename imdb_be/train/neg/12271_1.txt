Scenario Lisa Lutz started writing the script at the age of 21 in 1991. <br /> <br /> It is even in business? If someone gave her another chance after this piece of shit, that she is the face of the Fortunate award.This movie sucks endlessly ... It never ceases to amaze me that a turn in the movie ... and the the fact that they did this writer put it a little bit? Seriously? I can write better shit than this in my December <br /> <br /> So, how many lines to dial for me? I do not understand it at all. I believe I 'ma newbie. I believe that I do not understand why there should never be a limit to what someone has to say ... or quota? Seriously, I do not care if you have one word sentence .. .or even answer one word. I mean, c'mon? <br /> <br /> Thank you ... it is enough, after all? <br /> <br /> this film worthless.
