I'm a fan of Nightmare series, but this one is terrible. Death is so fashionable. If you were to look at it in 20 years all the Nintendo scene, LLC. I did as retrospection. I think they should have just made a prequel about how when he was still alive. It would be more interesting. This is a film that you can take or leave. Depending on how much free time you have.
