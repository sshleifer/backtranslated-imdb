Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) head out with his fishing buddies Zhindabayn, Australia on the weekend days of rest, recreation and relaxation. But if Stewart finds aboriginal woman's body floating face down in the river, then, apparently, it was the worst. The biggest victim of the weekend men's reasonable. They did not march out of the pit, and instead end up fishing weekend with some big catch. Then they go and tell the body. <br /> <br /> The city and the lives of the men quickly turn into a mess. Local media are teeming with them, and the charge of native superstition reared by the locals. Stewart's wife Claire (ENT Lynn, The Exorcism of Emily Rose) senses deeper meanings that have made her husband and his friends, but must deal with it through her own mental illness. <br /> <br /> Among all this chaos that's life, that there was this young woman who is now a media spectacle, splayed out in the morgue. Her killing and subsequent burial in the water symbolize what lay beneath the city Zhindabayn :. The separation of men and women, black and white, social and discarded <br /> <br /> only other people who seem to be aware of what happens in the two small children: a son Stewart and Claire, who is currently on led only mongrels Aussie who's mother was killed, and in just a few years before. Young girl living with her grandparents, and trying to let go of her mother, the best way it can, and the opening of a new body seems ?? oddly enough ?? a method in which to accomplish this goal (again, the main current Zhindabayn assumed). <br /> <br /> Each and everyone in this town of Jindabyne feel what lies beneath the surface, but none of them are not ready to plunge into the muddy waters and Take a look around (symbols are visible when near the lake, which is used for recreation and bathing, is said to contain the old town Zhindabayn under its surface). No, that is, until Claire does not make them. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting, if a bit too confusing. There are too many storylines that should be investigated, and it just is not done; too many loose threads. The acting was good, but the shooting of the film was terrible. Wobbly camera, grainy or dark scenes, but only a generalized negligence hurts the overall production. <br /> <br /> enjoys symbolic films, NORTHFORK be one of my favorites in this spirit. But Zhindabayn need to peak your head above the muddy water so that she could see their own problems, that just did not happen.
