It's hard to find a movie that the coast is still widespread mythology of Senator Joe McCarthy as a political king of demons. Boyle (Joe) gives convincing, but historically smudged Wisconsin Senator McCarthy caricature many take for real. Meredith, and treacherous Army lawyer Joseph Welch, who outwitted the McCarthy hearings in the army in 1954, very good, as always. <br /> <br /> In fact, McCarthy and Cohn had been right to worry about the terrible security situation in the army and the army began in 1954 hearings entangled veil used by the army to divert the investigation of their security shortcomings that the committee investigate, charge counter that McCarthy and Cohn tried to gain favor for their staffer David Schine, while in the service. <br /> <br /> film self-government agenda rather polemic initiative based on common myths that have gone for the truth to many people for many decades that the "red scare" was in fact false and McCarthy, HUAC, etc. d. always smoking in the wrong order, not being nothing more than lying down, ruining careers advertising hounds that trampling of constitutional rights affected innocent liberals, who were accused of security risks / com munists. <br /> <br /> The people who know little about the case still feel confident in repeating misinformation on McCarthy and the "red" scared that day, Clooney Murrow hagiography is an example. Misinformation is widespread, it is not surprising that people are not swallowed. A recent report of the death in Schulberg Buddy in a serious left-wing British newspaper «The Guardian» headliner that the Hollywood writer "named names", "McCarthy" - to perpetuate the lie that McCarthy "investigated" Hollywood as head HUAC-the truth is McCarthy never even been a member of HUAC and he had little interest in politics of Hollywood types, his studies have been limited almost exclusively to the US government's hands. <br /> <br /> in the mythology of the "red fright" is groundless now completely undermined recently opened Soviet and US government documents, if anything underestimated by McCarthy and the sheer scale of the Soviet and travel in the US infiltration, but also decades public misinformation about this period it will be difficult to correct. <br /> <br /> one day, perhaps, a really brave soul Hollywood to make a movie telling the truth about how many US men and women secretly helped the mass murderer Stalin, and worked to to impose their vicious system of governmen t in the western world, giving an accurate account can be, Joe McCarthy's career, but I will not hold my breath. By the time we have this mythical drunk lying bastard people's imagination so familiar in the media media .... "tail gunner Joe".
