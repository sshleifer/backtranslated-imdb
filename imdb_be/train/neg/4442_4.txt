I don't'know ... Maybe it's because I am Brazilian, but the material was too much. Too much love for music, too many parties, too much contrast between the good life of the main characters (come on, it was not so sad) and the aspect of the city showed the director. Everything looks too fake to me, family, relationships, music, "happiness". He just sells a little taste of fake Latin American cultures. I must be honest: it is to seduce me a little, but who would not be tempted by the fact that the fake life with good music, sex and parties? I'm not so stupid: what kind of world is one in which people do not suffer from diarrhea, deep sadness and sexually transmitted diseases? I liked the scene with his mother Caridad phone and discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the Spanish people.
