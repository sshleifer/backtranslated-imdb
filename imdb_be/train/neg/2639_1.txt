Let's first start this review with the fact that I signed up times Write a review and warn people to keep their money !! <br /> <br /> It was one of the worst pieces of garbage I've seen since Hulk. The storyline was the most predictable garbage you could think of. If you wait for 24, but on the big screen, wash is waiting in the toilet right away with the money, you will use the ticket .. You can have more fun that way. Action was awful, the story was completely unrealistic, (together with the so-called "twist" in the end. I must say that it is .. The ending surprised me. I do not mean the plot twist that surprised me, but instead effortless so that they are put together, which can be considered the only place a few decent action around the movie. they rushed the ending so quickly that I did not even realize that it was over, until I saw the credits rolled, and at this point I considered burning the films, when I could just understand how to get into the cinema. <br /> <br /> casting was terrible for several reasons. First, they should accidentally switched the characters job because Michael Douglas played the shot, which clearly Kiefer Sutherland was scheduled to play. in while Douglas was sneaking around agents, tapping of telephone lines, burglary systems, and removing people who were chasing him, Sutherland plays a less capable agent who is always in the mood Abajo ads, even when things are not so bad for him . He plays a very soft agent, nothing like the type of Jack Bauer roll us 24 fans love. <br /> <br /> I can only promise you that this film will disappoint in all areas. This can be best compared to a remake of "The Fugitive" / "in the line of fire," but written by people with mental disorders
