Watching "Speak Easy" is painful for fans of Buster Keaton. Seeing such a phenomenal author, actor, comics, director and stunt subjected infamous spectacles as spots Picasso ~ d, which is used as the fabric drops, or perhaps more like spots best Camembert tampered with whey solids and processed into Cheez-Whiz . <br /> <br /> Keaton poorly cast as Professor Post, whose exaggerated vocabulary is the only thing that prevents him to say, "Tell me about the rabbits, George.» (Post would say something like, "Please, let me know on the status of small mammals in the order of lagomorphs Zaitsev family, good sir, I believe, first of all I addressed with the epithet of "George". ") If Keaton created his own characters, they can be situationally ignorant, but they were not stupid. they were quick studies and become masters of their own worlds. not so with the Post, which Nicol and does not stop stumbling and clumsy, and anyone who does not have more control over their destiny than bilge rat Titanic. And while Keaton original characters had a magic naivety and innocence, Post comes in a deep sexual mentally retarded, that if he ever did become physically aroused, he put a bag of ice on the swelling and seek medical help. <br /> <br /> There are several small, redeeming moments, such as attempts to Keaton, to get rid of vampish Thema Todd or suggestions to the appropriate attire for the Greek dance camping, but it's just not worth enduring a continuous film to see them. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of bad movies, get drunk and watch the "Speak Easy" with friends, a la «Mystery Science Theater 3000". But other than that, stick Silents. That they may be 100% of what is remembered for the Buster Keaton.
