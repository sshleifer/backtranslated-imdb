Funny cranks in the London stage of the treasure, one young woman could not help fix her parents married politician with a strong, independent woman-pilot, who has never been in love. Intriguing early car Katharine Hepburn, played by Amelia Earhart as a pilot, who was too self-surrender to the participation of any person. Director (Arzner) and screenwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted the book Gilbert Frankau c) explicitly assigned to this project to get the woman's point of view, but why all the old cliches stored as frozen artifacts? Billy Burke plays a kind of simpering, sentimental wife who takes her bed when it goes wrong, and the final scene of Hepburn another bummer. Curious artifact rather than a classic for Kate-observers. ** from ****
