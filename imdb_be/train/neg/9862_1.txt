I could not believe it when I put this movie on my DVD-player. I thought I was laughing because I played D & D than half my life. I had to turn it off, as I had company and they were surprised that I was watching shit. <br /> <br /> I execute it later, and I had just left it in the soft core gay porn clown in the beginning. No, they run the gamut fart jokes, Cum jokes, incest, racism, dressing up as KKK ... This film is flat out there for those who have ever played D & D. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, It looks real D & D will not allow them to use their game. Who would want their name attached to it?
