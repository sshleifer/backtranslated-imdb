This film should be "carefree" the story of Santa Claus and his "magical and mystical" miracles. Instead, he comes off as completely horrible. Two things in this film that stand out in my mind as a monstrous 1) the path of Santa looks.- Have you ever seen a more horrible looking Santa Claus? and 2) the "evil Rep. Satan is "just the odd dance Pitch is just sickening to watch. Just watch this movie if this happens MSTed version or if you want a really good laugh. I can not believe that this is a children's film.
