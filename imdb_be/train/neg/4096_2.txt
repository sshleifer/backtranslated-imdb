It was a classic case of something that should never have been. Gloria was now a mother, her husband left her, because she will not live in some kind of commune with him (he was crazy, that Reagan was elected and would turn away from the society). It was then and there I had a problem with the series - come on, I say to myself, this is the same noble Michael Stivic that oppose the right winged philosophies Archie BUNKERa? The series went on, but it just was not Pizazz. Regardless of the pulse Sally Struthers received it was long gone by the whole family. Maybe, if the series was given another name and is presented as completely independent of everyone in the family, it might have worked. And also, it's show business.
