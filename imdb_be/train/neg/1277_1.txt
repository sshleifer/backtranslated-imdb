This film is still chills me to the bone of his thinking. This film is not just bad, as in the low-budget, poorly acted, and so, although it is, of course, all of these things. The problem with this film, that he seemed to be trying to intentionally irritate the viewer, and does so with great success. What I want to know how it is to be a horror movie? I mean, it's definitely a terrible, but not like horror movies should be. I could see, the first segment is trying to be horrified and failures, but what the hell, the second segment? It's just annoying. The third segment is how to look pretentious student film, which oddly enough makes it less painful segment. This is an atrocity that this film is not the way low on the bottom 100, so get your votes (1/10) in people !! I know that some people have given it good reviews, but, well, they are in a sadistic attempt to deceive you. Believe me, it is impossible to like this movie. The only benefit of this film is the amazing life extension effect: it feels like you are watching this film for many years after, as soon as the first half-hour had passed.
