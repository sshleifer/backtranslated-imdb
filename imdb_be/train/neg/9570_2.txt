For the first time in many years, I felt the need to enter the IMDb today, to clear himself from the film, writing a review, because it was just such a let-down look. The plot sounds strange when I read it, I was expecting the minimum mystery thriller, claustrophobic phantom hunting. Unfortunately, it gets diluted as bad from the secular, tedious love story and too much far-fetched and silly teeth gnashingly "no-one to say something like-it-in-the-bad-moviesÂ» -dialogs, that is. just painful <br /> <br /> Here's a quick of the worst crimes in this part of the movie: <br /> <br /> - the script relies so much on coincidences and inexplicable and unpardonable stupidity the main characters, it's just ridiculous. No, actually, it's anger. . And the lazy <br /> <br /> - referring to this cheap thrill. Long parade of "just in time" moments <br /> <br /> -. The main characters. Well, it seems that the writer has never experienced real people in real life, but instead acquired all their knowledge from bad movies. Thus, his characters are boring, lifeless cliches of the second generation. They are just a plot device, locum tenens without any person. They are "a man and a woman in breaking that still love each other." Never seen that one before, with the exception of 100,000 movies and it does not get more realistic and enjoyable. Think of a soft two-dimensional Hollywood fare, and you got it. There is not a single character in this film that even remotely fresh, charming, interesting <br /> <br /> -. Flimsy, vague solution that is rocking really bad and needs only one impulse to overthrow, although the word "resolution" may be poorly fitted here, because the film is a swampy mess that will not be all the same anywhere. By that time, when you till the end, though, you no longer care. The last third of the film, I just fast forwarded, because it was so unbearable to watch. <br /> <br /> Well, that's all. Regardless of redemptive features of this film has it all gets buried under incompetence. Do not look at this piece of shit.
