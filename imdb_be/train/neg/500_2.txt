Bloodsucker leading dance - what a ridiculous name, it is fully incorporated into error. It is not surprising that filmmakers try and mislead us, though, because it's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The story mainly includes a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island. <br /> <br /> Very little happens in this film. And if something does awaken the viewer against tetanus, it has consistently been unintentional comedy in the form of a monstrous dialogue group made hopeless CHAT artists. These guys are so bad that they do an actor, they provide a voice to appear as a group of morons procedural level. It's really hard to determine how bad the steps if you overwrite this miserable. But the voice of artists can not be accused of the script. This is a travesty. Involuntarily funny at best, and at worst pathetic. History as a whole, at least, uneven. Symbols Women especially idiocy; male or horrible, or tedious. <br /> <br /> On the whole enterprise smacks of pure audience granted. He does not remotely do what it promises, and even when the murder (finally) starting to happen, they all come from the screen. We all get a few hesitant cut off head shots. <br /> <br /> Some people have said that this film is a Giallo. I can not agree less with this opinion. Anyone who loves Italian thrillers should give this film the rounds, because there is nothing remotely worry about it. It is basically a soft core porn with terror angle. But this is not something very erotic. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this to anyone.
