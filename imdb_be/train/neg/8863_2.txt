Rising screech II (1985) was a complete 180 from the first film. While the first film was campy and awful. The second was launched and cheese. production values ​​for this pretty bad, and the game is disgusting actors. Brother Anchorwoman werewolf from the first part wants to find out what happened to his Lisa. "Scene" from the first film was heavily restored. Thin plain beautiful woman accompanies bro "(Reb Brown) in the old country (Romania), to uncover the mystery of her sister's murder / Transformation / death. Christopher Lee appears and disappears behind it, and as a kind of sage / guide to two. Sybil Danning and her two biggest assets look like Stirba, Chief Werewolf in Romania. She also suffers from a bad case of morning person, Ewww! <br /> <br /> bad movie. There's nothing good about this bitch. I surprise Philippe Mora sent this picture, because it is usually a good director. The film is so dark that you need a flashlight to see it (no, not the content, but the films). To round out the film from you to get a lousy "punk" performance from the damned copycats "Babel". Maybe if they split up a couple of extra bucks they could have the real deal, not an imitation. <br /> <br /> It's best to avoid if you are not desperate or you lose control and you are too lazy to change the channel.
