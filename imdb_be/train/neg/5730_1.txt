Where to even begin? Hardcore action? Nonsensical story? The discount effects? Absolutely disgusting characters? Choppy editing? Headache induced Casio keyboard score ??? The strikingly racist utterances ( "Look out, Charlie!" "Dumps, Jackie Chan !!" ??? I ??? Standing misogyny lifelong supporter of horror, and I have no problems with the current "torture -thonÂ» movie trend. It Still, it's badly made piece of junk. I think I suffered more pain, watching it than even the characters dying in it! If you like a girl forced to eat fried penis really poor soft core porn and think lines like "I'm going to find them to **** and staple it shut !! c ***" smart living food for you. <br /> <br /> As for me I feel the need to go wash my eyes with oven cleaner to prevent seeing this film again!
