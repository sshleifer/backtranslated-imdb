This is a direct continuation of the "Mummy Hands" (1940), as the protagonist, Stephen Banning (played by Dick Foran) is now thirty years older and connects the story (via archival footage) to groom his son, there are only two unusual aspects of the film :. Benning's early death and the presence of Turhan Bey <br /> <br /> Lon Chaney as a mummy Harris gets top billing, though, given the nature of his role, he has a little more to do than to limp along or trash hands. There is nothing to worry about his presence, except for its attempt to carry the groom, Isobel (Elyse Knox). Dick Foran receives second billing, but he was killed during the first fifteen minutes! We will have to wait until the "Psycho" (1960), when the main character (Janet Leigh) die the way through the movie! Buddy ban from the first film, Babe Jenson (currently Henson), a little later, looking much, much older and not do any of the comics he made the chip in the original. Hard to believe that this is the same actor! Unfortunately, this great actor's work is wasted because it gets killed Harris after only two short scenes. He then left to Banning's son John (played a bit player John Hubbard), led to the chase in the graveyard - NO! Sheriff is a torch With the crowd Bunning home to burn it and kill the mummy. Universal Sound familiar? <br /> <br /> Turhan Bey entered the audience as the new Pontiff, Mehmet Bey, to take care and feed the tan leaves Harris. With its "exotic" voice and appearance, it is very bad, it gets so easy to kill. Better film would have «Babe» von Helsing type take charge of things in tracking the mummy, with a final decisive battle with him and Mehmet Bey. Instead, we walking rehash of the various parts of the set of the previous Ecumenical horror films, put together hack Griffin Jay, who has written many other clunkers Universal's, although he also made "Don Winslow fleet" (1942) and "Don Winslow Coast Guard" (1943), who also showed Elise Knox. <br /> <br /> Elyse Knox played Anne Howe Joe Palooka six films (1946-1949), and, of course, Turhan Bey, with 43 film and TV credits are great starring «The Amazing Dr . X »(1948). <br /> <br /> cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric (with lots of noirish shadows in the sheriff's office) than the first Mummy movie "Harris," but there is little else of interest or excitement. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 3.
