I can not believe that they were able to spend $ 17million US dollars on this film. Spectacularly bad acting, outrageous scenarios and effects that you could do on your average PC, unbelievable plot tricks ... a reporter who can get inexperienced flight attendant's main work at the UN? What? Not only that, but this film is so unsubtle message that you left feeling as though they were trying to knock you on the head of a full-size crucifix. All of this film will do is preach the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money. If the makers of this film really wanted to shake the Christian people, and to show what it means to really believe they would use the money to help people who really need. Now, / that / might sway some people are actually listening to them.
