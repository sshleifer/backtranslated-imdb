Firstly, I have to admit that it's not a very good film. And I would never watch this movie when Pacino was not in it. <br /> <br /> The film is about a journalist strange 24 hours.And overloaded, dizzy, sick and sometimes regretful.I no longer as a sign all.It really sad, I do not understand in 20 minutes you can drop asleep.And, why Pacino wanted to be a part of this terrible movie.Just about money or what? <br /> <br /> Since I'm a fan of Pacino, I bought this 2002 movie people I Know.If you have not bought yet, do not even think about it, it's just a waste of time.
