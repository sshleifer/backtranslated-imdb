I do not want to sound like "old man", but to be honest, I have not seen too many movies that I like, that have been made since 1960 ... well, the movie just seems worse (though I totally got enjoy Scott Baio vehicle "Bread, My Sweet», for the "good form" sex scenes that do not add value in this film, except). This film makes a mother, a former Las Vegas chorus girl does not seem to be able to survive on their own, although it is clearly in her 50s (though the hint, being in her 40s). I did not buy it. I'm 57 and, like all the women I know have the 50s and 40s, more than able to survive alone (as I have done since I graduated from high school at age 13, she was legally emancipated and went on my own life journey.) <br /> <br /> daughter is not believable in her role working ... she gets a promotion, she does not deserve (great feature) and drops the ball too, but if another worker steps up to the plate and is ready to put the writers to take it down as "opportunist", when she was just doing what any prafaryenta Mr. person would do - taking advantage of the wide-open opportunity created by a lack of self-discipline of her colleagues, she apparently does not understand the concept of honoring its promises (to his boss, in this case). <br /> <br /> daughter reluctant to "allows" her mother to stay with her, on a temporary basis, and then treats her mother (a woman who gave her life, and raised it up to "adult life"), as an outcast. Apparently, the "scar writers as it does not realize that this is not a" common cause "for parents to act like children, and then treat as a child of their children. These are just some of the society" futility "that Hollywood continues to try to beat Russia's throat, as if we, their audience, were stupid for wanting to entertain their creative proposals. <br /> <br /> it's sad film with a blunt end. When the young male restaurateur was real and not a two-dimensional "character of the TV," he I would have stayed with her mother, who was not much older than him and very attractive . But in the end he falls "for his daughter, shallow and uninteresting girl who has that wit young people, but in the usual, soft way. (The« opportunistic "young woman who worked with this personal girl was much more attractive physically) . <br /> <br /> There was no plausible reason has introduced the audience why the restaurateur benefits daughters (who was alarmed, selfish, self-centered b * snip, who treated her mother with an incredible lack of respect) to the mother - a woman who was mellowness , gentle nature, sense of humor, and had zhytstserada Nost daughter could not even understand. Of course, the mother had its shortcomings ... it reacted to the death of her husband to drink himself into a stupor for a year or two after that, allegedly created a gap between her and her daughter insinuating. <br /> <br /> no matter how the characters have or have not been developed, it's stupid and a waste of precious movie viewing time, if you really do not like stupidity. (Where's the mustard?)
