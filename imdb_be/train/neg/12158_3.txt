.... may seem far-fetched .... but there really was a story of real life .. a man who had an affair with a woman who knew where he and his wife stopped ,, and she killed his wife ,, which makes it look like a rape, murder ....... <br /> <br /> in his error, she told everyone that a man asked her to marry him .. so she quit her job in Wisconsin ... and moved to Minnesota .......... <br /> <br /> at last I heard, she was in a mental hospital, prison security .... <br /> <br /> she was still wearing engagement ring "" it Abylai for themselves ... and told everyone that he had bought it for her. <br /> <br /> The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin ,,,,,,, and murder occurred in Minnesota ...... <br /> <br /> There was even an essay in the "People magazine "... in the spring of 1988, I want to say, on page 39, I remember it, I was in college at the time ,, and my colleagues met a man in the hospital security ....
