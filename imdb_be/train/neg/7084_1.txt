Like many others have stated, this is a terrible film of all aspects of film production. How they ever got some well-known actors name to take on this project strange. <br /> <br /> A lot of people complained that it was shot on the "cheap" camcorders. Yes, it was shot on video, but not "cheap" video. What did it was bad lighting, white balance, shooting and editing techniques. <br /> <br /> There were so many different methods of shooting and editing that are used, that is the production of a mess. Harsh, inconsistent coverage, compared with the manual shooting (ala Woody Allen), choppy editing (Allen other equipment), but poorly done, with no real purpose. <br /> <br /> The lack of white balance in the kitchen of the restaurant scene is inconvenient; very amateurish. <br /> <br /> simulated sex scenes had no meaning, operating at any level. <br /> <br /> As this video ever made it to print for me. It is worth watching if only wonder how bad it is.
