The soul of an ancient mummy is passed to one of his followers, so that he could punish all those involved in the desecration of his tomb. The extension of the soul makes young people age in a huge pace, until he looks like a mummy. One after another, the blood drain from those involved in the excavations. <br /> <br /> In order to be as short as possible, Curse of the Pharaoh rather dull affair. While the film does represent some good, original ideas (blood-sucking mummy, soul transference, interesting makeup effects, hand copying scenes, etc.) and some atmospheric moments, the direction and speed is the very definition of perseverance. To make matters worse, the first 15 are relatively short 66-minute performance of the film consist of nothing more than filling. I used to slow the mummies of these movies, but Pharaoh's Curse tests even has a patient. The cast helps very little. With one exception (Tsiva Rodan is a lone bright spot ?? wants the film could have switched to her mysterious character), cast as a sad, like a script. Finally, I do not know whose idea it was to put the mummy that looks servant that appears to be pajamas, but this is ridiculous, funny look at the creature, which is supposed to strike fear in the audience. <br /> <br /> Despite my generally negative comments about the curse of Pharaoh, I will vote for it 4/10. Not good rating, to be sure, but a generous view of all the problems I had with the film.
