Revolution scary movie, I do not care if you're a history teacher, writer, news, Al Pacino fan, there's no way this movie could possibly earn a legitimate "10". <br /> <br /> The key plot point Tom Dobby (Al) is trying to get money from a note he received for radical patriots, taking his boat. Everything revolves around the note. Son Tom joined the army in order to replenish the note that makes Tom to join the army, and they go on an adventure, trying to get out of the army, a few years after the war ended, and they can finally turn in a note to their boat, The End. <br /> <br /> It was a few battle scenes, and they were mediocre at best. Transistions scene used "five months" and magically put the characters in a famous historical battle. The love story of a joke, and the film as a whole is simply difficult to follow. So to maintain its "Note" and watch the Patriot instead.
