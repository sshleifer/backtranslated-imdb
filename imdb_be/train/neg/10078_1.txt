Boy-girl love / sequel to the songs, but this time it is and he punkette straight arrow. Film-lovers out there actually like this movie? He has a crush on? I have to say that the mind Coils ... "Grease 2" is really lame, the company, which does not even have the courage, or Moxy apparent audacity to take the memory of his predecessor in the fire (for example, "Jaws 2" or Â«Exorcist II"). No, she whines forward in slow and often just playing dead. It looks and feels cheap, with a large cast of lost among random direction and focus of treatment. It was the first time a significant audience got a glimpse of Michelle Pfeiffer and although it does not confuse itself, this role should be forgotten. Misfire at the lowest levels. star is not from ****
