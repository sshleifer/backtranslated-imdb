This is the least scary movie I've ever seen. How to manage to eat blob who is the biggest mystery of the film. Drop moves so slowly that o.a.p in zimmerframe could be avoided. Blob is a big piece of the success met a woman typical horror movie that instead of running away is worth another half an hour, so that it can be eaten. If you havent seen this movie I recommend you do, it's too ridiculous to take seriously.
