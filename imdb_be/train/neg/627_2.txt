Oh, dear lord. This film ... It was terrible. I'm a big fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies, and other people say that it's bad, I like it. The actor, who played "The Scarecrow" was amazing, I would say that. But this story was terrible. It does not make sense! It was too much gore, and is not necessary (and disgusting) sex scene in the beginning. I think that the director is trying to be "shocking" or whatnot, but it just came out terrible. To add to the heap of shit festering they called the story, the actors (besides "stuffed"), we are awful, and I cared so little about them, I quickly forgot who was who. In conclusion, this movie made me feel sick. If you can not watch this film in any way, please.
