The sun does not shine, it was too wet to play, so I went to the movies that cold, cold, wet day date. <br /> <br /> Â«Cat in the Hat" has been clicked, the name and when it was over, my stomach was sick. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers played the cat, his humor was lame, and children should not see this, humor is not a manual. <br /> <br /> the film was how to drink milk from mad cow, so it's fun to have fun, but the filmmakers did not know how to do it. <br /> <br /> this film in general, it is atrocious. The acting was bad, the plot has been altered too much, and humor was surprisingly very raw. <br /> <br /> It starts with Conrad and Sally, the rules you lyuchalnikam and future sheriff. If their mother has to go to work, she gets Mrs. Kwan nurse. Perhaps the lone funny in the movie, when Ms. Kwan watching Taiwanese courtroom, and `from C-SPAN. Soon she fell asleep, and here comes cat. <br /> <br /> The film begins to spin out of control. cat come to try to allow children to have fun. He's got a Thing 1 and Thing 2, who suddenly start to destroy the house. He improvises a TV infomercial, and accidentally cuts his tail off. And if the cat is full of Carmen Miranda, this is not funny. Perhaps its just ridiculous disguise as a hippie activist. And there is a fish that tries to warn children about cats. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that he did not warn us that the film was so much fun as sour milk, or to cut the tail off. <br /> <br /> Soon, the children outside the family is looking for a dog that has the key to the sheathing on the collar. If the crate is blocked entirely in the near future, their house will be a house cat to the universe. Here it gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the film. <br /> <br /> action as a whole, it's terrible. Mike Myers brings his brand of irreverent humor Cat Austin Powers, saying something like "You dirty ho" and presenting herself as a woman for a lifetime after a strong blow in the testes, and posing as a Pinata. Spencer Breslin as big as making trouble Conrad and Dakota Fanning cute as Sally, but alone they are not enough to save this terrible aortic dissection is waiting to kill John Ritter (accident waiting to happen). Spot and Slimey Lawrence Quinn Alec Baldwin disgusting when trying to persuade fellow mom who plays Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes Mr Humberfloob, mom boss, as well as the voice of the fish. The last three are also bland. <br /> <br /> In general, if I were a parent, I would not take their children to the potty humor, cause there is a lot of it and more. Save $ 7.00 and see something else. As the late great Dr. Seuss once said, <br /> <br /> It's fun to have fun, but you have to know how. Indeed, the versatile, stop! Fedor already in a coffin. <br /> <br /> As my mom always says, "Curiosity killed the cat," Cat in the Hat .- * to *****
