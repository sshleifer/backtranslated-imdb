The history and the show was good, but it was really hard and I hate depressed movies. Ri'chard big. He really put on the best performance of the recess, and a girl, who played his sister was really strange and gorgeous. Seriously, I thought that it was Carmen Electra, until I saw the section IMDb. I can not say anything bad about Peter Galleghar say. He's one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm currently reading The Vampire Chronicles, but I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book. It's a little too "real" for me. I prefer to Lestat and Louis witty little misunderstanding with the struggle of slaves. Eartha Kitt was so horrible and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me; I could barely stand to watch the show. (Sorry for the ambiguity, but I do not want to give anything away) Sorry, but it's just not my type of show.
