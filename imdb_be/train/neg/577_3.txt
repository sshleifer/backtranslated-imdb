First of all, Jon Bon Jovi, do not seem to be in place in a vampire movie. Along with other less interesting characters and a poor storyline entire film becomes predictable. If we keep in mind, and you complete the vampire movie fan, you can have some fun with a few scenes. Do not expect any sections Tarantino style here and no story of Anne Rice. (I'm waiting to forget the whole movie for tomorrow;)
