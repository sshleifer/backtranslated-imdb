Maria Bello, do not seem to care what people think about her choice of roles in the movie. Again she chooses a very complex and does not act in the popular film. Maybe she needs to these films to come out of the coated sugar (so-called 'Hollywood') those that it does here, then (Coyote Ugly course mummy and 3). <, Br /> <br /> while I think it is not able to achieve what he intends to do (I will not spoil it), Maria Bello as great as in his other independent / small film she plays in. it is a work that raises this movie. This combined with a surprising subject almost did the trick for me. But in the end (and even if I try to ignore some drawbacks such as poor pacing and drama), the film is still too long
