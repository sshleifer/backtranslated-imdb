This film was just down right bad. I love movies about the war, and I can usually come from the majority of movies and find something that I liked, but this is not one of them. The film lacked substance and intensity.OK I get it, the Finns put up one hell of a fight and then a large, but the story is poorly told. You have no real connection with any of the characters, and there is no real storyline to follow. You just go from one random episode to another, nothing flows to form a story that is trying to be conveyed. If you want a piece of film that will keep you focused, and oddly enough without fighting scenes, I would suggest «Downfall» (German WWII movie). Or, if you prefer a large plot and a lot of action, I would suggest the "Brotherhood of the war" (the Korean War / Korean film). These two films will not fail to be in the Winter War.
