Avoid this one if you do not want to look expensive, but poorly made film. Example? Sounds good, but the dialogue is not clear. - a cardinal sin in the French film <br /> <br /> This film attempts to combine Western, drugs and intrigue of ancient costume epic mode. What? Well, consider this. Cowboy Music oars during ball fights. Or how about a woman in her underwear, holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed? <br /> <br /> Someone should make a "What is Tiger Lily" on the bomb. Rewrite the script, and then either duplicated or subtitle it. Hell, it's almost that now. (Incidentally, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, as is well known to American audiences, play a role.)
