I see that someone has already thought about this analogy, which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after I watched this movie. They said that the ingredients were there, but there was no plot. In addition to the sexual scenes that bordered on child pornography (which I feel could be cut or have been presented more important in nature, rather than graphically, I would liken this movie on a recipe that has been broken in half. It's kind of like being handed a list of ingredients, without specifying how to combine them into a finished product. from the very beginning, the development of character and plot development is not enough ... unfortunately, many times in this monotonous nonsense we teased a bit of the plot, and we think, "Ahh-OK ... in the end all we're going to learn something about why This scene takes place ... or ... the character that ... or maybe we will finally know and appreciate this character more ... or understand and participate more with the relationship between the characters and ... etc. "but not here! on the contrary, many times I was tempted to just turn it off more than once, but if stuck the carrot was dangled, only to find that no mini-plot within the same hatever mini-story (and that are poorly represented), it was just a ploy. Why I stayed with him until the end remains a mystery but as a rule, IFC better choices, and they gave it 2-1 / 2 stars (another mystery). This is not something that the characters do not like a certain extent, or that you can not identify with them or humanity in general ... it's just that it could be much better with just a little more effort. I noticed it was shot around Santa Cruz and wonder if it was someone else's film school project. I would like to give it a better review, but honestly it was a disappointment and the frustration of spending half an hour.
