Resnais, wow! The genius who brought us the Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the task of creating a 1930s French musical in bright colors. Opening narration with old, decorated with netting called was a nice touch. Then opens a hole camera (like the old manual crankers) on a black and white poster. The camera pulls back (or, rather, up), suddenly showing us amazing bright colors elegant table set for tea. This is all within the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the music starts. Quite banal and forgettable Diddy featuring 3 girls choir unconvincing blabbering some nonsense that has nothing to do with the film (and yes, I speak French, so I can not blame it on the subtitles). These characters whistling from the door and replaced by a large number of people who break into even more forgettable songs. Then they leave, and finally, is Audrey Tautou, and we hear our first notable dialogue 15 minutes into the film. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that Resnais order starting with the gaping waste of time and musical cacophony. But the effect on the viewer that you want to throw the pins on the screen and storm out. I endured. <br /> <br /> It does not get much better. I'll tell you why. There is absolutely no acquaintance with any of the characters. We do not even see their faces in half the time (as Resnais seems too absorbed boasting expensive decorations to care about real people in front of the camera). People & flutter on the stage, like moths around a lamp, and we the audience is not able to focus on any particular person or area. It's as if you were to take each episode with a Brady Bunch and push it to the 2:00 movie. With bad songs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me playing until I (1 hour), I was looking at camera techniques, lighting and scenery that were all, I admit, I am great. But enough to keep your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe tomorrow I'll try to look through. Oh, who am I kidding. I have more important things to do. I'm sure you do, too. Skip it.
