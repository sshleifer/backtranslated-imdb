Wow ... I can not believe how bad ZOMBIE DOOM (aka February SH! T 3) in fact. I've heard rumors, read reviews - but I had to make up your mind for yourself. Well, let me tell you - blows !!! The worst action of any film ever made, dubbing, what should be done while the participants were completely wasted, inept and ridiculous gore the FX, no different story, "cinema", that looks like my grandmother took him to her cameras, props weapons that no joke - made of tin foil - the list goes on and on ... <br /> <br /> Three Man stranded on the island, where a bunch of weirdos running around with plastic and foil balls. Two of the prisoners are released together with the rebel island of freaks, and give one day head start before they hunted down the rest of "tribe" ... that's pretty much it ... <br /> <br /> To be honest - this is one of the worst movies that I have ever had the misfortune to expose themselves too. The budget would be about $ 200, and was spent entirely on the gore FX (which actually may not be a bad idea ...). There's nothing zombie DOOM, except tight party funny looking baked blood scenes with a lot of horrible dubbed dialogue. This film does not budget-other outings as PREMUTOS: Lord of the Living Dead look TITANIC. Some of them may rank ZD in the "so bad it is-good" category - and I think that if you're really drunk or high and watch it with a few friends MST3K style - I believe that it could be seen that way. But I did not. I hated almost everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM or zombies 90 (which equally terrible and incorporated as a "bonus" to release Shock-O-Rama with ZD) is indicative of other works Andreas Schnaas - it should be excluded from ever anything to do with the creation of film ever again for fear of death. There is one interesting kung fu fighting in the second half of the film, and a lot of blood - so I will do it to one very generous 3/10 - do yourself a favor and skip it.
