Why do I spend my money on it in the last day of Sundance? I want to return the money ... Can I have $ 16 back? While I was watching this film, I kept waiting for something to happen, nothing happened. The only way that I did not even know that he was supposed to be just that, after reading the story, which was not really like a movie. why director brings them hand the camera, and then decrease? It was not very artistic. Why does the director show Lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes? Why, when the actors were trying to say they sound like they are reading? Or is that the point? I felt that the Phantom Love had no history at all, and to be honest, I felt like my friends vacation video was much more important than entertaining this film.
