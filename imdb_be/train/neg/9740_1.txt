Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnnnn! :. = 8O <br /> <br /> ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... <= 8 <br /> <br /> Oh, um, sorry, sorry, fell asleep there on mooment. Now, where was I? Ah, yes, "predicted man," yes ... ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... <= 8 <, br /> <br /> Whoops, sorry. Thus, the "predictable man." Well, this is a British science fiction yawnfest about anything. Some orange-headed man projects himself on lasers, gets a touch of death. Then he disappears, the end. In fact, the film is not so interesting. Dull, noisy, starchy, stiff, and back-breakingly sad, "predicted people" 77 solid minutes of nothing, starring one. Dull as dishwater. Dumb as doorknob dust. Dull as Ethan Hawke - we're talking really boring here, people! But expect about our stupid cousins ​​from across the puddle, then MooCow now make the right review for «The projected Man»: <br /> <br /> ZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ............ .. < = 8.
