Pretty ordinary stuff Italo-Western, a silly plot full of clichés and lack of logic, some actors are mediocre, dirty setting, a lot of fighting and punching people shot on a massive scale. <br /> <br /> This has nothing to do with Django. - At least, not in my German translated version, the German DVD-release called «Adios Companeros" and has Macho Callahan fights against Butch Cassidy and Ironhead, because their gang killed him one (he is the only survivor). Then you have Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fight each other because they had a falling out and split the gang. And you have Ironhead fight against all, because it is simply the biggest and the most greedy asshole anyway. Yes, it is, no more ingenuity in the story line, hehe. <br /> <br /> small role Klaus Kinski as the Reverend Cotton excellent (which is why I bought this DVD). In one scene, he tries to separate the two men fighting, hitting them and shout, "I said, love" and in another place he won a competition in throwing horseshoes and going crazy on the second -! FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC !!! <br /> <br / > it is also noteworthy that DAmato JOE aka Aristide Massachchezi made cinematography - I love this master incompetent operation of thrash, so it was «Aahhh» for me.
