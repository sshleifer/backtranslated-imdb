the sad stuff that we got here. Its 5-minute shorts are better than this. Do you know why? because there are only 5 minutes instead of 91 minutes or as long it never. <br /> <br /> The plot is kind of ... eh .. the last half hour to order the rest of the sad and funny = (I had hope, trailer made it look ridiculous, but the pace of this film is very slow and, unfortunately, not funny. just bored klaymen running into each other and trying to make us laugh .. does not work. <br /> <br /> Maybe the next time Knox. <br /> <br /> Maybe, re-cutting this film and to add the best scene will do a lot of healing, but now it's just not good.
