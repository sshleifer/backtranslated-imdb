I usually do not comment, but there are things that must be said. Where to start ... <br /> <br /> The current on the part of Jeremy London was awful! I do not think he can be so bad. The plot could be good if it was well directed, along with a good solid performance by a lead actor. Unfortunately, this is one of those movies that you have read and think it has great potential to be interesting, but disappointing from the start. <br /> <br /> Well, at least I got a good laugh. I would not waste my time, when I will.
