If you like syfi soap opera is a show for you as fare as I'm concerned, that does not work for me, and after watching the episode 3, I just can not watch anymore. It is a sad and slow and to show that the schedule is based around 100,000+ years ago, when you base it on Battlestar Galactica scale for coming on the earth, they sure seem to have all the things around 100,000 in the summer Chevite driving vans down streets and 100,000 people watch summer popular branded LCD TVs. In addition, there is the same with the rest of the set, and on the show, there is only a large part of today's material, which is involved in this to keep in mind, I think they could do a lot better without a job to get around these issues and yes Battlestar Galactica had some of the same problems, but not as bad. As the rate in the rest of the show is not as good as BSG was poor and before proceeding to it. ??
