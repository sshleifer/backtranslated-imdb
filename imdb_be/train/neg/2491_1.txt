Maiden Voyage just. I would like to say straight away that I was looking at it 5mins before I just could not stand it anymore. As mentioned in another comment, this film does not get the whole "so bad it's good" thing, it's just bad. Actions awful, the SFX is poor, and the story is fresh and silly. Even the extras suck in "bag man guards" and such appear to bear arms as water pistols. <br /> <br /> do not even bother to watch this film, the only thing that's special about it is that, no matter how low your expectations, you will still be disappointed.
