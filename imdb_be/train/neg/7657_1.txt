There should be a rule that states quite clearly that such films as Resident Evil must be made in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of undermining the best. RE was survival horror game, and damn effective at the same time, however, Paul WS Anderson has managed to do it, just like any other video game movies to come. Alone in the dark, in fact, the same spirit as Resident Evil, so of course, there is little hope the director would be able to have some part of the brain is enough to make a horror film, not the gunman. Instead, Alone in the Dark only proves that no longer rely on video games become movies. <br /> <br /> The story, despite the fact that it is obviously not intended, it is important, is the largest of the many problems with the film. The film begins with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text, which may or may not be important, since a minute passes, the audience stops caring and just sitting through the rest of hitting an object closer to them. Then there's something about the orphanage, some artifacts, ancient tribe, some of the bureaucracy and some demons, all of which are so intermingled that the audience really can not follow what is happening. Symbols and out of the scene, as sweets, having a vast frost and needless deaths. In general, I can understand that some demons got released, and Edward Carnby (Slater) has some connection with them through an operation of the children in his orphanage, which could not be him. He finds an artifact involving demons and it leads to the ex-girlfriend of the anthropologist (Reid), who, of course, he manages to have sex with right reason. Then, out of nowhere, all hell, and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander (Dorff), who, apparently, has a mutual hatred for Carnby. <br /> <br /> It's funny, so I do not really understand that this is not only because it is difficult and complicated, but it does not leave room for any genuinely care. Instead, I highly recommend it if you have to see this film, to bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion. <br /> <br /> The action scenes in the movie with a plot as bad as it should, at least to bring it up a bit, is not it? It is a pity that this film, like any other ruined shit ever made, with a fairly rapid reduction to decapitate a chicken coop chickens. Given that it is based on a horror game, not an action game, it is particularly annoying. <br /> <br /> The first action scene involving a person chasing Cranby of the taxi is one of the worst I have ever witnessed, and the rest is not so great either. Demons look a bit cool, but the fact that they turn into powder, was killed takes all that effect. Scenes with a lot of guns, which should be well observed, but not to include the muzzle fire as the sole source of light, and zoom and pan the camera faster than the head of a crack addict. It's all kind of a seizure inducing crap that keeps the child in bed at night. <br /> <br /> Acting is what I like to call to make an actor and making them do anything. Slater does not do anything, but the sound is important for the film, although he seems to have more talent than he is letting on. The same applies to Dorff, who gets the thankless role, although actually having some talent (something that happened a lot with him). Reid pretty much exactly what it should be, the background of sex appeal, and every time she tries to act is a disaster (as it is incredibly bad opinion of the scientist it is at the very beginning). <br /> <br /> In general, this type of film that I'm worried about the future of video games movies. If they continue to destroy the spirit, as it is only a matter of time before Samus Aran Middle-Easterns kills with the AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti fighting squadron foreigners. Unlike Resident Evil, however, this man does not deserve a second chance, so I do not think it would help me forget how terrible this film. This soft, uninteresting and uninteresting. This is a film equivalent of diarrhea; all thrown together, nothing really does not fit, and, in the end, you're just glad it's over <br /> <br /> TOTAL :. 4%
