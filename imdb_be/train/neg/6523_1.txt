Please take a moment to read my entire review. I'm not knocking the movie itself -. DVD only options currently available <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> I really wanted to give this film even two stars. I mean, how could it possible to rank only 1 of 10 <br /> <br /> Here's how!?! Epic film adaptation of Tolstoy's novel "War and Peace" with historically accurate battle scenes, caresses of the Red Army and very loyal, scene for scene adaptation of the novel would be difficult, but it's worth sitting through seven. - if this is what you see <br /> <br /> The problem is you can not see the movie. - anywhere, as far as I know, <br /> <br /> I'm trying to see Ruscico DVD version - widely considered to be the best version available, as this letter boxed and restores scenes that were cut from the other DVD releases. <br /> <br /> But it's one of the scariest film prints I have ever seen transferred to DVD. The picture is cloudy and inconsistent, often gating. It's almost bearable, if you scroll through the brightness, color and pattern to the maximum levels .... but the problem does not end there. <br /> <br /> The sound is also a way inconsistent, blaringly loud in parts, almost unpretentious in others. <br /> <br /> As for the language, it is a huge problem for the English - dubbed version has a few good actors and some really scary ones whose characteristics grille and part of the film just is not duplicated on all sliding into Russian and even the French accident. <br /> <br /> subtitled version is not much better. No subtitles are displayed below the image, but just above it - obscuring part of the beauty (or what's left of it) in the landscape. In addition, the subtitles are often a bad translation (a shame, given that the script took effort to cut as close to the actual words of Tolstoy), and subtitles too, seems to just fall apart. <br /> <br /> So, even if you are up to a maximum of color, brightness and picture settings and volume track and select the subtitle * and * English dubbed, you're still going to get a film that annoying to watch and listen. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's content to overcome this? It might be able to, but at seven o'clock - who can survive for so long <br /> <br /> Maybe someday, someone will come and restore it? - and maybe then I'll see masterpiece - but for now, I just can not give more than one star on something I was only able to stand watching the first 12%.
