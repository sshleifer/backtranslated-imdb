If you thought that the original 83 was bad, try this modern day masterpiece. How could it be worse the more you ask? Well ... at least in the first you had Eli Sheedy jogging in a sports bra. Besides updated graphics, modern theme (eg, terrorists), modern weapons and sexy new voice for Ripley, unfortunately, it's the same sad story tired. Anyone who has seen the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line in history going. And for those who have not seen the first ... well consider yourself lucky that you only saw him once. Maybe in another 23 years, Hollywood will try again.
