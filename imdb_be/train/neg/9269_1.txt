Well, because, seeing PÃ¤rt 1 through 3, I can honestly say that they have never made a part of the 4. All that sticky, and I mean sticky price really bad acting, I dare anyone to look at it and will not be bored with their minds. <br /> <br /> I mean, part 1 to 3 held strong vibe on Damion site, but without him around in this, it's just not the same. Of course, by the end of Part 3, I get a little tired of the continuation of the story line, but it was a good closure at the end of the third. Again, there was no reason for the body 4. Even if there are, they could do much better than this crap I had to sit through, Lola. There is an hour and a half of my life I will never see.
