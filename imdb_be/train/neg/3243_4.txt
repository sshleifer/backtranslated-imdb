The most important requirement for any film, following the confidence tricksters is that they must, at least from time to time, be able to pull one on us, and their dull-witted brands, the cops, the mob, and (ideally ) with each other, but this film NEVER pulls this game. Each scam you can see coming a mile away (especially to recover after childbirth!) No, they are very interesting, confusing or complex. Perhaps, Mammet hoped to make up for it with instant dialogue and complex psychological relationships. If so, he failed. Line in order, but they are delivered in such an unnatural, abnormal, stylized so that I thought that, perhaps, some clever point has been done on all operating constantly us ... but it was not. As for the psychological complexity, the protagonist is a bit repressed and makes some ridiculously forced Freudian slips of his father to think she a whore, but she gets over it. I really enjoyed the street scenes, though. I looked just like the picture of Edward Hopper.
