Who wrote it? A guy named John Cohen. I believe that this was the first script, it never worked. Someone should have told him that you have to write dialogue that sounds like something someone really could say. <br /> <br /> And who directed it? Scott Marshall? Son Jerry Marshall. My nut fell far from the tree. Someone, perhaps, he wanted to let him know that you can actually shoot the scene in a taxi in New York, and it will look real, and you do not have to pretend with blue screen for no reason. He may also have wanted him to know that he must stay away from Jessica Simpson, but we hope he learned his lesson now. <br /> <br /> And Jessica Simpson ... of course, she can not act. Hell, it does look like Jessica Alba Hepburn, and yet it plays a major role in this film. OH wait, he was promoted to her father. Well, that's why she got the role. It's really the only reason I can think of. <br /> <br /> So what should I be surprised that a bad thing? No. I should be surprised at how bad it is? I think it would be a lot of people, if they could see as much of it as I am. I mean are you waiting for the movie starring Jessica Simpson will be bad, but it's ... it is not just bad, it's the complete opposite of the classic film. Think about the great Woody Allen film, this film is as bad as the movie is good. This anti-Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I did not pay to see it, I stopped to watch for ten minutes in the cus I could not go any further. Without a doubt, I would have left the theater early. In fact, I wonder how many of the 6 people who have seen it in the theater actually stayed and watched it all. The film begins ridiculously bad, and then moves to a point to be so bad that it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture. And then, around when the first act comes to an end, you realize that it will only get worse, and that is if you need to either go away or kill myself. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film goes into the category of being so bad, it should be used instead of water landing in Guantanamo. Although some prefer water torture.
