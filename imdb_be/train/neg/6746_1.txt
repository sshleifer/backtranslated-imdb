* SPOILERS included * <br /> <br /> With a name like «Bleed», you know, the creative juices do not run on a high when the puppy was conceived. The film is your basic low-budget slasher film is mediocre. Yes, of course, he tries to be creative with the premise of "murder squad", but we know that it was just a joke anyway. Well, for those who really care about these things, the main story is that the new girl in town starts dating her colleagues. He invites her to his circle of friends, and at the party, they said to her, as they are "killing club" and they kill people, blah blah blah. Well, we know that it was all a joke, but not before our heroine kills woman in a garage. Now, "members" club murder killed one by one. Oh, and the bad guys win and the film ends on a downer. By that time, you will not really care though. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, the first 10 minutes or so of the film does not make sense. The motif of the murder at the beginning of the film is never explained. I would say that it was a way for the director to the site of the film, but on the DVD has deleted scenes! I do not know why anyone would want to see more than the full-length version with the «Bleed», but apparently, the people behind the DVD think audiences will demand more. On the box it says that there are Easter eggs, but why the hell do I want to spend my time searching for additional services on this film for me. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a bad movie, and «Bleed» comes on this front. It was not a fun bad movie, though. Everything looks good in the movies, and there is plenty of nudity, but the acting is awful. My least favorite guy character who ends up being a murderer ... I think it should be funny and fun, but it just ends up that goes as a tool. I think the funniest moment of the movie where our heroine kills woman in a garage, in a funny unconvincing death. The heroine shoved the woman into cement garage pole, and the woman looks like she just hit the thing, and it spits out a mouthful of blood, and "dies". <br /> <br /> For those who believe that the film is a complex solution, the creative process is done by professionals, check «Bleed». It will change your mind, and you will understand that any employee can arrive movie made. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not waste your time and money on it.
