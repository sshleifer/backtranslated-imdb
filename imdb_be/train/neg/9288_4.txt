Half Past Dead, starring Steven Seagal in the title role was the main B-hit. Half Past Dead 2 is simply a direct sequel to the video, the gunman is nothing to lose, but without the ability to win something. It is less interesting than the first: in all aspects. But worth a look though. If you like the fighters or just something to watch during a session of popcorn; if you like to watch as former WWE stars on the screen, or even if you like to watch the sequel, even if they are straight or not. <br /> <br /> Kurupt did a good job, Bill Goldberg was below average, I think he did for work. Kurupt good comedian, I say. The rest of the job done, but nothing amazing, nothing is far from good. <br /> <br /> technical details, well, that made Sony can not be large. Cinematography was a disaster, but the general direction is acceptable. Whatever, just watch, when you want. When you look, you will not lose anything. But if you do not ... well, you do not lose any.
