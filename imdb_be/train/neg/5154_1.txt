this is the only film that I ever went to. acting-- bad bad bad plot-- casting-- bad directing-- bad cinematography-- when they set to make a bad picture, they could not have done better. I hope they are proud of their turkey. I'm surprised that someone connected with this film was ever hired again in Hollywood. do not waste your time!
