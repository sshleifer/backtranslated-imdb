In 2005, George W. Bush began his second period as President of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a film called Into Blue appeared.The existence of this film is not as bad as the other things that happened this year, but the film itself was miserable, and perhaps worst of this year.Now, in 2009, the United States have another president, there is another dad, new Korean nuclear weapons ... and the film in blue 2: the Reef, which is better than the original ... but it's the same as saying: "getting your fingers cut better than get your head cut ".This sequel to a really bad movie that kept me extremely bored and uninterested.The cast in blue 2: The reef consists of a ktsorav TV series that are completely devoid of any credibility and weight dramatically, but are perfect for showing their bodies.Chris Carmack (The OC), David Anders (Heroes and nickname), Laura Vandervoort (of Smallville), Marsha Thomason (Lost ) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) brings the hollow and uninteresting. I loved some of the previous movies directed by Stephen Herek (Nibbler Bil l and Excellent Adventure Ted specifically), but in this film, he can not even create a minimum level of stress, emotions or entertainment.The characters of this film is not only poorly implemented, but they also repulsive.Honestly, I wanted all of them to die.The cinema this film, too lame, and it seems to have been done by the technical team, which makes commercials for Hawaiian hotels.Into the Blue 2: The Reef is a terrible movie , which is better than the original film, but it is the very ie, more than anything, as I have already said.Avoid this crappy movie at all costs.
