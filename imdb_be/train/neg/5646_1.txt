Utterly predictable silly show about a man who killed his wife mowing her down while driving and claimed that he passed out. Why is he still driving a car? Why is he still feels able to drive a car that killed his wife with a friend? This question did not take place the writer. History then Witters on about psychology and its faulty marriage, which is tied to the malfunction of marriage the wife murder-dimming driver. All-knowing mother and child dimensional thrown in for good measure, and all builds up to a predictable outcome and smashing finale. Or police psychologists so easily taken in? Deadful writing that the actors do their best with, but they are doomed to failure. This is on par with the Harlequin Romance. Do not waste your time watching this, if it is not what you are aiming for.
