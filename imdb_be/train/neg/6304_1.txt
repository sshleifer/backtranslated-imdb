As World War II naval history naked, and someone who is not proud of the history of this country, race relations, I can not wait to see this movie. What is disappointing piece of schlock. I made it about 3/4 of ways to the end, but I had to exclude it on the auxiliary stage attack. The idea that the submarine would shoot a torpedo in the PSB, as if there was a hope to hit it, and then be in the "run" state of the PSB during a dive, is absurd. And that's just a small detail. The entire film was poorly written, poorly directed and poorly acted. I agree with others on this board, it might be a good movie. It's as if they decided that since all these bad propaganda films were made in all-white casts, they are required to make one with black people. And as bad as these old films are, it's actually worse. And it almost smacks of false advertising headline Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. It turns out that they were very minor role. I have to believe that these two wonderful actors were embarrassed to be associated with this film. I did. I gave too much in my life that shit movie.
