Despite the stereotypes, virtually cast "no name" and obviously low budget, I thought that this movie was okay; much better than I expected it to be. I was skeptical at first - the idea of ​​a computer virus, which can also infect people, it seemed a bit ridiculous to me. But in the end, I thought that the film is well crafted concept (even if some of the scenes were a bit pattern). <br /> <br /> The roles were very good, and the two wires, it seemed, their role very seriously. I could not help but think, however, that Janine Turner little Geena Davis as a look-alike. Maybe it's just her face or makeup, hair and clothes, she was in the movie, but he continued to nag at the back of my mind all the time. <br /> <br /> While it's not a "must see" or a great film of any standard, «Fatal Error» is an entertaining film that will keep you not watch to the end.
