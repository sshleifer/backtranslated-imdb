US likely to work in the police in the UK, all of which operate around armed to the teeth, and did you know that members of the MUR change in the form, when they stop work and go to the pub! It should be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst way "real" British police that ever imposed on an unsuspecting public. I can see that Mr. Snipes may need money to pay its tax debt, but what the hell, a good actor Charles Dance makes this mystery. <br /> <br /> Even worse than the worse the low-budget "B" film 50s. One and a half hours of time a suicide and I will never go back. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like a real plague.
