I love British humor, I believe that this is one of the best in the world. Like almost every British sitcom (well ... maybe Sun Monthy Python, some of the jokes were great, but some of them I did not understand.) But this League of Gentlemen's just something good to make you sick. The show was good, in a sense; it helped me a little bit thin, because watching this piece of trash makes me feel that I was not hungry anymore. It's really disgusting, sick and not even funny TV show, and I wonder who is really laughing at this stuff. I watched it for about 10 minutes and turned it off. It was so disgusting, watching a man dressed in a woman with yellow teeth and urinating on the car ... I mean ... what's so funny about it ??? It makes me want to vomit. A lot of humor, but disturbing images and cheap toilet laughing ... I do not know ... if you like this stuff ... you go ahead ... to watch ... but honestly, people watching and enjoying it should be some emotional problems. Garbage.
