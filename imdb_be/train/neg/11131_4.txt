Firstly, I agree very little that escapes his mouth Mr. Chomsky. His prose shipping interesting counterpoint is that makes a person a hit on campus circus. He comes across a nice, modest, pragmatic. He is not satisfied with the current political style (unpleasant bi-partisanship) and it is aimed at the leftmost and rightmost, decrying how and for good reason. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film itself is hopeless. In fact, I would not even call it a documentary, but rather just a collection of speeches. Observation of "Rebel Without a Pause" is no different from watching on the dynamics 3am tape segment CSPAN. There's no camera movement, no change, Sun stylistic touches. There's no history, no story. <br /> <br /> Technically, not to mention, the production is strictly amateur. Audio terrible and inconsistent; Sometimes we can not hear Noam say, other times, we can not hear the questions, which are currently laid present. If Noam speaks rarely, we are allowed to see the reaction of the audience, except when we give a quick shot his wife, who apparently visited every one of his speeches and beams with pride every time we see her. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this film, and I would like to say that you are probably better to check his taped voice on a tape or CD to listen to in the car. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars ... and I'm in a generous mood today.
