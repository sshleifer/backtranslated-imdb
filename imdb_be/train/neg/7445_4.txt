Very sad drama starring a very young Roddy McDowall, who trains at the wild horse, the Flick name, and is the only reason to watch a movie in the first place. Covered in a ravine, the power of music and shortness of sweet dialogue, this is one of those movies that endless bother you to the point gnawing headache. Naffly eponymous sequel, Â«Thunderhead, Son Flick", which McDowell trains the next generation of cut, a little better than the original, but the pace is slow and evaluation continues to beat you into submission, though there is at least one or two scenes do not cause a coma.
