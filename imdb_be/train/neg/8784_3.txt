The idea was strange, the actors were incredible, the story would have been a very scary, but the handwriting was poor, and there was no depth. I could not get into this film. I could not get a feel for the characters, there was a lot of climaxes, and the film ends just very bizarre. It was a happy ending? I do not know. It was a sad end? Again, I do not know. You leave the theater feeling unsatisfied. The film had so much to give, but I could not. Just because you can edit, does not mean that you have to, do not you? I would not recommend this movie, because you just can not say that you have left a feeling of the film, it was over. You're just confused. Believe me, you'll probably thank me if you do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
