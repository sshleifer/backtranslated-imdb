I followed the progress of films for quite some time, so that one might have expected a little too much. I think Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, to be good at what they do, and it was interesting to see that Dan Reed could come up with, but unfortunately, it just does not work for me. <br /> <br /> The problem lies in the fact that the film does not really seem to understand what genre it falls in, and as such it does not impress on drama, horror and thriller elements, because instead of focusing on one of them and does it well, it's a bit of the compensator all trades and master of none. <br /> <br /> premise (like most revenge films) just a couple to meet and go out, something bad will happen, and they get their revenge is a simple formula, and one that many filmmakers treated qualified for many years . Unfotunately in this case, as if the thought Dan Reed, "It would be nice to make one of those films that revenge is a bit deeper, showing a more human side of the characters and delving into their mental state more .. .." wrong! There are also several key elements that are absent in this type of film is in general some warning. Not doing this, or it can occur an element that adds to the tension, but there is nothing like that here. It just happens, nothing happens for an hour, and then something interesting happens, and then it ends. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of very tough competition in this genre and caps to the Dan Reed for the attempt, I have no issue with his abilities, but heading into a period of writing ... I would say that the next time when he has to follow the formula for the type of film that he is doing instead of trying to be too clever, and it will have a high-quality movie on his hands.
