I stole this movie when I was a freshman in college. I tried to watch it three times, the other two, because friends wanted to see. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I never heard about this movie, but since he was so funny it should be funny." Wrong! I can not bring myself to watch that pile of shit after a dream boxing match / stroke of the war, which burns a guy with a good opponent Singer leads a physical pain. One would think that the terrible comedy funny hurt you, but after watching this, you will know it now. This film is not worth the price I paid for it. I watched a ton of movies of Steven Segal, and I even looked Crossroads twice ... but I still could not look at it.
