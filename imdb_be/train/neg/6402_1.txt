When I saw this film, about 1979, he became the first film I ever walked out of the center. There's nothing worse than a comedy, simply misses funny, and it passes every time (although I can not speak for the last 25 minutes of the film). There was nothing original about any of the skits. While I like the racy humor, where appropriate, these scenes were too vulgar. What is even more annoying is that this film was advertised as "the first film of Robin Williams', capitalizing on his new found fame in the television series" Mork & Mindy. " However, his role was so small that you can not even notice it on the screen.
