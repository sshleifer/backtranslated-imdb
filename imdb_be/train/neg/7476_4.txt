Evil Aliens is obliged to huge debt of Peter Jacksons early films Bad Taste and Braindead.I must admit, never use those films, in particular, and I say the same thing about the West this.Jake filmmaker who clearly lacks inspiration and chooses his rob those whom he looks to.I lost count of the number of times a big Hollywood movie quotes especially James Camerons Aliens.The amount of blood, and the blood on the show is not something funny, the last end of the film becomes tired and pulled out.Maybe it would work better as a short film.The actors poor direction is weak and the plot is not existent.I can be seen that the director is trying to do, trying to pay homage to it, but the others did the same, much better than shown here. 4/10
