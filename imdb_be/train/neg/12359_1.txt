I thought it was really a terrible movie - I was actually screaming at my TV several times. One or both of the gay men lead was miscast; there was absolutely no chemistry between them and Richard Rakkolo it seemed that he would rather kiss a dog. The film covers their long and tortured courtship, highlighting each break-up and make-up, but do not develop in-between the causes in detail. These reasons would make for some interesting characters, but not to fight or make-up scene in bed (lame, even if you liked the movie). <br /> <br /> Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine as their characters, but does it cost to rent a movie. Save your money.
