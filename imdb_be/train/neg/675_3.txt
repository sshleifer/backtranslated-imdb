City girl Meg Tilly gets a terrible phone call from her mother and, understandably shaken, returned home in rural drips her family, only to be faced with a mystery: why all the inhabitants of homespun acting bizarre and disturbing ways? Radiation thriller, with barely a nod of ecology, has a small resident of the town soldier who (ridiculously) includes two women looking at each other with desire in a public place and Tim Matheson receive a verbal note from the girl at the office desk. The image is too stupid to him, longing to spend Tilly and quiet intensity in the trash, forcing himself into a corner, he can not hope to get out. Some of the cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth well (in particular, the sequence set fire to the garage), although it is brought to a patchwork of editing - and rather bathetic final. Simplified script has not a drop of surprise or originality piece sleeve. * 1/2 ****
