I agree with comments from other users in the fact that the two leading roles were well acted, that being the guy who played Harry Gilmore and the role of Giovanni. It is a pity that the story was so boring. And hear I did not know anything about the story of Gary Gilmore in the film, so I do not know what to expect. I thought it would be something like Dead Man Walking or camera, but how wrong I was. The whole movie was just talk and talk and talk about their mom and dad. The only cool scenes were flashbacks, where the father would lose its character. It was the only interest I got from this borefest.
