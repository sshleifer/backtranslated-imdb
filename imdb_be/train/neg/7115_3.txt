Thus, the administration, with its offer of free hockey coffins for everyone who dies of fright during the movie so lame it's funny. And here is the first "skull scene" so pull and non-suspense, it's funny. The actual plot of the movie a few decent, there is at least some real food for thought in the behavior of the characters, and the plot twist well as go horrors. The current average is actually not bad. <br /> <br /> In general, this film does not completely fall flat on the road will be 1/10 of the film. It is not scary enough to get the lowest ranking, or even the second lowest. If only I had read the script, I would say that there was potential for it to be worthy of a movie. It's just that the reverse direction and production, which will ruin the film. So it's a bad film, but there are much worse than they are there.
