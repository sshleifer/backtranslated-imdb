Always enjoy great films that deal with the super-natural and deep thoughts about the spiritual world. However, this film just turned me off as far as his production and direction. There's nothing to go into a deep discussion about what this story has to say; all I can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen. Actors, namely: Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, gave an excellent performance in his native land of England, and we have seen it in the «Still Standing» TV series. Heath Ledger, playing a real evil man, and the last time we looked at it in "Brokeback Mountain," "05, gave a great supporting role. Shannyn Sossaman (Mara Sinclair), did a good job of seduction rectory of a church does not admit of any faith. NOT waste your time, you will be sorry!
