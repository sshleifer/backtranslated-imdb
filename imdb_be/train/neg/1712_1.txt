If Todd letter were to come out and admit that this film was intended to replace the zombie genre, I would like to change your rating at eight. Try to imagine a movie where each scene, line, and even every nuance of acting has been designed to be a parody. I could make some of alphabet soup, rearrange what's left of the letters, and even better scenario. Two scenes in particular, comes to mind when I think about this movie. SPOILER ALERT! One of them, when his father Mike, a second dad to go, I say go down the stairs hushed packed with zombies. This is a small staircase, and despite the fact that they clean the rotation against the undead, nothing happens to them. When they reach the end, an ex-Marine turns and says, "God you horny bastard", and shoots only one. The second is in the military complex. Woman stabs a zombie with a machete and surrounded immediately. The camera moves around it for about forty seconds, while it is surrounded by a zombie at arm's length. Then she almost accidentally runs out of the crowd and joined the others. SPOILER ALERT OVER! These scenes have to see to believe. Nevertheless, I love this movie as well as almost any comedy just because it's so damn funny. Kudos Todd sheets for so many people in his film and the disc to make it, but really is not anything else.
