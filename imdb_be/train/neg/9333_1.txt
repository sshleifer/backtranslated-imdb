Awful !!! I do not want to be too negative, but this film has an IQ of stupid monkey.What disaster.I just could not believe how bad this movie dialogues is.The just very strange and not on, the camera work at times awful, while the music soundtrack for Lawrence of Arabia, I just watched this movie to see how much worse it can get.Some side impact "actors" in the general difficulties disaster.Sorry but my thumbs and feet and anything that can hang down drops on my body on the ground. Harvey Keitle is a great actor, but who knows, maybe he is in a financial crisis, to take part in this fiasco movie. ,,,, This film was supposed to be given to all students in all film schools just teach them a lesson on how not to make a movie
