I'm a big fan of Jane Austen, and I ordered a movie with Amazon.uk just so I can see it without having to wait forever to come to the US, I really should have saved my money. What works with Ann after Wentworth? The whole point of the character Anne Elliot, that she was quiet and refined. She was not impulsive and vulgar. And Mary, she was suffering from a stroke or something? Her performance was not normal, and it was not for her to walk normally. There was no chemistry between the two protagonists, who have done their "romance" absolutely incredible. In the final scene, they even Sally Hawkins wearing the same dress, Amanda Ruth wore during the writing stage. The same clothes do not make the same film. In my opinion, they were not looking version of 1995 that despite the fact that it is the flaws, it is still pretty close to the book. The book, I do not think they read it. It's kind of like a Cliff Notes roller credibility. Hit on all high points, without explaining anything.
