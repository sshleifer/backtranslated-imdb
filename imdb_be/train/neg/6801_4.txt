Firstly, I will not tell you why I rented this film, because I'm still confused myself ... <br /> <br /> Air Rage much as any movie I've ever seen, where the plane is hijacked . There is, of course, that one important person on the plane, and the hijacker seeking revenge. The sad thing is, some of the methods to stop the thieves have already been used in other films. Have we really become so unoriginal so quickly? <br /> <br /> While it's Ice-T (which, for some strange reason, makes painful efforts to IV, while he is not busy with an "a" back to the turnip), which glorified the cover, the film is really stars smaller than strange Kim Oh stewardess, who "suddenly" misses of the five hijackers who, of course, come back to haunt them. As for the rest of the cast, the only person I was able to recognize Steve Hytner, better known as Kenny Bania with «Seinfeld». <br /> <br /> I can not forget to leave my favorite part. film if the hijacker used about a pound of plastic to blow the lock of the door ... BRILLIANT <br /> <br /> plot was predictable unnatural <br /> <br /> scenario -. brutal, he got to the point where I could say something, I would feel stupid comment, and it will be the next line in the film. <br /> <br /> As for the special effects ... the only thing special about this film, I wasted energy costs to run your TV and VCR for 100 minutes <br /> <br /> name -. the film took place in the air. But because of the less than stellar performances, only rage in the film was that the spectator. <br /> <br /> So if you are in the mood to even pick apart the film, because it is bad. Please save yourself, do not choose it.
