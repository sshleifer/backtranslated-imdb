I am glad that people IMDb able to decipher that the genre of the movie gets. I had a suspicion that tries to be a comedy, but it also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama I was not sure. For comedy is surprisingly devoid of even the smallest enterprises in the field of humor - even to the ridiculous "twist" ending, which confirms what a complete waste of time the whole film actually. It's hard to describe how amateur bullying really is. Anybody involved in this film have any idea at all that they were supposed to do? In fact, worth a look, so you can watch the screen in slack-jawed disbelief, how awful it is.
