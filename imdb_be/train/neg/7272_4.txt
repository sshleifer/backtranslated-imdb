The film is a bit tedious. It is basically a silent movie, with the bulk of O history, presented through a series of voice-overs. While making a silent film, it's not such a bad idea, it's one of those movies where the lack of dialogue and repeated early scenes make it just tedious. You do not understand the causes of boredom, while also in the picture, and then it's too late. The first 40 minutes of the film is the slowest part of the Mexican soft pornography and prosaic soft porn in it. Later in the film style of the first 40 minutes of starting to make sense, but it's too late, because by the time the audience is lost. There is some good shooting place at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I've often wondered why more and more films are not shot there. The campus was built on the edge of the lava fields which lend the campus is very otherworldly appearance. My biggest problem with the film is that the director / writer made the film the way he would like to see it, without regard to how a viewer who does not know history will see it. You can not ignore the audience, if you tell the story.
