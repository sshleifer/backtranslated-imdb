I have seen the original, entirely dubbed in German, and I was surprised how bad the film really is. Thinking I have seen my share of bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Mad Auntie, zombies and a lake, could do nothing to prepare me for this! It really was a pain to sit through this film, because there is no plot, no good action, and even the special effects are not convincing, especially the so-called zombies, do not wear anything but white makeup and old clothing, so they good set will not be destroyed and ketchup marmalade spots. <br /> <br /> If you really want to spend 90 minutes of your life, and then look at it, for the rest, do not do it, because you will regret it!
