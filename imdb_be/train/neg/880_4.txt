Garson Kanin wrote and this look at "modern" Las Vegas, and the gap between the generations, his first directorial effort since 1940's! David Janssen somewhat miscast as the owner of the casino big shot who is reunited with his son (Robert Drivasom that looks disconcertingly like an older Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches every scene the same way: defending himself with a chip on his shoulder. Playing this role, cool and laid-back asking too much from Janssen, who barks at all, as in the querulous put-upon husband (he even chews with Don Rickles, and makes him cry!). His son, an idler in search of his own identity, making hip comments on how young people look at Vegas (give them another ten years), and his dissatisfaction with the Pope's life causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro pretty self-conscious as a secretary and Eddie Willaims has a funny bit as a dancer to audition. Unfortunately, "where B" is not much else going for it but now dated reflections on ethics between adults and children, some Swiftarrow T & A and entertaining satirical bit exhausted at high rates of world gambling-- most of which were covered currently classified ad nauseam. ** from ****
