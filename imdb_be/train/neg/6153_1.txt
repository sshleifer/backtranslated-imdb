So let me start by saying that I have seen this film as part of the deal. I was really bored one day in 1997, so I biked to the store video. I asked the clerk that the worst film he had left was. Without hesitation, he walked me to the "Lucky Stiff.Â» He told me that he refuses to rent for $ 1 (it is said that it would be wrong to charge more), when I promised to watch the entire movie. Therefore, I watch it for free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. God-Awful even. I need not go into the details of the plot, read other reviews. Jokes have no meaning. The acting was terrible. I know that he was supposed to be a comedy, but the stupidity of the main character was tedious. You can try to look at it as something to laugh at, but it's so bad, it's not even funny in the way. Avoid!
