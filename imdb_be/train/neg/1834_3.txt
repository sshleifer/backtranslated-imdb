I can not say about this film. I think it speaks for itself (as the current rankings here). I rented it about two years ago, and I totally regretted it. I even / tried / love it, watching it twice, but I just could not. I can confidently say that I have absolutely no desire to see a waste of time, ever, ever again. And I'm not one to smash the movie, but I really believe that it was awful. It was not even funny anymore. The only bits I enjoyed were a few scenes of Christopher Walken in them. I think this film is destroyed as Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can think about when I see one of my films now-a-days that awful movie, and it reminds me not to spend money. Amy Poehler as very annoying, too. <br /> <br /> In general, well, I think you get my point. Stars for Walken, by the way.
