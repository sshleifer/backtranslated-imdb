When I was a kid in the '50s and' 60s is nothing connected with Disney was, by definition, great. What happened? They can get any actor and actress that they want the best of his time. But somehow I managed to screw things Disney, despite its rich resources. <br /> <br /> Disney could afford the best writers, the best producers and directors, but still ... they screw things up! This film is shit. The sad thing is that I suspect that Disney in his arrogance does not even know when the movie is good or bad. <br /> <br /> Only thanks to the talent of the actors that I can even give it a 3 out of 10.
