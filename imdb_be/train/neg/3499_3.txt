Comedy Central has had success with the original programming with professional comics. Chapelle Show, Mencia Mind, The Daily Show and Colbert Report hugely popular all-star professional comics and all, or in the case of Chapelle Show, were solid show. Given that Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics in the business, I was expecting good things, when I tuned in. <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> There was some mildly funny sequences, but considering that the star caliber Silverman, the show would be much better. It was only a pilot, and we hope to show in the next week will be better. If not, get her help in the form of the best writers for the show.
