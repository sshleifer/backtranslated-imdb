We'll see. The "St. Elsewhere" finale, we found that there was not a hospital, and that every thing was in the mind of an autistic child. «Newhart» over, telling us that it was all a dream. And "Ryazanov" over, telling us that all of this took place in her mind. Very "creative". Annoyingly there were more like him. Yes, it was just a TV show and was not at all true. It's just that when you get caught up in a big movie or TV show you will end up with at least wanting to believe that all this is "real". At least, as far as it reflects the reality on the screen. This type of series finale was done twice before and it was old hat, frustrating and simply not fun to watch. Now «Newhart» all be a dream? At the very least, make in a creative way, which far exceeded the expectations of those who loved the show. The idea itself was not too attractive, but it was so brilliantly done, that it is possibly the best series finale ever. Ryazanov left me feeling cheated after such a devoted fan.
