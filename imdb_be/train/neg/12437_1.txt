Â«Home Alone 3" is the first film in itself has no home Culkin starring the same villain. However, the plot is very similar to the original "Alone at home" movie. Instead of two comic villains, we get three or four of them. This film includes some traps, but he also has a long scene with a remote control car. Slapstick humor is consistent as well, but the boy and villains really are not able to make an impact in this movie. (No pun intended.) This film does not offer anything new or different than the previous films did, and there really is not a warm, holiday feeling or podagovory that the other two films. This is a pure comedy, but it failed to make me laugh, like the characters in reality it is not for me. I would not recommend this film; it's pretty boring. If you are looking for a good holiday family film with comedy, and then see the original "Home Alone" movies.
