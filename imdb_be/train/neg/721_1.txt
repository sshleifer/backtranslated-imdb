This film has won several key weaknesses. The first and most significant of which is the apparent lack of a good story! This, unfortunately, makes the film not only difficult to watch, but also sends the observing certain feelings of hopelessness, as if he or she spends precious time of his short life. This means that the film can not capture his audience, instead it encourages the public to view the growing contempt for the film and everything related to it! In short, it is really very very very very very very very bad! Do yourself a favor and chew on a big rubber boots, you will find that much more interesting and enjoyable than watching Terminator woman.
