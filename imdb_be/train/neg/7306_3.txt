Truly one of the worst films I have ever sat through. I never really time to write one, but was forced to after witnessing this insulting film-making and feel somewhat aggrieved to waste their time on such a piece of shit, to be honest. There were so many details that infuriated me with their complete randomness and lack of sense (for example, if the police ever take pictures of people with infectious diseases? If the hospital or by such person due to lack of treatment? Why was the guy who I noticed he was spying on his wife to travel on the street in a bathrobe while carrying a gun when she rolled on the bed?). In addition, characteristic - as we have almost come to expect in such films - was awful (for example, as the blonde guy - I do not remember his name frickin and do not give a toss anyway - completely turned against his friend and ran away leaving her), and I finally want to meet them all terrifying end! Production was badly disjointed and cinematography is nothing to write home about.
