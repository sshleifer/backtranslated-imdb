Let me be clear. IMDb I used for many years. But today I went through the trouble of registering on the website, just so I could give this film the lowest possible rating. I have seen hundreds of films, some of them bad, some of them badly. Never, however, I have not seen such a contrast pretense and incompetence, and high thoughts of failure. <br /> <br /> The world Sorvino is terrible cast as a princess, but it is incredible how Phocion, a young boy. Fiona Shaw is always entertaining, but the dialogue in the film is much worse, even, than in the insipid French play, which is the source (Marivaux never reached Hollywood so far, and we must keep it that way). <, Br /> <br /> in order to illustrate that, for example, Leontine is brilliant, warm philosopher and scientist, she is shown furiously pouring chemicals from the beakers beaker, shouting the names of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and princesses play even dumber. To this end, the couple should receive a joint award "Danes", which in a just world will be awarded for unreasonable and anachronistic uninspired interesting reinterpretation of teenagers from the literature, as the aprons from the 1990s (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables). <br /> <br /> In addition to the brutal plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce the art trails in the shooting of the film. For example, there are moments when a handful of spectators and fade from the point of view of the action, sitting in chairs, watching the main characters. The director wants to see that it is adapted the play. I get it. But this did not happen until far in the film. At that moment, he saw a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment and then disappears, and is a terrible distraction. They are similar to some non-scary zombies, being through the mists, filling us with fear. If you see the horrible and fun song that ends the movie, you want to pick their own crowd of zombies and kill them all in serious poisoning injustise mind for 112 minutes. <br /> <br /> Matthew McGuire
