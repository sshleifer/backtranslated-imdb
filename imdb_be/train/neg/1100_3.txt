Since most of the reviews of this film is screened seen a decade ago, I would like to add one later, the film open with footage of B-17's bombing of Germany, cut the photographic film to Hauptmann (captain) Wüst character Oskar Werner and his assistant working in the store, making its way to Hitler, the Führer bunker, once inside, they were interviewed by members of the staff of the bunker, then cuts the film to one of the many with Albin Skoda conference scene gives a decent impression of Adolf Hitler rally his officer on the «Ultimate victory" in t oh while Werner character manifest as slowly coming to the realization bunker Denizen are caught up in the fantasy event of the world and some are wrong BUNKERo drawn, the most notable of which is the flooding of the underground to avoid the Russian advance through them and the minor podagovor involving his youngest Flak-x and hard block of a family member living in the movie suffers from a number of inaccuracies in the details that the German film made after only '10 WW2 should not have been included; actor who shows Goebbels (Willy Krause) wear the same uniform as Hitler, including hands Eagle- Goebbels wore a brown Nazi Party uniform with a swastika armband-on "CC" soldier of the German army camouflage wear, well documented scene of Hitler awarded the Iron cross for the boy from the Hitler show took place inside the hopper (this was done in the yard) and, finally, Hitler's suicide weapon is clearly indicated as the Belgian model browning 1922 most accounts agree it was a Walther PPK-some bit of acting as well, bldg etsya totally inaccurate with drunk dance scene near the end of the film be noticeable, this bit shows a cabaret skit with intoxicating wounded soldier (his arm in a splint) manic goose-stepping music while the nurse doing a striptease dance mix / belly, all by candlelight ... it's really a shame to see the most incredible-bit, if the gain of captain Werner Wust this audience alone with Hitler Skoda, Hitler was shown as a wall fell on the bench, under the influence of drugs and delirium, where the nature Werner started Xia asked him squeal With Hitler, who bring years of the SS guards, who fatally sooner character Werner back with a gunshot, this entirely fabricated scenes based on true historical accounts -Werner character is dragged to die in front rooms, and Hitler to prepare its own end, goodbye, Hitler demonstrated its employees, but the suicide of the frame, the last show of the film Seconds Hitler pyre smoke slowly forming a ghostly image of the deceased person Oskar Werner / Hauptmann Wust-this film would Olsha allegorical than historical, and all those interested in this period, will do best to check more recent film, such as the 1973 remake of "Hitler: the last 10 days in" or German film «Downfall» (Der Untergang), if they want more realistic account of this dramatic story, the last two films based on the first person, eyewitness account, with "Hitler: the last 10 days" Bein g composed of autobiography Gerhard von Humboldt as a staff officer at the Führer's bunker and "Downfall the" made of memories secretaries Hitler's , the game screen for «Der Letzte Akte» taken I'm out of the book of US Nuremberg war crimes in a court judge Michael Masmanno in "Ten Days to Die", which is a collection of events (most obviously fantastic) than witness history, it is surprising that the cost of Trevor-Roper, "last day's Hitler "was never filmed.
