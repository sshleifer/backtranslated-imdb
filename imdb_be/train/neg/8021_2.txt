Visually incoherent and full of itself, apparently, the director decided to seek artificial depth to extend 5-minute chart as the 81 th minute of snoring Festival. <br /> <br /> moments that work in this film is very limited, and the characters do not even feel real. How could you feel invested in the main character, which has been made so unreal? <br /> <br /> substantively and stylistically, it all feels like a bizarre dream sequence. Concussion irregular camera work, uncomfortable silence and gaps in action, and that way a small spider crawling on the screen? Anyone who thought that he should go back to film school. He did not add any meaning, just cheese, or even stylistically to work with the rest of the film (assuming that the film was even a style that is a hair). That flop.
