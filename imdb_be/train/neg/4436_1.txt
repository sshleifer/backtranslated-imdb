I gave this movie rating 1 (terrible). The only reason why he should even get 1 instead of 0. great Ben Kingsley, who always shines, no matter how horrible stuff thrown in his direction. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino as its element here as a spectator one just can not get over the fact that she even in this piece. <br /> <br /> stupid, stupid story and a terrible production. Do not waste your video rental $.
