I can not believe I just spent half an hour, watching such a weak film. If there is only one movie, you have to skip this one. <br /> <br /> Robert teenager, whose father had recently died, so he begins to hang out with some of the local anti-social teenagers and drugs. All this makes it harder unconsciously and finally a subconscious explodes ... <br /> <br /> The first thing that I do not think I can find some kind of meaning or the next great delight in this film, rather than in any single character . If the director believes that I have seen in the last few minutes, as the great ecstasy, I have to say that it's not even close. <br /> <br /> The use of cinema is also not mature. Most of the time I could not see any facial expressions of the actors, and I did not feel the body language was enough to impress. Maybe the crew was so tired that they have installed a camera there, to include all of the settings. Everyone is happy, except the audience. <br /> <br /> The plot is particularly weak. There are a lot of unrelated scenes and conversations that can be should be linked, but they are really so random that you can never get them all together, it is possible if you are not the one who wrote them. <br /> <br /> In one and a half hour you can find in less than 5 minutes of real action and everything else, there are just people who walk, talk and move. So I really can not comment on the work here. <br /> <br /> A good selection of music in the last few minutes, though. Maybe it's the only good thing. <br /> <br /> I never gave the film 1, but this film is definitely worth (at least, you're laughing, when you look at the horrors). This is a film about when an unsuccessful attempt to reflect the troubled teen is found very disturbed audience. I hope that you are in a group no.
