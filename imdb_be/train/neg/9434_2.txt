Banned as "Video Nasty" in the UK, Upset, of course, was quite a bit of notoriety. However, the most shocking thing I have found about the film was its inexperience in all departments. Rend I could handle: the terrible actions of rubbish editing, terrible direction, lousy script and bottomless soundtrack was much more difficult to take <br /> <br /> Three girls on the way to disaster music festival during the ravine. storm. They are saved by a friendly stranger who takes them to the next house. The owner of the house, touched the old woman, and her unmarried daughter, welcome girls, allowing them to stay for a few days to recuperate. However, someone did not want the girls to leave ?? ever! One by one they fall victim to an unseen assailant. <br /> <br /> Taking a long time to go out and showing some of the worst performances ever in a horror film (and that takes some doing), Upset is a truly awful film. Music is a mess (it sounds like three years has been to produce a synthesizer) and, as such, it complements the film perfectly. Only a few bloody scenes towards the end and a little gratuitous nudity maintain sanity after receiving the lowest scores. <br /> <br /> If you Completist horror (and, unfortunately, I have), you want to see it in order to put a check mark in the video Nasty watch list. But keep in mind ?? this is a very, very bad.
