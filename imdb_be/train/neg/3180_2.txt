Which is sad movie! Summing up, it is basically just his daughter Nana Patekar knocking Karisma Kapoor, while she tried to flee the village with her son. Can anyone tell ??? boring concept was not so bad, but it was poorly executed. Canadian locale, and some of the village scenes are well shot. However, in general, cinematography went short. The story could have been fine, but the film just seemed to drag. There is only so much a person can take stupidity, not to mention three bloody hours it. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film was the song Â«Ishq Fire", and it was only five minutes long. Also, this film was a piece of shit.
