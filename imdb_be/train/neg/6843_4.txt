Quite an interesting flick operation in black and white written by David F. Friedman. Leading actress Stacy Walker is well cast and surprisingly attractive. It resembles a mad Renee Zellweger with a bad haircut. This chick just made two of these films, and then moved to Texas. Music awful. One of her boyfriends play Sam Melville (from the TV show recruits), using a different name <br /> <br /> The best line in the film by Tony. - "You're not putting me doll None of my? chicks put me. " Good B / W cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs (Easy Rider and the target, and many others). Good locale (cool pool, which is also used in Corruptor). Surprising ending, but fitting. A 4 out of 10. The best performance Stacy Walker.
