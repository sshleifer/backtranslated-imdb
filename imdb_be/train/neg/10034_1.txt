If there is one film that is the worst this year is the first promo Tashan instructed that the film would be boring Dhoom 2 movie style, and I knew it would be only the first bad movie all that is possible due for film and Yashraj Or maybe seeing cheesy promotional But this film gave me a shock, it was even worse is Dhoom 2, and what I expect the introduction of the first Saif, who sadly then Saif- Karina meet Karina is so artificial, and then Anil Kapoor oh, what he does in such a strange film? That is an interesting role? What actor is he doing? His first scene in order, but then his action becomes repetitive and it overacts Akshay Then, provide some interesting scenes, but the film became more boring and with all the obsolete thing of childhood romance, children's scenes overdose Rajnikant style action and all the sad scene ending another joke <br /> <br /> Vijay Krishna Acharya would get 3 films more to send, if the film works, here's a strategy Yashraj, only money nothing else So Vijay is yet another addition to their list of filmmakers crap music (Vishal Shekhar ) Daily <br /> <br /> The performances Akshay Kumar in the film comes as a breath of fresh air, it really gives some attractive moments Saif Ali Khan is annoying, Karina equally bad ham Anil Kapoor defiant and spoils the show more rest in order
