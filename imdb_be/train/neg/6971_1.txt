All of this frightening waste of films needs Count Floyd popping up every sixty seconds. Somehow they got Reylsbek, Enspach, John Vernon, and Joe Flaherty together on set and could not get within five miles, about eight kilometers from the actual movie. Boy does this thing suck. There is not one original line of thought, a shot, or the effect of brainless opening sequence to the closing brainless. Magical, ethereal Enspach with Five Easy Pieces - boring. Reylsbek - boring. John Vernon - sad. Big mistake - it is boring. If this is a horror film, Buttercream Gang is thuglife documentary. <br /> <br /> Seriously - every bad movie contains its own explanation for his unfitness. Usually it is in the opening credits - "writer, director and producer of" one guy. Or in the heart of the actions of some prostitute so poorly that you know that there is one and only one reason for this turkey to get done. Here you will not find out until the last of the loans, where cooperation about a dozen sub-functions of the Government of Canada is gratefully acknowledged. <br /> <br /> Now I'm looking to take on the Beast MCT Yucca Flats, to get the taste out of my mouth. Ghod, than improvement.
