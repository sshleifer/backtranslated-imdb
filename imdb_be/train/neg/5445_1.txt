Ooof! This one was a bitch. He does not fall "somewhere between Star Wars and Thriller», that's for sure. In fact, all that is somewhere between the cracks Wham! video and Captain EO, not only as a big budget and a lot more close-ups of ugly adolescent cry. Simon Le Bon clean front and center, while the rest of the band bravely trying to hide the fact that they stole his entire career with the last 3 albums Roxy Music. Short clips from Barbarella do not add anything. Avoid at all costs. (However, I liked the part that they played «Hungry Like The Wolf», but for some reason there was a tiger hiding in the audience is changing into a woman painted stripes tiger? I mean, they did not sing "Eye of the Tiger" or "Hungry Like tiger ", the wolf! Whatever.) DVD from 80th Duran Duran video is probably worth a look for the sake of nostalgia
