I lured to see this film its StarPower, but ultimately, it is all that brings. It plays much more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about a big city corruption. This is the biggest flaw in his predictibability and a complete lack of suspense. We know who the bad guys from the start and just follow along as they fall like dominoes. The film is to its credit has to refrain from gratuitous violence and sex, but forgot to replace a good, clean romance or excitement in any other way. Everything tastes good, flat decaffeinated Diet Coke. «Q & A», which also takes place in New York City, is a much better alternative as «LA Confidential».
