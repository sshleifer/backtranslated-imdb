This ABC directly to a TV failure is not making absolutely no justice brilliant science fiction novel that wrinkle in time. Ms. Madeleine L'Engle brought the child and adult in the magical, fantastic and original world, neither the author in front of her. This novel is the first of its "time Quartet", a beautiful take on life, the universe, and time itself. However, it is easy for any child or young person to understand. His unshakable morals prevalent throughout the book. This film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of the work of Ms. L'Engle under Art. Frankly, they thought? The effects look cheap and funny, the plot is soft and uneven, the dialogue is far-fetched and almost every novel characteristic magic was lost. It was a terrible attempt to bring this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that one day intelligent, decent director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Cuaron) makes another attempt to bring the book to the screen and understand it for what it really is: a masterpiece. This device can be compared only sad, fake and cheap motel-room art, which does not hold any reason and does absolutely no effect on its audience.
