Swedish militants have in the past few years have turned into something that mimics the American films tempered actions as «Heat», but with a low budget. This film is worth the same recipe as the "Knoll Tolerans» and «Livvakterna». Nevertheless, it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a sharp and hard film. <br /> <br /> The story has been seen before, the dialogue feels artificial and action is very bad, especially with the main actress, film tries to paint a picture of hard-boiled military as robbers, without remorse in general and female researchers, who lost all his problems the past, but at the same time it is acting quite rationally. It can not be very good. <br /> <br /> In the bluish cast photo style does not seem fresh anymore, and it's not even done well in this picture. Only a very few scenes actually look good. In addition, the sound is quite strange, and it sounds like a lot of the actual dialogue recorded later. <br /> <br /> The main quality of this film Stefan Sauk, although it does not make a convincing portrait of a Special Forces team leader who has some really funny lines. In addition, the music is quite good.
