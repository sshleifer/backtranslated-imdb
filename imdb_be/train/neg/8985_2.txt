Previous comments encouraged me to check it out when he appeared on that, but it was a bitter disappointment. Lupe Valdez is great, but does not get enough time on the screen. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play familiar, but forward-looking characters, but the script leaves them stranded. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the ego Lee Tracy character, which is, at best, self-centered, physically and verbally abusive jerk. Reactions of "public" ill-conceived and incredibly, that makes the "trick", it seems like bad tricks of the writer. And it strains credulity that the nature of Lupe Velez could fall on him. <br /> <br /> In the "stinging one-liners", mentioned in another review, we must depend on the observer, since I did not even notice, that an attempt was made.
