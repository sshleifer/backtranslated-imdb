There's plenty of star power in the house spirit, to create a new galaxy, but the final product is quite controversial. The movie and its message is very noble and I think that, perhaps, most would agree with them. (Liberal democracy is good, violent fascist regime bad unbiased well, racism is bad, and so on). Unfortunately, we are beaten from head to toe with this, as well as the subtlety used as I have described them. <br /> <br /> In the end, we are left to look very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty idiots that have no redeeming qualities. It radiates with all suspension poorly planned "about" wrestling match. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays a patron, a man of many contradictions. Meryl Streep as his gifted bride and Glenn Close, as her daughter. If the camera is left with these people, the film tends to move, and very pleasant. Unfortunately, the Spirits House grapples with just too many subplots and characters pop with pictures like shooting targets. We do not get to know them, so we do not get to take care of them. The result is boredom. <br /> <br /> If the Bill of August, the director and screenwriter (from the book by Isabel Allende) was either lengthen the film or omitted several characters, this film might have worked completely. As you can see, it was a nice try, with good communication and bonecrushing yawnfest. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended.
