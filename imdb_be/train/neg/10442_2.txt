All Internet buzz aside, this movie was god awful. I expected that the film will be more farce than anything. Instead, the filmmakers were trying to do a serious film thriller / horror, and they are completely missed. There were only a few good parts, and a couple of good lines, Samuel Jackson. In addition, it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snake. It was miles better than the film itself in playful online. Now that the film really comes out, I hope this is a joke die. Do not waste your time and money on this piece of hyped garbage. If you are looking for something that is funny and interesting, then just go to Snakes on a blog.
