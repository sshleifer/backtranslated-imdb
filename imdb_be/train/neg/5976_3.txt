The rumor is true: girls like Coyote Ugly more than guys. And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given. Jersey girl goes to New York to become a song writer. And after the initial disappointment, having no success, he overhears some girls partying around $ 300 each one made last night. She gets an audition at the bar they work in and surprise you! The place is full "two-year old kids" bursting dancing babies eyes. <br /> <br /> the story is not bad, but some of the characters are cute, especially Cammie (hereinafter "the fashion coordinator" part was cute) and a bouncer, but let's face it, the drama was terrible and completely ludicrous from the start. Purple and her father looked too funny, when they were in a relationship for the entire film. check Violet too jamming on this keyboard with a break dancer! <br /> <br /> the first time I could not figure out how to production so terrible? In a short time with this movie, Hollywood could stand on two naked ah, and show a new low without any major public outcry, to say: "You have been warned!" Instead, it seems, Coyote Ugly is a purposeful intention of trying to kiss each primary relief in the world of advertising babies at the bar, but pointing. thin paper "to pursue his dream of" the history of a man disappointed with every teen you aim! <br /> <br /> And finally, music. There have been absolutely no interruption of music I found in this film, especially when it was necessary (hospital scene). Each scene felt some short music video you just want to stop, while the bar is not open. But the climax was the final laugh: Â«80s, as the song would be expected Cyndi Lauper to jump on stage and jam with Violet. Gosh, I personally thought that Bon Jovi is going to jump with long hair and jam too! <br /> <br /> In addition to some really clever camera work with Coyote girls when dancing (especially in the wet stage), and a pair of cute cliche, Coyote Ugly purely embarrassed. Whether watching how you did it, it seemed nothing but killing time. Or spend depending on how you look at it.
