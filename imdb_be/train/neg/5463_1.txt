I have not seen Arthur (TV series and books) years ago and have never liked the show very much (if you are a fan of this cartoon, I'm sorry if I'm spoiling it for you, but it's actually what I think) .Lots people liked it, but I did not. <br /> <br /> school children characters seemed to have fought constantly (especially Arther and DW), they were polite to each other often, but gradually I tired to complain to each relationship of Arthur and his sister DW (but it was the name of written), and DW was of ADHD (or ADD) -like 4-year-old sister of Arthur, which sometimes require (this may be why Arthur was annoyed that were its procedures, as well as her imaginary friends, and her collection of stuffed animals, etc. .), friends of Arthur acted like teenagers instead of what they were like in the Arthur books, and parents, well, they did not care very CMM t. <br /> <br /> most of the movie was Rocko's Modern Life, not Arthur (no offense).
