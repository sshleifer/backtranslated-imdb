This is one of those films that seems to have tried to ride the wave of martial arts craze. It seems like Billy Jack, I think. However, while Billy Jack made one notable martial arts scene is not in it, except for some gentlemanly arts and roughhousing as such. We presented the star, who is described as learning Judo in the Marine Corps. I was in the Marine Corps, and while they're pretty set in boxing, I do not remember the emphasis on judo. As a result, the antagonist, James MacArthur, makes reference to Judo, he offers an excuse why he, state champion wrestler is so easy to win. Lame.
