This film was a strange, totally inexplicable, and hysterical to watch with friends, drank a large empty house. I really like the opening of a thing with Lisa wandering lost in a fabulous city. I want to be a handsome stranger lost in some exotic European area, although perhaps not in the low-budget horror wave. Definitely get the ending where has oddly enough, not sexy sex scenes that were cut out (in my copy of the DVD in any case). Do not try to figure it out, just go ahead and follow the strange bit ... that's all. He can not see, if you really want to plot or characterization, or anything at all to make sense. Quite pretty, although you can just give up on this and decided to see a real horror movie, like, say, Dead alive.
