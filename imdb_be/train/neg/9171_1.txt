What can I say? I ignored the reviews and went to see it myself. Damn reviews were so good. What a waste of money, given that this budget. <br /> <br /> The good thing is, I went to the Kill Bill then. <br /> <br /> In order to see a really scary movie, would Crossroads! <, Br /> <br /> The bottom line-- I like "Girl in Gold Boots" better than this shit.
