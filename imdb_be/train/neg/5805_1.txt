Anyone who has seen the original to go out and destroy this terrible mess. Baldwin is trying to emulate the late Steve McQueen word for word remake just does not work. While Baldwin did some remarkable work, it is a failure from beginning to end. McQueen had charisma, never try to compete with the star. As for Kim as Ali McGraw said enough. McQueen kinds of dangerous, threatening and believable as Doc, the film had the excitement and suspense, Baldwin and the company has made it into a comedy, I laughed the one and only time I've seen this wretched film. And this horrible hairstyle for Michael Madsen, who is one of today's more interesting and believable actors! Does it make people Michael, what were they thinking.If you want to see the movie-making, as it was under the direction of Sam Peckinpah in Get the original!
