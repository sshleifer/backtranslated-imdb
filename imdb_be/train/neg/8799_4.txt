Kudos patience Paul Muni, who spent many hours in the dressing room every day to see a part of Zola. Mooney was one of the biggest stars in the 1930s, and I wonder how many people today -other than the classic movie lovers - know anything about it. He was a giant in the business for at least ten years. He could have won the Academy Award for this performance, which would give it two in a row as he won for playing Louis Pasteur a year earlier. My opinion is that while he, as a rule, to exaggerate a little, I still think he was one of the greatest actors of the "Golden Age." Whatever role he has played; . You were glued to the screen watching him <br /> <br /> In contrast to the role of Pasteur, I thought that this story smacks a little too much of what we have seen over the last 60 years: over the side to a liberal hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood could not suppress his contempt for the police or military, is making it a point to tell us how to "corrupt" the organization. Filmmakers just love when the power is challenged and defeated. In this regard, the film is far ahead of his time, as we have seen this big-time since 1960. <br /> <br /> However, it should be noted that the facts confirm this story. It is also not in any way detract from the achievement of Zola as a social reformer, get rid of some evil. Good for him! I wish they had spent more time showing that than focusing on a single test.
