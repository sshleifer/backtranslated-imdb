Return Boogyman a terrible movie that plays like a movie, it plays like an episode of the television sitcom, when they flashback to the old episodes. Return Boogyman a clip show. <br /> <br /> Mutch film constant and annoying memories from the first film. Again and again the same footage. How sad it is. <br /> <br /> The film is really about the psychic woman who has a vision of the first film. <br /> <br /> I've seen the first film, which I do not want to see the same scene over and over again, and I do not know who it will be. The whole movie looks like it was done quickly to make a few dollars and it is so.
