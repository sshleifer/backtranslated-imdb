Horror filmmaker Class-Z Carl Monson was one of the most prolific directors working in the field of low-budget films in the bloody mayhem.His chirping mismanagement baked blood, ridiculous actions, boring sub-plots and bitter dialogue.A mysterious black clad figure massacred guests living in the family mansion.Unfortunately this film almost bloodless.You not actually see the murder except for the shadows and a few blood splatters.The sluggish pace and plot rather uninteresting.The action merely competent, but the lack of gore and mayhem He left me disappointed.A generous 4 of 10.Just beware: do not confuse with the film Monson equally weak "Legacy of Blood" Andy Milligan in.
