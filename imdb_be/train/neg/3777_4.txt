Flat, soulless computer drawings on less strange backgrounds animates terribly predictable plot in this film. Absolutely nothing takes you by surprise, you can even tell when the vocals of Bryan Adams are going to come, which are always at the wrong time. <br /> <br /> The main character, a horse Spirit, given to the annoying voice when he tells what happens. The narrative is not necessary, though, as everything is really obvious. You can even say that the horse is said, even though all they do is neigh. Which is good, but all the horses are doing exactly the same sounds -. One for the prevention, one for sorrow, one of laughter, etc. There is no difference between the voices of horses <br /> <br /> Small children might like this movie, though. This is a rather sentimental for the family to sit down and look, and there is little risk of someone frightened. If you do not have anything to do, and want to watch a movie with the kids, it's not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, this is not recommended.
