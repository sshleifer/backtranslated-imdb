This product has absolutely no storyline. Actions uncomfortable. Promising Dutch TV Sophie Hilbrand Star should not add this film to her resume. Her acting is far from perfect, and I personally think that she crossed the border professional integrity; relating to the way she puts herself in this film. This film contains too much unnecessary nudity, vulgar sex scenes and coarse language. It also shows the wrong way of the Netherlands (like most movies). It is not necessary to watch this film: a waste of time, waste of money and an awkward entry for Hilbrand, which was better than her close to the screen.
