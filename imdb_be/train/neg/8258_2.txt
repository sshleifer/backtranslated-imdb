I had the good fortune to read the book before watching the movie. It was an epic of youth, the dream of summer has passed, a lot of potential indie movie or a big budget drama. It somehow got into the hands of a hack that is clearly recorded watch Boogie Nights and Rushmore, not really learning anything. The script loses the meat of the book in favor of coercive emotional notes and low brow jokes. I feel sorry for the actors as the characters in the book are rich and textured, but cut to uncomfortable charactures in the film. Mason Gamble is great when given the opportunity, Dylan Baker, but the skeleton, which remains in the history plays out like a bad after school special. Poor people = good, rich man = BAD. <br /> <br /> While it's almost worth a look to see the beach of Southern California, where Sinise parks his trailer, which is intended to go to the Bay of Delaware. <br /> <br /> It is a good book, but embarrassing turn for first time director Mills Goodloe. <br /> <br /> C.
