My first review in 2010 "Into The Blue 2: The Reef". The story of two divers, played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort, who love to explore the hidden treasures at the bottom of the local reef. A day after a day of sight they approached a couple, played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They say young divers who they want to hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact of the hidden treasures of Columbus, which is reported in the bottom of the reef. <br /> <br /> The next day, four dives in the bottom of the reef and rough after a day of diving, they find nothing. A few more days in the past and two hired divers have discovered that they are part of a large conspiracy of death, in which they can not escape otherwise they will be killed. They were hired to find two large containers. One of them contains a nuclear reactor, and the second contains the core. <br /> <br /> The film also has a back story about another person (the brother of the main character) tries to patch things up with his girlfriend, I consider this part of the story was a waste of time, it also includes a very steamy sex scene between the pair, which to me is a waste and was not necessary to show. <br /> <br /> However, in addition, this film does have some good underwater photography and the combination of colors in a well, so it gets 4 stars. Into The Blue 2 is a sequel in name only. None of the original actors or the characters return, it has a dull story, silly character and sad climax.
