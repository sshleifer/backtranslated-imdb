Terrible acts terrible throw and cheap props. It would've been much better if it was installed in the blockbuster parody style. What a waste. Starting from the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> «enemy» Calling it "The film" would have done it better. (Contribution to spoof effect). Cap looks like a 60-year-old, blond girl just having one and the same blank sad look on her face at all times. Toward the end of the film he is working together to take down the bad guy and every time they exchange words, it just feels like a cheap data line to the sex scenes in the porn film. Horrible. Do not waste your time.
