in fact, it's basically the same movie.and they could not even get a temporary event correct.maybe line that was deliberate because of laziness or not caring.either way this thing real woofer.it not even deserved to be called a movie .i saw it as a so-called second function on the drive containing the original Boogeyman.i thought my head would explode, and I encourage you to run as far in the opposite direction of the thing, when you have cursed with misfortunes combing through this path. it should come with a warning label like: Warning may cause to throw a few IQ points, if you are in this vicinity.for I have no doubt this thing is 0/10
