Well, I watched this movie a little more than 2 years ago, and now I pulled it out of a dusty shelf to see him again, and I must say that I really think that this movie is good. The film caught the buzz as the bootlegs I know what you did last summer, 3, as well as Final Stab was Scream 4, and this film is not so bad. I mean, he had shortcomings and, of course, it would be funny to release it in theaters, but still the night popcorn movie, this movie is not half bad. It has a few scares, and some really hot woman, I might add. In addition, it shows new muscular look, Joey Lawrence, though, obviously, even that did not win him any major Hollywood role either ...... I feel bad for the man, he had a career in the early and the mid-90s with a flower, some Disna movies and eternal brothers show ..... Lawrence Joey Lawrence was a bit player in the comedy scene, but then, as in the 360-degree turn, his career has gone in the south only make low budget movies like this. <, Br /> <br /> film also throws you off guard at that makes you think, between the crew, there really is a secret that someone knows, only to be disappointed in the end to learn the secret. He also throws you on who is the murderer, I had an idea, but so far woulnd't think that the killer, who he was, but his motives were a huge disappointment in conjunction with the secret. Now, if there was a secret that was released? This film could have been one of the best to the rating of films. But I youngsters to college and topics in college I went on spring break at the beach the size of the mansion house similar to the one in here, so it's just made me feel sentimental about this movie. <br /> <br /> so as slasher flick. Good for northern cinema.
