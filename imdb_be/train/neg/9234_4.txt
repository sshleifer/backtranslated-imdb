Remade today, this film is very terrible, very disturbing dark comedy. Psychological obsession, and the web of lies and manipulations, 1948 give shine aren't-they-cute harmlessness. Drake plays a stalker, shamelessly by the people, in turn, helpless and handling, Grant plays nasedat sacrifice, alternately angry and ignoring <br /> <br /> Much anxiety. I could not look at the classic songs with the same suspension of disbelief since. <br /> <br />
