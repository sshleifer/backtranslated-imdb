The film begins with the people on Earth, revealing that their rocket to Mars are not lost, but just drifting in space near the planet. If it is produced, one of the crew members is ill, one live and the other two are missing. What happened to them it is told through flashback surviving member. <br /> <br /> While on Mars, the crew was apparently attacked a number of very silly mistakes eyed monsters. Ironically, while the sets were pretty good, the monsters were among the silliest I've seen on film. In addition, the odd attempt to realism, the production used a process called «Cinemagic». Unfortunately, this is a great innovation just made the film looks pretty cheap when they were on the surface of Mars, and the intensity of redness almost made my eyes bleed - it was bad !! Despite all the cheese, the film had some interesting story, and a good message about space travel. For fans of the genre, it's worth a look. For others, you can just find it all rather silly - see for yourself and decide, <br /> <br /> Although by today's standards it's not a particularly good science fiction film, compared to films made. At the time, it is pretty good <br /> <br /> PS. - When you are watching a movie, pay special attention to Dr. Tremain. It looks like the spitting image of Dr. Quest cartoon «Jonny Quest»! In addition, it sounds and acts a lot like him, too.
