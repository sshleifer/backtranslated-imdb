I can not help it, but I think I like movies that are meant to be scary, and are just plain bad. Personally, I listed it in their own top 10 worst films right under the creatures of the abyss!. Watch this movie and laugh just do not expect any Academy Awards for action. A better chance of understanding a film of his own. Frankly, although I have seen much worse than this. Plus some maniac cruising around the desert wipes are the same people that had just died, that's unbelievable that it must be original. I think it's one of those love-hate movie. You can make your own mind and his terrible, but she pulls it somehow that's why I love it
