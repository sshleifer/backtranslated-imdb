I'm really shocked that the great director Chuck Jones started doing some of the most incredibly boring cartoons I've ever seen. I did not laugh once during this short, and it is a caricature of Bugs Bunny, for Christ's sake! Bugs bunny cartoons always funny, but not boring! Unfortunately, this is a short Good Night Elmer (another extremely short boring Jones) supplemented with Bugs Bunny. <br /> <br /> The first warning sign is always entirely goofy cartoon gag retribution. Good Night Elmer was boring because it lasted for one and the same two jokes forever predictable payoff. This cartoon, on the other hand, the suffering with another warning sign dim cartoon: there is too much dialogue. Cartoon, at least more than two plugs sleeves, but most of them seem to be more than they are due to the huge upholstery dialogue. At one point, Elmer finishes lunch, and comments, "It was weawwy awfuwwy well Weg with wamb," perhaps the most superfluous dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (signs reading text aloud in a later era Woody Woodpecker cartoons are not taken into account in my book ). Even if this cartoon lasts 8 minutes, it feels like more than 20 thanks to the dialogue, as it is. <br /> <br /> bunny Elmer was not funny cartoon to me, but if you have sold his soul to Chuck Jones and nOT to acknowledge that he had sent a few clunker during his career, you could trymlivats pleasure from it.
