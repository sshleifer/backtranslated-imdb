This is definitely the worst film I've seen in my life. Actions poor and the plot is almost inconceivable. Be or do not like beacons or any ships that it has nothing to do. As for the special effects, the film does not. The crew of the film is likely to have been on a boat in a stormy sea, and not in the studio, and if some of the "killed" men (if you can even call it that) their reaction is absolutely unreal. Gun quieter than a mute. How this movie can have one two awards it raises serious questions about the state of the human mind. Well that's about it. This review is probably more interesting to read than to watch a movie. If someone is considering watching it or buy it, I would seriously advise you against it for obvious reasons. I said that it includes a spoiler. If the fact that some people get a knife and a gun fires a giveaway site. I believe this is because they are the only good part of the movie.
