I heard about this movie and I knew that it was not very good. But I started to watch a movie (in my movie) and was interested. This can be very large, dark black satire on the morals of today's media. Small shorts at each contestent were good. This is to create something I do not want to miss. But when the show begins the so-called all becomes implausible, cheap and rather silly. This is where the author must add something that would make people think. Instead, he wrapped and assuming that people can mute it. <br /> <br /> ending is so bad, I give it a 1. Even when a film about a promising start.
