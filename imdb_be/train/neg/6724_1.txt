If you choose a film that I hope that one factor that you consider are the actors in the film, using his fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way? This is not a political statement, it is a moral issue that effects society. If the comedian / actor does curl sexual and racist remarks about the teenager and her father, we must ask ourselves (I want to support this behavior)? In this case, Mr. Foxx behavior tear in the social fabric, which teaches our young people right from wrong, good from bad behavior that loving-kindness is better than hatefulness. Mr. Fox should remember that it is only entertainment, and there are many out there for us to choose from. Saying sorry, did not get him off the hook. It will not be undue pain or remove the bad behavior he stretched to our youth. One way to stop this behavior to stop being a fan of this. No longer see anything, they are a part. We can not change them, but we can stop the glory we give them.
