I'm sorry to say this, but «Thunderbirds» did not even come up with a loud bang, not to mention any disease. At one stage, I gave serious consideration to leaving the theater, I stayed in the faint hope that the film can be improved. I was to be disappointed, it did not get better, it gets worse, if at all possible. If I went to watch the film with the idea that he was going to be a "parody of" I have until now been pulled. They had an excellent opportunity to make a big franchise films here, they are completely wasted this opportunity. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be embarrassed to have there names attached to this film and Frakes good thing I can say is that he should be embarrassed and ashamed will not be far from the truth. I saw this film the show ready-to-release, I was waiting to see him most willingly, who grew up in the sixties with the original show. To say that I was disappointed would be something humiliation. And the last thing I will talk about the film were puppets in the TV shows were only a little more than wood, where the actors in the film.
