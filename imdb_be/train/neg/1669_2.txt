Here we are: the two travelers from distant futuristic world are coming on the earth ... one on a desperate mission to save the life of the other inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the savior of the whole race. <br /> <br /> So what we might call the killing machine? It's almost like he was a destroyer or destroyer ... kind of like a fighter or something. What's the word I'm looking for ... what -terminates- things? Hmmm .... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the defender (who quickly doffs white tunic, he stole from Luke Skywalker in favor of the local clothing) is a young woman, the first and saturates it with the future hero of origin to be. Evil Uhhhh ... Â«fighter" kill some animals and steal their weapons and clothing, and then trying to find a woman visiting her workplace and ask, looking menacingly in the eyes of the people and repeating her name threateningly. <br /> <br /> Then begins a desperate race for survival, as the seemingly immortal and stop the "fighter" pursues the pair through the countryside. At some point, he can get his boots and ski, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> It is possible, in a thrilling finale, he will try to crush them under the wheels of a huge tanker full. .. acid. Then a truck accident. They will be saved ... but no! He will appear again, as strong as ever. He will kill and persecute defender Woman in meat processing plant, where the finish line in a terrifying, it is pushed into a large part of the industrial processing machine, and destroyed once and for all. <br /> <br /> But, maybe, I extrapolated too much ... after all, I stop watching this movie after Mr. defender magically fills Sean Young, kissing her in the bar, and then says her child will be born within 3 days. <br /> <br /> costumes and effects are great in that movie ... I liked them the first time I saw them on Star Trek: The Next Generation too! Sean Young takes another big turn as unemotive Replicant and career sweat-hog Stephen Baldwin is also on board as Young Cop Boyfriend Fat. I do not know where he fit into the story, though ... maybe he imports from another James Cameron?
