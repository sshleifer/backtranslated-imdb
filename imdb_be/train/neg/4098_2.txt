Despite the fact that it is "better" than the first Malvo (which is not saying much, in any case, I would like to watch paint dry), it still sucks. Do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these guys low budget pictures. I was tricked into buying several DVDs, to support some Indie filmmakers and boy did I regret it. Some of them were not even officially "liberated", but (no bootlegs bought by themselves the creators of the film) and I can not even list how bad they are. Avoid anything with Teen Ape or Bonejack in them, as they appear in other small indie films that they are a member with. If you are friends of these boys, most likely, you were in his films and had the pleasure of making them. But for those who were supposed to watch them? No way. Poor video, bad sound, bad acting, bad story ... etc. etc. It's not even funny. I gave it 2 because Debbie Rochon is in it, and that's about it. Maybe it does not even deserve 2 About 1 1/16-second star, to show that it was a bit better than the first (which I would have rated negatives). If you want a decent sun-budget film, go pick up something from the "FriendsÂ» LBP over a Freak Productions, Marty Jenkins or Raising Stakes. It's actually decent.
