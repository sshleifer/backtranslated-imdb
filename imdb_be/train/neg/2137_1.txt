Even the first 10 minutes of this movie was terrible. Hard to believe that anyone other than John Cusack would invest in it. With the sequence of the anti-war / anti-war films have already been destroyed in the box, it is almost impossible that the studio of any kind would itself associated with this scenario. <br /> <br /> In the first place, it may seem like a kind of politically motivated derivative Grosse Point Blank with Ackroyd and Cusack (a) again. But only about 90 seconds in the movie, it becomes obvious that it is mediocre attempt Dr. Streynzhlav. <br /> <br /> I loved so much Cusacks films that I thought I would venture to see the DVD of it. I must say that I do not know when Cusack normal enough for me to even watch another feature starring again, if someone can not vouch for it. Cusack seems to be so damaged by his hatred of George W. Bush and the war in Iraq, that he was ready to commit suicide career. Tom Cruise has never been close to getting this far. Not even close.
