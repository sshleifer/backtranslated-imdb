Incredibly discombobulated turkey mixture of the anti-Hitler musical (!!), the pre-war Americana and Agatha Christie detective novel parodies with one big, big problem: it is deadly unfunny. In addition, the simple IQ plot and dialogue, the strangest aspect of the "Lady ..." is obsessed with casting. Gene Wilder (star and co-author) tries his best to all this: he plays the romantic lead (with his good looks and age !! !! He and Woody Allen should start a club for Clueless, mirrorless aging comedians), and he's trying to move and funny and sarcastic and smart, and trying to sing and dance, and succeeds in NONE !! Looong shot from his good old days with Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> For a while I thought I had a fit of myopia, because everything in the movie always says Cherry Jones is a pretty hot chick and Michael Cumpsty is incredibly beautiful stallion !! The guy who plays the male secretary Clare Bloom is a thin bespectacled balding actor as sexy as chair and is the subject of two major passions will !! over-the-top, Mike Starr acts as the most incompetent, phoniest cop you've ever seen, deserves a place among the 10 most disgusting performances in recent film history. The saddest comment to see the excellent Claire Bloom and Zukova completely and insulting miscast wasted. At least, I hope that both stars had paid their bills back home (and then released their agents) with this flop. Not surprisingly, the acting prodigy Sukowa not returned to Germany after she saw that Hollywood is in store for her !! <br /> <br /> If you want to see how to make really bad movie with a very bad scenario frantic casting director, to learn this one - otherwise stay away !!! - 1/10
