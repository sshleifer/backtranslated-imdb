The film is quite intricate and absurd. The plot is terrible ... but on the positive side, the current is pretty good, with a few good screams and rants. Sharon Stone OK this time ... not even half as good as the original mind you. Murder is not as gory as the first, or is a shame. He was not an unpredictable mess all say that it's all the same. Sex pretty graphics while other times it is clear that it is a fake (they were fully clothed). Scenario weak most of the time, but the scene steb and disputes between Dr.Glass and Washburn are highlights. The plot twists several times, but the ending is terrible. Voltage is always constant with a huge spoon, "My God!". Chase sequences brilliantly directed, and arrows and impressive camera angles and bring a little class otherwise, the peak felt film. Sharon Stone a little old for this too. Bits, where we can see her breasts were, in the first delights. This time, they are too disgusting to describe. Movies him self, and on the average, but it's worth a go. Mainly because the movie really deserves a good buzz ... with the opening sequence is an event. Do not be critical, but if you liked the first - leave it. Nha destroy jogging. You'll be glad that you left the stone on stone.
