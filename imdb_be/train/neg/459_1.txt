I was looking for a cute, simple comedy to pass the time, but the choice of the film turned out to be a huge mistake. <br /> <br /> I can not write a good thing about it. First, the script is stupid and not funny, relying on tired, recycled jokes and farting turtle for a laugh. In my book, this is not funny, it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Low budget "effects" (if I can even call their effects) with a horrible cinema. In many places, it feels almost like an indie film shot without money. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I feel sorry for the actors. There is Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards, who are desperate for money that they have agreed to take part in this? (Looking at their recent filmography, it would seem so.) In spite of the clothes, Pamela is showing its age and in general, they do not come across as sexy, not to mention funny. <br /> <br /> This film is not even so bad that-is-fun category. It's just bad, as if all the participants were tired. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
