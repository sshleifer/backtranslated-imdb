Not sure why this film seems to have received such rave reviews. <br /> <br /> While viewing the "explosion" for one night on TV, I discovered that he misses nonsensical, random plot that was what is happening on the screen. The entire film, seems to be nothing more than an exercise in pointless artsy Fartsy-indulgence on the part of the director. The fact that the director / writer goes by one name moniker only reinforces this feeling of pretentiousness. <br /> <br /> Those who are interested in the indie film would have been better to look for something better written, and dare I say it, more interesting than a waste of time.
