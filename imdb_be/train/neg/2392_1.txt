In fact, we have seen it twice in the theater, because we could not believe how bad it was for the first time. Maybe we missed something ... no, what is missing has been missed since the beginning of pre-production. I actually went back to the novel Robbin, to see if I could find the problem, and I found that I thought it was funny and fun back in the day now, just so disconnected and fuzzy-headed garbage. <br /> <br /> Thus, the original problem of the film decided to do it at all, and the rest of the train accident has progressed from there. Absolutely nothing works - not a blessed thing. Some beautiful appearance photograph gets forced by randomly placing the camera in the interior shots. All the actors look at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickinson look positively killed - for Rain Phoenix, which gives the impression that she knows too, to see how badly her performance is actually, except. Dialogue is one long, unwavering crawl. Scenes are meaningless from the second to the second, and there is no communication between them. Yet, the film stumbles blindly, making sure that it says something profound <br /> <br /> It's too bad to even be funny. it's just a meal. Van Sant has made other films good to great, I urge you to see, and I'm happy that he survived (and seems to have learned from) this disorder.
