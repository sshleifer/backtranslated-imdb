Quote Oedpius Rex, because it is a tragedy that this movie was even made !!! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films I have ever seen! I am in no way Uwe Boll hater, like most people on the IMDb sense of humor! <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll films as email and Tunnel Rats is a funny bad, and therefore interesting. But honestly, this film was just awful. I hated it so much that I would give it a rating of zero stars if I could. History simply shit! He spends four-fifths of the film is building plot, and then they have a middle, which only scenes Grizzly awful tasteless made a killing! Finally, finish it with Â«Villan wins ending", which is quite acceptable, but, of course, it could be more tasteful than this! <br /> <br /> I am not against Uwe Boll (as I mentioned earlier), nor I against violent movies! I ** king love movies hard! I loved Saw movies, movie Hostel, Tokyo Gore Police, New York Ripper, 28 films, Dog Soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, Last House on the Left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, every Tarantino movie, every Peckinpah, even Cannibal f ** king Holocaust! But this! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> It was just hard, sadistic and perverted! And look at the movies I just listed! If I loved Cannibal Holocaust, and they do not, then it must be bad! Uwe, do not go all the dark again! You're funny, if you are the light of the heart, as well as Ed Wood. It was just a horrible experience! I felt terrible all over after watching this! <br /> <br /> Do not look !!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!!!
