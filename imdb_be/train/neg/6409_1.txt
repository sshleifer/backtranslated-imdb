I just saw this movie last night ... I can not believe the reviews on this site. Those who give it one star must be Buffy fanatics. Well, I'm Buffy fan of the first order, but I know bullshit when I see it. At each level, this film is terrible. Technically, most of the time you do not know where you are in this film, even within the same scene, it jumps the POV, like crazy for no reason. A lot of logic in general in cinematic terms. Emotionally cold for dark and trying to be a psychological thriller, if it's just confusing. Throwing unpleasant perspective red neck in the film is a cheap way to pass the "atmosphere". I ran out of patience with him for a long time until the last act, but I had too much fun with my friends doing MST3K riff to turn it off. After leaving Buffy ', SMG had 2 successful films, even if the listing of "Scooby-Doo" on your resume can count. Gellar is a good actress, but she (or its agent) sure can not find the vehicle for her. And Mr Shephard, if you are having trouble paying your mortgage, I'll send you a few dollars, if you promise not to appear in a movie like this again! (In addition, the estate of Patsy Cline should sue for libel!)
