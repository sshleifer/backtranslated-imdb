This film is a twisted nonsense film set in Japan about a dysfunctional family that eventually with surprising violent visitor who just sits back and watches 4 family members at their worst. Nothing is sacred in this film, with the sex drugs and violence are stretched to this limit, I am surprised that passed the censors. <br /> <br /> In general, I think that it will apply only to those whom we should not be encouraging, not any supposed leitmotif goes for the rest of us to consider. The film, which panders to the worst elements in society, and in any case of an injury ... the frustration of a man who made a sublime dead or alive, and audition movies.
