Most recently, I was enthusiastic and ahead of the movie so much that I almost did not see it. Well, just saw it today, a rating of 5.8 is understandable. I think that if you expect something so that it becomes an acute need, is not worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course, 2 The Hills Have Eyes has its moments. It has a very cool and well-developed storyline that connects well with the very real product, but it is so surrendered themselves that it becomes so difficult to follow. And if it were not for the production of Wes Craven on this film, it would not have anything to do with the original remake. <br /> <br /> But all this makes you go, "That should be horrified or COMEDY?" because there are a lot of funny, jumping randomly spaced points liners and silly (IE «There's hand sh ** e!" or " ! you motherfu ** er I'll kill you all damn son of b ** tches ») and action (God does not even remind me how bad it was <br /> <br /> storyline:!.! (this part contains spoilers beware), the film begins with a woman giving birth to a mutant baby (oh-la-la!), and then the screen darkens the film is heading, and monologue. then we go to the office, where random rank is a veteran of the war dummies. We believe that it is for this scholar, tracking people seek mutant. checkbox to keep a track of audio channels No one dies! Then set the tone opening, you would expect more. <br /> < br /> Then we go to the same team of military training of recruits in Baghdad. As captain parade their "good work of stupidity", their last day of training in New Mexico, in the desert, where the family stayed in the past THHE BECA use them stuck. While in the process of learning, in the end, things go wrong, people die, and ... I need to tell you more? Because now I have the attention span of goldfish just I force myself to sit here and type this. <br /> <br /> The fact is, what happened to THHE2, it just dosen't work. Many are retrospective, and the ending is not very safe ... but with a twist! Foolish one, that is. I'm pretty sure that the Ultra Cut super Directors with a holographic cover and a ticket for The Hills Have Eyes 3 will be presented all his alternative endings, but at the moment, I'm not sure if I care. <br /> <br /> So, by all means, if you liked the first THHE so it's almost a sin not to see it, then by all means, see it. But if even then, to avoid at all costs. It's for your own good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
