This film is really showing its age. Imprint I saw was terrible because of age, but it is possible that there are better prints there. However, this is not the main problem with the film. The problem was that, although the film was made in 1933, it was essentially a silent film with only pressing dialogue scattered (only a few sentences) in the film in an amateur fashion. Sometimes the characters have been turned back or they spoke with their hands on their faces - all in a pathetic attempt to obscure his lips and "cleaverly" to hide the fact that the movie was dubbed (?). Well, it is true that this Czech film would have to be duplicated in many languages, but to do so in a way, it was really stupid and obvious. He just looked cheap. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is low budget and looked silly. It's really a shame, though, because there was a grain of a good story - a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay, and / or has no interest in women. But in the 21st century, few people really willing to sit through this archaic mess. Even with a few glimpses of naked (and somewhat stocky) Hedy Lamarr, it is not worth all the hype that accompanied the film when it debuted. Even before the 1933 standards, this film was poorly made sackcloth. About the only interesting thing about the film to see how different Lamarr appeared in 1933 in comparison with the glamorous Hollywood fashion created when she came to America - it looks like two completely different people <br /> <br /> It is. partial view and technically worse than the film, I do not see how he got such rave reviews. For some technical problems, the film can not estimate 10 or something close to it.
