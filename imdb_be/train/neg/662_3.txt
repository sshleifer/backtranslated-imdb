and make a good horror film. It is as a writer has never seen a horror movie before, and did not understand every single thing he wrote was formulaic and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in films like "The Scream" and "Scary Movie." <br /> <br /> between terrible bit is the most trivial and boring dialogue ever written. Stupid "we're going to prom" garbage. I wanted to claw my ears. To be honest, «The Hills» has the best dialogue. <br /> <br /> There really was no need to make this film. The leading lady is not interested, and I kept thinking «Her? Really? Guy obsessed with her? Really? »<br /> <br /> All of the characters act in stupid ways, including the police. (Cover 2 teams in! Front and back! Not a sleepy policeman sitting in his car with the window rolled down his throat just waiting to be cut.) <br /> <br /> A serial killer only swans on killing everyone he He wants, without the slightest problem. Many victims of the resistance (or door). No one has any protection or the least idea of ​​fighting back (or turning the security lock on the hotel room door). People as mentally retarded sheep. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you Gore fan, you will be disappointed too. All murders are stored offscreen and - ahem - tasteful. (Yes bang it for you!) <br /> <br /> None of the murders is not a little interesting. Most of the time they have already occurred by the time we learn. <br /> <br /> The only cliché missing was a cat that always appears like that movie. "Oh! Keys You scared me, I thought you - killer! AIIEEEE »<br /> <br /> And then at the end, when it came time for the killer to die - well, let's just say that this is the easiest and most obvious choice. Snoring. <br /> <br /> The audience mock and speak to the screen throughout. He was too stupid to believe in is not really scary enough. Nha encourage this kind of lazy filmmaking <br /> <br /> (Oh, and by the way -... Sun wreath of prom king or queen tiara many many a bucket of blood). <, Br /> <br /> So save money and rent "of Carrie" or "Friday the 13th" or "Halloween" or "Scream" or «Scary Movie» (any of them) to get a good panic from some original twists.
