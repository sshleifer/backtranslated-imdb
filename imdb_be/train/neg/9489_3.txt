In theory, the films should be a form of entertainment. While this eliminates the documentaries and other experimental forms of film production; most of the films, especially genre films must not only say that this story or message, they need to entertain your audience in some way. All this just to say that in my opinion is not a bad movie film with low production or low-budget, one bad film, it's boring. <br /> <br /> «Hellborn» or "caches Damned», as we know, in the US, it's a bad film, simply because it just is not involving, and irremediably sad and tedious. While he has a very good room, it is only weakly developed, and mediocre action will not change the situation for the better. On the other hand the film probably would have been a fine or even a classic B-movie, but here it is just a bad attempt at a movie. <br /> <br /> Director Philip J. Jones tells the story of James Bishop (Matt Stasi), a young psychiatry resident who just got my dream job in a psychiatric hospital St. Andrew; but the old shelter, seems to hide a secret. After the mysterious death of some patients and persistent rumors of satanic practices, James decides to find out what was going on; only to find the suspiciousness of his boss, Dr. McCort (Bruce Payne), who believes that the bishop is going like crazy as his patients. <br /> <br /> While the premise is quite interesting, the implementation leaves much to be desired movie. In an attempt to make a supernatural psychological thriller, Jones is on track and road and makes the film, filled with every cliché of the genre. Of course, there are a lot of great movies that are also filled with clichés; but «Hellborn» every one is lost and converted into a cheap jump fright to keep things moving, resulting in dull and predictable storyline. <br /> <br /> To act fairly mediocre, for the most part, with one big exception: Bruce Payne gives an idea of ​​first-class, which makes the appearance of a movie unworthy of such good acting. Matt Stasi very weak, as the protagonist and the other actors make appearances forget <br /> <br /> Despite all these shortcomings, one thing should be written on the «Hellborn». he has a visual appearance is very good for the budget, and is very similar to the modern day mnogobyuzhetnogo Hollywod «horrors» production. Furthermore, makeup and prosthetics made very nice and construction for the base of the antagonist sufficiently good. Unfortunately, the rest of the horrible special effects and outdated, which makes a huge contrast with the makeup and prosthetics. <br /> <br /> «Hellborn» is a film with a few good things, superior to his serious shortcomings with terrible results. Hardcore horror or b-movie fans may be interested in his room, but it's a sad and tiresome experience. 3/10
