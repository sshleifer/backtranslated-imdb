One of the earliest films Frances Farmer; 22, it is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby in a great voice, but the songs are not in his power. March Raya and Bob Burns interesting, but their comedy is probably greatest in his time, in fact commonplace today. Roy Rogers also appears- in singing roles. In my opinion, only worth watching if you're a fan of Frances Farmer, and perhaps a fan of Bing Crosby.
