Psycho kills college students, can the new teacher to stop the madness? <br /> <br /> Believe me, you will not care. <br /> <br /> With a name like Splatter University, one would conclude immediately that this film is simply not high art. But worst of all, Splatter University did not even qualify for a fun garbage. Splatter U is so badly done - history is meaningless characters thrown Business cards, and the entire film lacks any essence of imagination. Needless to say, there is no voltage or the atmosphere or scares. This is nonsense not even have the guts to throw any nudity (the cheapest thrill all). So everything around it endlessly spoiled slasher does not offer anything in the way of entertainment (even a cheap laugh), but simply becomes complete sadness. Bottom of the barrel people - even die hard supporters Slasher want to think twice before watching, let alone pay for this movie <br /> <br /> bombs ****.
