I sat through almost one episode of the series, and just could not anymore. She felt as if I was watching dozens of episodes already, and then it hit me ..... There's nothing new! I heard this joke on the Seinfeld, I saw someone fall like that one, Happy Days episode was almost the same story, ect. None of the actors are not interested here either! Some of them were good at other exhibitions (not here), while others are new, they would never have gone to the profession. Avoid this bitch!
