Let's see, where to start ... bad acting; I'm not sure if I'd even call it that, it's more along the lines of the script, not effort to read. Actors do not even seem to be at their side, and seemed quite lifeless and lethargic. Of course, there was a scene or two with nudity, but it could not save this film from his lifeless characters. <br /> <br /> In order to call the protagonist rapper it is an insult to the people who actually do. lyrics had no rhythm or flow, and seemed to be more along the lines of meaningless tirade. <br /> <br /> budget? Perhaps this film even have a budget? It seemed that they used less money than I've seen in a home shot a YouTube video. Poor lighting, props, poor post production sound. Bad special effects, if you want to go so far as to call them so. History would be nice if people actually seemed interested in his case, but there was no life in this film; I do not care who sent him. <br /> <br /> I've seen some really bad clicks in the last year, and this is certainly one at the bottom. Do not waste your time, or you'll be wishing you were listening to this unbiased review. Check the ratings, you will see 1-x ahead quickly whipped 10 from almost nothing in between. I wish I would have looked a little closer before you spend your time. That suck-fest!
