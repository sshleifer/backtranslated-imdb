I wonder who is and more importantly, why the decision to name Richard Attenborough send very special sensation to hit Broadway in many years? He is the director of the Academy Awards. Yes, he won the Ghandi moron! Jeremy Irons is the Academy award-winning actor, you want to see how he plays Rocky Balboa? He has experience with musicals. Really? "Oh, what a lovely war" have you forgotten? To answer your question, yes! The film is a disappointment, clear and simple. Nha ounce of live energy has experienced severe impartiality of the proceedings. Each character danced beautifully, they were adorable, but their projection was theatrical. I do not feel anything. But when I saw him on the stage, I felt everything. The film had to be thrown with the stars, the unknown aliens, but stars with significant memorable face even the most invisible group. Great actors who could dance beautifully. Well, Michael Douglas was in it. However, I forgot that I was absolutely not the case, and you're absolutely right. Nothing like a musical by Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas.
