I think it's pretty safe to say that this is the worst movie ever made, when I saw the trailer on TV, I knew right from the other one, it would be a piece of ****, and it would be better to avoid it, but I have some way involved in seeing it some friends, I went to the movies with low expectations, but I was hoping that there will be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during the film. The so-called "joke" in this film brings a shiver to the face, they are mostly made up of people who take blows to the face and balls, child looking strangely and acting like a horny gangsta and typical racial jokes we see so often in today's trash comedies. The film is obvious, and the story is not only impossible to believe, but also predictable and boring. Symbols are very annoying and highly stereotypical. I do not want to see this movie **** again, I would prefer a bullet in the leg than be subjected to this part fuckwood ever. If someone I see, said they liked it, I physically hit them in the face
