Revenge is one of my favorite themes in the film. Moreso, Â«the futility of revenge" is one of my favorite themes in the film. Seeing irreversibly Noe (2002), I was expecting even more important expression of this theme. Instead, this film is a weak half-hearted attempts that did not express anything other than a lack of condemnation of the film and attention. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The end of the scene, gratuitous male-on-male rape / torture scenes come across as nothing less than a woman revenge fantasy rape. However, the film did not even see to it. Instead, drawn scene (which is much higher than the rigidity of the original rapeseed in the extent to which he was a graphic and to whom he was ritualized) topped with a shot Dawson faces in terms of either regret or "It is useless" t fix anything "and rape continues its abuser heard in the background. <br /> <br /> My problem with the scene is not a shock, but a confusion as to whether there was such a graphic scene trying to convey to the audience. I mean, we feel bad for the rapist? Do we rejoice in retaliation, Dawson? Are we disgusted by the cruelty of it all? Do we feel the time Dawson clarity of regret? In addition to this omission, the film really kind of awkward walking with more style than substance. Character thin, uniform dialogue etc. <br /> <br /> I usually try to take movies on their own terms, but the trigger does not really seem to know what it was. Thumbs down.
