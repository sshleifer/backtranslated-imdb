Great concept gone wrong. Bad action, even worse letters .... After watching the first two episodes, I wondered why he had never done it in two seasons. Symbols forget writing in poverty, sets a CI. The special effects are just bored - so much better than it was done in the same time period - where is the money going to this? The first episode starts wondering what is going downhill fast - the commandment of the show just stupid. Do not get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Sci-Fi & "freak" - but the show just does not cut it. As I said in the beginning, I was really surprised that I did it in two seasons - much better than it was canceled after only one season (Jake 2.0, for example). This show was just plain bad.
