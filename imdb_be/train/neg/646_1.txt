I saw this film by chance, and this film was an accident ... well, it was a must. Blondes prosecuted, the villain is disappearing getting from one place to another within a minute then disappear and reappear, hiding.he was'nt even a super hero, so I do not know how he it.he could'nt scare the cat and it's not hard to do. <br /> <br /> old "bathroom mirror" just not terribly more on the fact it is no longer a scary year ago. you had the police on the trail of the villain, another clich√© (played by Idris Elba with a very convincing American accent, he is from London) director did'nt have a clue and made a movie full of cliches and do in "a terrible step" that was COMEDY look scary. pity!
