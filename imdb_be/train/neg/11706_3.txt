Remarque novel. Cast that looks great on paper. The left wing of refugees struggling to stay in Paris between the wars. Gestapo officer under cover. <br /> <br /> Sorry NO synergy here. Bits and pieces of stick entirely. <br /> <br /> The stories of the refugees left in France should not be is boring. Read a biography of Arthur Koestler «Scum of the Earth" (if you can find it). Or terrible "Dialogue with death» (Ditto). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the only interest in this film lies in some of the random parts. <br /> <br /> Conclusion spend a lot of time drinking Calvados, Normandy apple brandy. I welcome any tips to keep Calvados gap itself. This, of course, made this film is faster appear. But, according to the film, it is sold only in the low-cost, low-class sedans. Vive Le Parisien Tabac! That's what I say. Links to intoxicating liquors do abound here; that would seem to be a concern of the writers. <br /> <br /> I like films set in France, because it can be a fun waiting for the inevitable announcement of full-length alcohol floated on the wall in the background. I was not disappointed. This time it was for Byrrh, a very unusual choice. This film will evaluate 10 if only we were judging him to clarify his drinking frescoes. <br /> <br /> indifferent film score is by Louis Gruenberg. Grunberg is best known - if you can call it that - of his opera "The Emperor Jones", based on O'Neill's plays. It premièred at about the same time as the film version starring Paul Robeson. Opera survives today in a record or two on Tibbett. It should surface again quickly, though; they run out of potentially marketable opera revive. <br /> <br Opera /> topic seems appropriate to mention here, as Charles Boyer character works under his pseudonym "Czech." Two of them are "Wozzeck" and "Gunther", both excellent role in German opera. It's just a coincidence? <br /> <br /> The name dropping just seems to be part of this film. Pay attention to what they call "up Himmelstoss» by phone. Himmelstoss case, one of the main characters before Remarque "All Quiet on the Western Front» <br /> <br /> Well, jokes, everything is in place. I think that there was no time to develop any drama.
