This film really has no beginning and no end. And it's really quite incredible. Mary-K and Ashley must have interns working in the room to send the Italian fashion company. But, for some reason, they are placed in a 5-star hotel (conveniently located across the street from the Colosseum), and all other trainees, they work the same normal pattern, looking like they are. One thing that I found, obviously, in this film, so that one of the twins does not end with the guy. I believe they were trying to turn their ordinary plot a bit. Nice try.
