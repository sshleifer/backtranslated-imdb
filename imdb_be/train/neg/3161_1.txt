Most of the «Over Her Dead Body» so painfully unfunny that I actually fidgeting in a chair with embarrassment for the actors. <br /> <br /> Eva Longoria proves that she can not carry a movie in this terrible romantic comedies, and, moreover, that it is not really even a comedy any time. She grating and annoying, like a ghost that comes back to earth to keep a roll of mental love her widowed husband. Fiance plays Paul Rudd, sentimental and unsightly, while playing the mental Lake Bell, resulting in a film all the energy he has anemia. I felt most sorry for Bella, as she seems to have some comic ability and overtime in an attempt to make the material work. Unfortunately, it is against an insurmountable task to do any movie that shows Biggs tolerable, and it is slowed down with the other actors, Leo DiCaprio at the end of "Titanic." <br /> <br /> «Over Her Dead Body» really pi ** ed me, because of my laziness and the total lack of effort. I started thinking about all the interesting projects that can not get financing because huge amounts of money now being sent into the soft shit like this. Seriously, this is Hollywood thinks films like this is good enough? How stupid do they really think that the movie going public? <br /> <br /> Class: F
