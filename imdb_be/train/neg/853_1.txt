Well, to be honest, I do not understand why everyone thinks it's so cool. It's really not. There were two good things that came out of the film version 1. Jack, it was very good, I tilt my hat to him. Performance 2. Denis, he was good. There is no other, that it was pretty stupid. And that was Stanley Kubrick thinks Shelly development as a Wendy? It was so bad. It looked the same every time she got scared. The problem with this film was the ending. I would have more respect for him when Kubrick would have ended differently. Moreover, the entire film was just stupid. The problem of the film is that the book was much better. So I do not see the movie read the book, and you'll be much better. 3/10.
