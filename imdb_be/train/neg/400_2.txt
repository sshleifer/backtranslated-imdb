I rarely do these comments, but I felt obliged to spare the other pain I endured in watching this film. It's so silly and implausible as a total history and the details that you simply can not suspend disbelief. The problem starts early, when you see a government researcher tools around in a new Porsche and the dining room with his team in the restaraunt, which looks like a castle, with a view of the Capitol in Washington, DC, a life state salary? Hah! It only gets worse. Toward the end, when the poor guy starts to kill the good guy, the last group to act so stupid that you want to die to cleanse the gene pool. The special effects are very good - the money from any manufacturer can buy - and leading actors were great in other films, but the script and direction are idiotic. Many people have been wondering if there is a deliberate exploration of the previous ones, the vestibular dumb films of Paul Verhoeven (actress, Starship Troopers), but this film is to stop wondering. He's just bad.
