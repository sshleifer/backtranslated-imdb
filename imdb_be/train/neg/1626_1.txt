The film appeared on a local TV station here in South Africa in recent years, and I thought I'd warn you, even those who like to watch bad movies B-class (which I do), it's not even funny. The plot concerns a pair of house in the country comes from. Some strangers are and .... The problem is that most of the film, apparently shot in the early seventies, a member of the extreme wide shots of people who are in real time and very slowly, from A to B. this makes the film tedious in the extreme and the expected blood and gore bribery simply never happen. I really wonder - how many people actually watched it from beginning to end?
