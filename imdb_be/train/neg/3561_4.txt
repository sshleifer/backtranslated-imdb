Stephen King adaptation (according to the scenario of the King), in which a young family newcomers in rural Maine, learn about pet cemetery is close to their home. Father (Dale Midkiff), finds out about the burial MicMac beyond the pet cemetery, which has the authority to Sunday -. Only, there is not quite back certainly nothing buried RIGHT <br /> <br /> Below average "horror" picture begins clumsy, offensive and inept, and continues that way for some time, with the absolute worst element is useless performance in Midkiff. It gets a little better towards the end, with a truly disturbing ending. In fact, the whole movie is really worried, so I can not completely close it - at least there is something to make it memorable. Decent support performances Fred Gwynne, as the wise old age neighbor, and Brad Greenquist, how disfigured the spirit of Victor Pascow not enough to really redeem the film. <br /> <br /> The King has his usual cameo as a minister. <, Br /> <br /> Following the continuation and director Mary Lambert (it's not surprising that she did not have any work main movie, huh?). <br /> <br /> 4/10
