Maybe it's dubbing, or maybe it's the endless scenes of people who scream, moan or another carrier, but I found the Europa 51 one of the most congested (and so annoying) films I've ever seen. The film begins promisingly, if familiarity, and her mother Ingrid Bergman too busy to spend time with her son, a spoiled child (Sandro Franchina). While mom and dad (BLAND Alexander Knox) ​​will delight your guests at a dinner party, a boy trying to kill himself, setting in motion a life-changing series of events that are Bergman spend time soul empathy for the poor and needy. Inspired by the Communist newspaper editor Andrea (Ettore Giannini), soon she spends more time with depressed than she does with her husband, who soon closes it in an insane asylum for their troubles. Bergman plays a sacred role hilt, repeating her 1948 role of Joan of Arc, and Rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and shooting its best effect. Unfortunately, the scenario drives his point home with a clumsy subtlety, Andrea and mother turns reciting Marxist and Christian platitudes. Before the final break soaked scene, I had more than my fill of these tiresome characters. A real step down for Rossellini as he walked away from neorealism and then took the mythical and mystical themes 1950 Flowers of St. Francis.
