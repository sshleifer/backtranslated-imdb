The subject, in spite of this amateur exhibitionist film - or effort on one thing - that just an interesting and bold, as the composition of the student's book moody high school full of death "Poetry." Of course, this will prevent the audience, who are obsessed in the way, but success will come from himself, and not the director. In order to really get under someone's skin requires sensitivity, discipline, technique and talent, as well as eye and ear. The film does contain a single image, the flags as a fixed (and also used in the case of video), but without the development leading towards or away from it. If the director had his eyes, he would see it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie - that is, the film.
