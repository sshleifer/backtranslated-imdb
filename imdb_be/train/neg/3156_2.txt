I just want to make one thing I love, cleaning Vartan! But this film really lets it down. His actions are still great, he is still as charming as ever, and it still looks great. But the film itself is a nonsense! Henstridge, I'm sorry to say this, comes a little brave ... you constantly waiting for her to run away with her best friend, who own sub-plot is a little strange. My family and I (who sat and watched a movie with me) were also postponed the soundtrack to the film; Sometimes music is just not consistent with what is happening in the scene. However, even this is not the worst aspect of what I found to be very disappointing film. I could forgive the leading lady butch-ness, I could forgive the bizarre characters who have been thrown into the mix, and I could forgive a poor choice of musical accompaniment, but the choice of which was to cut his entire middle part of the movie and skip straight to the end ??? The ending, obviously, it was planned from the beginning, but as he gets there remains untold. If you're a fan Vartan miss this film: buy a poster instead.
