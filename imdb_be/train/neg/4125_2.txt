Holy shit! What a terrible, terrible Spanish thriller! I've had it for about four years and finally started it the other night. I watched for an hour or so before going to bed. I was very intrigued by it all. I finished it last night and could not believe it when I stopped him at night. Literally, I stopped him in the second film went all the way down. <br /> <br /> As I said, I was very intrigued and wondering where this mystery is going on, but stopped him right if Simon receives a package in the bar. I picked up when he opens the package to reveal a laser pistol, and then plays a "threatening" laser tag game. Phew! Then a great show that all this is a terrorist plot role botany games. Phew! You can tell, the Spanish industry has been identified behind the director Mateo Gil (co-author of two big hits in previous Amen√°bar). There is a great result and a great photo. But this scenario reeks of stupidity. As someone who has spent the last 40 minutes with a straight face is beyond me.
