This film is poor trash. He has a terrible taste, and pedestrian and unconvincing in the script, but is supposed to be based on real events - that do not add much of anything, but make it more frustration. The direction is not very well done as scenes and dialogue out of place. Not sure Robin Williams saw this character or history. To start, Williams is not conclusive, as a gay man in relation to the collapse and is not in itself an interesting relationship. To make matters worse, his character is forced to an ugly story of a pedophile, which is the base, and has no place in a printing device. Do you have old Rory Culkin tasteless spouting «d_ck_smker» - in a good Fun-, which is annoying enough, then laughed up the character of Williams. Finally, you must Sandra Oh, like a guardian angel Councilor Williams and thrown in explaining the whole fiasco to end. Toni Collette character is just annoying and a statement of its 6th Sense perform the worst direction. Very Miss-state.
