Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante Broadway show held for many years, but the evidence of his power and charisma is lost in the film version, which is likely, that the consequence of the choice of the director (Richard Attenborough, as far as possible from the B-way, as you could get) and lead actor (Michael Douglas, who plays the director-choreographer, as a slimy corporate lawyer). Fine story about a grueling audition for a Broadway show, which turns into a therapy session for the actor-dancer-Pevtsova pushed directly to us, with loud, Brassy talents playing on the rafters. Nothing modulate or thin, especially ludicrous story about former dancer returns to the theater, and butting heads with the old flame Douglas. Excessive thirst for applicants filled with promise and suffering, but their personal stories about longing a bit awkward; This, combined with sluggish pacing Attenborough spell disaster, and even now famous songs do not break through the artificial packaging. * 1/2 ****
