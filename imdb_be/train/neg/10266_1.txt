First observed 2004/07/11 - 1 out of 10 (the Dir-John Keeyes): Over-top rehash of the 70-ies was supposed horrors, on Friday 13th (versions 1 through any ??). I can not think of anything redeeming here, except for (or can I think of anything?) ?? The story revolves around a bunch of stupid people who listen to the radio one year after some of the children were donated in the forest as a "tribute" to this alleged. But, lo and behold, one of stupid people have a connection to the actual event, because her sister was one of those killed (again, how stupid is that it can even be a part of it). Guess what? The killer is at it again and we tipped from the start who he is (because there is any mystery at all). And besides all this, where are the "cops" and why not someone called them. I can not believe that this film was funded by someone else did. One would think that now the American people will judge slightly higher, at least in their movie-going experience, but not so this filmmaker.
