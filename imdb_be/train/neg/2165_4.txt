This film was a rather strange impression on the viewer. The film is obviously based on the game. Now I am sure that everyone in this film works just fine in the game, but in the movie it just does not feel very interesting enough to watch. The film is too "unnatural," and they did not even bother to change some of the dialog box to make it more suitable for the film. Instead, what is presented is now quite literally re-filming stage games, with more set-top characters and dialogue. Because of all this, the story does not really work, and the film becomes almost full bore- outdated and viewing experience. <br /> <br /> It will take some time before you realize that it's a comedy you watch. At first you think it a drama, you see, with bizarre characters in it, but as the film progresses, you will notice that the film is more than a tragicomedy that leans more to do comedy genre, not the drama genre. <, Br /> <br /> character and dialogue do the things that make this film bizarre and over-the-top one, which sometimes do become unwatchable. Of course, the actors are great; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among others, but they do not actually elevate the film to the level of "watchable enough". <br /> <br /> The story feels completely disoriented. Basicaly story about anything and just basically focused on the brother / sister of the characters played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what exactly is this story even about? The film feels pointless and outdated, which has very little to offer. As I have said; I believe that this story is good and interesting to look at the scene, but the film is really out of place and simply does not work. <br /> <br /> Editing simply awful and again, and it becomes even funny bad in a certain sequence. <br /> <br /> It was further expected from the director J. Lee Thompson, who obviously did a much better movie than it failed rather stage-game translated to the screen project. <br /> <br /> In fact, not worth your time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
