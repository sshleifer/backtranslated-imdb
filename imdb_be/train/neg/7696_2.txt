So, nonsense! I just watch, and I still have a bad taste in the mouth. Too many colors, too many unnecessary "add-ons" to the stories, too many silly characters (I guess they wanted to make a comic, but I just wanted to cry) ... too much. It is a shame to spoil one of the divine stories of the "Thousand and One Nights", as it is. Childish, naive (as in a bad way), and with a lot of magical breaking mistakes, I do not think it can keep a child from five to ten more minutes. Princess is excellent, but it should be Bezyazykov because the actress did not know how to fulfill their role. The rest of the cast is even worse ... our "bad guy" is very bad. It's a shame that the "nice guy" is not the best. The only light in the darkness, of course, David Carradine, who is, unfortunately, far down below the level of this, but at least keep it actor / "fighter" skills top. I am still sorry to see it in things like this, but I'm glad that I had something to look into the whole charade, so thank you David. Only, just for him, I give it 2 stars in this fiasco ... I would give more for it, but it will increase the final score to the film. The rest is so bad, that I might be like in the classroom, but there are no class lover, the one here, and I think that would be too much.
