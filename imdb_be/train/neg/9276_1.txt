It's really pathetic film. However, the original (un) holy trinity governed by the law of diminishing returns with the third, «The Final Conflict» degenerates into ridiculous south section about halfway through the film, seems only to provide the necessary knowingly confusing deaths that were now becoming all meaning the existence of "Omen" series. But then stick the arrogant TV movie (beware shoppers box Omen set on DVD - do not be fooled ratio widescreen transmission, it was strictly small screen material) on the rear part of the series, in general, small demonic chillers unforgivable, in particular, it approved as it was, exec.producer and producer of the first three films Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. I would give-away of the plot, there is, apart from the usual scenes of death (hopelessly toned down for the TV senses) and some of the worst I've seen action. All involved in this project to supply the people should be ashamed of this parody ever made it to the screen, not to mention by masquerading under the name of Omen. If one person is convinced my review to avoid this confusion, I'll feel better.
