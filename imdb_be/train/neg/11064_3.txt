Well, it is difficult to add a comment after reading what is already here, but I feel like I should say something. I was not exactly looking for "in splatterfestÂ», as someone puts it, or even "blood and guts / gore." I have respect for the victims' relatives, although I really felt filmaker DID NOT. -They were nameless, faceless and meaningless. Just vessel Dahmers sexual antics. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with views of morbid curiosity that makes me think: "What makes a man a serial killer as well as interesting feature stories about Dahmer, of which I know very few people here seem to think?. that the film should not cover events in the history of IE .. Dahmer his story of what happened when he was caught, the consequences, and so on, but it's important! you see, I think, if you're an American, you will know it all. We do not live in America. in order to tell the story of such a man as he obviously was, etc. trabue, at least some of the stories and real events say / shown. This does not mean that the blood and guts, there are ways of showing the terrible things in the film within the meaning of, or reasonable pictures without the gore. I do not touching some of what he has done (I learned more about it read the comments of users on this site!) The film felt empty. As with very little substance. I would like to know if there is a film about real Dahmer because his lack of direction, very slowly, which never changes, Strange way homosexuality and very unfortunate absence of any attempt ending, this film is bad. I would not recommend to anyone that they spend the time it takes to watch it. Definition 1 of 10 (for action!)
