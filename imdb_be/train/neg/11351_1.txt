With massive advertising is incident on Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. and the same labor, my son was bugging us to see it. Between the DVD and the theater, I have seen almost everything so far from outstanding (Incredibles, Shrek) is really bad (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But it was easily the worst film I've ever seen, children or no children. It was "when it is nonsense to go to the end?" This experience? Well, it is designed for young children (or should be - it is an insult to the intellect of those greater than 3), but I've never seen something so predictable, repetitive, and moves slowly. Then, when you finally tired, but relieved that it was over, there's this bizarre thing in the end, what do you think it is setup for a joke, but no one - this is serious, although it is difficult to say that they are trying to to achieve. The effects of 3-D ... yes, if you've never seen them ViewMaster not a big deal, otherwise (if you look at the screen without glasses, it seems to be the same process). Even my son is bored through. Both my wife and I looked at each other and said 'wow' at the end. Poor in all respects.
