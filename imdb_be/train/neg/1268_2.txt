What condescending movie! Located in Los Angeles, center of the universe from the POV of Hollywood filmmakers, the film tries to be profound social commentary on contemporary American angst. <br /> <br /> Stereotypes, ingratiating characters widely different socio-economic backgrounds cross paths in their ordinary, everyday life. The plot is clumsy and haphazard. Many unimaginative plot contrivances keep the film going, as passed by the shooting, an abandoned child left in the weeds, a gang of thugs to intimidate the lawyer, the guy flying in the night sky above the city, the child in summer camp. <br /> <br /> and all these events, the one constant in generous portions sociological "ideas" grafted through dialogue, as the characters are synchronize their life experiences. One character says to another: "If you sit on the edge of this thing (the Grand Canyon), you understand that this is a joke, we are people ... they rock laugh at me, I can say, I and my concern is a real sense of humor in the Grand Canyon "<br /> <br /> and another character pontificate on the meaning of all this :." there is a chasm in the country, constantly expanding the gap between people who have things and people, Don "t there ... it's like this big hole opened in the ground, as big as the Grand Canyon ... and that come pouring out of this eruption of rage ... and creates violence and fury ... ". <br /> <br /> In addition terribly unnatural and forced dialogue, except for small, bland characters, except dull story, the story is a painfully slow pace. Responsibilities annoying and superficial. tone of the film is self-satisfied and complacent, in contempt of the script for the audience. <br /> <br /> It was the film project has been approved by Hollywood suits who think themselves omnipotent guru, looking down from a height. They think that their film will be a strange discovery unpretentious for us unlearned film buffs, wanting to know about the real meaning of the American social change.
