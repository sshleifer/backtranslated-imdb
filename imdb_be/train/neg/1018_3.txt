There is good reason, Edison went straight to video: it would be landed in theaters with a crumbling clatter. The film did not last long, and risky sad. Just a notch cattle (due to Freeman and Spacey, who apparently had a spare two weeks before their next films), the bad guys as funny and act as near non-existent, as the actions of Justin Timberlake. I hate to knock the guy, but soon he realizes that the priest is his forte, the better. <br /> <br /> The film is not so bad ... but mostly. I like the fact that LL Cool J received what appears to be a chance to become a leading man. He deserves it. And, unlike his fellow musician and co-star, he can act. Kevin Spacey is almost always pleasant, but (you can see him swallow several times as he chews the scenery), and Frimno has the ability to raise the film up to three stars (out of ten ... he's not so good). <, Br /> <br /> When all is said and done, the final error of the film is that it is the mundane and tedious piece of pseudo-action bullshit, he could not keep anyone awake. It is also not able to do any good to give a shit about any of the characters. In general, that's just boring. That being said, take it off, if you suffer from insomnia.
