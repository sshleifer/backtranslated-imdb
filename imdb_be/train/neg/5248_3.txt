If this should be the "last hope" for entertaining and complex actions of German cinema, and then not much left. <br /> <br /> «Die Sieger" trying to be sexy, bold and February, but it is nothing of this kind. Wooden symbols and stereotypes, and every time they do something unexpected (which is not too much) act against his nature. This makes it difficult - for me it is almost impossible - to follow them or even identify with them <br /> <br /> Most of all, I think the film is very bad throw .. There is not a single character, which I believe. Maybe, a senior officer in the Special Forces unit - but that's about it.
