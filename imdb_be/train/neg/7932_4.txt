Oh, my God! What a disappointment. I watched old Westerns on British television for decades, and I did not know that one of his show yesterday -. Most other Scott westerns come around every few years or so, and, as a rule, should look again <br /> <br /> the rich colors and outdoor sets were good, but that's all I can say about this film. I agree with most of the other negative comments already made. A few times I felt like turning it off, and finally I did, in the middle, something I hardly ever do. <br /> <br /> Scott seemed unusually oily charming girls, two of his assistants were so annoying and was a Mexican bandit guy. And I have a feeling that the military uniforms were 20 years or so is too modern, not that it bothered the creators of many other westerns. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's even better in the second half, but I could not have worked to wait and see.
