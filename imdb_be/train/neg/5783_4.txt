Ah, sex-and-gore film. It's too bad they do not make it more (if you live in Japan). But if they all turned out so that it is not so bad. <br /> <br /> The film is mainly composed of two distinct vampires picking "John" on a country road, taking them home to the castle, having crazy sex with them and then eat them (with the exception of the first victim, they hold around for no particular reason). Things are complicated when a woman in a campaign with her husband becomes too curious about this mysterious woman, she continues to see. It becomes a real ugly here. In the end, the two vampires in a bloodthirstiness that they eat everything in sight, and manage their captive sacrifices. Unfortunately, so much for this secret existence. <br /> <br /> The fact that the two vampires do not mind their clothes and fooling around with each other is the only thing this movie has going for it. Otherwise, this is a bloody, tangled mess (why they are so far from the grave of his castle?), Poor watchable only a few minutes Vampire games. The only thing I got out of that movie was these two bits of advice: shooting lesbians will not kill them; it will only turn them into vampires, and do not pick up prostitutes along a country road; they are likely to vampires. In addition, it is not really worth my time.
