Fire St. Elmo has nothing to do with life after university at all (for most of us ordinary people anyway). Why is this garbage even made? Who can really relate to this? Who lives like these characters? I really feel sorry for the actors to deal with such a terrible scenario. There are some talented young actors in this "film" which did a good job elsewhere. It must have just one point joke with them on the set. <br /> <br /> I actually found this "film" insulting to my intelligence. The only joy I got from this hoping that Sir John Hughes was a good laugh when he saw the show of the same year his masterpiece The Breakfast Club was released. <br /> <br /> Do not make the same mistake I did watch it because you like the movie 80 minutes. This is exactly what an insult to the genre.
