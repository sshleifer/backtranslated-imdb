I'm always surprised about how different everyone and almost every movie you get both extremes. People who think that this is the best film, and people who think that it is the worst. <br /> <br /> Stigmata is not the worst film I've ever seen, but it's there. First of all, the sound. Manufacturers have spent more time on the soundtrack than editing. It was so loud that the sound track is played, and no one spoke, and then, when Patrica said in her monotonous voice, she barely could be heard. <br /> <br /> I usually like Patrick and Gaberial, but they were both flat in the film. Patrica were mostly 3 emotions. Quiet, very painful, or very angry she stigmata. The first was the preferred one, the second part screaming pain, the third involving raising her voice. It was the loudness that distiguished three, not emotions. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed a lot of deep meaning and podagovory all talked about it, or maybe I was distracted by the terrible images and MTV, as the style. When you watch 3 minutes of video you need a quick cuts and slow motion to pass a short story in the film 2:00, it's nauseating. I do not see the point of it, seeing that the women around Steet and throw the child. And nobody Pittsburgh does not rain that often !! <br /> <br /> I think maybe the real story, with something to say can be conceived, but the budget was spent on the purchase of music and equipment to make a slow rain drop shots and rent that apartment gorgous, Ms. Arquett lived that they end up shooting the guy with the story.
