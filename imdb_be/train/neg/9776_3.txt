I do not know much about the film industry, but good movies should tell a story ... your characters have to start and finish your trip. In the last exit in Brooklyn, they can, but it is by no means a satisfactory manner, and I do not mean a happy ending, just ANY ending. <br /> <br /> Last Exit to Brooklyn, established in 1952 Brooklyn during a very hard blow job, it sets out a number of plot threads in motion. Most include some of the most unsympathetic characters ever to walk on the silver screen. But Last Exit to Brooklyn brings these stories to any conclusion ... it leaves some of them hanging, Sun end, or from an explosion in a strange stratosphere for "artistic" end. <br /> <br /> Two cases in point, and they contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> Sadly transvestite character (an important character in the film), affects the machine and killed. And it is not for him in the movie .... it is gone forever erased from all memory..no reaction from their friends, enemies, lovers .... nothing. <br /> <br /> In another thread, stupid, ignorant, and secretly gay leader of the strike, suspended work, his gay lover, and found the neighborhood thugs, thug gets trampled. The final scene shows beating the streets of Brooklyn, and the street lights are very, very similar to those of the Nazi death camps ... and the scene drags on and on and on ... and the camera pans down to the body of the leader of the operation, and he was crucified .... . ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And, of course, is for him too .... brain erasing ..... disappeared. <br /> <br /> The result .... no matter what the reviewers initially said in 1989 about the movie ... .This movie is depressing part of the precipitate. Avoid this. And if it had not been warned, he really deserves a rating of NC-17 for large volumes of physical, emotional and sexual cruelty ... not even allow teens to watch.
