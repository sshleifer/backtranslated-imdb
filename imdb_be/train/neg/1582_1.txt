Argh! this film is a headache. and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> maybe it's just that my hatred of the genre of action, but even as a child, when I swallowed a scar like Navy Seals, I still consider this film with distaste. Now I really despise him. <br /> <br /> take a pretty good fast-paced story. retain the title and throw the rest away. instead use some half assesd future gladiators plot the full plot holes the whole thing under the threat of destruction (why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena, how about a camera? Why clearly marked frames that actually happened on bakersfeild in unguarded room? ) <br /> <br /> whole movie screaming eighties by truley terrible accounts in stupid shiny suits. ugh. <br /> <br /> do not watch this movie. I know that some people loved it, but some people go out for a while urinating, and I do not understand how.
