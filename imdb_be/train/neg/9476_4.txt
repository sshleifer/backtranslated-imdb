Pretty crazy detective novel featuring all black shade, trying to figure out who killed debauchery trumpet player who was just going to go to Hollywood to make it big. Was it his wife? His girlfriend? Its Would-Be-Girlfriend? Her father? His Butler? The newspaper guy? Who knows? And who cares? The result is only slightly destroyed, and the actors are not to get me in the mood to care one way or another to find out. Why snake venom as a weapon? Who knows? What is the difference? Music is good, but there are few, and most of them would rather "let's get this over with," This is not worthy of your time. So, it is better all-black cast movies there.
