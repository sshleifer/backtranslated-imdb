Now I have recently had the pleasure of watching sight gay comedy Bachelor Party, one of my new favorite comedies, I laughed until it hurt just the type of films. So, naturally, I would like to see a sequel, hoping that it will have the same laugh, but instead Party 2: The Last Temptation generation produced American Pie, which is tasteless and wins the opening goal of the first film. So, the first film has nudity, but it does not appear in every scene. In addition, the story is exactly the same from the first, it does not always appeal to me, but it might be a little more original. The only thing that I am glad that at least there are no old actors from the original Sun appear in this film, because it would be really cheesy or stupid looks. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda are engaged, after only 2 months of dating, everyone is against him. Melinda has a rich family, but they are very happy with Ron and Melinda's brother, Todd is afraid that Ron would take his job. So they go on holiday in Miami for hen and Todd is going to make sure that it will be a trap Ron into the picture, which will make Melinda change your mind about marriage. <br /> <br /> Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation has a couple of laughs here and there, but all are not able to deliver what the first film made. These guys are friends Ron, were more of a nuisance than a nice, except for Seth, he was kind of funny. Set just outside of charming characters Ron and Melinda, everything else is just more or less on my nerves. You want to see this movie? Just watching Girls Gone Wild, is the same thing, only he does not try to pretend that it is a movie. Stick to the original Bachelor Party, is a film that is going to get you in tears from laughing. <br /> <br /> 3/10
