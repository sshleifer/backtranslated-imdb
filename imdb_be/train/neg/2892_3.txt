Ursula Andress naked body is one of those things that make you believe in God. Two other women (especially one who plays the maid) have great body as well. Then why higher the grade, I can give a film with such a quality and quantity of nudity only 3 out of 10? Because to get to the incredible Ursula's body, we have to sit through a movie that otherwise unfunny and boring (keep in mind that I watched a full 101-minute version, and not the 78-minute American friend, who probably cuts a lot of foreign material). In a typical Italian comedy tradition, most of the characters are exaggerated caricatures of (monster army, the «Latin Lover», constant drunk, naive maid), that's not funny, just replay. Final Word: look at it, but keep your finger on the button, fast-forward, you need it. (*)
