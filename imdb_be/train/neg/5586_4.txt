Man Man strives to be a good movie: it has its heart in the right place, it tends to be epic and has a message that, without a doubt, everyone will appreciate. But there is and some of the problems with this picture. He strives so hard to be good and get your message across that sometimes the audience should feel unchallenged. So the only adequate, that the images that are used simplified image - Man Man does not allow the viewer to decide what he thinks is right, but the forging of his posts in his head. Joseph Fiennes illustrates this in his role: he is doing everything possible to look concerned, genuinely touched and all the other emotions you express with only one expression of its repertoire to offer. We add that the film is a long and loses its speed to the end, you could easily lead to the conclusion that man is not worth watching. But there is a sufficient number of points to defend it: it is interesting to have some humorous scenes and show-stealing Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course, you should not compare him to humanistic masterpieces like The Elephant Man (David Lynch), but you'll leave the theater satisfied. He tries to capture your heart (even if your brain thinks it's too obvious) and is successful most of the time.
