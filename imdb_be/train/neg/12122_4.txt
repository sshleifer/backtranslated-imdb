Seeing as the Snooker World Cup finals ended in a premature and disappointing way to defeating Ronnie O`Sullivan Greame Dott 18 frames 8 BBC 2 found a gap in their schedule and so I decided to walk on the moon to broadcast the film, I had absolutely no knowledge of the <br / > <br /> I have not missed a few seconds of title loans do not have the slightest idea about Viggo Mortensen starred in it and thought maybe it could be a cheap TVM, of course, the opening of a sugary Pearl and Marty are the children in the summer camp has something made for TV feel at bright lighting (too brightly lit) cinematography seemed to suggest that it was a cinematic film and not to the exterior wasn`t Viggo Mortensen as a hippie guy Walker, I realized it was the release of the movie in the end someone Mortensen`s wouldn growth `Star TVM, I mean That`s how a legend like Robert De Niro is in the direct to video movie. Wait .... Bob was NOT '? <br /> <br /> Some people on this site have mentioned that Pearl and Marty is unconvincing on-screen couple, and I agree. I can understand why the Pearl will be involved in the exciting hippie guy, but has no idea why Walker would be brought to the plain of Pearl's wife. The sixties were before my time, but, of course, if you have the choice between `hippie chicks and tedious wives doma` s really not a choice at all. Mind you a lot of people took LSD in those days, so I guess that explains it <br /> <br /> I feel a big problem walking on the moon comes down to, It`sa romantic drama, in the center (Just how `d waiting in the TVM) with a few unfortunate scenes of majority so why include quite explicit sex scene? He jar with the rest of the film, and possibly from renting menopuasal women who were 20 in 1969. I say probably because the film also seems to be aimed at teeenage market with majority of scenes and those teenagers will probably get bored with the historical and social context of a man walking on the moon and Woodstock. In other words Walking on the Moon is trying to attract a lot of audience types, but is most likely to appeal to any of them
