I would just like it to be known that I do not often evaluate the films below 5. I was initially very excited to see this movie. His numerous trailer blows on TV for a few months REAALLY I want to see this movie. So, that night, when I saw that it was available on FEARnet on demand, I got popcorn and sat down to watch a movie <br /> <br /> storyline seemed quite intriguing. - some dude carve unsuspecting people on the subway. There's also a photographer will receive a missing person. Where do they go? What happens to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some of the photographs, which he took, and becomes obsessed with the butcher following him around, chatter. The film was a way of sucking you, even if the plot was very predictable. "Oh, no, it's dark, look behind you," I say, rather sad with cheap thrills. HN <br /> <br /> The plot, although predictable, intrigued ... that is, until the end. "It was good until the end .... Then just silly," says Jack_skellington_freke on bulletin boards. And I totally agree. And here come the spoilers ... <br /> <br /> Look, I was hoping it was some crazy killer, some psychotic people will cannibalism. No, it was some kind of secret society to keep living creature for centuries. Woo. How original. How unreal. How sad. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Let Lionsgate. You were weird movies, but this one is sunk.
