I had some high hopes for it, because I like Tim Roth. I was not pleased with this film. I liked Ang Lee Hulk few years ago, so I figured it would be more bang him. Firstly, I was very disappointed with the performance of John Hurt here. It looks as if his eyebrows were re-form it. His performance was unconvincing. He was not as good as one would expect. Meanwhile Roth cool as always here. Case Gamma does not stick to the original storyline, I do not think. I believe that the best part of the movie was the end. He had some interesting action. The only problem with the original, it was too long. This one is not so long, but it was a bit boring at times. I remember some time ago, when Walmart was this film really cheap for sale, and I always wondered why?. Now I know. I was hoping to get blown away, but I was not.
