I actually like the movie Asylum. I made it a habit to see as much as possible. Even rip-off, they would do great as exorcism And if the killer calls. It's just lame. I can not believe that the same people who made the dead walk and DRACULA curse actually did this film too !!! It's not even funny bad as JOLLY ROGER or Penguins (which, by the way, is pretty bad). It's just wrong! I mean, I can evaluate and / or to forgive bad actions or lame special effects in the film Asylum, but this film takes itself too seriously. I really hope that the snakes on a train better. Now it's a film that I can not wait to see.
