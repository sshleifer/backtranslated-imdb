PLAN B has the appearance quickly made, unedited, sloppy script for a film with an attempt at a picnic for the participants in the process - a picnic, which was suspended from the very beginning. It's just another Mafia based on the "Comedy", which has nothing new and lowers the standard for those involved. <br /> <br /> Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino), a crime boss is more concerned with clothes and appearance than about your business out of control. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony Desando) is dumber than dirt and ignorance should be funny. Maloni has slapped one of his debtors (who just happens to be married to Fran book - Diane Keaton) and Fran Maloni takes as his assistant to work off the debt of her late husband, being Maloni on 'killer. Fran is afraid of his own shadow and can not perform Maloni job in the election, instead of transporting it «whackees» Florida to hide in her house of his brother James, while she can not figure out what to do next. This alternative is the murder of the three candidates is called Plan B, Plan A was to kill them! The ending is quite predictable as well as each line is assigned in the script for the characters. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton did a lot of great films and one of the most talented actresses and comediennes, but then she screams and rants and pulls her way through a ridiculous part, which is quickly becoming annoying to watch. Paul Sorvino, well, like Paul Sorvino cast from other gangster films. Sling is also allowed to play on the balcony in the broadest farce, a complete failure of the fashion imaginable. What should be the comedy ends up being just silly and exaggerated. Director Greg Yaytans must return to TV comedy: it was far-fetched story has been condensed into a half-hour concert it might have been a chance. grady Harp
