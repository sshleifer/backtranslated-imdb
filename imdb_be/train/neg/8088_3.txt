To make a good movie, you need to either outstanding actors and a wonderful director. You need at least one of the two. This ear we do not have the needle. <br /> <br /> I do not even remember the name of the director. He did not have to do a lot in his career. I really like Donald Sutherland, but it absolutely can not be the main actor in the movie. He does not hold. Sutherland is excellent in the film, if it is not more than 15 minutes. I would say, for example, that the Sutherland was very rich in JFK, Oliver Stone, when he spoke with Kevin Costner on a bench in the park for 10 minutes without stopping not even pausing for breath. Excellent. But Sutherland is the main actor in the film is not good. <br /> <br /> Kate Nelligan? It is probably good for the television series. DVD awful. Horrible color. Terrible light. I could not even assess the landscapes of the island Storm for how lousy pictures. <br /> <br /> This story Follett was good, but it is a pity that they have transformed it into an uninteresting movie.
