I can not believe it, really does have everything IMDb TV show known to man! I have not seen this show for 20 years. I remember only two episodes, and I barely remember those. I remember that Tony was on from the start, because one of the episodes I remember is the one in which everyone is trying to get Tony to join, but he rejects them, but usually at the end of the show, he becomes a member of the Power House, with all the plaudits . <br /> <br /> Another one I remember is the place where Lola, for some reason, pretending to be dead, (complete with funeral and carried out). I do not remember why he played dead, or, as the show is over. <br /> <br /> This is one of those shows that I convinced myself that I have invented, because no one had ever heard of him.
