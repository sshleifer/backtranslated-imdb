This film deserves another bad review. Consider one reviewer to praise the movie virtues that do not include the "no sex, violence or gore. Uh, sorry. Very adjustment film has us watch as the young fellow Cody, with a love of life, and who has everything to live is blown to pieces, leaving Cody holding his lifeless, bloody body. And, given the nature of the war we know that Cody saw the horror on an almost daily basis. So much for those who are viewing this film with such glasses have grown that the violence that detects a face Cody erased from the memory of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Without a n whether the family of his own Cody, John Rambo, traveling the country on a bike that does a long way in his native city in the US under the guise of a place called Nevada City. Do not mention any implementation of a clear fact that Cody damaged goods. We know this, since it with virtually declares him as he Cody order to "break" from the death and destruction of war. This explains, because nobody does not seem to notice or care, the obvious "flat" effect Cody. This is not a bad game. It is a flat effect of post-traumatic stress disorder. Not guessing here, remember that its CO ordered him to leave the battlefield. <br /> <br /> How about the fact that "accidentally" kiss, as noted by another review. The fall was an accident, was not a kiss. As it was Cody «respect» Vera by clicking on it, knowing full well that it is spoken for? Now, when there was torque non-family. Moment, which is then announced the immediate universe as if it is on YouTube. Of course by frame Faith loyalty and Kodte coming on, "a woman who is planning to marry another taken in the spirit of Xmas season, take a great interest all the hearts and lips of their cheaten. <br /> <br /> We do not know a little bit about the groom Feith except that she professes her love for him, it takes no more than a nano-second to accept his offer (could wait for any other thought), he is generous, he loves her to death, the family has not nothing really against it, he believes that marriage is based on compromises, and the two never discussed the plans after marriage. Do not villains here. <br /> <br /> Asner is an excellent actor given to the dialogue of the hill, "we love you son ...." "You're part of our family" literally days after they We met with a stranger named Cody. And "a group of brothers of speech where the phrase was first of all never intended to apply to virtual strangers to the battlefield <br /> <br /> The result :. This film wool Xmas fluff that betrays himself in major ways, most strongly when he claps Cody disrespect to Faith, physically hitting it knowing well what she speaks. When re-definition of the family as we know it is namely the adoption of a virtual stranger as a full member of the family love, because we all "love you." How many of you have done this, or know someone who did this . NO.
