I'm a big fan of Troma, but I can not understand why they bought the rights to the film, it's so sad, I felt like I was watching for 3 hours. Some where in the short story, he says, "but the fact that Satan knows that he stayed out of annoying tourists" Well, they did not seem to bother him in the movie, but I do. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie the actor who plays Satan, I like a bad movie, but it was just boring.
