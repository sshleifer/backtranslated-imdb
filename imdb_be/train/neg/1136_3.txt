Each film thirties dated, but if you were to look only John Ford films, it would seem more dated than if you watched the other. ie Grand Hotel is relatively modern melodrama. With Ford, there is always a hard sell whose generosity (Abe, The Joads). Always over-emphasis in the harmfulness of certain heavy. Always I made a bad, uncomfortable and obvious scenario. This is no exception. It's just a pretty ponderous delivery device mood. And the mood of it all going for it. <br /> <br /> What is Ford doing here does not make me thankful for Lincoln, it makes me wonder how the state has ever been settled population full of morons, shown here, Ford continued to make decent films. It is also dated nothing but bad. He feels completely false. <br /> <br /> Henry Fonda with a fake nose strange. And none of Illinois utter end «S», or say «Shonuff!»
