Being a film studies graduate, I would like to think that I have seen a wide range of films, some good and bad, but I would like to say that the "Summer rain" certainly worse movie I have ever seen! I chose the film in the hope that he's going to be a great British classic, such as "Secrets and lies" or «Lockstock», but oh no it was so bad, that has flat mates, and I ended up laughing and cringing in the funniest action and cheesy script (it reminded me of a bad " theater in education "school production). The main characters of Michelle and Mr. began to annoy us from the beginning. "Michelle," the main character, who lives with her two friends, has the type of personality that you never get tired of slapping, and Gary was so wet (he kept breaking into tears every 5 minutes) by the end of the film I actually give a damn about no one of them all that I could think of: ". I paid £ 3 for the pile. I have never written a review before, but after watching this film, she influenced me to warn people of this catastrophic production. So, please, avoid at all costs. Thanks for reading.
