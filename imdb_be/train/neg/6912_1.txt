The only reason I even gave it a 1 out of 10 because the option to give it a zero to 10 is not allowed. It was the biggest waste of time I have ever experienced. For about 75 minutes, you are exposed Worst actions (and I do not mean that in a good sense as well as in KILLER NERD, who had a great hardcore action) and the plot, which is not only funny, but also has absolutely nothing to do with to do with the massacre. So I even rented this piece of shit because he has carved in the title. However, there was only one murder in the whole movie, and it was pretty lame on it. You spend more time watching the dispute and the children do yard work than anything. Speaking of children, a little boy actor is probably the most annoying child actor so the bean out of the house to the cemetery. I have already said, he was shot on video instead? If you want to throw away money and an hour of your life, then by all means watch. But if you relish their hard earned dollars and time, and then depart as far as possible.
