It seemed that this film to all this going for it with a good camera, sound, film, scenery, music, costumes ... but drum roll, said Garry Stretch! I do not know if it was his bad action or just a bad script, but I would like to say that this is so. Given its cast in this role, it was difficult to eradicate it even to the end. I wanted him to die in battle or one sword / knife fights. <br /> <br /> Then, rub in the conspiracy to murder the king was because the king does not dine and sex with his Queen? Pretty lame. And go to the extreme to kill his son? Then push up her lover, the success of the King? I see a thread or two here and there, historical bytes, but the manner in which it was presented was a farce. <br /> <br /> I do not recognize Gary Stretch from the rest, but it was awful. I read the comments of another user of the audio is overwritten, but do not think it was called ... In the end, he says, in English, is not it? It was really awful. Line read immediately table ... flat line coroner. It may be that he simply does not have the voice to carry pitch fluctuations. <br /> <br /> In addition, I have to watch it to the end, so that the film, at least, "interest". This could be more if the script / line and casting has been given more work. Scenery and crew along with a very good quality of the film is that it actually made the film above all else. Throwing and history were all secondary. I give the set 10.
