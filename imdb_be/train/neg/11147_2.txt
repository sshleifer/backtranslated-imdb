I have nothing to comment on the film It's so bad that I had to put my first comment on the IMDb website to help some viewers save time and do something more interesting instead of watching this "movie" ... that it will do even better to look at the walls. <br /> <br /> And because I have to write a minimum of 10 lines of text, I tell you as a low budget movie, a bad game, no actors name, stupid fool, like a wolf, and so on ... In addition, history does not bring anything new, special effects made in the 80s style. <br /> <br /> film is almost as bad as the movie "Megalodon". <br /> <br /> So have fun! ;) (Do not watch this movie)
