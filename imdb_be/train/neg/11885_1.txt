I do without the usual comparison of the definitions of the legendary film director, known for his neurotic New Yorker person, because, frankly, do a comparison with the clumsy loser Josh Kornbluta, it's just an insult to any such Director. I also fail to mention spot-on satire `Management SpaceÂ» in the same breath as the celluloid disaster. I can, however, compare it to waking up during your own surgery ?? it is painful to watch and you're wondering whether the surgeons really know what they are doing. Haiku Tunnel is a kind of film you they pulled the plug on the early stages of production. It was tough to live it and as a result, viewers around the world to ensure that suffer. <br /> <br /> preconditions movie ?? If this is indeed the one ?? not even worth discussing, but I will for the sake of caution. Josh Kornblut, the pace of worker with serious commitment phobia, offered a permanent job. Its main task which is almost 17 high-priority letter to his boss. But the absurdity, he is unable to perform this simple task. My reaction? Big deal! It's not a story ?? is a fleeting thought in the best case - the one who was supposed to hand over any self-respecting director of. <br /> <br /> The lead actor ?? if you can call it that ?? This clumsy man clown with full features, falls, untamed hair, as well as a number of facial expressions that range from start solutions anxiety plain. Where to find where is the director of this schmuck? What are you talking about ???? He is the director? Oh, my mistake. Playing himself in his own embarrassment scenario is one thing, but I suspect that Mr. Kornbluth is not as convincing, as a human being, not to mention actor. Be sure that this does not in any way aimless killing the character, but never before have I been so riled up by the presence of the actor on the screen! My disappointment further confuses his incessant monologues to the camera scene. I mean, as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to understand this nonsense, Kornbluth insult us further, `explain 'action (the first rule of filmmaking:` dramatize exposition "?? the show, do not tell) Who is this guy thinks. he? he does not have the charisma or charm, and, judging by his Hawaiian shirts, with no sense of style. casting his agent must be shot at point blank range! <br /> <br /> supporting actors do not do anything to ease the tense sadness I felt, with but one exception. Patricia Scanlon puts in a very funny appearance As Helen's ex-secretary who was driven mad by her old boss, and making harassing phone calls from his basement, holding a flashlight under her face. It made me chuckle to myself, but at the moment quickly passed, and I'm back to check his watch for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The film's title is also wrong. Haiku Tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry. Do not be fooled into thinking that this is an art house film because frilly sounding name or by the fact that he played only a few kinatea rah and did not make any money on hand ?????? there is a very good reason for this! <br /> <br />
