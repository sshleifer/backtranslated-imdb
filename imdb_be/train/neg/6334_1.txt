I saw this film in 1979, I was 17 or 18 when he was released. The theater was maybe 1/4 full when the movie started. Ten minutes later, in a movie with me and a friend who went with me to see a movie in the theater were only two people. The film was really weird and had no plot or the reasons for its script and people demanded their money back. We decided to stay for the whole film .... Why endure such torture ?? ... that's why. We wanted it to be true film critics ... have a standard primed all the other movies it's hard to justify to say that you have seen the best film (10), they always come up with something better. But it is easy to be able to build all the other movies from the worst movie ever made (and this is it ... 1 the best). There may be other movies out there that really qualify as one, but I still see them. Now I base all the films that I see on the scale based on this worst of all .... I am a true film critic ... he told her.
