«The Dream Child» 1989 is the fifth film in the (usually overpriced) "Nightmare" series and later from now, the series has become a total waste. Only good films in the series were the 1984 Wes Craven original, and the third part, «The Dream Warriors» in 1987, the second part was disappointing and sad, and it is the fourth part, which previously scary crazy Freddy Krueger began to annoy with constant stupid jokes . This is the fifth part of the series has almost nothing to recommend for the (admittedly large) except for visual, and a terrible scene, a flashback sequence before Freddy Krueger came into existence. The rest of the movie consists mostly of our razor claws turned maniac yelling stupid joker jokes, and old teens ligament formula donkeys, who are desperately trying to avoid falling asleep, because the good old Freddy is waiting for them in their dreams. Lisa Wilcox returns as Alice Johnson, and a bunch of uninteresting crap, such as super-dumb "terrible" nursery rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some justification for making this unnecessary and unfortunate continuation .. In short:. No originality, just the decline of the old formula, and an excessive load is painfully annoying jokes. My (generous) rating 3/10 associated with great visuals, and especially emphasize the difference in terrible the next sequel to "Freddy is dead," which is horrible beyond belief. if you do not hardcore Freddy Krueger Ent uziyast, «The Dream Child» should be avoided, and even if you do, it's more than likely be disappointed.
