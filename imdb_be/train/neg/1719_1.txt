Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the most terrible, amateurish film I've ever seen - ranking right up there with Manos, Hands of fate in a bad action, useless direction and production values ​​of a kindergarten level. In this movie, stupid-looking claymation / flip animation dinosaur waking up after the meteorite hit the lake in Bumblebum, California, and began to dine on local hayseeds. In an exciting climax, being described by one local as "a giant alligator with fins", pulls this ponderous mass of earth to pursue his potential dinner, before the bulldozer would hit him a couple of times and he was dying of boredom, every character in this Moovie complete moron. One pointless narrative shows redneck go to the liquor store to buy a $ 4.75 pint Ripple; instead of just buying a bottle, idiot shoots cashier and another passer-by shooting at a cop, gets chased to the lake, all so that he can be eaten monster. Sad big monster open it should be nothing more than a piece of foam. There's a fake magician fights fake British accent (in order to make it seem more legitimate), two overly clumsy tenants cattle boats, some cheesy "prehistoric cave art" made in small and annoying bungee-Pickin 'background Moosic. In one painful scene, fake wizard and his dopey wife / girlfriend / partner manage to inflate the film an extra 4 minutes from cowmenting about how maybe they can see stars in the night sky, even though it is clearly daytime on -prezhnemu. Even at a constant fast-forward, it Moovie hurts, and it hurts bad. MooCow said called fumigator, so this cow pies really stinks! : = 8P
