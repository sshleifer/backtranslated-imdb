I do not even want to call this thing the film - a film that did not need to win any awards. The acting was terrible as were stupid scenario. This is exactly the kind of movie that so many people think especially for the NRI audience, but really hated abroad of its complexity and the overwhelming sense of "trying" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I find it strange that so many actors familiar with the English language have such a hard time doing so convincingly in front of the camera. I am sure that many readers will know what I mean - all these tokens of English phrases thrown into the movie in Hindi and regional films for cold spots. There are a few Indian films, in which the English seem quite real - Being Cyrus recently. Although it is not a great film, it was a good movie, and language did not seem to "inheritance". <br /> <br /> I am ashamed that P3 was awarded NGO in 2005, only semi-nice part of this waste were Konkana and a few background shots count. In addition, do not even waste your time with this film.
