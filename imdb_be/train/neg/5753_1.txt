... although for the film, which seems to be trying to sell itself as a horror, there was a distinct lack of blood. <br /> <br /> There was also a clear lack of skilled directing, acting, and editing. script lists <br /> <br /> Jeremy London put in one of the worst performances I've ever seen - his "descent into the maelstrom," insanity is aching self-conscious and awkward. Oh, look at him twitch! Oh, look at him, to drink hard liquor! Oh, look at him to raise an eyebrow and cock his head to one side! Oh, look at him dirty, greasy hair dark! On listening to his mannered husky voice! He should be tortured artist / writer / genius! Ah, yes, comes the poet-shirt - it's another boy who thinks he is Byron. (Or Poe.) Oh for the love ... did someone give this guy a guide on "How to do it well" or are they just pull it out of the carton where non-existent little plastic toy prize in the discontinued brand bargain bin of grain. Well, that was a stupid line - but that's only because the London performance melts my brain with his terrible <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl cute, and very Briar Rose, but still grow in her acting shoes in. this film - she put her line as it goes up, in fact, all of her work was very wooden, her posture as tough as her line - who knows, maybe she was just reacting and trying to counteract the rotation of Jeremy London . kinks, but if so, it takes it too far <br /> <br /> It is characteristic Ari Vervin as Poe - and the role of his character is confused, it provides the best performance parts. He is, quite simply, look right, but it's more than that - it has some depth, I thought that he had a life for the two-dimensional dark as the other characters. So, maybe it's just because I like Poe, and can, therefore, only let my mind wander and think of while he was on the screen. - all that he had interest factor otherwise no <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters faceless blur - there are all the usual caricatures: fights blonde best friend who is a bit of a whore; killed a local police officer who is a bit of a jerk; protective older man who, perhaps too much is not a fatherly interest in our heroin; the intrigues of the old witches, etc., etc., yawn, yawn. <br /> <br /> As with the "obvious lack of blood for a horror movie," the question, none of those they mention (and that the character of London mentions - so pointedly - in his attack on the writing of Edgar Allan Poe) do not follow through on. As another reviewer said - there was potential here: murder, incest, - truly shocking things, but instead they avoid out of trouble, and cut off from violence (raised candles swinging through the air - stepping on a sacrifice - then - - cut to black, it is normal to Noirish traditional horror, in fact, it is expected and lovingly received, when it happens - it's an expensive convention, especially if they are accompanied by a fake lightning and intense Siouxie eye makeup - but in the "descendant" is just catches nyazgrab ohms, or as if the editor got sick at the last minute and cut it), it can be a very tense psychological thriller - horror Palingenesis / delusion / madness - or easy (and fun) slasher film. He tries to be either or not (something new and interesting), but in any case it is not only depressing !. horror element in all of this film is an epic stupidity <br /> <br /> I think the editor (if there was one at all ), it must have been drunk when he / cut this thing. - There are awkward cut scenes; scenes that seemed to be out of action (but it could have just been a poor scenario). Similarly, the director and cameraman - there were some very strange frames and framing, I think it had to be a tribute to Hitchcock or Browning, but only end up looking ridiculous (again, a fine of noir, but trying something different. ) <br /> <br /> All of this, perhaps, might have been funny (in a way that previous reviewers have mentioned - Â«OMG how did it get done?!?"), if I were in the mood for some trash - packaging, unfortunately for me, I settled on the couch with the lights down low, with the clear intention of scaring yourself silly - this is a very bad movie, and I'm afraid I can not recommend it for people, not for laughter <br /> <br /> Please, please do not waste your time and money on it. - or borrow real horror / thriller movie, or find a copy of the fantastic stories of Edgar Allan Poe, one way or another, you "will have a much more pleasant and frightening night than you could ever hope to achieve with this stuff.
