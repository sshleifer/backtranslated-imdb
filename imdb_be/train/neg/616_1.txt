Let's face it; some lame child who dies and his soul is transferred to the scarecrow. Das is not going to not happen Neva! OMFG this stupid loser kid who can not fend for themselves gets his ass handed to him some drunken bastard screwing his mom. Right, like he's dying, he's looking at the stuffed and he has given his spirit to go to a scarecrow. Drunk guy covered his death, making it seem suicidal, and thought that he was with him. Later we see, he rushes out of the trailer, and then receives another meeting with a scarecrow. They had a brief meeting, which includes a drunk calling him a loser and bouncing stuffed with "Takes one to know one, loser!" Scarecrow is turned away from the building, calling him "daddy-o", and then behead the poor. We can see how this amazing film unfolds from it. He continues to kill a lot of people after that. Basically he kills the man who gave him a hard time in a crowded and goes to kill some random ass men, some just laughs. Do not laugh here. He adds the punchline to every kill, too. Every time he killed someone, he will do a carat flips and finish it all with one of his signature punchlines. In the case of one who was with poor hearing, he would say: "That's Ear" and then shove his ass or we can actually take a cue from the film he has just made killing a police officer and was on his way to murder the only person who had.! or stood up for him Her father, the sheriff, screamed crazy to stop, he said. "Hey, stay awhile!" and threw the dagger dropped chest and put it on some wood at the end of the film, he has killed. two guy and I threw in pointe "Gotti divided!" and killed the two guys on the shove cash into their heads. Wowzors, this f lm made me want cream pants so bad. Maybe next time this guy does a movie, it would not be gay.
