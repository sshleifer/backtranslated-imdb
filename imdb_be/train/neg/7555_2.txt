Do not let fool you room - it was one funny movie. The problem - it was not supposed to be a comedy. History puts you well for ending that never comes. Even worse is that the settings NEVER explained. You will leave the theater asking "what is it?" I appreciate it, simply because there were a few short moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat. Nicolas Cage did as good a job as can be expected, in the role, but it is very little to work with was not. There are strange quirks and interesting turns everywhere, that there was absolutely nothing to do with the film. Let this one comes out on video before you spend money.
