This is one of the worst adaptations of musicals ever made. The staging of A Chorus Line is excellent. This movie misses the mark in almost all respects. Even casting confusing. Take Audrey Landers as the Valais. "Dance 10, Looks 3" is a song by Val. History Val is that she is an excellent dancer, but 3 in the looks department. Yes, it is a solution, but in the end, she is an excellent dancer. What brilliant filmmakers do? They hire an actress who can not dance and is famous for its great looks. Way to miss the boat. <br /> <br /> Then there's choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett in the coffin. Why do not they use it choreographed? It really can not be improved.
