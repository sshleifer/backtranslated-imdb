This movie is just plain bad. Poor. Poor. Poor. Now that I got that out of the way, I feel better. This film is poor from start to finish. History is lame. Segment 3-D really bad. Freddy in his cartoon character worse. Thank God, they killed him. And who wants to see Rozanov and Tom Arnold cameo? <br /> <br /> The only good thing in the movie is a bit of history that we have given to Freddie. We see that he once had a family, and we will see him abusive, alcoholic father (Alice Cooper). <br /> <br /> In addition, all bad. There are some quality actors in here (Lisa Zane and Japhet Cat), and they are doing their best, but the end result is just as bad. One and a half hours I spent watching this movie and a half hours I'll never get back.
