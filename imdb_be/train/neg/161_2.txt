If you can imagine, Mickey Mouse, like a street pimp New York, or John Wayne, as a communist spy, then you might believe, Pat Boone juvenile offenders on the farm of his uncle in Kentucky, and you can probably enjoy this film. <br /> <br /> This film is so stupid that not even mannered to mid 1950s asexual love story. And the problem is that Hollywood has made such a big deal to refuse Pat Boone to kiss a woman not his wife on a screen before its release, the audience knows that he will not kiss Shirley Jones, so you can not build any expectation for "screen completion" of their love. It's kind of like watching a western in which cowboys had no weapons. <br /> <br /> The story does not make sense. Even the name of the song is sung with enthusiasm upset. <br /> <br /> April Love belongs to the worst film of the transaction bin with Ishtar and Plan 9 from Outer Space.
