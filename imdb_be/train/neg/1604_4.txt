Remember the movie you seemed to enjoy in the past, not quite correspond to the same feelings as an adult? This happened to me when I returned to school..the Class Reunion National Lampoon. The film has an excellent opportunity for a laugh, but surprisingly aimlessly, as we see, a bizarre collection of characters of a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot a flame of fire out of her mouth, a man who appears to be a vampire and Var ' Yat killer dressed as a woman and wearing hooded. Do you have a class president, who believes that he best thing since sliced ​​bread (but, as we see in the film, he is a coward and a joke), a pair of pot smokers, who do not even know what they are in their own class reunion and a man named Gary, for whom one knows even know (and no one seems to remember his name..this is one joke I used). There plump pervert who likes to grab the woman in awkward places, a deaf and blind woman who has squeal Holler when you call her dog, and cook (you know her from "Goonies" and "Throw Momma from the Train") who likes to put food on the plates of people with hands! The film, in fact, about a psycho who (or at least try to) take revenge on his classmates for a gag they pull on it (they arranged for him to sleep with his twin sister!). The film characters as they search for the killer canvasing darkened, damage to the hallways of the old school. They said the killer of his psychologist, which seems a bit odd himself. The film has a few good jokes, that work (largely in the early stages), but the film is slowly getting worse every minute. The real problem of the film is that it does not really know where to go. The film is pretty much one-joke premise it unreliable direction..if it really has any direction at all. Throw enough enthusiasm, but the material they need to make funny just does not have the quality to hold any interest. It's a souvenir for fans of the early '80s comedy relics who have forgotten (this one is true).
