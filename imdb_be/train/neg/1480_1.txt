He pulled guts guy his example! This is a travesty right?! No one says that it just happens like improvisation has gone terribly wrong. I think that in any way. This film must be a travesty, because who would say that they wrote the script differently. Can anyone imagine all sit acting as a director and the writers are on the storyboard. <br /> <br /> The director says, "our next inbred thief uses its 24-inch machete gut our marker terrible neighbor. Get this, he will pull his guts Â«<br hole sleeve /> <br />" Brilliant! "The entire cast reads. <br /> <br /> No way it can happen, no one wrote that stupid! There must be a hoax. <br /> <br /> I loved the part where the thin introspective Gal inbred freak beats to death of a cast-iron frying pan, she is on the floor of the cave. I was not sure what types of cannibals PEDIGREE worked a lot to prepare. Maybe this explains why pan lying on the floor in the dark, at the right time to kill a distorted carcass. It seems ironic that after a cranky guy defeated by martial arts experts porn queen and pair with jocks type door it falls so easily pan skinny defenseless neighbor. <br /> <br /> What is that Richard Grieco guy doing this? He fired his agent or something? <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain the ending to me, please, because I have not got it either? I can not fully understand why good character girl wants to kill a funny woman who makes her tea. Nothing, I do not want to know.
