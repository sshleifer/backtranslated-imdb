I can always tell if something will hit. I see him or hear him, and to get a good feeling. I did not get a good feeling, watching the view. I was not thrilled with this film, and I'm not surprised that it is estimated here as one of the worst 100 films. I was actually turned out to be right. <br /> <br /> The first thing that threw me was the title. Not that I have a problem with Ebonics (Black I, by the way), but for a film they could use a better name, and it is time to use a name that does not have bad grammar. I heard the dialogue that saw action, and all that I could do this face. <br /> <br /> I also believe that the dance theme of the film to be exaggerated. At least, «You Got Served» was better than that, in my opinion. Even the soundtrack does not excite me.
