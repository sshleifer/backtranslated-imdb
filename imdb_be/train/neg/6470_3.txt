Disney goes to the well one too many times as anyone who has seen the original Little Mermaid will feel grossly disrupted. The celebration of the birth of his daughter Melody, Ariel and Eric plan to introduce its King Triton. Triumph quickly fell to the "sister s, Morgan, who plans to use music as a security tool to get the King" Ursula trident s. Stop attacks, Ariel and Eric to build a wall around the ocean while Melody grows wondering why she can not go there. <br /> <br /> Ugly and scary that describes it directly to video sequel. The Little Mermaid 2 gives you that feeling all that watch seemed to have come straight other Disney films. I believe that only Disney can plagiarism yourself! Do not tell me that Penguin and margins sun remind you of another duet with LION KING! <br /> <br /> Other aspects include annoying rematch between Sebastian and Louie, royal cook. They played badly under it! The culmination between Morgan and everyone seemed to be another disappointment. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give away, but in 75 minutes, everything seemed incredibly crowded and too much to handle. The difficulty for Disney, The Little Mermaid, better to leave on loan and laughing. Then you can prepare for the rest of the other sequels Disney is going to drown you in the future.
