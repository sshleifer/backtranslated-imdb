This film is perhaps the cheapest, Cheesiest and poor continued ever made. <br /> <br /> However, this is the most ridiculous and stupid Disney movie, and will guarantee laugh juicy stories and the lame sites from start to finish. <br /> <br /> This group of short stories, which seems like a bad fanfictions. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * First of all the Beast and Belle be petty argument over helpless. Then, three new characters losers decide to fix things forged letter of forgiveness to give Bella. Part way through this little episode, Belle has the eye wall, which made my brother and sister, and I'm laughing so hard. Then she and the Beast fight anymore over the letter ... and then know the meaning of forgiveness. How many years have they ??? Of course, old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Then, following all of the Lumiere is the biggest dope in the world when it comes to romance. It comes from a man who could Woo nothing feminine. And they do FiFi psychotic villain who is trying to kill Bella and wind landing tape free from the end of this. What a message to send a child! <br /> <br /> Then, following everything about Mrs. Potts is angsty. And the next after that, all of the monster becomes too belong to the birds, to the point where it just seems downright silly. <br /> <br /> The animation is so ugly, it kills. There are at least 100 errors you can clearly see ... and painting badly. <br /> <br /> The beauty is simpering juice that blubbers every time something goes wrong. In addition, it is small and very different from the usual Belle. <br /> <br /> And the side characters are annoying ... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere fight almost all the time. I know that they did it in the movie, but it was an exaggeration in this.) <br / > <br /> but the worst character Mrs. Potts. It destroyed that. I can not even describe it. Just buy it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I put 1/10 juice, but I give it a 10/10 comedy.
