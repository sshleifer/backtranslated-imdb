This is perhaps the worst version of the game I have seen. - several times on stage except the movie <br /> <br /> It is a good idea to adjust - the American South can provide a reliable background for extreme reaction round the alleged misconduct of the hero. <br /> <br /> But doing! Widdoes is very educated Beatrice has a particularly poor performance. Waterston, a great actor, not much better, as Benedict <br /> <br /> The poor performance in the role of Don John - it does. Keanu Reeves look good. Perhaps the desire to make it a caricature of a villain along the lines that links the maiden train track fits cornerstone kop≈° capers of dogwood and its people. - but the actions do you want to crawl <br /> <br /> Successful box set includes a scene where they trick Benedick loves Beatrice believe it - was acting would be competent wonderful. But the use of the river and visual humor Benedict approaches are well made. <br /> <br /> In general, I had to force myself to keep looking, but it certainly did not hold my attention. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> As for the recent comments above I'm almost 40. I watched the stage and screen productions of Shakespeare for more than 2 years. I would suggest trying to protect your friends you're talking to a piece, and not to attack the other reviewers, if you are so poorly armed to the point. I assume, though, with your dislike of youth, that you are quite an age when actions brought bygone days more to your taste. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite pairing was Rylance and McTeer on the London stage, unlike Widdoes, McTeer, experienced and charismatic performer, can act.
