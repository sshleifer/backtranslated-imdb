Pretty average even for Monogram's standards, this mystery (a remake of The Sphinx) has an eccentric portion that is not solved until a special effect - you'll see through it in about ten minutes. Two wires have some good fresh dialogue in the beginning, but John Hamilton hopelessly boring, as the villain (completely discard Etuilla any role) and jerk shtick Warren Hymer is very annoying. Nevertheless, it's worth sitting through five minutes of visiting the incomparable Mäntän Moreland like Nicodemus janitor who gets the best of counsel during the jolly appearance courtroom. You have to hand it to Bill «One-Take» Beaudine; he was not a director, but he will always break through to the routine programmer with some blunt vaudeville.
