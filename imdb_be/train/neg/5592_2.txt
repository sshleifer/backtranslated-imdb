It's hard to describe this film, and one wants to stubbornly tried not dismiss it too quickly, because you have the feeling that this might just be the perfect movie for some 12 year old girls ... <br /> <br /> This film has a good concept -suchasnuyu version of Sleeping beauty with a twist. He has some pretty sleepy arrows and some interesting sketches of the boy's relationship with his single working mother and his classmates ... a good start, you might say, but then he got a little greedy, very greedy, he tries to be a science fiction, drama, thriller perhaps a romantic love story, a fairy tale, comedy and everything under the sun. The result is simply left the audience feeling pretty inadequate. For example, the scene where the girl (played by Risa Goto), finally woke him up (Yuki Kohara) kiss, instead of being romantic, is to try to be scary to make us laugh ... then this is a cheap trick because it will destroy all the anticipation and emotions that he is trying to build for the better half of the film. <br /> <br /> I have not read the original story of the movie is base on (a well-known work by the artist Tezuka comics known for his intriguing and intricate stories), I wonder if all the problems exsist in the original story, or is it going to adaptation? It is quite illogical, even for someone who is used to the "logic of caring," the Japanese comics. For example, how the character Yuki Kohara to manage to get to the hospital at the time (if it is suppose to be a long bus ride) to escape the character Risa Goto front of the cameras as soon as he saw her live interview on TV? <br /> <br /> There are also some scenes that are directly copied (very uncreative!) from the other films, and they all seem pretty aimlessly annoying IE. the famous "mouth of a lion caugh my hand" scene from "" Roman Holiday "<br /> <br /> The film tries to be everything, but ultimately not be anything ... it will not be a fairy tale, and not have enough jokes to be comedy ... and surprisingly, there are some scenes that seem even unintentional "ghost" movies. nevertheless, should give him credit that he was able to sense some caputured Japanese teenager. <br /> <br /> it looking this film, I have a feeling that there might be some films that should have come with a warning label that said "this movie can only be suitable for a person under the age of 18," he there was definitely on the poster of this film. <br /> <br />
