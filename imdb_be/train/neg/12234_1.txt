I think that it was pointless to release the second part of a movie like «My Girl». «My Girl» was a very good movie, but it's ridiculous to make a second part of the film, in which one of the main characters (as Thomas J. Culkin) dies. The story ended after the first film. I wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story takes place. It was pointless!
