I stopped to look lost in this episode, because I thought that Ana Lucia and Libby's death was unnecessary and really upsetting. Then I learned that they kept Libby around only to die in the next episode! G! I can not handle it. <br /> <br /> I like the show during the first season, but it definitely gave the second season, I found Jack and Locke little religious hatred, to annoy. The death of heroes Rodriguez & Watros was the last straw! <br /> <br /> I give this episode in 4/10, because the end of my view of the earlier large series, created by legendary pseudonym JJ Abrams. I hope that his series to improve this in the future.
