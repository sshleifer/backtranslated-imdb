It was a disappointing film for me. He came to me through a boxed set called "Classic film noir", which was a gift from someone who knows what I usually enjoy films are made in a style (I insist that noir is a style entirely genre) . I do not think it's a noir in general. There seems to be a trend these days to label and market every black and white B movie was made from 1947 to 1955, as a film noir, and the label is not always appropriate. There is pursued by the male protagonist, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and most of the film's action takes place in the room. This is just about the common elements of noir that I could see. There does not apply to paranoia, or any real reason why one should sympathize with Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was overdressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale. I do not want to spoil the movie for potential viewers. However, I would be interested to hear that other lovers of film noir have to say about it.
