The first lesson that some filmmakers (especially those inspired by Hollywood) need to know - just "style" does not sell. I think Tashan in translation would mean style. For vtoryhi, if you are obsessed with selling style, which does not save you from having a decent story. <br /> <br /> Tashan is a story that could be enough with some best director. But it is not so smooth. For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshay - a storytellers at various points in history. But this setting is not used properly. There may have been better to mix and match their narrative. Action sequences of the seventies. <br /> <br /> Cheoreography awful movie. I think that's just a dream vaibhava merchants went through this movie. Vishalshehar put a good score, but it does not belong to this film. Why Sufi Song (Dil Haar) in Tashan? Why cool Hinglish song (Dil Dance Maare) than Anil Kapoor when he is the one who english crazy? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar saving grace of the movie. But he is in his stereotyped themselves. You will not mind missing the movie.
