Steven Seagal seems to be sleepwalking through a terrible film shot almost entirely close-up to hide the complete lack of budget and resources. To pick up on the technical shortcomings - silver F / A-18 and F-14s take to the carrier for the air strike, and miraculously become camouflaged F-16s for the actual impact - would give this film more credibility than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the credits of the film, which fade and then disappear in a lightning wipe, which is supposed to be accessible to all users of Final Cut Pro. Combine all their creative skills to your own credit Michael Keusch puts in the same category as the Marseille Mandi.
