The original «Vanishing Point» was a great movie. Subtle motifs, characters who seem real and spontaneous.The remake was terrible. Instructive, patently obvious; he missed the point, why the original was a classic. Black Charger was cool, but even that can not save this film. Why shelf with white Challenger? I do not think it was the best choice as early as 71. Some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious. For example, if Vigo standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his «Dream Quest». His Indian friend was standing next to him. Vigo was only wearing his white briefs. I'm sorry - it just looked ridiculous - it is examining the prospect of its fruit emerges. Another scene was at the end - after explosive crash into bulldosers - Speaker said that the effect is clocked at 180 miles per hour. Then he remembers that the police said that his remains have not been found, because it evaporates, but some people believe that he jumped out and was hidden by friends in the crowd. Then he shows his car rolling out to 180 miles per hour! First of all, you could not open the car door to 180 miles per hour. Secondly, the car will continue to move in a straight line for 100 meters. With no one to control them. It would quickly turn over about 30 times. Third, if you hit the pavement at 180 miles per hour, you would have the wind in different Squishy pieces. Regardless of whether we see it at the end, standing with his daughter. In general, the film, which would insult anyone's intelligence.
