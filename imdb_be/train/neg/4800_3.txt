If you have made a genre film in the late '80s, basically you have a 50/50 chance it will either be installed under water or in prison (unfortunately, we did not get an underwater prison film). Frame for the murder of mob boss Moretti (Franchoz), Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole) ends up on death row, right next to the mob boss's brother Frankie (Frank Sarcinello Jr.). But this is less of a problem Derek as a rogue agent of the government (and the mob snitch) Colonel Burgess (John Saxon, which also directs) uses prison as a testing ground for a new supervirus. This is the only film directed by Saxon during his legendary career. For a guy who has worked with tons of Directors, it seems, only those that he picked up any tips from the cheap-o were Italian. Of course, this is a low budget, but it can not serve as justification stilted performances, shooting omissions or clumsy exposition within the first 15 minutes. To his credit, Saxon was doing it a bit bloody, and he works in a fun nude scene (our host falls asleep during a prison riot only fantasize about women scientists). Cole, who looks like a more durable January-Michael Vincent, well, like a stoic lead and Franciosa - sports really bad carpet - this makes it all the clich√©d mafia boss. The final takes place in a favorite place Marty Maki, Bronson Canyon. Retromedia released it on DVD as a ZOMBIE HOUSE death.
