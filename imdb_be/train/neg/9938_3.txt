Marxist polemic Godard to be as close to unwatchable film, as you are likely to see from an internationally respected filmmaker. Bits of political theater, mind-numbingly sad and endless, interspersed with the adoption of "Sympathy for the Devil", featuring the Rolling Stones in the studio. <br /> <br /> In the development of this song by Mick Jagger played the demo on acoustic guitar, backing vocals recorded towards the end, mesmerizing, and it costs to rent this movie, to see bits of stones. Almost half of the film is devoted to this, so thanks to the miracle of chapter stops, you can skip all the country's political parody and just watch the stones to put a song together. <br /> <br /> When I on laser disks, I valiantly tried to watch it all, but I do not see how someone can go through it. I finally gave up and head-skipped my way to the Stone segments.
