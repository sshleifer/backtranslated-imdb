What a piece of junk that movie was. The room was fine, but even at the beginning of a bad effects to fit into giants normal size people (even effects in Hercules were better) I knew it would be bad. But in fact, terrible part of the film dialogues. It is absolutely incomprehensible, foolish and silly. I felt that it was written by some 9-grader in the creative class and D-. I want to slap Casper Van Diem and other actor on this film following to the end. <br /> <br /> I've had my share of bad movies and cheese (I like a series of tremors), but it's ... I do not recommend at all. It's stupid and bad flabbergastingly dialogues make you cringe.
