Now I do not hate cheap movies. I just do not understand why you have to spend money on a film that you could shoot with a video camera of your father. When I rent a movie, I want it to be the MOVIE, and not a group of people, thinking that it would be a good idea to spend some MiniDV -. Tapes <br /> <br /> Maybe I hate it so much, because the guy in the video store said that it was great, and it was not. Maybe I hate it because it's cheap, have a dull story EVER, most unreal character ever, and really, really, really the worst showdown in the history of movies ever. Even Tom Savini can not save it. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is a waste of time.
