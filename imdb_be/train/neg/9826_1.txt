I think it will be a great film for the true believer in organized Christian dogma, but also for those with an open mind, who believes in free will, rational thinking, the separation of church and state and the good science fiction is a terrible joke! <, Br /> <br /> There are some well-known actors who are either badly in need of work, or have a need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us heathens. <br /> <br /> I entertained this film just as I was entertained by "reefer madness." This film tried drugs set forth on tactics of intimidation as well as the film tries to teach "Christian" principles to the threat of hell and suffering for otherwise good people who do not share their interpretation of our world. <br /> <br /> It was, I howled with laughter and at the same time scared me to realize how many people actually believe that our society needs to return to the good old days of the 19 th century!
