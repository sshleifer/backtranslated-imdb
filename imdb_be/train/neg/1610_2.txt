What I find so interesting about this film - I have seen the full 4:00 version Roadshow, oddly indifferent it. For a film about two very charismatic men - Castro and Che, has been a huge political struggle, it is almost completely devoid of emotional fire. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demián Bichir (which, at best, second-level actor, with a slightly high-pitched voice) do not have a drum or depth, and mostly limited to Castro said Che, Go here, go there, do this, and no explanation as to that effect or this action will Odder still is the actor in the cast, which has the necessary strength to play Castro -. Joaquim de Almeida, but it is shunted away in a small part in the second half. Without tension or passion, which would be expected to dismiss these people and their followers, the film becomes a boring epic feature film about the hairy, bearded men who go through various jungle screaming and shooting without purpose or end. Some of the reviews that I read showered praise on the work of director Steven Soderbergh, actor ignoring almost completely. (One actually spent more time talking about the new cameras digital film Soderbergh than the story or the actors or the fact that it is entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.) This is strange, strange thing to do, because a) Soderberg was only a mercenary in the film, and b) it's not more than competent job of work, unnoticed at the nod to JFK by Oliver Stone in black and white cut up the camera when Che visited New York. If you can imagine the Reds director Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty, you get an idea of ​​dull competence of this film.
