This is a very complicated film. The film is very difficult to follow, and the story just seemed to have no meaning. Rage Wolfman has been made in Spain, and I think that if any film dubbed from one language to another, it can not be translated exactly as it was before in the form. Maybe it's part of the problem, but I doubt that it is possible to explain all the problems with this film. Dubbing is very bad, and the voices of the characters do not match very well. Scenes are volatile, there are many strange and bizarre characters that do little more than further confuse the viewer. What I did like about this film was the look of the Wolfman and the scene where he attacks. Now, when they could put it all together, and if any sense, they could be anything. Do not waste your time on this.
