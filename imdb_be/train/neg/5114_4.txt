This movie was bad. Bad action, bad management, bad writing. But it was not bad funny. It was bad in a boring way. I watched Â«Surface in the air," because I thought it might be a laugh. It was not. Do not make the mistake I did. There are many more enjoyable ways to spend a half an hour, for example, watching paint dry or reading the dictionary. Seriously.
