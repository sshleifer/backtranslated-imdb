As for the movie goes, this film was very good for a mid-50s. There were a few times that the lighting was too hot, but the shots are usually in the frame and remained in the spotlight. Action was above average for a budget low bitches, but the direction was terrible. Several scenes were dragged for too long in an attempt to uncertainty and the effects do not exist. The onset of the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut, and every attempt to breathe life into the skull was evident with a stick and pokes lines. I also could not help but think that the budget does not allow them to ensure the house that they continue to make reference to the engine and that all things are in storage should be in the near future. Honestly ... it would be more interesting if it was the worst movie. It was not bad enough to be a "good-bad" movie, but it was not good enough to be "good" either. Get the MST3K version ... it's more fun.
