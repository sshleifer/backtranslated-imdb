I went to see this film, based on a review of Siskel and Ebert; I not only get cheated, but I brought friends, and had to spend the rest of the day apologizing profusely for making them sit through this meaningless crap. After that, I never went to see the movie based solely on the advice of Siskel & Ebert.
