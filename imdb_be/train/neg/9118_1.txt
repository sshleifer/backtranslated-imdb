It is, literally, the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. This may be the worst film possible. Some movies are so bad that they are good; This movie is so bad that he misses a nice camp and became just unwatchably awful. This anti-enantiodromia. We bought it with the intention to insist, and my whole family gathered around for a fun evening of clever remarks; Instead, we sat in a daze, feeling sorry for the poor Peter Sellers. <br /> <br /> This is worse than the animated Lord of the Rings. This is worse than the continuation of the matrix. It's worse than Krull. This is worse than any movie about Batman. <br /> <br /> Or not, under any circumstances, even if the film approach to ten feet from the TV.
