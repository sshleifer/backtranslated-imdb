Not that I want to be mean, but this movie really surprised me a lot. Throughout the film, I was like ... um ... that this film is all about? I do not get the animation in general. Perhaps this film will be only for those who belong to 1980. There's a group of people came. After the movie, many people said: "It's all" Honestly, I can not believe that this film was awarded the best children film. If you think about watching this movie, I strongly recommend you not to do it. You'll regret it. I'm not kidding. You will find that you are just wasting both your time and money you go and see it.
