To be honest, I do not know what's funnier is awful remake of, or comments on this board. Overview MASTERPIECE had me in tears, it's so funny. Anyway, this movie is one of the worst films ever, and certainly in the bottom of the barrel for the sequels. The name "Mark" on the title made me stop and look at it this morning on HBO, but it's a slap to the other three, especially original. There are so many classically bad moments, but my favorite guy catch fire juggler on the psychic fair !! a good time! This film Omen series that «Scary Movie» is for the whole genre. Avoid if you are looking for a good laugh.
