Slow and riddled with inaccuracies. Excessive Despite its shortcomings, it is still an interesting story about the famous and heroic siege of the Alamo during the struggle for the independence of Texas from Mexico. James Arness as Jim Bowie. Brian Keith as Davy Crockett. Alec Baldwin as Colonel Travis. Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. This project is made for television, and star David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.
