Immediately, this movie was funny. Not that he had no redeeming aspects ?? For example, the best thing about this movie was a beautiful background scenery. Anyone not living on the east coast of the South need to know has no great mountains like those in the West. I knew it was ute immediately, but perhaps Dalton could not suppress his English accent, so they had to forgive him, saying that this southern city. Discord his accent in the southern one was easier. Of course, the film has a plot twists, but a false sense of place was that I could not pass up. It's not like Utah has no meth lab ... so why the authors considered it necessary to pretend that he was in the South outside of me. <br /> <br /> Another thing in action figures always confuses me. Why do they always make the "erection" sound effect when a character pulls automatic pistol? It seemed that each sound effect in this film was "Chuck-Cheech" means 9mm was loaded and ready to fire. Of course, the weapon was already chambered rounds so it was not a necessity. <br /> <br /> Finally, the fireworks were WAY over the top. But hey, this film has been directed to a specific "market segment" I guess ... It's too bad. Each of the actors can act, but this movie was lame.
