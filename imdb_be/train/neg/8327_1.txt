GOOD. So it's a low-budget "film" (I use quotes because he was shot in the video Hi-8). Actions universally ugly, ludicrous makeup (blood looks like it came from the Sherwin-Williams, and I've seen more convincing blows, made of Halloween Ghouls sets) and lighting in general looks like they used to, someone borrowed Toyota pickup shine lights on the actors. <br /> <br /> I could forgive these low-budget features, is there any real content, when the film made an attempt to tell a story. But this collection of footage boasts no plot, no real characters, rather than a pulse. This self-indulgent mess Sun <br /> <br /> And do not worry. - No spoilers here, because there is absolutely nothing to spoil.
