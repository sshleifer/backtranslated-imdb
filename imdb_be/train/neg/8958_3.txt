I do not really like the first "Cube" movie. It was a good idea, but the stimulus and the characters always gave me love it too much. Perhaps, in fact, does not feel the need to see it continued, but when I heard that they were doing the third film, which will act as a prequel to the original. I was intrigued, thinking that perhaps they would correct some of the problems of the original, and to give us a memorable characters. Well, I thought wrong. <br /> <br /> «Cube Zero" starts well enough, introducing us to two characters that are responsible for the look and maintain an endless maze of traps that plagues people in Cuba. The filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery to the establishment of the daily lives of two men. A few questions made of him in relation to the reasons why people are sent there and also the true nature of those who run the whole operation. All this left quite to the viewer. The action was a bit weak, but overall, the first half of the film has moved quite well. <br /> <br /> With the story moves on one of the two "observers" begins to develop serious doubts about what he does. And then he decided to go and help a group of people trapped. Here's where things start to dissolve quickly in the dim cheese. <br /> <br /> Sending people who run the program cubes we get acquainted with «Jax» character. Together with two of his subjects play a major reason why this film failure. At the beginning of "the JAX" looks and speaks more as the villain of the third course, obtained directly from the film, James Bond complete ever "popular" glass eye that ruins any atmosphere created relatively good pace in the first half of the century. What's more is that it starts to feel like a comedy, not a serious movie. With some incredibly banal lines may screenwriter missed and did not care. Action itself is degraded to a further low when the former "caretaker" meets the group in a cube. All interaction painful to watch as everything else after it. <br /> <br /> Again, do not fail to impress on anything but weak characters, dialogue and action "Cube Zero" is a waste of time for those who are looking for a good horror film.
