It was god awful. The story was all over the place, and most of all, I was confused because of the terrible editing. I did not feel any sympathy for, because their characters were not developed enough. They were very shallow people who do not have dimensions. Cheese, cheese stereotypes podagovorov that did not go anywhere. Stripper chicken was just entertainment, even if it was worthy of that look. I do not know what it is trying to be, but how shocked I was when they showed that this garbage on Sundance? I almost canceled the subscription. You might think that channel, as though to show that higher quality movies. There are many, many better gay themed movies out there. "The Celluloid Closet" is a great documentary. I thoroughly enjoyed "Wigstock: The Movie". I'm sure there are others that are slipping my mind at the moment, but what I'm trying to say is that it's just not worth it. If you catch it on TV, okay, but otherwise do not bother. <br /> <br /> There were maybe three or four shots that looked very nice (sadly, I can count them on one hand), otherwise the cinema was pretty lousy as well. The lighting was far in many places. I think that some effects have been used to try to add something that just was not practically nothing going for it. <br /> <br /> I can not deny, Johnny Rebel is quite hot (no light hair, of course). It is a pity that his actions did nothing for me. Shelf with real porn, man. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
