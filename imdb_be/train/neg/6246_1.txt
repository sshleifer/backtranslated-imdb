It touched a few interesting things .. But! - He can not provide proof of exclusive research shown. Who "friends" and "small group of scientists" who collected the data? - What happened to the whole biography of Al Gore's going on there? Like how he liked to play with cows on a ranch, or that his child hit by a car .. too bad, but .. what does that have to do with the ozone layer? <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot better stuff, a lot less time on the Discovery Channel .. I really do not understand why it has such a high rating on IMDb. If you have been living under a rock, this "documentary" should not be news to you ... it's all old news ... And Al Gore is trying to do is to get some points in popularity. ps I am not an American, so do not even try to say that I am a bush fan: p
