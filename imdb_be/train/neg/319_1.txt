A friend of mine bought the film for £ 1, and even then it was extremely overpriced. Despite featuring big names such as Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and incredibly talented Burt Young, this movie was about as funny as a chisel and a hammer straight through earhole. It uses the tired, the bottom of the barrel comedy techniques. - consistently breaking the fourth wall as Sandler speaks to the audience and seemingly meaningless installation of "hot girls» <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who want to make it as a successful comedian, to to become successful with women. If the resident comedian ship - shamelessly called "Dick" because of his bottomless success with the opposite sex - presumably lost at sea, the nature Shecker Sandler gets his big break. Dick did not die, he's pretty locked in the bathroom, presumably seasickness. <br /> <br /> Maybe, from his mouth, he just tore the worst movie of all time.
