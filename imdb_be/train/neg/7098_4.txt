An interesting idea for the film, as shown by the last dragon on earth and showing the struggle he and someone evil is together. When he was younger, Einon was stabbed in the heart, Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to the dark lord, who gave him half of his heart. Now grown Einon (David Thewlis), now the selfish and wicked king. At the same time, Bowen with a new friend, Draco the dragon (voiced by Sir Sean Connery), to get a reward for "killing" dragons. But as Einon a half to hear Draco, they both feel the pain in one of them was hurt or killed. Also starring Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Worth seeing!
