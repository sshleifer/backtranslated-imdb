I have seen many, many Nutcracker productions. Now, maybe I watched this movie with tainted viewpoint of a theater director, but I was disappointed. I am sure that people find these products in particular large business choreography, but from a purely theatrical point of view, I found everything from the design to the choreography to be dull and unsuitable with the "movie." None of the traditional "strange" and impressive costumes looked like what they were supposed to be (ie, candy does not like sweets, rats do not like rats, but rather as chocolate kisses) the action was weak, perhaps softened too much for the screen, and the choreography just did not do anything for me. This makes all the shows are very satisfactory (at best) as if it were intended not to move away from any other production. But remember, again, that from an artistic point of view, theater director, and not a dancer or choreographer, but straight male theater director.
