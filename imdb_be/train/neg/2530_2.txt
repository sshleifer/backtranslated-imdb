This film was deplorable. and not in a good way, as some claim. Firstly the main character is very unattractive gingerman. Second - WTF is happening with this van love. The plot is, basically, it's a boy wants sex so buy a van (which justice is pretty cool). Incredible, considering that it looks like a newt, he kills with a lot of chicks! And it fails with some. Then he kills really hot chick, and realizes that he loves this bird tasteless, who played hard to get. Then drag race with Chick boyfriend. And the tips of his van. At this point, Danny DeVito saves the day. Despite the fact that it should not, because tilting van ginger child first to cross the line. I gave it a 2 * As I am ready to assume that there are some 70-Vanning subculture I do not get, but also because there are some 70-boobage too.
