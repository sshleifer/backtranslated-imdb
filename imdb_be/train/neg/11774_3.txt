I made the unfortunate mistake to see this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival. He was a good shot from the beginning, but this is the last positive comment I have about the film. The acting was terrible, I wonder if the actual GoGo Girls have been hired? But it was a story that was really funny, actually, it was funny and sadly the only reason why I gave it 3/10. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** below. <br /> <br /> I just want to mention a few of the scenes that really got the audience to laugh:. <br /> <br /> Sticking Woman in the field: who would have thought that a child pushing another child can be acted so bad. . The actual exposure <br /> <br /> get a bus scene: girl gets on the bus. But, in time with the music, the world comes to an end <br /> <br /> Rolling Ironing line :. Wow, this one really shows off skills story writer. In the room, and then the raw meat and selling skills. Why not just get her to perform all three "sins" at once? At least, the film may have been a little shorter <br /> <br /> The current down the stairs in a shopping mall :. Watch as one of the girls takes on the flight down the stairs, pursued by flesh eating Dow, do not wait. . It * is * just walking fast, trying not to break her nails <br /> <br /> which ran in the blood :. this is definitely my favorite scene, and suitable end of the movie. Half marathon in red paint, finished vaulting up the stairs and across the bridge, only to be thrown in the most improbable passing car. Not only that, but it is carried out by a suicide itself frantic girl in the film, now it is sticking to the character for you. <br /> <br /> I'd like to think that this film was created in '16 old and their assistants. Unfortunately, having met the director at the presentation, it is not. <br /> <br /> However, if you are in a sarcastic mood and fancy a laugh with some friends .. still did not even think about it.
