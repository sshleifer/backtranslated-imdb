The first inspection. The script is so slow that it's really a 25-minute story blown up to 1 hour 40 minutes. The dialogue is so flat and really one-dimensional. "Action" pathetic, they seem to have really raised the student from the class to read a few lines from an idiot board. As for the whole "point" of history, namely "war is bad" (oh, there is a shock!) Does not really exist. Without outside "allows you to shock them and get more advertising," the scene, no one will talk about this film. It is so bad that it really bothers me to think that it is better to use the money it could continue. Believe me, I've seen some bad "emperor's new clothes" movies, but one thing I can say for them, at least, they were well-shot and well made, the camera dangling for two scenes in it! Read all the other reviews - avoid at all costs and not to talk about it.
