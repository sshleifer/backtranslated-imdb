I've seen a lot of movies and I rarely ever appreciate the film "1", but the film was the terrible. <br /> <br /> The acting was awful, the story was funny, the effects were not realistic and the characters were annoying. Usually when I see a horror film, I think it's when the characters DUMB hears a noise in the house / forest / schools / etc and then yells "hello there anyone there?" - but at least they are believable if they do it .. this movie could not even get that right <br /> <br /> is a movie that will make other horror B-like Venom and fog. It looks like the Academy Awards winning masterpieces. <br /> <br /> I'm always open mind while watching the movie, and I can only say that this film was a waste of time, and I'm writing this comment, so that someone else who is thinking of watching this film come to its senses. This is terrible!
