what ever you do not waste your time on it is meaningless. cinema. Remake that does not need to utter. Everyone comes out of the theater was the same remark. The worst film I've ever seen. Save your time and money !!! <br /> <br /> Nicgolas Cage was cycling down the hills, swimming in the murky waters and rolling hills, being attacked by bees, but while his suit was not yet fully touch and crisp white shirt to the very last scene. <br /> <br /> Despite the good throw Ellen Bernstein and Cage's action was just as incredible as the film itself. It's amazing how good actors can make such bad movies. Do not they receive a copy of the first script. If you have any interest at all in the film to at least wait until it comes out on DVD.
