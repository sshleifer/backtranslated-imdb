After we considered the use of zeta words, about, in the first 10 minutes or so of the movie about 22 times, listened to some really bad actor occur around women and horses, and largely operate as a 12-year-old boys play pranks together, well, we excluded it. Based on a gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a failure of a Hollywood movie, the product of boring and non-writers of talent. <br /> <br /> We do not give him a second chance, thinking that, of course, would be better. No dice. Later, a friend of mine passed through the rest of the film if it is not improved, still no dice. <br /> <br /> The main character has a cool bike. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone, except maybe really immature teenage boys or fraternity.
