Its one of those stereotypical dance films MTV generation, and I do not see where all this "it's not so bad" debris from. Actions terrible, it is the same story as all the other movies "dancing" there. It's awful! The name must not cry watching. "How did she move. Because if you can ignore the grammar of film titles? At least some dance movies were half decent dance scenes, these are not even worthy of an hour. I give it a 1 out of 10, only because there is no zero. I seriously beg someone IQ of more than 60 not to look, not to spend money. 1.6 / 10 should say it all. This film should not be made.
