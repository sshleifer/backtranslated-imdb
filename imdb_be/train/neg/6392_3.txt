Supporters goremeister Herschel Gordon Lewis should look elsewhere, if they have picked up the film for its usual buckets of blood being splashed about, because it is very little in the way of bloodletting in this film. Instead, Lewis decides to try and tell a bizarre story, based on the unsuitable special effects on a budget, that could probably have been two times when the cast turned out his pockets for change one day. Ironically, while cheap and very bad acting (especially McCabe as Mitchell), total plot outlandishness holds the attention everywhere. Imagine that this film would be like with a decent budget! In general, it strains champagne taste on a beer budget.
