I expected the film based on Grendel, in a book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It was based on the Beowulf epic, but told from the monster's point of view. <br /> <br /> No matter what you think about the book Gardner, a film based on the epic Beowulf shall not be entitled Grendel when he says nothing more about the monsters for a few pitiful scenes in which the CG monster shows how any more than a modified Predator. <br /> <br /> In addition, the authors also should be punished for screwing up so badly the original story, and contributes for increasing the ignorance of the masses of viewers across the United States. <br /> <br /> typical Hollywood to get it so wrong. <br /> <br /> It is very frustrating and a waste of time.
