This early entry B in the patriotic category struck a fine young Gene Tierney on the ads and posters, but you should expect a good time before a glimpse of her, riding in Hollywoodized camel train. Previously, we have created a George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert, as the guys who barely get along, but we must stand together in the face of attack. I saw Sanders, like so many pleasant cads, it was interesting to observe the rare good turn Man. However, the appeal of Bruce Cabot pretty much a mystery to me - it is the foundation and non-thin in comparison, but I always felt that he had just come out smiling from under the car, covered with grease and a sixth grade education. Some people like Â«Em, that way, like a gypsy queen character Gina. This is an adventure vehicle, tho, and just as we were warned about the invasion of the locals with guns, ready to sabotage and attack the British on their own land, is the final shootout in which we have to lose the main character for the benefit of all. This feature does not require anything more than your attention to the pressing in the afternoon on Saturday, the programmer, which would have made even he was paired with the best. It was almost more interesting to identify a great secondary actor, and the sudden appearance of Dorothy Dandridge in one of his first roles. And two or two and a half stars out of five.-MDM
