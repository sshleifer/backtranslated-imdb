I had to do a search on the actress to find the advice of this film, because it is now the name of unexpected love. It really should not look, but I was not familiar with both the conclusions and wondered why they were headlining lesbian film on life expectancy. It's pretty discreet, and you do not really get an idea of ​​who these characters as a spectator, I was not able to become emotionally invested in the story line. I believe that I am not the target audience for this, but I do not know who it is. All in muted and soft focus and tons of earth ... nothing very interesting. I had a prurient interest to see the two women make out, but it is processed so quickly, that I was disappointed. Hire a personal record instead.
