I never understood the popularity of Power Rangers show Sabana, which was quite simply second rate Americanized version of the ultra-popular Super Sentai series in Japan for the last three decades! What was cool about the Japanese version gets completely lost in the American version, features, special effects, etc. <br /> <br /> Of course, many children say that the power rangers are the greatest, but they would be wrong. <, Br /> <br /> I'm sure that if they were the Japanese said they would like to know how much better the Super Sentai has over the American version. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers quite badly, try Super Sentai instead! Looking for the best show, try Voltron third dimension instead!
