This film is not accurate and not funny. The plot does not even make sense. Some scientists who work on the periphery of science opens the door to another dimension (maybe hell ???) and his daughter gets sucked through it or whatever, then one day, for no apparent reason, she returned, and now she has a big breasts and is poor meetings (I guess that demon in another dimension, did it for her?) the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend, but she is gay so obvious that she is more interested in his new girlfriend, and they stumble this witch spell books (they want to be witches E or something ???) and the evil spell ends getting read again that, as an evil demon comes on earth, which is only a bikini girl and rejected by a guy in love can stop, apparently. There is a topless scene for no reason and the guy there that my friend is well known for The Wrestler, but part of it is not needed, it is obvious that they have done something just put it there, because then, perhaps, wrestling fans actually watch this senseless film, I am sure that half-naked girls do not hurt there. Additional features on the DVD have been even more confusing than the rest of the movie, I thought it might help explain what's going on, but it's actually just made all the more confusing. Who are these people and what do they do? Basically, it goes something-bout-a-monster-go camping in the production of the film, but there are plenty of things (eg, another dimension and a bookseller), you make it confusing. I do not like the movie, but it was only like five bucks so big deal. I do not recommend watching it, although he was too stupid, I can not think of any part of the movie, which was nice.
