I do not know what some of you smokes, but I suspect that it is powerful. <br /> <br /> To call Gone was awful would be an affront to the very concept of scary. Acts disgusting and I do not bully Madonna here, we all know that it is useless, but someone had to warn the others, that her illness is contagious. My back hurts just from cringing so much on poorly delivered line. Editing is so sloppy that beggars description. Photos and composition (which, in this age, competence should be taken for granted for any movie with a budget) affects inept, even the opposite and looks unnatural lighting. These are the basic elements of the film, if you can not get them right, you should look for another line of work. It is as far-fetched as the production of the third degree of Snow White, except far away and not have done it interesting. <br /> <br /> In the original film of Lina Wertmueller wonderful satire and metaphor, superbly acted and written, featuring spectacular visual effects - you can actually try and feel the sea salt made by the sand in her hair. Sexual tension feels real and immediate ... those of you who have found a version of Guy Ritchie boring, must see, it really is one of the landmarks of world cinema. <br /> <br /> For those of you who thought that the remake is a kind of masterpiece should have your head examined.
