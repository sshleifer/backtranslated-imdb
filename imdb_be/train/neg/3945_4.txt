My name is Modesty low-budget film, which tells the story of the origin of Modesty Blaise. This does not mean that the film is terrible, it's just not what I expected or hoped. While I was aware of the character of Modesty Blaise for many years, I'm not too familiar with the comic books or graphic novels, so I'm going into this film somehow, as an outsider. This may be one of the reasons for my disappointment. I was expecting more action and more comedy. The film managed dialogue. I suppose I was looking for something with a little more than the cost of the camp. As it is, my name is modesty deadly serious film. There are very few, if any, "light" moments. Action, at least by Alexandra Staden, is acceptable, but nothing outstanding. As others have noted, it does seem a little too weak to be plausible in the title role. What action scenes have my name Modesty is one of the weaknesses of the film. I never bought into the notion that the woman can manage a group of trained killers. <br /> <br /> I really hope that Quentin Tarantino comes forward and makes a big budget movie rumors, based on the nature of Blaise modesty. I am convinced that the concept has great potential, and I would very much looking forward to it.
