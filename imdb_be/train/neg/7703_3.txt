Known show master enters the elevator with her friend. Suddenly, she kills him and runs away, and the old lady gets a heart attack. The name of the female killer is Sawa. She was still going to school and working for a vicious criminal, Akai, who sleeps with her. Once Sawa finds out that he had killed her parents .. <br /> <br /> ------- <br /> <br /> Even the biggest fans of the anime will have to admit that this is a vicious fighter frustration Gore festival. "Kite" is a style, but it is still garbage. Amazing story about a teenage girl who kills people, as the killer was trying to be scary and touching at the same time, only bringing the story to fall flat on his face. One of the highlights is a sequence of actions in which the good / bad character Owl drops along with a bodyguard out of the building, but the dramatic structure is not as well-planned and directed by the strange and grotesque animation Yasoumi Umetsu on the faces of the characters is terrible. only that no sexual intercourse sequence just terrible <br /> <br /> Evaluation :. 3/10
