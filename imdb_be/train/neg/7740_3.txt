This movie actually manages to be a meaningless enjoyment 2/3 of the way. Unfortunately, the film is too "entangled" ends. Although I know that some of the plot contrivances standard "buddy cops' films and I got drawn characters who Foil each other brilliantly, but in the end, the film belongs too much to chase sequence as a crutch, and I lost interest. <, Br /> <br /> The filmmakers have done a great job of getting the characters alone and do their own thing, and we have to see who they identified as with the cops in the early stages. We have created our own opinion, rather than force-feeding them through a kind of constant debate. <br /> <br /> In the end, there's too much going on, and it's distracting from what could have been a nice piece of escapism, that's what about Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) at the end of the film: <br / > <br /> 1. its real estate transactions 2 his love affair with radio psychic 3. he investigated internal affairs investigation into the murder 4. <br /> <br /> If you add in concerns Casey you like, what he wants to be an actor and avenge his father's death. Now some of these things come together and even come together well, but all the story elements are combined among this fake chase, which for so long and miserable that I barely have time to break my anguish and to give a shit about what just happened . Scenario impressive acrobatics can not overcome bad filmmaking. <br /> <br /> As if inappropriate sequence pursuit was not bad enough, the one that has four separate sections and can last about half an hour, it was not bad enough, Joe Gavilan field is his real estate transactions, pursuing a criminal with a gun . All these extra-curricular subject lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me just does not come across criminal. We have forgotten or no longer care about the murder plot at this point, as several story lines and eye candy to chase us were stunned beyond comprehension. <br /> <br /> While I could go on the chase, and they destroy a decent story, I will not. It might have been a very nice formula for the film, but he got too big for his pants, and he turned into a waste of time to reserve. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett actually quite good and small appearance Gladys Knight is worth noting. Unfortunately, none of the participants could not help it hopeless to mislead the film from being forgotten. <br /> <br /> Although it will probably be better than love "Hulk" and "Lara Croft Tomb Raider II of", which still does not make it a good movie. I once heard that Harrison Ford has claimed that only make films, and the thought would make the money, I'm not sure if this is true or not. What is true is that, to get more cash you do not need a great movie or a great actor, this film does not have in its main roles. My advice would be Harrison Ford: Follow Indiana Jones, because at least you can run.
