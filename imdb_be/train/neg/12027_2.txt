I saw this movie in the middle of the night, when I was flipping through the channels, and there was nothing else to watch. This is one of those movies where you stop to see what it is - just a moment! - but realized after twenty minutes or so that you just can not turn it off, no matter how bad it is. One of those films that are somewhere between being so bad, it was good and so bad it's good, just bad, it is worth seeing just to experience confusion, knowing that it is so! Large middle-of-the-night fare, if only for the fabulous tennis resistance. I do not even bother to ask yourself why no one can say that Chad Lowe is so obviously male, because logic does not apply.
