I was fortunate enough to meet with George Pal (and still have DS: TMOB poster autographed by him) at the Congress shortly after the release, and asked him why he decided to make the film "Camp." Before he could answer, two studio FlackS intercepted and lecture me about the studio "knows better" and how "no one will take this movie seriously." I read Bantam prints for a couple of years, thanks to a friend (Comicon participants from the 1970s remember Blackhawk and his band? I was in a few years, what happened to him), and had higher expectations than what we got. <br /> <br /> in FlackS insisted that no high adventure will never be done seriously, and thus "camp" was the only way. Several other fans jumped on my side, with Pal listening as he could. At the end of a small event, Pal came up to us and apologized, wishing he could do more and better. <br /> <br /> Star war put the lie to FlackS, and a year after the death of Pal, Spielberg and Lucas proved that Doc Savage could easily next major film franchise ... if it were not for FlackS. <br /> <br /> pluck memory or history of Doc, and the film will have been worth the rating 6/10 no more than mindless popcorn seller. <br /> <br /> But without destroying heritage, as it was no less evil than the killing of the child in the crib. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage can still come to the screen, and to survive the inevitable comparisons with the help of an informed patient is Indiana Jones, but it would have to be done with the utmost seriousness and seriously, to bring back the glory that we should expect from the first American superhero. <br /> <br /> SIDENOTES: Yes, there was a second scenario for the archenemy OF EVIL, and it is much more serious. Yes, there were synchronous frames the shot, but basically, setting an arrow and very few actors. And, yes, there _is_ one sheet of Ron Ely jumping over a brick wall and blasting at something over his shoulder with a purpose-built bronze gun. Ely dressed rag over a button-down white shirt and tie with a bronze, and the words "DOC SAVAGE: arch-enemy of Evil ... Coming Next Summer!" PS: If anyone knows who FlackS studio was accompanying George Pal in 1975 in Sana'a -Dyega Convention idiot smack up side the head and call them idiots that they are. At the time, they do dorkknobs and Fu Manchu and striped baggy pants fabric, Paramount and carrying a briefcase.
