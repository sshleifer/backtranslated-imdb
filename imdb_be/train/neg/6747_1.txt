Wow ... speechless, in making this film, I can not say much. Coverbox local video service had not said that everything ... nothing but 6 actors / actress, who lost on the set of Scream, and decided to make a movie! <br /> <br /> actions, apparently, not in the budget, but they were able to afford nudity and pretty actors! Style over substance almost makes its mark here with the exception of most of the failures of the current class forgets that there is a story that needs to go somewhere, when they read the script. After only 4 or 5 kills with the help of so-called masked killer and intricate tie-in the story of the murder of a club that thinks dumb leading actress of this club that it can join (only if it can get for the girl, bumping into her car), you want to strike the hand with the nearest sharp object to remind myself never to get too excited perhaps a good film like this. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for the people who bought the film and can not find someone to take it off their hands. Another example is what happened with the number of straight to video release of horror, without a thought embedded in essentials. Throw, if you did buy it.
