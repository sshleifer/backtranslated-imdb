What happened? What we have here is basically solid and believable premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the film loses. In fact, he never got going. There was a little excitement when we see that Angie is not really pregnant, then find out what it is in the end, but it was. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person, and usually brings a lot of the movie was terrible, and his whole character was not even close to this important film, but to do it any longer. I really would like to see more interaction between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and perhaps try not to for the sake of pure comedy, which, unfortunately, it was not, but perhaps a drama with comedic elements. I think that if the film did it would be very funny as both an actress quite funny in their relationship and sit here, I can think of many scenarios that would have been a riot.
