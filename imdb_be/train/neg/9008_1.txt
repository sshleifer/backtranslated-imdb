There was a lot of unknown films or films according to the bad reviews that I really liked. It was not one of them. <br /> <br /> He replayed and used camera techniques, which made me feel like I was looking at a soap opera. It was ridiculously predictable and occupies a large part of the movie to get going and then left you to ask "what is it?". Once I decided not to take the movie too seriously and to watch it from a purely formulaic point of view it became more enjoyable. this is one film that is wound on MST3000 if it was the same.
