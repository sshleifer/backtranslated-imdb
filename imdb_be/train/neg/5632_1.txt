I watched the DVD (called the Black Widow in the US) and I felt then that it was, in fact, really a terrible movie. But they had to cut quite a bit from the original film, and I missed a lot. The sex scenes were very little vulgarity and nudity (even the breast), but I have read several other comments on IMDb.com mention vulgarity and something of a tampon. I have not seen anything like that, just a bad, boring film with the characters and unpleasant vulgarity, babble story. Judd Kolagrande either paralyzed from the mouth up or Botoxed gills, and not a drop of expression touches her face. And her name makes me think that the drink super-sized in Taco Bell: Â«I'll have a cola Grande" It was actually kind of fun it was so bad, I have to play the way I had in my Mystery Science Theater 3000, talking about things such as the fact that the skin Defoe is too big for his people. It's really as silly putty!
