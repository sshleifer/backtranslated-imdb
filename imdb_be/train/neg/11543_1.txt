Although I use this site quite often to see how other people appreciated what I think it is difficult, or simply enjoyable film, after watching this "movie" of the film Four last night I had to write something down, even if it only helps to clean. again <br /> <br /> film was probably a shallow experience that I have ever had - the main characters played by Danny Dyer (23 Are you sure ??) and Gillian Anderson (Scully will always be like Leonard Nimoy always will Spock) had no real substance about them - I'm not sure if the first half hour of the film did not make the final version, but of course, in revenge movie that you would like to receive sympathy to the victims ... then I could not care less. In fact, the only character I seem to only care about the dog, with the second place comes the stag. Both animals from acting Dire (SIC) and Scully, which were fully opened frightening. I think, even though you are only as good as the script is given, and I would like to warmly thank the author, producer, director and all the cast for wasting 90 minutes of my life, and a very good electricity.
