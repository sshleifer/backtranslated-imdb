This film can be seen from three points of view: as a story, as a section of Amin as a fictional thriller. <br /> <br /> He fails in history, she casually mentions the coup that threw Obote's, the expulsion of Asians, and has Entebbe hi-jack in the background, but not in a chronological sequence of dates. <br /> <br /> In Amin's profile might have been interesting, because Forest Whitaker incredibly well, and if it was the best film he won an Oscar. (He got it - that proves Oscar voters sun to watch movies that they are voting on.) He ignores relevant historical episodes in the novel, which is observed Amin of Uganda and history with a doctor's point of view. Instead, he tells a fictitious story of a Scottish doctor and his love life is impossible in terms of Amin. But the story told is one case that Amin was probably innocent. <br /> <br /> In the fictional thrillers, there is no plot to hold it together. Start stretched - it takes cinematic liberties with the novel, but it sets up the story. The nature of doctor well defined, but lost in the second half of the film, which is suffering as a result of <br /> <br /> Why did the doctor decides to stay in Kampala poorly explained. - seduced by power? Why did he befriends no surprise. Another character in the novel was lost because the Scot has a deed in lieu of a black doctor - a ludicrous confusion, which does not seem even slightly plausible, but allows the script writer of the film to show the rage of Amin's arm, a little man called horse in the end it is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> And finally, in 1971, Uganda has driven on the left rather than the right, license plates were three letters and two or three digits - and where canines Equator? <br /> <br /> In short - if you have never heard of Amina, you can spend two o'clock to watch this movie, to assess the current Forest Whitaker, but the last hour will bore you into confusion. If you know, Uganda or read a book - do not watch a movie - it will only depress you. And if you want to know why the doctor so recklessly - it was not.
