Oh ... my ... God ... is, without doubt, the absolute Cheesiest film I've ever seen. Bad acts, the story is weak, weak characters, and the entire film just does not make sense. Couple this with a mediocre directing, truly amazing scene (eg, the one in which the child reaches the ravine and mysteriously falls), and thoroughly miserable dialog ( "Look!" "Musta peed in my pants!") And you get a complete failure. Not to mention the fact that the only thing that Mr. Atlas looks like he could win a case of chocolate bars. But it's part of the charm of the film. Sit down and watch it with some of your friends for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, because it's just as bad!
