It was probably the worst movie ever seriously. I could actually better himself, he has not even been set up properly. It's like that movie had a budget of $ 5 and come down with the changes. Do not look. I'm not even all the way to the end of the film, we had to turn it off. I give it 1/10 because it was fun, as the producer of this film wanted to make it a horror movie, but in fact turned into a very bad comedy. Basically, a lot of the girls ran to the car, broke the lamp, and the owner of the car followed them. The bit that I saw it was a woman with a gun, informing load of girls to take all their clothes off, what the hell? it must be some kind of bad porn as well.
