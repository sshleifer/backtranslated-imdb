Lame, lame, lame !!! The 90-minute cringe-festival, is 89 minutes too long. Meaning mature with the atmosphere and the possibility (abandoned convent) to spend on Scenario bitch filled awkward headless dialogue that strains of so hard to be hip. Basically it's just uncomfortable, and attempts gonzo horror fall flat (sample dialogue of this film: after the demonstration of its artillery, quickly trolley shot close-up vigilante character Barbie ?? it: `any questionsÂ« hyuck hyuck hyuck?). Bad action, idiotic, homophobic jokes and, judging by the effect exists, it seems, 'observed the way Evil Dead "directed by one too many times. <br /> <br /> I have my friends a great time to rent this turkey and subjecting them spent ninety minutes, they never return. What a piece of shit.
