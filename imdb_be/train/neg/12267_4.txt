acting solely as a film, I do not really like. not because there was no FX or because we had a unique interior, as the script for the film, in fact it was what kept me watching. <br /> <br /> I did not want to, because the action was a shadow, his "friends" are all happy, and then they are crazy, but you have no idea why; they take different roles, one a believer, the other antagonist, but they never make a point! In addition, the lighting was terrible, and I just mentioned technical issues. <br /> <br /> In a few words, I have a thing, the film could have just been "well, I'm outta here!" from some of the characters. as a woman who does not want to hear his version of the Bible. <br /> <br /> about the story, everyone is free to write what they want, and the story is proof of good writing and reporting, I credit the author for being so, my 4/10. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, to hear the story of this man believe it or not, just do not spend all the time to act, as you see, he and future shocked by what he says, and at the same time move on the screen and jokes, as you do not believe it <br /> <br /> Consistency <br /> <br /> thank you for reading ..)
