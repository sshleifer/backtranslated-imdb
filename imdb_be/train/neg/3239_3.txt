Ah, the infamous "Guinea Pig" series ... I honestly have to say that I was disappointed in general throughout this series ( "He never dies", "Mermaid in a manhole," and "The Flower of flesh and blood" be an exception ... and not even large any means ...), but "devil experiment" just hit. There's nothing realistic look going on here than a highlight (or perhaps frustrating, depending on how you view it ) eyeball piercing scene. the victim appears to be, it is not really concerned about what is happening and just howling or whining future first subjected to "abhorrent" (usually the time of "fun") torture. "The Flower of flesh and blood" is more rigid and bloody way fake "olfactory" material, but the film also provides a flat on the level of realism. I applaud the Japanese for It is pushing the limits, and they really have come a long way over the past two decades to wear the crown in the "extreme" film industry, but "devil experiment" is simply not tenable. Worth a look if you're a die-hard, if for no other reason than to see what the hype, but I can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10, and it is only through a needle-eye scene ...
