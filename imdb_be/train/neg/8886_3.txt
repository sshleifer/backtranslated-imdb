I not very impressed. It is difficult to offer any spoilers for this film, because there is almost no development in the story. All becomes clear within the first ten minutes, and then it's like watching paint dry. The action seems to be very poor as well, and reminds me of old black and white films of the Maoist era is sometimes referred to in the Chinese television during the day. Although it is difficult to say with the female role, Yuwen, as history seems to only require a workaround like a wooden doll. It reminds me of a fading star Gong Li someone got a good reputation as an actress in the West for being a scowl on her face all the time. <br /> <br /> The film Tian Zhuangzhuang in "Blue kite" was much better than the movie. But do not be fooled by the fact that Springtime in a small town was established in the late 40s. In contrast to the Cote d'kite, the fact that the film is set during the revolution has nothing to do with the story itself, the ruins of cities, does not seem to have been nothing more than colorful background. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Tian Zhuangzhuang's just trying to ride on the popularity of Chinese films in the West, and to appeal to foreign audiences that can not tell the difference between a film that "beautiful", "deep" or "hypnotic" and the which simply tedious and inconsequential. <br /> <br /> If any film fits the description of "oversell" this is it. I see no reason here to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.
