I watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest laugh I've had in a long time. The film is pretty dull and confused in a way bad intention. The only plus to be found anywhere in the film impresses ABS Corey Savier in. Alexandra Paul (I think that's her name) is terrible, as the wife of a preacher who has a history of depression. Ted Mackenzie Gross and his character is a reproach to top it all. And, as if the fact that you think that she has sex with her son is not enough, they throw in useless saxophone solo at every opportunity! End and the climax of this movie is absolutely horrible and ridiculous. I mean, who the hell wants to wear baby scams that try to get you to think that he is your son, and you had an incestuous relationship with him!
