Acting although nothing special, it's not do the job the OK, the story seems a good idea, the script friendly and the end has a pretty good turn; so what's wrong with that? <br /> <br /> To begin the special effects are very bad (if it was done in the 60s), it may look good, but in 2003, not only can not be an excuse for visual as poor as this, it makes me laugh that the DVD cover says proudly "of special effects creator of Jeepers Creepers." <br /> <br /> Secondly, the trend is weak, the film simply does not reflect the essence of the story, the doctor heart hospital feeding prisoners devil (or demon-type creatures) must be stretched or frightening; it's just not so. <br /> <br /> In general, it is rather poor film, and although it was tolerated and sometimes mildly entertaining, it's still probably better left alone. <br /> <br /> pretty boring 4/10
