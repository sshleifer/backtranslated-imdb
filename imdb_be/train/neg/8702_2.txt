This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch! I had to wait for him when he saw the first two, but I keep getting caught in these types of films with the idea, "Maybe they did it this time." Nope. - not even close <br /> <br /> Where to start? How about special effects ... To give you an idea of ​​what passes for SFX in this film, at one point the soldiers shoot «Raptor», he ran down the hall. Even with less than a second of screen time, the viewer can easily see that this is just a man with a tail, apparently taped them to run. Bad bad bad bad. <br /> <br /> What about action? If this is what you can call it. There is one character who, I believe, should be from the south. However, after living in the south for six years, I have never heard of this way of talking. Maybe he has some strange disability - the inability to speak normally. I find it fascinating that the character does not do anything that requires him to have that accent - so there is no reason for an actor to try to make one <br /> <br /> How about the story.? It's pretty simple - the Raptors to run, people with guns have to hunt for them. I'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these films always seem to run into the nearest tunnel system ... nya they remain outside to hunt prey? Well, at least they have the good sense to be very little in the film, which is expected to revolve around them <br /> <br /> other things. - Let's say you are in a building, and you know that there are people eating raptor run it. You might decide to take time out to have an argument about who is better - Army or Marine? And then decide what wrestling contest hands to settle it? How about the idiotic idea that they should look for lizard - Split into groups of two. Did they ever watch any horror movies (or at least one episode of Scooby-Doo)? In short, this is one of the dumber movie there. Miss it if you do not want to moan their way through the movie.
