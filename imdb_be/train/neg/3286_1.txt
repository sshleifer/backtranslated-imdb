I do not understand why do remakes have become a trend. Each remake I've ever seen is terrible, and this is no exception. If any of you have seen a quote from Ben Jones that he is "running" a piece of garbage, he is absolutely right. Why do they have a great TV show, which I loved, never missed an episode, and their own seasons 1-4 on DVD, and kill him, I'll never know. The TV show was a family show, and although Daisy has a body, it was really wore, or even the name of the show, keep the clothes. Family show has been transformed into a muddy part of garbage, and I would not recommend anyone go see. Another thing I did not like that John Schneider and Tom Uopat remarkable actors (along with the rest of the original cast), and they are very cute. After all, new and Luke is not even a little sweet. It was one of the boxes to show. Casting scary. They could have at least got a brunette for Daisy. I do not think that Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg, either. Any other role he ever played quite the opposite role. The only role they give up halfway decent Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, but it is not a comparison. Denver Pyle actor all his own, and this makes it ideal for this role. I think the casting horrible horrible story, and generally messed up a great show and turned it into a messy, scary movie. I would not recommend anyone go see. I saw him just out of curiosity, but also a free ticket to the season 4 DVD. I never would have paid to see this movie, but it was free. Do not pay to see this movie.
