From the creators of Shrek ???????? .. Well, that captured my attention. <br /> <br /> Well, the creators of Shrek and Madagascar. Madagascar was half as good as Shrek. <br /> <br /> And now Flushed half as well as Madagascar. <br /> <br /> This means Flushed Away is not good. Animation and all the special effects were very good, but the movie was not. <br /> <br /> The story of this film was intended only for children. This seriously is not possible for adults to really love this movie. <br /> <br /> But there were a lot of jokes, intended for adults. I bet kids cavity understand jokes. <br /> <br /> Despite this, I dint like this film. <br /> <br /> I'm totally disappointed. 4/10
