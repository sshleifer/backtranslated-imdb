Well, I like B movies ... I know that the B movies supposed to represent. But it's just awful. I am surprised that this was a decent overall score. Only redeeming quality of this flick are (mostly) marginal effects of splatter. Do not get me wrong, the blood has a lot in this film - but few effects really jumped out at me (as anal "probe" ... it was great!) <br /> <br /> I believe that this film was. shoot the Come -.. rent Betacam, at least, I have seen a porno with the best production values ​​(and it is better to act and) <br /> <br /> duties - but not sucked in Troma or Full Moon sort of way! <br /> <br /> History -. contrived, but what you get from such films as they are very easy <br /> <br /> Sets and Props -. suck my 16-year-old brother po! beat the more complex kits for our house on Halloween <br /> <br /> sound and dialogue -.! Sucked terrible voice (I do not even call it work), and each word is «S ** t" or " F ** to. »<br /> <br /> there are tons of good classical and B rated horror / Splatter clicks there and they are not so difficult to track. Do yourself a favor, do not waste time on this crap!
