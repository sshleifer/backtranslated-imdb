Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unbalanced young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she expected when she goes to the side of the pool with a nice staff. If her date and his friends jokingly say that they belong to the `Murder Club» Maddie takes it seriously and moves directly to the `Level 3 ', hitting a woman in the brain in the garage (for dents her car!). But Maddy and one wearing a plastic mask and kill other members of the group or has someone lost? <br /> <br /> The plot of this film (originally called MAKE «EM shading) is very poorly laid out, full of holes and spirals completely out of control before the ridiculous, out of left field twist ending. Some of the dialogue completely ridiculous. I had no performance problems Rochon, but the supporting cast was brutal. Nevertheless, I managed to sit through the release of Full Moon thoroughly entertained. There's a lot of skin and blood, and it is the ideal type of flick, to sit with a group of your friends and take apart. horror lovers can also enjoy cameos with Brink Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (parents Debbie) and Julie Strain (early victim) <br /> <br /> Evaluation :. 4 of 10
