Top Laurel and Hardy shorts filled to the brim with failures, accidents and damage caused to the ground state, but Olli receive the bulk of the (!) With a great view punishment-- «The Music Box» (1933) or "hauled in the Hole" ( one thousand nine hundred thirty-two) as some some classic examples. <br /> <br /> Here, however, for some reason (this is because it was based on a sketch parents Stan?) boys play it "straight" in the "comedy" is built around jokes and supposedly funny situations. He does not come off. This is just another third rate comedy tiresome 30s, only enhanced individuals Stan and Oli, who never show any sign of his trademark characters (Oli finger wiggling, blank stares Stey etc.) or comic abilities. <br /> <br /> the film begins with them running from the police. After all, we have never seen or know why it's hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught, and thus, hiding in a mansion in the Colonel shot.
