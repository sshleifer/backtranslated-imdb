Hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. I do not think ever to overthrow Last Action Hero, but it makes it easy. The film is about 3 single guys who meet on Sunday to discuss his sexual adventures over the weekend. The fourth guy - who is married and - what used to be part of the group shows up and says that he and his wife are doing. Nothing works in this movie. Jokes are not funny, but they are repeated throughout the film. Big kicker at the end of the movie ridiculous. Avoid at all costs.
