The first question that comes to mind after watching this garbage, who on earth gave these idiots right to use the name of Omen on this film? It is chaotic, embarrassing, pathetic atempt to carry on the franchise Omen. If the film starts backing music sounds like it was lifted straight from the Bugs Bunny cartoon, and since then the film is getting worse! I do not know who wrote the script, but I bet they got E - for him when they took him back to show your teacher! It's hard after a while to tell if it's a comedy, because it happens so funny and so not true original Omen it beggers belief. Acting ridiculous, especially with the leading lady Faye Grant. she keeps pulling silly face or she find it hard not to laugh? It is hard to say. Worst of all sequels I've ever had the misfortune to witness. 1 10.
