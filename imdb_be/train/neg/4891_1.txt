I want to clarify a few things. I'm not familiar with Ming-Liang Tsai films, and I'm very familiar with the art of cinema; I grew up in the seventies times Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many more <br /> <br /> The art of film were then really ART. how to paint. People of this to express their inner feelings, in fact, do not care if other people understand. They were out of commercial property; just to see some old Antonioni (or early Picasso), and you will understand. <br /> <br /> Tian bian yi duo of young (The Wayward Cloud) has nothing to do with it. This opportunistic film intended to deceive the judge and critic Festival, playing a lot of things, not saying a word. <br /> <br /> The story does not make sense. The lack of water makes the government to promote the use of watermelon hydrate. Girl in despair, stealing water from the toilet public bathrooms. There is also the beginning of porn (the neighbor), trying to make a film with an actress he does not seem to feel comfortable. There are some romantic revival between a girl and a porn star. Mess ends sex scene (not porn), which many people feel shocked, but I believe that it is less provocative than you can see in American Pie, or a history of violence. <br /> <br /> The two main characters never speak. Sometimes, the music style is number 60, and explains (through song) that occurs in the minds of the characters. These video clips, which are really welcomed because the previous scene, without dialogue or music only people look at each other, sometimes takes 4, 5 or more minutes that during the movie too much. <br /> <br /> There are also several bits of "hard to do sex without love", the "selfish mind the porn industry." <br /> <br /> Obviously, this film is intended (to leave him) to deceive the festival jury and critics. It has several pseudo-shocking scenes (within Taiwan censorship) and many subjects are open, but nothing has been signed, or going anywhere. <br /> <br /> These techniques have received several film (disputed) the important film festivals in the price and get the film wrongly commercial success (I can see the film in France, and the theater was packed). <br /> <br /> However, please do not be fooled. There's nothing new or original or originally said or filmed in the movie. It is a sad and empty; in fact cheating the public. Boogie Nights (which I loved) Intimacy and 9 songs much better films.
