Good film with excellent lead role, but a terrible master person. Stephen Jenkins, who plays her husband, it's really a bad actor. Joyce Heyzer, on the other hand, this saving grace of the movie. She's the best actor of the bunch <br /> <br /> Note * first comment trainee, who heaped praise on the film (and, according to his account IMDB.com, only written one review -. And guess what movie?) Obviously, with 'it is a plant. While the film is beautifully shot, it is in any case not thin or large or any other description of the reviewer hypobolic used. <br /> <br /> "The place of art" just a movie, but this is a big bully. It offers all manner of sexual situations, but never goes through it. How can I watch on Cinemax Skin Flick, but with all the "naughty bits" are carved. <br /> <br /> film, in general, a little distracted and end, and most of the third act, is a really big mess. There's a twist ending, of course, as every movie now considers it necessary to have a twist ending. <br /> <br /> A 4 of 10. <br /> <br />
