The worst type of film. In principle, the US Declaration of Independence was replaced with a plasma screen, and it fooled the museum security within a few days. Eh? <br /> <br /> plasma screen, which would theoretically run for less than 2 seconds from this watch batteries, considering that it had a sufficiently low internal resistance, to deliver the necessary current that will not. <, Br /> <br /> could be a dozen major automotive batteries and inverters, but the system will not fit in the case. Sorry to be anal, but it's not even close to probable. The rest of the movie was not much better, and I'm left wondering why the budget could not be donated to charity or have.
