This is a really bad movie with bad effects and is very dull pace Lamas really cool, though!. All the characters are just annoying (except llamas), and there is absolutely no one to eradicate or to take care of!, Plus action is very sad. The film gives us 3 villains who had to find a menacing and anxious, when in fact there is a boring, funny and just a bunch of morons, that I wanted to shut up!, Plus it looks really cheap and amateurish!. Lamas has a lot of charm, but he can not save this piece of shit, and believe it or not the discovery was really cool, as well as the end, but the average is incredibly boring, and I have a desire to push the button fast-forward!, Plus dialogue especially funny! .There cool bar scene that I really liked, but once Lama sent to dock it all falls apart, as well as the scene where thieves family Jennifer torture and kill them have had to find its alarm if it's really funny!. This is a really bad movie with bad effects and is very dull pace, Lamas really cool though!, But this is not enough, is not recommended. The direction is very bad. George Erschbamer does a very poor job here with a mediocre camera work, a soft spot and holding the film in a sad pace. Duties very bad (except for the llamas). Lamas is awesome here, and as long as he is not obliged to act, it's pretty fun to watch, and has a very cool character, and had a lot of charisma, but even he can not save this one, and it was a lot of chemistry with the cast ever! (Lama's rule!). Josie Bell scary here, and while it looks decent, it is not very convincing and had no chemistry with llamas. Cheryl Jeans hot, but not so much to do, but screaming and scared, she did well in that.Robert Scott incredibly annoying as the main villain, and not threatening at all, it was ridiculous, as were the other 2. The rest of the cast is bad. In general, avoid! Avoid! Even if you are like formulas (I). * From 5
