First observed 2002/07/11 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-John Bianco): Pretty lame gangster film of the Godfather of such a family in Brooklyn, who like to talk, a lot of four-letter words and kill people. The only thing of interest here was their attempt to show the feds as much as a gang. This is the only attempt a good movie. The rest of the film was predictable, and cheaply made. The quality of the photos on some of the scenes in bars and joints Floozy almost made you think you had a problem with a DVD-player due to poor contrast and some of the actors was sometimes difficult to hear because of the bad sound. The action was pretty much all of your favorite characatures gangsters of the best films from the trivial names like Vinnie `Knuckles' and Zhimmi` Pope, and the plot is largely followed this model as well. So, go see a gangster film, before putting your money to do so.
