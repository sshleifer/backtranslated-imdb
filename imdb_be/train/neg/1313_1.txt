Do not try to watch this horrible mini-series. It's six o'clock boring, incredibly love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry together. There is no heat in the story, no real passion, real romance. It is a dry, boring, drawn out, and uninspired as they come. And it does not even match the expected level of technical knowledge. Take these six hours of your life, and use them to something more worthwhile.
