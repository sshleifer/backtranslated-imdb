It must be a comedy, but mostly bad taste, and nothing remotely raises a smile in the film. a pair of film tries for a child, and these people in real life, which in this situation will balk at the figures, which reflect. For example the scene in fertility clinics are not in the least funny, and quite frankly embarrassing. Actor who plays builder and his helmet comes across as a bad excuse for rejection of the Village People. The female lead is trying to look 20 years younger than her. Both wires across as ugly, unsightly and very unconvincing. There are various funny and very subtle gratuitous scenes in the film, for example, a budget airline, which is devoid of any humor. The only reason I give it 3/10 instead of 1/10 is a sign for Shirley MacLaine, which is a class above the rest in the pass, and one mark for a half decent (albeit old) music.
