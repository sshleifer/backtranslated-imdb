This film is very skeletal. This is a fairly low-budget film (I hope!) That justifies this somewhat, but the lack of a decent cast and storyline fleshed hurt it too much. Phillips is quite believable in his role as the son of a torn-off families, who are looking for myself (although his family ... uh ... well, a little too white ...), but the rest of the cast are clutching at straws. Every moment that has the potential destroyed by excessive melodrama, is * the way * too many sub-plots (They need a filler ... it is a clear sign deficiency plot.) I would not recommend this movie for those who are not as malicious Phillips fan, or someone who has absolutely nothing * to do. 4/10.
