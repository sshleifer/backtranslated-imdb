Ohhh man! Now that's what I say! How bad / cheese horrors go this film was really in its class. A true gem! <br /> <br /> First of all, the film was not originally in English. That's good, because the voice dubbing was really exceptional! Here's my favorite passage from a dialogue (and there are many more where it happened) ?? "I feel a little better. I just drink ?? your blood! »<br /> <br /> And what a drama! Here's a game on the play summed up the interaction between the military and scientists ?? <br /> <br /> Scene 1 ?? Scientist: "You can not do this ?? It would be a disaster "- The officer:" It's fantastic, "(then he proceeds to cause a complete disaster in the same way as a scientist predicted) <br /> <br /> Scene 2 ??. Scientist: "If you do that a lot of people are going to die !!!" - The officer: "You do not know what you say." (He does so, and many people are dying). <br /> <br /> Scene 3 ?? Scientist: "Do not do this ?? It will kill all "- The officer:" This is nonsense "(then he proceeds to kill all) <br /> <br /> Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (You get the idea). <br /> <br /> If this were not enough ?? there were a few scenes that really stood out as instant classics! In one scene, the military just 10 guys pointing guns at two unarmed men. The leader yells, «Go get them!" 10 And all the army guys, one at a time, dropping the weapon and fist fight two opponents! An instant classic! <br /> <br /> And do not worry. No attention to detail has not been expelled! This film was even hip / optimistic "80 keyboard / synth soundtrack set the mood! <br /> <br /> And believe me ?? I realize that this review may contain some spoilers, but there are so many goodies in this saga I really just scratched the surface. The film of this caliber comes only once in ten years! A true experience of watching a movie! A masterpiece! Wow!
