I signed up just to make this comment (which largely repeats some of them are already here) act worse irregularities, he explains the generally accepted stereotypes have some of the worst of insipid female objectification (all CRB NO brain), and has some of the Cheesiest lines known to man. <br /> <br /> including, but not limited to Â«Allright lets see what these guys can do?" I would also like to note that if they show accident involving innocent civilians, you end feeling badly for innocent people and start to hate a character itself. character Eddie Griffin is also one of the most stereotypical black guy people who just rub people the wrong way. He may or may not be a good actor, but this film does not allow this kind of research character. You want to film that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys? Oceans 11. The film just makes you hate the bad guy, and not to capture an audience. <br /> <br /> Even machines can not make up for that fluke film. This Enzo, Griffin broke sums up the movie perfectly. It just sucks.
