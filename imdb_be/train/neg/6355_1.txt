I could not wait to see this movie. About half way through the film, I could not wait for it to end. All (white) actors delivered their lines, as Woody Allen said simply: "Tell me how it is ..." Then they said that their line on the screen as they try to emulate Woody Allen It was so annoying we all know.. like Will Ferrell really talks, and he does not stumble on his words, as Mr. Allen. Comedy part of this movie was as boring as a tragedy, and certainly never funny or interesting. I must admit that I never He was one of the main Woody Allen fan, and this film is definitely not turn me in. I think that his letter was g that way as bad as its direction. This film will go down in history as one of the worst 10 movies I have ever seen.
