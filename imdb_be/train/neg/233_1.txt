This film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of sex in the city and Four Weddings and a Funeral. In fact, if they called it sex at the funeral, they could have done better at the box office. <br /> <br /> But the film falls between two stools, and can not get up. Characters spout dialogue is incredibly bright, but never take any action, vaguely known as a man. One arbitrary, pointless action follows the others to advance, that goes to the site, and one tire quickly falsity enterprise. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell gets points for the actions of her little heart, but performs contrast stolen Imelda Staunton, as well as of all things, a detective (not they have a requirement for a height over there?). Ms. Staunton did not seem to make a wrong move. Would that we could say the same about the script writer and director. <br /> <br /> If Notting Hill molestation as a dummy, to stay away from it. Phonus bolognus on the half-ring.
