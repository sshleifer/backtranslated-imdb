Message of this film, "the person is more important than beauty." Janine Garofalo to be "ugly duckling", but the funny thing is that she is not quite ugly (in fact it is much more attractive than Uma Thurman, a friend who looks like a model). <br /> <br /> Now this movie work when the "ugly duckling" was really unattractive? If Hollywood to stop this hypocrisy? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, despite the message he wants to convey, this movie is ridiculous. <br /> <br />
