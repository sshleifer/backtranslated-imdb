There were a lot of really great horror films produced in the seventies - but this film is certainly not one of them! It's a shame child is not better, since it works with a decent idea, which takes a couple of times a successful horror theme. We have an idea of ​​a vengeful child, who has worked so well in classic films such as The Bad Seed, and then we have a central theme of zombies, which, of course, has been the basis of many successful horror films. The plot is basically it: a young girl accuses a load of people for the death of his mother, so she goes to the cemetery and resurrects the dead to take revenge (as you do). It's all good, except that it's boring, except! Nothing happens for most of the film, and although it take away from the ends with a well-baked with blood; it is not enough finals to justify sitting through the rest. The film obviously filmed on a budget as the place look cheap and all the actors of the trash. There really is not much I can say about the film in general, as there is not much to it. The child is oppressive horror film of the seventies, and I certainly do not recommend.
