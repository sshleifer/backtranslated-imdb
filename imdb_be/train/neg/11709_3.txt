You have heard that it was said to live each moment as if it were your last? Is this your last day or no, please do not spend part of his view of it! Nichole Hiltz provides some interesting moments of eye candy (which, unfortunately, still wrapped) and David DeLuise shows why it should follow a small screen or a feed for advertising dogs. Fine, surreal story with terrible dialogue means that there is "Art" in the "art of revenge." <br /> <br />
