I taught at a Catholic parish primary schools nuns set out Jesuit priests in high school and college. I am still a practicing Catholic, but will not be considered a "good Catholic" in the eyes of the church, because I do not believe that certain things or act in a certain way just because the Church tells me. <br /> <br /> So back to the movies ... it's bad, because the two people killed this nun, supposedly satire as the embodiment of female religious figure. There's no comedy in the fact that satire is not done well during the action with Diane Keaton. I've never seen a game, but if it is very different from this film, it could be good. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that the weapon can be forged, and the first shooting of the entire plan of the female leadership of four former students, as an attempt to demonstrate the emotional and intellectual fanaticism Sister Mary Faith. But it turns out that the bullets were real, and the story is a tragedy ... tragedy of loss of life (except for the two former students ... life of aborted babies, student life mother), the tragedy of dogmatic authority over the love of people, the tragedy of organized religion, instead of the true faith in God . This is what is wrong with Islam today and yesterday, Judaism and Christianity.
