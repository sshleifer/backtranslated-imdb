(AKA: DEMONS III) <br /> <br /> Made for Italian television, although shot in English, and was not to be a continuation of previous Demons movie. He was supposed to be just a name, the ogre, who is the director Lamberto Bova released it. <br /> <br /> The American family is renting an Italian villa for the summer. Woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams of himself as a little girl, going down to the old cellar of the villa meeting this cocoon-like structure hanging from the ceiling. He lit and covered with cobwebs, and have something that looks like a spider or insect legs hang from it. He drips that looks green. <br /> <br /> Of course, the husband does not believe any of this. The villa is just old and creaks and produces strange noises in the middle of the night, and it should just ignore it. <br /> <br /> But the OGRE is in what looks like some kind of 16th centaury suit that looks like a wolf's head, attached to it, and it attracts the fragrance of orchids. <br /> <br /> in the film is not so bad, and at least the dialogue is halfway reasonable without funny clumsy phrases that would bring dubbing, there is no real gore but some skeletons of rotting in the basement of the pond, which really like the bottom of a modern swimming pool. OGRE itself simply disappears after he moves Jeep Cherokee family. <br /> <br /> screeching Copy DVD I watched was OK, with a picture of a black takes place within a few seconds to half an hour in a movie, a vice, I hope, Shriek since been corrected. Additional amenities include a short interview with Lamberto Bova, where he explains how this is not a sequel, etc..etc ... along with some other trailers Shriek DVD-releases. This is pretty standard stuff. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 <br /> <br />
