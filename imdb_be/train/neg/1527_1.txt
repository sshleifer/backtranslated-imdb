If you really, really want to spend my life two o'clock, do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Look on television. 2) Find the movie "Men in White". 3) If the "Men in White" is going on, sit back and watch. <br /> <br /> And that's all. After sitting for two hours of bad puns, dreadful (and funny) movie references, and feel something, perhaps with the lowest production ever made in recent history, you spent two hour of his life, and I wonder why. <, Br /> <br /> Why do I do it? I was stupid enough to think that this film could be really good. It was not. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you're old enough to remember, Power Rangers, you can find some familiar faces in the film. Presumably to save on production costs, Saban (who also make Power Rangers), decided to generously sprinkle the old monster costumes from each favorite toy sticky-Scandinavian franchise during the movie. I noticed a lot of the old monsters of the episodes I've seen since I was a kid, so I believe that it can, at least, we can say that has some meaning nostalgia. <br /> <br /> But if you want to see the actual power rangers monsters, go see itself Power Rangers. It is much better than this piece of garbage. (And it's saying something!)
