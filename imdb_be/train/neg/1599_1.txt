Comedians NATIONAL CLASS REUNION was a flop when it was released. He did not stay long in theaters in my big city. Why? Because it is NOT !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not bad in a good way, but bad in the very painfully unfunny way. The entire cast of actors were largely unknown, it remained unknown after that turkey. <br /> <br /> The idea is really great (a parody of slasher click), but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect. <br /> <br /> Just to avoid this "comedy". Your time is more valuable than a nanosecond to spend watching this embarrassing misfire.
