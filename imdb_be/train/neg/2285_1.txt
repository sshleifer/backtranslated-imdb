Well, that's 90 minutes of my life I will not go back. This film makes teen TV show «California Dreams» to see how «Almost Famous». The acting was terrible and unrealistic plot. Do not even get me started on the actual group at the forefront of the story, the lame song, watch, etc .. You would have to believe that they were one of the hottest areas in the country, and not enough to recognize the irony in the world that one. The guitarist can be seen that a user of heroin, not that I blame him, if I was around a group of rotten stale with songs and wooden acting injectable horse I would too. <br /> <br /> If you are a musician remotely seriously, avoid this at all costs.
