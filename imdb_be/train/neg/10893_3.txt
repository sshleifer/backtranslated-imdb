This is one of those films that should have been much better than it was. Scary to think that Blockbuster approved editing must have looked, because the director cut on DVD was boring epic proportions. Naturally, you do not expect that it will be "The Godfather", but the class acting or two might come in handy. <br /> <br /> In addition, there were so many nice guys in this film, but they were woefully untapped. I like to watch, like a pack of she-devil squirming around in their BVDs as much as the next guy, but even I have the right to expect a little more. It's not a total loss, though; at least we got a peek (indoor) harmful Drew Fuller and really care haircut. And there Huntley Ritter, looking even more attractive than it did in the «Bring It On» (and acts in much the same). There's always a silver lining, children. You just have to look very hard for it. And from time to time, you must use your pause button.
