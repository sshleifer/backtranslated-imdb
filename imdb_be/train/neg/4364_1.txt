I find it hard to understand why this part of the total waste was repackaged. The only salvation for the whole thing Ariauna body in its sexual form. Her sense of humor is also to be appreciated. It is an advantage, but alas it would take a magician to save this garbage. However, it should be positively recognized for her heroic efforts, and true professionalism. I can not say the same for her co-star Lilith with her whining voice that cut on your nervous system. Appeared disinterested and it seems that only her presence on the set was all that was needed. All of the above in addition to performing in Ariauna is really full of garbage.
