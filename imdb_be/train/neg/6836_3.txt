Please, even if you are in the worst of moods, to refrain from watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not think that was right with this film at all. On the recommendation of a friend I watched it, and I was literally flushed 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life down the cabinet. Bad action direction silly, weak plot and sequence of tears - and when you mix it together, you get a "double whammy." Even less than expected did not materialize. <br /> <br /> I think I've learned one thing - never look click actions Van Damme. They are pure waste of time!
