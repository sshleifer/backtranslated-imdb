Ron Howard directed this? 1966 cartoon magic by teaching simple lesson child using a simple plot. In this film, Howard gives us Whoville full of greedy, manipulative, selfish Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it was not his fault; I present a script to back a faithful man, so Carrey channels Tom Green and the result is movie magic. Just like Penguin Danny DeVito in Batman Returns, The Grinch Kerry so thoroughly unsympathetic, that any amount of comedy, which can be obtained with its character simply evaporate. Where the 1966 cartoon Grinch showed that we could all identify with, Carrie Grinch is that angry, callous old man, we've all seen at one time or another, sitting in a parked car or tripping kids mumbling in his supermarket cue. This Grinch carefully devoid of any humanity, humor and understanding in general, and its repayment to the ends of the film sounds lie. Entire film rings false: there is some silly Christmas lighting competition, failure to explain why the Grinch this jerk, digging in his childhood, and the unreadable mystery why some of the Whos have that strange lips expansion and some of them do not. In contrast to the 1966 animated film, I would suggest that the child would find the film exhausting, irritable, and is filled with conflicting messages. Do we need to see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard cast filled with his incompetent relatives. Throw in the required butt jokes, fart jokes, sex jokes and other mandatory Carreyesque low-grade humor and you have a film that is as far from the 1966 animated film (and the book that inspired it), George W. Bush with the rational, conscious thought. Thumbs down on this big fat turkey.
