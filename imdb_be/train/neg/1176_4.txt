Turnover is always a possibility for dramatic films, because, in fact, most of the revolutions in the most dramatic events. Unfortunately, this film does not have enough drama compensated boredom wealth. One does not care who wins, loses, dies or lives - only to end it as soon as possible. This is due largely to the fact that it seems to me that the superficial use of technology background. Scenes of Paris and the French countryside is the quality of the cardboard about them. They may do better on a bare stage, and left that way. You can not expect amazing effects "Home of Flying Daggers" and "The Golden Compass", but in the end, it's 2002 digitally mastered production. The characters seem to enter the stage for the input stage, so that one loses count of the number of times the character to enter and leave the room. in my opinion, this film transforms the French revolution 1790 "papier-mache" revolution "papier-Calais' world.
