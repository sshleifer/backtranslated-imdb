Urgh! 3 things needed in a movie: a good script, a good story and a good cast. I watched this movie, expecting it to be fun and it was terrible, unfortunately, disappointed when it was just awful. I've lost the will to live in the middle. The only thing that prevented me from stabbing the eye with a fork was Rose Byrne (which was the reason for me, watching it in the first place). She did a good job as Rastus and its appearance has not changed much since she was 13, it was a fantastic first effort in the cinema. the dog was also very good. both did a great job with this horrible stuff. Sandra Bernhard, I think that was the biggest mistake in the film. she was completely miscast, and I do not think she ever really got the character <br /> <br /> I give the film 2 out of 10 -. and then only because of the roses.
