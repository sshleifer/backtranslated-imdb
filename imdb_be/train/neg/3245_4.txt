The debut film by David Mamet was seen by many as a real roller-thinking person, a movie that makes you question everything and everyone. I saw him for the first time recently and could not figure out what was supposed to be so great about it. <br /> <br /> The film is about a female psychologist named Margaret, who is also a best selling author. Margaret was disappointed in their profession and its inability to really help anyone. She's trying to fix it, helping to settle a gambling debt of his patient to a shark named Mike (played by Joe Mantegna, which is the only reason to watch this film). She discovers that Mike is really professional people trust when it almost becomes a victim of fraud, he pulls out immediately after the meeting with her. Intrigued, she returns to him and asks him to show her how scammers work (she plans to use it as the subject of a new book of psychology). Then she falls on him and accompanies him for a long con, he and his colleagues found. <br /> <br /> I do not feel like going into details, but at the end of the film it is revealed that all the events of the film were difficult rogue Mike and his minions fraud Margaret $ 80000. <br /> <br /> Before all the big twist at the end was very predictable. Any scene, where they worked, these rogues was made quite obvious by unnatural acts and strange lines read. Not only that, but the public (and the protagonist) know that they are dealing with swindlers, so it's really a big surprise when we learned that Margaret herself was conned? In addition, Margaret supposedly clever psychologist who is an expert at reading people, but it allows itself to be deceived too easily - and keep in mind that it is well aware that Mike fraudster <br /> <br. /> Second, we are led to believe that Margaret was conducted from the beginning, but in order to ultimately confectioner work, she had to do a few things that fraudsters could not predict what it will do. First, she had to decide to help resolve the debt of his patient, which allows it to meet the crooks in the first place. If she had not already done so, all the rogue would not have happened. I just have to say that it is quite reasonable to assume that a psychologist is going to take it upon himself to settle a gambling debt of the patient. Not only that, but what are the chances that thieves would be in the right place on the night when she decided to show? Maybe they just show up at the bar every night, hoping that she would come and see them? Another thing that was going to happen, it could not be predicted that Margaret had to go back again to see Mike and ask him to teach her the tricks of the trade. What are the chances of that happening? And yet the whole game is based on this premise. <br /> <br /> Another problem I have is with the ending. Margaret learns that she has been cheated, and Mike decides to take revenge. Firstly, Mamet leads us to believe that she is going to con con, but fails, so the final end of it Mike gunning down near the airport luggage. Somehow, it just felt awkward and inept way to end a movie about swindlers who ply their trade. Not only that, but she did not even return the money he stole from her. <br /> <br /> In the end, the film leaves you feeling empty and unsatisfied. And if you, like me, had predicted beforehand that Margaret was going to be tricked, you can find this revelation as unsatisfactory.
