I love Jamie Foxx. <br /> <br /> And I like 99% of all the movies that I see. <br /> <br /> And I came out of this one. <br /> <br /> At the present time, I recognize that may have something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of the theater, who laughed at every little thing ( "oh, no, Jamie knocking at the door! Hee Hee HEE! Â»), but ... it was just incredibly annoying. There can not be sustained camera shot, no camera and shot from the usual angle ... everything had to be in your face, loud and annoying. <br /> <br /> The bad guy was trying to be smooth and Malkovich-like, but at the moment, it's just old and tired. He did not bring anything new or interesting. Of all the characters, too many lines that you saw coming, too many you've heard before, and too much "tough guy" line ... and I do not mind this sort of thing, in fact, as long as there is a bit of originality to him. In fact, pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucks. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Foxx, and I think he is really funny, and I thought he was funny in this movie ... but not funny enough, I endure everything else. <br /> <br /> This film needs less shoot-em-up, less annoying camera shooting, more emotion, more feeling, more and Jamie Foxx. I gave him 2.
