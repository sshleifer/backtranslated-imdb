For a small minority we have seen here praising this film got serious. I know that the peoples of the personal opinion at the end of the day, but anyone with more than a few brain cells can determine with certainty that it is the general trash. Too bad he does not deserve to be part of this franchise. I can only assume that they say, how much is on friendly terms with someone involved in the film and try to give your career a boost. Poor in all respects, entirely con people, in other words. The plot is weak retelling of the previous records, the script too. Cover for the lack of originality with the help of a girl instead (WOW!) Or do not distort the filmmakers are not short of ideas, and, unfortunately, the complete absence of any scares. Absolutely no redeeming qualities, will not utter a complete shit. I was awarded the couple chancers one character just for the fact that the DOE had to get someone to finance this piece of shit. They need to put more effort into what they are actually doing this movie. Shame.
