Another bad class Z trash from prolific Pune. Tim Thomerson's 13 inches of Clint Eastwood as the police chases of the space flying ugly head (!) On Earth and gets involved in a gang war in the South Bronx! Mercifully short, but deadeningly dull, with Cheesiest effects, starting with the attack 50ft woman. They should have fired the guy continuity, too: Notice how Thomerson's glasses disappears and reappears in every second frame. Ridiculously bad, but that's why we watch these movies, is not it? Sequel'Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys', is reported to be even worse, if that's possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (of ****) <br /> <br />
