This movie was terrible. I had a very hard time watching it all the way through. I did not get the point of the film. What is the point of this movie? The soundtrack was bad, the action was bad and sad story. The two main characters in the film were very sad, and their dialogue was not interested. There was no chemistry among all of the actors. I do not know what this is, but I suspect that most of the actors were the first timers. The film could easily be reduced to one and a half hours without losing the plot. This indicates how many useless scenes were in the film. I would rather have a root canal first two hours of the film. I want those two hours ago! If you want to look good, funny movie that family and made a bunch of Mormons, watch Napoleon Dynamite instead.
