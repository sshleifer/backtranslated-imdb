Probably one of the most boriest slasher films ever, poorly acted and poorly written. <br /> <br /> Five students plot, stop for the holidays closing down the hostel, but some patterns on them and starts killing them off one another, the prime suspect is a terrible gardener John Hemmitt plays Woody Roll, or it may be one of the five characters. <br /> <br /> act not so bad, not great either, except Daphne Zungia, dying way too fast and should be the main character, and the rest is good rather boring, although Laura Lapinski main character sometimes has its own charm, and you feel sorry for her, after all. <br /> <br /> The Kills is not really why they banned it, killing look fake basically one guy his arm sliced ​​in half at the beginning, which looks really fake, but others are pretty disgusting, as one girl gets her head run over by a car, one girl gets boiled alive, and the second gets burned alive. <br /> <br /> Overall not a very large shredder Coe LD It was much better
