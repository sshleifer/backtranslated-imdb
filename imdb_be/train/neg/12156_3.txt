Jesus Christ, I can not believe I wasted my time watching this movie. I watched because I have such a crush on Jordan Ladd. But watch this movie just gave me from her. It's just awful! I could watch Survivor Series 93 on it. <br /> <br /> The leading man in this was so soft and versatile. I would like if the big Mistuharu Misawa Tiger Drove Â«91'd your ass through a glass window. I anger every time he said "lake" and "cab". I would kick his ass. <br /> <br /> Jordan Ladd, on the other hand, it was absolutely wonderful. A true angel. But she could not even save this complete joke of the film. Unfortunately, she could not even act like she was with her nut when she took a drug truth. It looked ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I also liked a little, where Jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on it. It reminded me of the time when ... nevermind. <br /> <br /> Anayways, do watch this movie because of its horror.
