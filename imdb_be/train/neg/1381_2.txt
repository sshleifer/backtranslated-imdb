Light SPOILERS, contained in this document. I'm spoiling the film, to save you from having to see it. <br /> <br /> Jet Li movies fall into one of two categories: Shaolin period films and films set in contemporary Hong Kong revolves around the triad of triads or as an organization. Every genre has its best and worst movies. `Twin Warriors' best Shaolin Jet Li film era while as` The Evil Cult» is it the worst. `Fist of Legend" and in the recent past, `the best of the modern era," Jet Li movie. 'Black Mask', is without doubt the worst. <br /> <br /> Jet Li plays a self-exiled mercenary who received an injection that gives him superhuman ability, but reduces its service life. The `new life in exile, he is playing the pacifist librarian. When his old mercenary squad goes on a rampage, Jet Li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them. He puts on a very silly corrugated cardboard mask to hide his identity from the police (and the public) as a librarian, and to hide their true identity of his former comrades in arms. <br /> <br /> version I saw was dubbed, and badly at that. Why Jet Li seize and hold hostage in his library employee, if he a pacifist? There is a story of love between them? Why is the police chief did not care when he learns about the true identity of the Black Mask? The plot is just BAD. Bad by superhero cheesiness, bad in the sense that the characters never properly developed, badly in his character interactions, all translucent explained completed story that I quickly lost interest. <br /> <br /> action and martial arts sequence of the path from the top. A lot of blood, gore (torn parts of the body), wealth, explosions, and matrix style superhuman martial arts gaps are present in the film. Unfortunately, this movie is better and only selling point. If you want to see Jet Li plays a vigilante superhero in the style of Mission Impossible movie 'Black Mask' delivers. For the rest of us fans of Jet Li is a real disappointment. This is one of those movies where Jet Li never gets to be Jet Li: It does not get any chance to enchant us with their charisma, or a chance to impress us with his great, but the realistic ability of martial arts. <br /> <br /> Usually Chinese fakes Ozzy Osbourne will be enough to engross me in the film, unfortunately, `Black Mask" was the exception to this rule. Indeed, the antagonist of the film, the way he dressed, his long straight hair and trademark round sunglasses looks like a modern and at the age of Ozzy Osbourne. However, the villain entirely on the screen long enough to do the trick worth. I believe that the similarity with Ozzy was deliberate; annexed to watch the villain, he also held a satanic looking for shelter. So much more could be done to trick the villain Ozzy Osbourne! Unless the writer, director, or NOBODY bothered to give the background and develop the character of the arch villain of the film! <br /> <br /> `Black Mask" was the first Jet Li film, released on video in the United States after the Lethal Weapon 4, and I'm glad I stayed away until now. Quite possibly, it ruined my whole perception of Jet Li as a martial artist and actor. If you want to see Jet Li at his worst, rent `Black Mask" and 'Evil Cult »and make it a double feature or horror, both intentional and unintentional. Otherwise, follow the moves that use the talents of Jet Li, and there are areas that are partially well-thought-out and believable. 3/9 stars.
