I've seen this movie two weeks ago at the "Festival de New images it Japan" in Paris. Although I did not expect much from him, I must say that I was disappointed, like many people in the audience ... if I wanted to sum up how I felt, I would say that I'm comparing it to the Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa from start to finish. Of course, this is nonsense. But I could not do anything. Stories are quite different, but the worlds are drawn very similar to each other. And from this point of view, "palm trees", of course, can not stand comparison with the masterpieces of Miyazaki. Even if it's very good technically, melancholy remains ... in the end, his complete lack of originality makes me advise you not care to watch it. I appreciated it 2 out of 10 (a little harsh, I believe it deserves 3 or 4)
