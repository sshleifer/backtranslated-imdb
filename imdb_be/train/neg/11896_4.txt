Before I begin, I _love_ Eddie Izzard. I think he's one of the funniest stand windows around today. Perhaps this means that I will be in it too high expectations, but I just did not find Eddie funny in this walk. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that Eddie is trying too hard to be Eddie. Everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic, and we all love him for it. But in a circle, it seems that he is going to more ridiculous than funny, and completely lost me in places. Many of the topics it covers, he covered before - I even think that I learned a few recycled jokes in there <br /> <br /> If you buy the DVD you will find behind the scenes look at the tour Eddie. (Interestingly, in places, but not very funny) and the French one of his shows. Hards will be pleased to see Eddie in a different language, but the subtitle is not very funny comedy. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Eddie you've either got it or you have to buy everything that I say. If you are just passing through, or buy Glorious Dressed to Kill - you will not be disappointed. With round, you probably will.
