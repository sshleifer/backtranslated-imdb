This movie is terrible. CGI is very cheap gray blob CGI. Crocodile looks like a big gray stains. Worst of all is that no effort is not given at all to make it to walk or see him alive. Basically it is a photo-purchase CGI, which is placed in the scene, and you almost expect to see a hand that moves in CGI smudge on the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects that I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of really bad movies Sci-Fi Channel. <br /> <br /> In addition to the terrible lack of special effects, cast consists of the typical subjects of low cost, which are likely to work as waiters / waitresses in local diners while they are waiting for their big break. Perhaps the funniest scene in the film when one of the bad guys trying to sexually assault of Kate and the giant crocodile jumps out of the sea on the second headquarters of the floor of the villains, and the balcony and pull the bad guy off Kate and instead of crashing right through the building (Keith and crushing) Croc simply flies back at the same angle to the water. No laws of physics do not apply to this movie or special effect. At least, there is pride among the crocodiles.
