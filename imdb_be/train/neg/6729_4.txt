Apparently a lot of people really like this, but I found it quite offensive infantilising and nonsense, to save from oblivion Jane Russell and some memorable musical numbers, such as a knife (but there is a noticeable drop in the invention later). I do not get along with Monroe - she has to play a dumb blonde who is not stupid enough, but it just comes as dumb. Russell could not fully convince, if it says that has never been to school, but otherwise very good. Men dramatically uninteresting since storyline. In no event brutal, but so fragmented, that if this is a classic, God help us all.
