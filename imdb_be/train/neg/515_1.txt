Oh man, this movie is bad. It flows awful. The story of the racing driver, who is in love with himself, and then should contribute chicken fast food chain and in doing so, do not love themselves. He is trying to get out of the contract and terribly, painfully unfunny jokes come. Jim Nabors it seems as if he is a lunatic, not valid. You miss such as the Burt assistants Dom DeLuise and Jerry Reed while watching this bitch. Loni Anderson hair is completely terrible, arguing that the varnish tons of hair did not come out in the sixties. Or maybe it was a wig. Speaking Bert wig was not bad in this film. His worst "day wig" was in the "Smokey and the Bandit 2." Anyway, this movie is the worst car Reynolds movie, ever, ever, right up there with the "original" Smokey »Cannonball Run 2". and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper," which, fortunately, was not continued) great, fun movie. This one is not. Even Ned Beatty, who is a great actor, it stinks. you will be a long-type villain Jackie Gleason, that's fun to hate. and note that this is not one of the funniest films in the bag on. this sucks, pure and simple. Even the outtakes at the end was hard and boring And worst of all, unfunny. And though I have not forgotten, "Stroker Ace" was one of the first heavy nail to seal the coffin Bertha before it several years later, a revival in "Boogie Nights", another film that is as «Deliverance» years ago, it shows that man can act very well, if they have a decent platform to do so.
