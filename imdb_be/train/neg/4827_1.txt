If this film is meant to prevent people from doing drugs, it fails. I was ready to start using them, I got waiting for something and nothing ever did. This movie is neither horror or drama. It's just paranoia of methamphetamine users. This film could win the award for the use of the word «F» so many times and so aimlessly. It was not well said, but I felt that they did Meteo replace Meth they borrowed someone. Hector worse and more paranoid as the film went on, and the girl became more hopeless. The ending really does not make sense. The film does not make sense, unless it was just to show how annoying to be stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a meth head. I relied on other feedback, I decided to watch this movie, and the rating on this film should be much lower than the average.
