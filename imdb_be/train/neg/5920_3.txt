Unusual? Yes! <br /> <br /> An unusual setting for the American war film, New Zealand. <br /> <br /> unusual material items, four sisters and their relationship with American soldiers, one bearing an illegitimate child with a dead son of a senator, in another life, with seven Marines (one at a time) before being killed her return from New Zealand POW husband. <br /> <br /> The unusual to see Paul Newman set such a poor job shortly after his unforgettable role as Rocky Graziano in the brilliant Â«Somebody Up There Loves Me." <br /> <br /> unusual two penalty "stars" Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons, leave so little about yourself to a movie. <, Br /> <br /> Unusual that I could be bothered to write a review about such a bad film, to give it a miss!
