This game was made by Sega. Being made Segal, I was not expecting much, but I did not expect this stuff too. To begin angles work against you in this game. Motorcycle your vehicle. Motorcycle is the worst part of the game. Every time you run into something you just stick to it, and you do not move. You will never fall off the bicycle or sunken vessel on the subject. The protagonist is hardly speaks, even though he has a voice that suits him. Graphics is horrible. Going through the trees on your bike. The camera takes the fight to the enemy impossible. This game is not even worth renting.
