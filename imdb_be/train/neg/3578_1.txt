There is absolutely nothing to atone for this film. They took a sleazy story is miscast, miswrote it, misfilmed it. He has a bad bad dialogue is performed in the winding and bad stories. <br /> <br /> As bad as it is, not as an art, it is not even worse trade. Who would be the target market for this. Which age group? What interest group? <br /> <br /> Someone should make a movie about how and why they made this film. What I would pay to see. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of bad movies, and it comes in "by Sailor fallen from Grace" and "Manos" ... my choice, as the three most unredeemably bad movie I've ever seen. All related should be forced to make conversation with Vandamme for all eternity. <br /> <br /> I call you. Watch this film and to perform academic exercise - as you could take it and make it worse? I do not think so.
