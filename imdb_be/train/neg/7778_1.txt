It should be Cheesiest, stupid, the most backward monster film of all time. This is a complete joke, it's even surfaced in theaters. It's kind of like watching a monster of Loch Ness in rural America. This film deserves to be thrown into the toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, shame on you. People involved in this idiotic garbage heap should be lobotomized. Wait! Maybe I give them too much credit. I'm sure they were shooting a lobotomy. How else can you explain the complete and stupidity that it includes a bucket of shit. Do not waste a single minute of his life, watching it. Do not even waste your time sending the response.
