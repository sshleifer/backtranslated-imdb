Not laughing at all. Yes, I was watching all of this train wreck, but only because I would not be surprised later when Cleese came to the second part. (No, he did not.) <br /> <br /> This may be historically interesting youngster you are there to see that the British "humor" including black "joke", as thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> What amazes me even more, though, to read the comments of other reviewers who recognize it's not very good, but then turn around and give him a high voice. If the vast majority of comedies that you have seen, even worse than this one, of course, I'm sorry your painful existence. <br /> <br /> The level of humor of this show seems aimed at young children, but the subject does not. So who is it? People who like repetitive and stretched double takes, oversight, drug jokes (it is interesting only as a short trip back in '77) and one "low" humor. Three Stooges still funny, and have been for me as a child too. They had some effort to joke work. This, however, is dropped schlock. I'm afraid it's the end of civilization if this stuff really is perceived as follows. Next you'll be telling me that tabloid TV is popular. :(
