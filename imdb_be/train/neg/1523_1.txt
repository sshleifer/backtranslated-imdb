This "film" has to be the biggest pile of steaming C * p ^ I ever <br /> <br /> seen, What more can I say than Harmful, Harmful, Harmful. There's nothing to keep this "movie" and I pray that they do not even talk about creating a sequel. If you think about watching this, then you should know that the storyline that two garbage men get involved in saving the earth. Movies like black people were torn to pieces and put back together to make this "comedy", but totally failed. Please not this film (save yourself).
