This movie is so bad it's funny. In fact, Mystery Science Theater 3000, a television show, in which three characters and watch a parody of bad films, used this very fun film. I suggest watching it (perhaps on YouTube), and actually see this movie. <br /> <br /> Please do not see brownies, if you are not prepared to stop at the first stage. In fact, do not watch this movie, period. Please. At least, not serious. His jokes are not funny (if not more), and you'll have a lot more fun to watch a parody of a parody or while watching a movie. <br /> <br /> You may feel sick while watching, so do not feel sorry for yourself. Read the book. Wash. All that is more fun than playing house.
