It is a pity that you can not go lower than one star. To see The Wicker Man, I thought Alien 3 only film that will actually deserves negative stars. In all fairness, The Wicker Man does not detract from the fun of the earlier film, but the fact remains that my overall enjoyment of the film was reduced by seeing it. <br /> <br /> There is a cheap trick too often used in Hollywood, when the producers are too stingy to hire good writers, or in too big a hurry to allow them to bring the story to a satisfactory conclusion: a slap in the shocker ending, and we hope that the public will confuse it for something artistic or meaningful. This gambit that is rarely possible, and in this case we can only splash of embarrassment to a great actor and ridicule from the manufacturers. Especially because that "carefully" (or as they put it) Finally, did not seem to flow logically from the story (which, of course, I can not stop without the introduction of spoilers), but instead he denies that deserves a story had up to this point. <br /> <br /> it is a film that would logically apply to psychopaths, pedophiles, and perhaps die-hard fans of Nicolas Cage, but only a few of a wide audience. If you really want something along these lines, I heartily recommend the M. Night Shyamalan's The Village instead. Not having any memory erase pill, I believe that we must ensure that it is better to get it off my mind, say, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or Pee-wee's Big Adventure?
