I thoroughly enjoyed A Man Called Horse, when he was released in 1970, but will return played like a typical sequel. Everything about it - the budget, script, plot, cast, and actions - inferior to the original. Gale Sondergaard in Elk Woman, an elder of the tribe yellow hand, does not look like an Indian, and neither does the other half of the "Indians" who played the Italians, Mexicans and Latin Americans with cheap wigs. And the old guy who played the chief acted thicker old Squaw, than the fierce leader of warriors. He even used the bow, like a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who did such a fine job in the original appears to be coasting at this time. I believe that he could not resist the easy paycheck he received for reprising his role as a horse. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are some interesting moments in the film, such as the horse passes the painful ritual of purification in order to "find their own vision" and rally Yellow hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors, but overall, the return of ragged, sad, banal and predictable - just like most sequels.
