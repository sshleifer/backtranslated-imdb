"Do not Drink the Water" is an incredibly bad movie. It is based on the 1966 Broadway play by Woody Allen. Starring Jackie Gleason, the comic genius behind the "Young". Directed by Howard Morris has appeared in several Mel Brooks comedies (Life stinks, High Anxiety, Silent Movie), and made a mark in the animation (he sounded signs include Gopher from "PoohÂ», Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey) what went wrong so? <br /> <br /> I think the problem is that the room is being played too seriously to work effectively. The original game was mocking Elena, so he worked on Broadway and in the remake of 1994 Elena. script recorder Allen and Harvey Bullock has the background to death and making too many changes compared to the original game. Creating wife Gleason Airhead in this release, when she was a stubborn woman in the original is just one example of why it is not working. <br /> <br /> Act is not much better. Gleason is doing everything it can with the material, but he can not save it. Gleason was a comic genius, but also a great actor, he has demonstrated in "Hustler" and "Soldier in the Rain." His abrasive personality could work here, but a lousy script does not even give him a chance. Too bad. Fool wife Estelle Parsons will drive you crazy after 20 minutes. See how fast it will take to want to strangle her for you. It is also a shame, because it is also not a good actress, becoming a two exceptional acted in "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel" None of the other actors are doing particularly well either. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen hated the film so much that he remade the film in 1994, with himself and Kavner (Marge Simpson) in leads. They manage to hit all the right notes and the film itself is a comic masterpiece. It is finally on video, after a long struggle for the rights. How to get out and find this version. All original 1969 cleans the unwanted guests, overstay their welcome. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * with 4 stars
