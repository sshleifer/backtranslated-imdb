I really do not like this movie. The plot was very predictable. The typical American story, I'm sorry. The guy gets the girl kind of thing in the end. And London monorail? Bank London ??? The Bank of England is that it is in fact !! - I did however like the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves. And the British were the villains? (In addition to Parker and Lady Penelope) What to do? Oh, and they kept saying things like "come here" The Thunderbirds "» - but it has never been known as «Thunderbirds» in the series, why ?? I would like to see this remade in 20 years with a British cast. I prefer the original series. Sorry!
