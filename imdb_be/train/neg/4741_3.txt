In Wendy: Homecoming Warrior is a very good, strong story, but the cheese is destroyed parts throughout the film. I am the youngest teenager and do not use this film very much. I thought that the consequences were terrible, but they could prove interesting for young children. Sample moves scattered action, you know that it was totally fake. Then there was the Yen Lo, evil spirit, who temporarily has random people and return to their homeland, in which Wendy seek to win. It all ends with a typical feel good movie, if Wendy and her cousin Buddhist monk Shen Yen Lo defeat (and destroy it forever), in the end. Thus, Wendy learns a lesson ... blah, blah, blah. I'm ready for the next DCOM.
