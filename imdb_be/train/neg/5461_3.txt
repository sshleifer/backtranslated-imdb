Like all cult TV show, there is a group of people who love Dark areas are so many that they evaluate almost every episode, they show the greatest EVER. While some of them are really outstanding classics, true for each major episode, there were a few that were mediocre, and at least one that stank. However, as a die-hard Trekkies, the fans zone insist that they are all gold. In fact, this is what I originally reconsider some individual episodes of the cult series of steam, and not in the movie, I usually watch. <br /> <br /> While it's not the worst episode ever made nor it among the worst thing that the poor any reasonable standards. Widow looks a long procession of soldiers of the Civil War, who go by her house. In the end, a very unexpected turn manifests and there is not much excitement or suspense here.
