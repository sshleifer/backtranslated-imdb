I can not wait to see this movie for a long time, after watching "Return to Paradise", which I found to be sand. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing about this was unpredictable end, I think, in part stolen from the "Return to Paradise". <br /> <br /> Maybe I expected too much. <br /> <br /> On the positive side of the Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Although I did not like the character of the Danes and the first and found it very annoying. <br /> <br /> I could not see anything realistic about the film. He could have been done much better, for example, there could have been more attention to the conditions of detention in prisons and explicit horror. It was too much fun movie to be realistic. There may also be more of the action and tension <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is "tragic" ending. I could not have predicted that. But by the time I really did not care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
