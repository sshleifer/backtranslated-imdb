MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO minors (1998) ½ * <br /> <br /> Starring: Scott Baku Braskotter Eric Byrnes, Heysbert Jensen Daggett, written and directed by John Warren 100 minutes Evaluation PG-13 (for language and some violence) <br /> <br /> Blake French: <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, the new John Warren comedy «MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK minors" is an interesting scene. It consists of a sequence, where an angry coach throws the ball hard into the wall behind him, only to have it hit the cement and bounces back and break his face. It's not much, but with the exception of a few jokes, all this film has to offer ... enough said. <br /> <br /> This film is not only structurally disrupted, characterized by undeveloped, predictable, poorly written, but just bad. Even uncritical viewers will hate this movie with everything they got. It is so familiar it's just not funny. <br /> <br /> How many times have to be made the same movie about sports? In recent years we have seen the same material in the «Air Bud: Golden Receiver», and as bad as the movie was, it's even worse. At least, «Air Bud» has been focused on the family. "Major League Back to the Minors" is too vulgar for a healthy family to watch together on Sunday afternoon. It is too childish for adults. So who is this movie for? Teens? The elderly? ? People are so desperate for entertainment they'd rented something like this <br /> <br /> The film, like many others, as it has one basic point he is trying to do: work in a team wins all. Yes it does, and what a great moral to try to prove. I wish I had seen, and freed it so many times, over and over again, so little talent and intelligence that alerted them a man in a ballerina costume. Where stupid speakers to form their own "comedy routine buddy" muttered one liners to himself as "They suck", "These are the children fast ball timed with an hourglass," "This guy fell out of the balloon for some time to find, that he lost - maybe it was his mind "," Someone needs a nap, "and" ever see the sunset as beautiful as what to play. "There, where the symbols have so little value to each other, that we We never know them by name. And where only the heart lecture scene to work together so unknowledgeable, it's almost funny <br /> <br /> «Major League Back to the Minors" is so bad. it stalls their banal ending right in the middle of a good closing sequence. A good baseball team on the back, they're going to win, and - the power goes out. I thought for a minute that this piece of garbage came to the conclusion, but in fact, it is false final scene exists only to add minutes of work time. The film is mainly composed of a series of unrelated sketches that throw in so many rotten jokes, this is not funny. There is another kind-of-funny line of dialogue, there is a coach and a player is talking to each other about why a long time outfielder did not want in this position anymore. coach of the answer: "You're too old, too slow and too fat." The reaction of the player is to die. But this scene is, of course, does not make this film a great time you like, and, of course, is not worth a dime of your money. <br /> <br /> So here's another terrible entrée into the genre of the film, the other condemned with his own script, which failed to see before, and the second, which is so familiar, looks like deja vu again. <br /> <br />
