When I ordered it with the Blockbuster site, I had no idea that it would be as bad as it was. Who knows? Maybe I forgot to take my ADD medication on the same day. I know that from the moment of the cast arrived in their wagon, dressed in their late 70's style wide collar, flared and hair birds, I knew that this ridiculous gem of the disco era was the glory sent to garbage containers. <br /> <br /> first prediction of just how bad things were to be had at the beginning of the story, trying to explain that cosmic forces were in the game, to wreak havoc on the world, making the polyester and porn-quality music for the next viewer. From the first scene to the bad effects to make "monsters" from another world, and then the house, which jumps from one universe was achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of "The Vagina Monologues." <br /> <br /> throughout the film, a sure sign that something was going to happen, if it would appear a small boat. "Ship" was suspicious of something that looked like an old VCR and camcorder parts and will attack anyone in his path. Of course, if you move slower than the intestines influenced Bob Barker, but it was threatening pencil thin yakoreev and the ability to cast in a sinister green light, which could stop the bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through only the cork an hour or two (with some help ). <br /> <br /> Moving on ... how to continue the mystery and bottoms ... We found that they were in «Space Time Warp». As we build this little nugget of scientific information? Because the oldest man leading his son says, that more or less unprepared fashion, as he recalled the "you won the big game" for a cup of Joe or a refreshing ice-cold bottles of Coca-Cola. Pops was a scientist? No, but he knew about horses and apparently intervened as an amateur in string theory and Einstein's theories. <br /> <br /> In the recording I watched a DVD about the quality bootlegs. The sound was muddy and the transmission looked like it was shooting screen cinema with a VCR on a mobile phone, in addition, it was really, really, really bad. (There's not enough "really is", to describe it, actually). <br /> <br /> I know that there are some love this movie, and compare it to other cult classics. I've never seen this film in its initial release, but even then I think I would have come to the same conclusion: to bury this one quick.
