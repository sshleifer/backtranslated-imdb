First of all ..... <br /> <br /> What the hell? Why in the world they are trying to sell the low budget piece of shit on the TV late at night with the promise of an alarm, the onset of disease garbage that any normal person with a real soul could not look. <br /> <br /> What the shit's funny about the injured dog, grandma gets her head was hit ... a guy gets his arm ripped to pieces and two girls go to the bathroom? what in the hell has the world come to the fact that people find in the comedy Some things are so sick. Anyone who thinks that this kind of stuff is ridiculous, should not be allowed to even walk on the ground. <br /> <br /> But from what I hear it is not even offensive ... yes ... they promise comedy dementia through piles of garbage patient ... and they may not even realize it.
