I have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film. I even bought the rental company to give me my money back because I insisted that they committed false advertising. <br /> <br /> Not only is the film itself is p.o.s., but cover is what sold me. I did the best make-up effects on my children on Halloween than what the movie really reflects in comparison with the cover. You can say, "raccoon eyes?Â» <br /> <br /> I'm not going to spend more of my time, going into full details, but come on, the protagonist of the film is the LA police officer, who was born and raised in Alabama - but has a German accent!?! It is for the offensive.
