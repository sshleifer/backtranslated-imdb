this film really bad ....... no, I mean really really bad. Tony Scott terrible director. of all the films he has made, I only as an enemy of the state, except for the fact that he is one of the worst director of all time. what shocked me the most, Richard Kelly (Donnie Darko director) did the script for it. Now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes, but to participate in it does hope he has learned his lesson. <br /> <br /> Now, I love the new role of Mickey Rourke, but I do not even like him in this because of the terrible history and the appearance of it. Do not get me wrong, I still love Mickey Rourke, but he made a few accidents in his time, and this is one of them. I do not know what to say about Knightley, I think it is too overrated. I just can not feel it in the movies. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is bad. this is ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
