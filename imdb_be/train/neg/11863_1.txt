I thought that this movie was a disappointment, I expected it to be much better than it was. I'm so glad I did not pay to see this movie, and I'm not sitting in a movie theater for that. Where to start on this film, acting in this movie was average, had a terrible sense of humor, and only the general plot of this movie was not special. I thought that this movie was suppose to be big, but it was nothing more than a waste of time cheese. I think that acting in this movie was not terrible actors in this film was the chemistry, it just was not there. I think that, if possible, we had another actor playing Kirk than Jay Baruchel it might be better, but the whole time I watched this movie, he looked tall, and I do not get the feeling that he did not act in this film . Now, Alice Eve did a great job as an actress, but there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All the actors in this film, there were no names and there was very little effect on the film. Humor in the movie was not funny, there were several ships in this film, which was okay, but not worth anything to say to your friends that they would understand. I think Jim Field Smith had a hard time with it, because he could not decide whether he wants to romance or comedy. I sincerely believe that he must follow advertising Burger King. I think that this film could have been better if the authors would have gone to another director. The storyline of this film in the same way as any other hot girl just OK guy love story ?? boring, I think it would be better if it was more originality, but what a disappointment nothing. I honesty do not recommend anyone to go see this movie. I think you would have more fun at the dentist than in this film. So save the agony and just do not see it.
