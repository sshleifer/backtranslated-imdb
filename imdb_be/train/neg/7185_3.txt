I was drawn to see this film because of the story and my desire to see the horror. <br /> <br /> To my disappointment, it turned into more of a comedy than horror. Action, dialogue, and the flow of the movie everything was very poorly done. A lot of this does not make sense. For example, there is a party of about 30 people, all of them in horror from one person, in spite of them to be in a secret place, and all the healthy-looking young man and threatened they feel exhausted. All the time I thought maybe it was a parody of another movie like a scary movie, but they were trying too hard to make it disgusting -. Focused on trying <br /> <br /> Blood and blood too poorly done. I have seen the Halloween costumes look more plausible than that. Guy with his head cut clean off ... looked clean - no signs of bone, flesh, blood, and even the head. Strong kick down with an ax on the body should apply themselves to something ... It seemed that the guy was swinging the bat instead of an ax. <br /> <br /> Revealing who the main villain was supposed to be a turn, but contrary to other parts of the history. What happens in the head guy to turn out like this? When he should be a turn, you should at least build him adding mystery and suspense.
