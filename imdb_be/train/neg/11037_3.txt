I love this episode where Jim gets GreenMan. It's great! If Jim throws the little man through the window, a look on his face is invaluable. Then, when it begins to turn to Priest in the name of his wife only to find that she was Pee-woman? Much writing and great casting with great acting make this a must see. I'm trying to find a specific photo from this episode. I would like to use it as my avatar on the bulletin board, because I think that Greenman oars. Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim Greenman like? Can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a picture?
