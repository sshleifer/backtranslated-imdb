I saw this film in its screening of High Falls Film Festival in New York, and I must say that I found it horrible and full bore. Despite the fact that it was interesting in some places, the only real laugh that seems to be the real plot to speak of, and acts in some places it was terrible and wooden, particularly «Lovely Lady» and the narrator's voice (which I never never heard) had a lot to be desired. J.C.Mac was, I felt, the redeeming feature of this film, the present action, and grain, and (from the cast) a single real action. I am confident that with other cast and tighter reign on the direction, it could half decent film. Let's hope it does not go on general release, or, if you really want to get a copy, look in the bargain bin at Lidl.
