I was waiting for this movie for a long time. Especially because Chawla in this, she is a good actress. <br /> <br /> This film consists of six stories. This new concept has flown over from Hollywood. So this is not a new item. <br /> <br /> 1. Khamini (Prianka) is a dancer. She wants to become famous and was a boyfriend that reporters be interested in it. But Rahul (Salman Khan) is, and he says that her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Priyanka has not a very good actress. When she cries, I'm angry. Salman Khan can not play comic roles. But a painful parts of it is amazing. <br /> <br /> 2. Vini (Anil Kapoor) married to Sim (Chawla). He gets into the mid-life crisis and is attracted to a young woman from forgetting what he actually has in his life; his wife and children. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor Juhi an innate actors / actresses. They are great. But this story is thin for them. <br /> <br /> 3. Shiven (Akshay Khanna) is going to marry Gia (Ayesha Takia), but he gets cold feet and injuries wedding off. <br /> <br /> 4. Ashutosh (Zhoh Abraham) married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). She gets into an accident and suffers memory loss. Now she knows that she loves her husband. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) is a taxi driver. He meets Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz), which is a white woman who is in love with an Indian man, but he is going to marry an Indian. Raju Staphani to bring to the man, but falls in love with her. <br /> <br /> I never liked Govinda movies. He is very annoying, not funny. But in this movie, I loved him very much, as it grows up in recent years. <br /> <br /> 6. Oh, yes! There Sohail Khan! He plays Ram Dayal, who had just married Phoolwati (Ish Koppikar). He wants to get some serious action with her, but each time her family had come between them. <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan Sun handsome actor, but he's funny! I like his movies. <br /> <br /> Now here's the problem. All these stories are not interesting. In order to make a story of six wholly interesting stories does not make the entire film interests you! Here and there the stories relate to each other, but this is not essential for the characters <br /> <br /> My conclusion. Priyanka can not act! Remove this woman in Bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should make more movies, this role was too small for him. Salman Khan can not play the role of the comic, but the real serious movies. It is written on his life as an actor. This movie sucks, and it's a waste of a good cast of actors and actresses, like Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshay Khanna and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> This is the same as you have the opportunity to make a film with Amitabh Bachchan, and only let him sing a lullaby.
