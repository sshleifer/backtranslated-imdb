This film is an excellent illustration of how not to do science fiction film. Worst trend in fiction, to make your theme terrible talk, pseudo-Orwellian / Huxleyan / whateverian «vision» of the "man of the future." <br /> <br /> science fiction filmmakers (and authors), in geek take on a very serious, given the high ratio of crap to the goodwill of things their genre. I think other genres with high CTGSR (yes, I just made it, relax) as horror or action, or even a romantic comedy seems to have a little better understanding of the fact that they do not change the world with some profound "message ". <br /> <br /> Sci Fi, of course, can be successful on a serious level, as well as many great filmmakers proved. But there is a big drawback of the whole concept, which is represented by "the Robot Jox" low-rent construction of the "future" (the lone element of good design: the strange, slippery forward shields ads all over the place, to encourage women to have more children) and his painfully heavy parallels "Iliad" (He NAME ACHILLES for God's sake! I do not really pick up on it until I saw the movie a coin for the tenth time, but I went to the school community, so the filmmakers are not rehabilitated.) <br /> <br / > Of course, if you're crazy movie freak like me, it's the reverse side m ie strong growth potential. I love movies like this, so how bad movies often more fun, and sometimes even more interesting than good. This kind of approach Bangs before watching the movie, I think, <br /> <br /> Note :. Lead in this film (? Harry Graham, his name I refuse to go check ?.) In fact, not so bad, he makes a go of it. He's kind of cool, especially if he's drunk / hung over.
