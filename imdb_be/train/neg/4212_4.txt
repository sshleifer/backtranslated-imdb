At the beginning of the film is excellent with a great sound and some good humor, but when the film moves in the animation it quickly loses its appeal. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons that it was so, at least for me, was that the color in most of the animation is too dim, too little contrast. It does not look good, at least on VHS. After a while it flares up and looks great, but not often Moreover, the characters come and go too fast. For example, I would like to see more of "Moby Dick". If the film starts to pull, however, it raises again to the input of the dragon, and then the movie ends strong. <br /> <br /> In general, just not memorable enough or are not able to compete with the big animated films of recent decades.
