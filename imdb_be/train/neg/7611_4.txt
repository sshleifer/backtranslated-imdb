First I watched 2/28/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - DVD-version, which I have seen under the name "3 Days of the Condor" - Yes, so the CIA drama full of easy performance makes for a very relaxed film. The premise of the story revolves around a 7 out of 8 members of the CIA's research group have been killed since Robert Redford's character, code = Condor, he was the one who was left. Who killed them and why? That's what Redford tries to find out, trying not to be the eighth victim at the same time. Along the way, he gets the character of Faye Dunaway is involved, primarily because he needed a place to hide, and then it eventually helps him after some time sweet Lyuba. This is one of the few innocent guy on stories to run, but this one is not much suspense. Flat views do not help, and Sun finish seals the deal for the audience enough either. Despite the presence of a good director in Sydney Pollack's group and classical performers, story and performances are not what they should be, and so the film is not what it should be.
