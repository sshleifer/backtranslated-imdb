This film is actually worse than most movies I've ever suffered through, and I've experienced a lot. Absolute nonsense. He has a horrible, forced dialogue; nonsensical plot development; really drawn scenes "ghost images" that are more like a high school remedial art project than a horror film; 5-10, at best, attractive women; long, boring sex scenes involving women said (forget what you know about virgins especially those with lop- other fake breasts!); muttered, difficult to understand the speech of some of the characters; and they actually used the mask of the killer clown from outer space during masturbation scene that is to be the saving grace because the movie was pretty fun, but it is not. Veden Fell Lamest is the bad guy in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> Absolutely give this a miss.
