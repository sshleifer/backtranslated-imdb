The same problem I have with the musical version of "Les Miserables" applies equally to the "Oliver". Instead of writing the composer's stylistic period of the game settings, they just wrote the Broadway melody type, which have been historically and stylistically unidiomatic skewed. <br /> <br /> Also, blatant cruelty and ugly drama activities not mix well with some of the solar ditties that permeate through. It's uncomfortable mixture that leaves the strongly acidic undertaste <br /> <br /> Casting boy Oliver does not help matters :. Indicative tone and vexingly precious, there is something less than solid here. Fezhin performs its traditional procedure adequately, although it is obliged to sing the melody is little reason in the manner of the period. <br /> <br /> Â«As long as he needs me," are poignant rendition, throat and tense. Two large production numbers, "Who will buy" and "Consider yourself" seems to be over-produced, with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in. It's one thing to go to any one else to cross the line into excess. <br /> <br /> darkness, despair and depravity most of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography. Although the novel is considered a classic, I have to admit I have a problem with the consciousness of Mr. Dickens, that his works usually emit negative vibrations. This may be due to the expansion of its bleak personal life, which was full of disappointment and regret. <br /> <br /> Not all combined talent of these products, either on schedule or behind the camera, can overcome the non-constructive nature of the base material. All this leads to uncomfortable Downer experience for me. <br /> <br />
