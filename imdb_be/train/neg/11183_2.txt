"People I Know" is a clunker with no one to root for, and no one to take care of -., Despite the efforts, the game is the talented cast <br /> <br /> Pacino delivers his usual show of force, Eli Wurman, past-his-prime advertising agent, hollowed out of a lifetime of moral corruption. But unlike Michael Corleone, it is impossible to have an emotional investment in the character of his dilemmas, his fate. <br /> <br /> The film traces the preparation of Eli in favor of a liberal political affairs, while distracted by the client (Ryan O'Neal, good in part guaranteed), the last "dirty laundry" - in this case, the TV actress companion , get connected with the wrong people. Tea Leoni brings her usual stellar this secondary role, although, again, the script does not give her a lot of work. A sister-in-law Ali, Kim Basinger was able to elicit sympathy, despite the implausible plot mechanics. <br /> <br /> This film is only for those who like to watch Pacino strut his stuff, and use the other principal. Unfortunately, between the script and direction, "People I Know" is strictly amateur. Thus, its limited theatrical release and fast way to DVD. Consider yourself warned.
