Over the years I've seen a bunch of them directly to the video Segal movies, and each has the same number of entertainment; unfortanetley, level of entertainment at a low level. Of course, the action sequences are fun, but that was pretty much it. Segal was really in his prime, when he wanted to movies; Under Siege, Under Siege 2 and ordered (at least in terms of action), but in the last ten years, these types of films that star Seagal does not correspond to his previous training. <br /> <br /> On the more positive side, the film made a good use of time, as some of the action sequences and the use of wit. Only if the film seemed to just drag on, pretty cool action scenes brought him out of the ditch. I sincerely believe that more films would Segal better if he was not the only one that the supporters recognize in the film. Supporting actors and actresses are very important thing, and if his current films were these known supporting actors and actresses, perhaps, the film will get more popular results.
