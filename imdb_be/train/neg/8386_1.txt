Loosening of the film alone, like shooting fish in a barrel. It's too easy. So I'm going to challenge myself to recognize the positive aspects of a little man. First, I am impressed with the special effects. It actually looks Wayans head was attached to the body of the little man. I never doubted it for a minute. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I liked some of the unexpected Kama. David Alan Grier playing annoying restaurant singer, and his extradition "Havin 'My Baby» and «Movin' On Up» were priceless. John Witherspoon, who, coincidentally, played Grier's father in 1992 boomerang (if you remember, that he was "coordinated" mushroom mushroom jacket with belt) currently plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. So that was fun. <br /> <br /> In addition, this film is about as believable as White Chicks. How dumb is when even the doctor can not say that this 40-year-old man, not a child? He has a full set of teeth !!! How is it possible that no one seems to have noticed that it is not a child? Little Man is so bad that there is a cameo by Rob Schneider. And please, if you are stupid enough to spend $ 8 on the film, at least, do me a favor and do not bring their children. This movie is too sexy for young children (a lot of jokes and hints about sex, which descends, restaurants, etc.), and I felt bad for the parents who brought their child to the screening, I was forced to endure. If you insist on seeing a stupid movie, as the least spare their children from pain and suffering.
