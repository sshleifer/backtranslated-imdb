This film is really, I mean really, I suck. It got so huge plot holes, and the 30-foot dragon can pass through them. Not to mention the dragon, which is inevitably the worst computer images ever put to film real. I mean, if you see something like this, you have to think, "Wow, someone actually did this film. Then let him go. It takes courage. " Who they are, I'm sure they do not work in the movie business more. <br /> <br /> When I rented this film, he was not on DVD, so I (reluctantly) took it on video. The first thing that seemed to be the Lord of the Rings trailer for two towers. It was a very smart move by putting this trailer video. This justifies (reluctantly) giving the film one star, otherwise I would give it zero stars. Maybe the producers at Pearl Dean Cain (I think thats how you spell it) will draw in a crowd (uh, in the video store, that is). <br /> <br /> Then they used a split screen technique (as Hulk) to (I guess) to compensate for the fact that the crime of this piece of shit movie. On the cover of the box, we see a picture of our character and the dragon. It looks whether the dragon is really like in Dragonheart, or is it just me? In any case, the dragon in the film looks like a reject from Gremlins 2, and has a CGI Nintendo video game villain from the beginning of the 90s (probably worse). In addition, not a movement of the Dragon, as it pursues its victims- the same F ## CKING monotonous movement- the right foot, left foot, right foot to left leg- house, house, house, DOM house, DOM F # $ king DOOOOOM! It just pisses me off. Perhaps the filmmakers thought it was fascinating and would have the same effect as Jaws. Why not have a Dragon POV shot. In any case, it was just ridiculous, just like watching Whibley toon. <br /> <br /> Dean Cain gives a lot of goggles during the film (perhaps his coming to terms with the fact that this film could have ended his career). Do not wait for Superman here. The first time I saw the trailer for this film, I thought it was an add for PS2 games. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it is so so bad, my 5-year-old brother can come up with better ones when it unconvincingly tries to lie about why he did not do anything in my room, while I I was not there. Oh, and did I mention that the F @ # KING hate people who make it incredibly brutal shit Stupid STUPID MOVIE? !!!
