"Little man," now on DVD, is a Wayans Brothers flop. This is a story about less than a midget criminal Wayans plays, hides a diamond in the women's purse after the robbery. He and his partner Tracy Morgan cook genius plan to disguise Marlon, as a child, and put him in the women's house. It then passes through all kinds of "Home Alone" or "child's play", as the chaos to get the gem back and be treated like a child. I was amazed at how low the humor in this film. Jokes have been made in other places, so many times that they are not cute or funny. I almost think the film would be funny if they were not using CGI and used a small actor, Marlon's face was plastered. When viewing the deleted scenes (minus the CGI), this was funny actor in a mini-me, as a way, but they chose a different route. Several Kama and Tracy Morgan to do some funny scenes..Spend your rent amount to $ Borat, if you want some real laugh these days. <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
