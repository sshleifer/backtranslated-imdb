From the 1988 Writers Guild of America on strike, they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. This is pretty much crap, which consists of re-cut + pasted clips from Season 2 and has been described by its author, Maurice Horel as "awful, just awful.Â» <br /> <br /> Why the producers could not just wait to shoot something decent, who knows. I believe that due to the strike the production ran out of money and can only release the episode flashback or maybe Roddenberry was too ill at the time, to be able to veto this half assery. This episode also marks the final appearance Maldur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series.
