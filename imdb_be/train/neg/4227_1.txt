I was stunned that I actually sat and watched it. I love independent films, horror movies, and all the zombies on the whole thing. But if you add Ninga, you've crossed a line that should never be crossed. I hope that the people in this film had a great time doing it, then at least it was not a waste. You never know, watching it, though. Scenario? You're kidding. Acting? I think that even the trees pretending. Cinematography? Well, there must have been a camera there. Period. I do not think there was any actual plan to participate in the making of this film. Such a complete waste of time, do not extend it further comment.
