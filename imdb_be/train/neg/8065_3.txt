Steve Carpenter can not shoot horror movies. First of all, it was very bad casting for this film. The only decent part was the hot brown-haired girl with Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This movie has not dried blood (usually a key ingredient for a horror film), no action, and not acting entirely unknown (also a key ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actor, but he's so dry and clear in that it is boring. There were a few parts that were supposed to be funny (continuing teen horror / comedy films), and no one laughed in the audience. I thought that this film has been rated the R, and I did not pay attention, and I realized that it was changed to PG-thirteen Anyway, see this movie, if you like, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. It is the only person who would find this film even remotely scary. But seriously, you Steve Carpenter, stop shooting horror films. This film makes Creek look The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
