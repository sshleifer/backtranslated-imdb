Shame on Yash Raj films and Aditya Chopra, who seem to have lost their intellect for many years and provide a stable rate of the scar in this part of the cinematic shit is not even worth Tube You standards. I gritted his teeth throughout the flick from start to finish with schizophrenic direction, plot lines that never materialized, and at the last stage I'm just embarrassed that my country and its Crorepati filmmakers can "throw" crores on such nonsense. actors shame for this work and even comment on it as a part of the work, which they may have to. Saif Ali Khan Fully disappointed in the selection of the film. Kareen showing enough skin for puberty affected and Akshay comes in a dim-wit. Anil further delay with fluffy charm in English. His accomplices were commendable in their actions and bizarre cinema scattered in the last 15 minutes, it was enough to pop a blood vessel. Do not waste your brain cells, energy or money to go watch this- Go SEE / Rent AMU c Konkana Sensharma instead- Thats a beautiful piece of independent film ever get out of India.Intelligent, poignant and beautiful story, a fairy tale that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me hope that all is not lost in the Indian movie-making.
