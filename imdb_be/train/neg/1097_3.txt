I understand that the US army was demoralized in 1971, but this movie was incredible. He was supposed to be a training camp is not a punishment battalion of the SS in the novel Sven Hassel. The writer must be a real hater army. Psycho sergeant went on to beat the crap people belonged in a prison cell, and useless Black sergeant was fired as well. These people went abroad, receiver units, no doubt wondering where all the damaged unfit recruits come, and the investigation would be fastened. The scene that blew it was completely electric one. Farrell, the lawyer alleged the barracks, would have on the barrel instructor for issuing an unlawful order (to torture a prisoner of war in violation of the Geneva Convention), the actual attack on the enrolled person, sexual assault and indecent conduct officer. Intead it just goes away. After that, discipline brakes down to the level of a madhouse and the film becomes unwatchable. I do not know how it ended, I went to sleep.
