Well, my girlfriend and I rented DVD and about 30 minutes of the film, we have shared a lot of "ehhy that the film is about, and more importantly, I take care to see that it ends" look and decided we either need drugs to keep us interested in the "story" or just end the pain right there, and then look for something else. We chose the latter. <br /> <br /> I liked the "incorrigible" a lot, but Mango Kiss is too silly and surreal for my taste, sorry! I definitely prefer the «D.E.B.S», «Better than chocolate", "Fucking Amal", "Golden memory Fish" and "Fire". <br /> <br /> -Sorcia
