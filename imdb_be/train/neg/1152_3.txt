I understand that this film is trying to portray. How old are often ignored and treated like trouble, and this means that they end up feeling unappreciated and how their lives are empty. <br /> <br /> I do not have a problem with this message, but I just feel that it could pass such a way that it is not so painful to watch. I like a good feature film, but when the film becomes too shy Arty (as in this case), the result is often disappointing. Including shots of man packing a suitcase slowly that takes 5 minutes to try to make a point, but only end up annoying the audience. <br /> <br /> Female characters are very weak, and you'll eventually want to just tell them to pull it together. This is a film that you feel that you have to enjoy or high speed, and certainly has its merits, but I was too upset by watching what ever recommend it to someone else. This can have a deeper message than other films by Roger Michell (such as "Notting Hill"), but at least it was a film that you can enjoy the view.
