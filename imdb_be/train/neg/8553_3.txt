It is actually a very bad movie. Ideology is not as vicious as in these films Collins made later. However, my main concerns about the film is that it's incredibly boring and quite frankly for a long time. The whole concept of the person of ex-SAS connections terrorists for no apparent reason is not very convincing, and you can not wonder why a group of highly organized terrorists (who later became quite ignorant) falls on it. The film begins with a pretty powerful scene, but then meanders for quite a long time before the construction of the big final. In general, I think, who dares wins might be interesting 45-minute episode of professionals, but the story is not of a feature film. Although quite successful at the time this film initiated the demise of the career Collins, who in the eighties mainly because of cheap and dubious fortune soldiers off-year war films. It is a pity, because it is actually a pretty versatile actor, but in the end Martin Shaw a carefully selected roles and has a career that is still successful.
