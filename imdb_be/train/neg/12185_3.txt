What ever possessed Martin Scorsese to remake this film? And not only did he alter it completely destroy it? Senseless decision to make the character played by Robert De Niro (in his best performance overdone, and that says a lot) in a religious fanatic funny, and application relationships entertained Hollywood (and Mr. Scorsese especially) - relations that make the author think that the best way to make a mad character to the crucifix tattoo on his back. In any case, this film is terrible. <br /> <br />
