This title is more like film-making exercise than a film that was to be released, to be seen by the public. For Defoe and his wife must have been fun to work together in a film for the first time, not paying attention to what people can actually watch it. I felt that it was 90 minutes wasted, as I was looking forward to a conspiracy to development, or even start. <br /> <br /> Trying to comply with this film in the genre, and you will not, because it lacks a beginning, middle and ending. I saw the movie "artistic" before, and it does not even come close to the arts, an essay or original, it just seems to me completely pointless. <br /> <br /> I think it speaks for itself, unless the person who rated the movie 10 was under 18 age group. Without a doubt, for constant meaningless sex scenes that the film was persistent to throw at us. That is, if you can call it erotic. This, of course, has no taste.
