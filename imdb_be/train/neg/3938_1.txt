Not even Timothy Hutton and David Duchovny can save the dead fish from the movie. Firstly, the script was clearly written to be in the B-movie, but something spiritual (looking star vehicle to raise itself from the TV) and Hutton (looking for "two" with "one-two punch," he hoped, that will define his career after "Ordinary people") attached to the film Merry line, big bad wipes from scene to scene (let's -. who uses cloth after grade 12 grade Telecommunications), and plain old bad? the current sink of this film. Even the spiritual Sun insured against bad actor plague, which this film. Tol ki Timothy Hutton rises above the material at all. I have to admit, feeling spiritual pain as he read the lines that are off-screen. While I found that laugh when I am sure that the director wanted to feel horror, nothing prepared me for the closing line in the voiceover Duchonvey: "If you ever need a doctor, do not forget to call 911." If only the studio had called 911, that dog film would never have been. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
