This movie is really bad, so bad that even Christopher Lee can not save poor it.A story even worse scenario and a bad direction makes this a truly outstanding horror film, a prominent part in the fact that it is the only horror film that I can honestly say I would never look again.This garbage makeup plan nine from Outerspace look like Oscar material.
