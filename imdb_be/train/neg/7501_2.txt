I went to this movie is waiting for a short film relating the effect of the Son of Sam had on society. I did not expect that Spike Lee to force feed me more garbage on racial tensions, MOB-justice, or the inability to make a choice man in the street, under pressure from their peers. Or presented an extreme opinion. <br /> <br /> The entire film could have been more effective if the 90-minute format with more focus, less related sub-schedules. <br /> <br /> Don "did not even bother to rent a video, you do not get pleasure warmly by Spike Lee; In this case, the theater stands. This is not the fugitive film.
