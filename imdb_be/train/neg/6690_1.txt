I sat down to watch this movie with your friends with very low expectations. My expectations were not anywhere near low enough. I really can not say that the genre of the film was on the show, and if it was a comedy, humor has been fully released. The plot did not exist, and the effect was terrible. My friends and I had time to look about 30 to 40 minutes of the film, before we expelled him and immediately asked for the video store to get it back. I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are deliberately trying to look the worst movies of all time. I honestly do not know how this film lasted more than a day, in theaters, and besides, I can not understand why anyone would want to watch it, taking into account not only a very uninteresting title, but also the absence of any well-known actors / actresses is cast. This review is not a joke, and I honestly think that this might be the worst movie ever made. This is definitely the worst film I've ever had to sit through.
