awful, just awful! my old friend number is used to watch this garbage and it drove me crazy. book is one of my favorite and it's a shame that some people will never know what it's really like, because their first impressions of the dig like this. they have changed so much that hardly recognizable. that worries me, because the book reads like a soap opera, in any case, providing enough food for today's entertainment. this is like one of those movies that Lifetime say "based on a true story," but are entirely fictional. none of the emotion or the depth of the book, just meaningless melodrama. if you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading, I suggest you try another option.
