All logic goes right out the window of the train in the British horror film, located in the London Underground and in the title role is generally reliable Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), Franka plays Kate, an entrepreneur in the way of the party office to meet up with friends who sleep on metro station, only to wake up and find it was locked, and find themselves being chased by "someone" or "something" with killer intentions. <br /> <br /> hole land and unbelievability a lot and there are very few things that are really nervous / scared, but many are simply boring. <br /> <br /> generally unpleasant film that just needs to be closed under the ground forever and make all us grace. <, Br /> <br /> The only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor Ken Campbell, who did better than that ?? it even including «Erasmus Microman»!.
