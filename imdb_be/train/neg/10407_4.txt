I found Tremors 4: The Legend Begins to be boring and boring.All action scenes were stupid.The so-called «GRABOIDS» reduced to the size of the modern day domestic cat, if not smaller.The action was terrible, and this film was just not needed film in the saga of tremor, because even if he tells the story of how was formed graboids, the story is so stupid and useless.Also, if you want to tell a story WAY back in time, make sure you use the same actor (Michael Gross), to be someone in the past, when someone currently in other Tr mor movies.Geez ... If you have not seen this movie, do not waste time.Stick to tremor, 1, 2 and 3, for the film a good time.This however, make sure you deleted sit right next to you with the help of a button Stop working for the rapid retreat of this nonsense.
