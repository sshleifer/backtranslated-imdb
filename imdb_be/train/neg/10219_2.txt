Soldier Blue Film with the claim: the claims to be some profound statement about man's inhumanity to man, on the white man's exploitation of and violence against indigenous peoples; biting, caustic comment adamant Vietnam horror. Well, sorry, but it is not a pity to be any of these things. Soldier Blue that actually harmful, corny, poorly made, dishonest garbage. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer here hit the nail on the head to say that it seems to be a hybrid of two very different films. The fact that it mostly is inaccurate, stereotyped, poorly acted "odd couple" romance - Strauss and Bergen overcome their prejudices on lifestyle and other fall in love (ah, bless) - bookended two heinous massacres that would not have been on the -this place to splash swing Fulci. <br /> <br /> There's no excuse for the disgusting, lascivious, of Gore-soaked climax in which cute little native American children in different shot, sliced, divided and planted in love and plan to schedule large, and a large family breasts American women clung, raped and did not take - not an excuse, that is, except for the box office. (Itself a massacre, while repelled in the abusing intentions, very poorly staged and shot, a lot of actors, lying around with bright red paint smeared on them, punctuated with a few special effects sequences beheading / separation - dismemberments, among other things which used real amputees have set. Now what I call service). <br /> <br /> Forget all you have heard PPU (including the ridiculous comments that begin and end the movie) about it being "protest" an indictment of American brutality against indigenous peoples. This movie does not matter about the plight of Cheyenne; I had to do it, so that would show some featuring native American character, would lead us to know and take care of the nameless, faceless innocent people who are suicidal at junction. Instead, what we get is a stupid white bread romance Bergen and Strauss (lousy actors in this, at least), with plenty of blood, guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious. <br /> <br /> Which is a terrible shame, because the film will be made about the massacre of Sand Creek, all real-life massacre in the US (and the UK, and all the so-called "civilized" peoples) took part in the course of centuries (Iraq ?). it's just not the same movie.
