This is one of the two post-apocalyptic fantasy films that Pyun made in 1993 - and it is bad one. Apparently, all his energy went into «Nemesis», which was an interesting non-stop action of the film, and was much more expensive look. "Knights" clumsy and cheese, bottom-of-the-barrel sci-fi that too often resembles a video game (new enemies pop up constantly and must be destroyed as soon as possible). The only thing that saves this film from the dustbin Kathy Long; Sun is particularly attractive woman, but no doubt brutally effective fighting machine. As for Kris Kristofferson, given his age at the time (58), I hope that his understudy was well paid. (* 1/2)
