I'm not going to mess around with a plot synopsis, since you know that the film is about and almost no plot, anyway. I have seen some reviewers called ISOYG Â«anti-rape" movie or even a feminist statement, and I just have to call in to the meeting of the hypocrisy of these requirements. <br /> <br /> First of all, what do we see on the cover of this movie? That's right: a slender woman behind. Whether it was an attempt Zarkhi to make a statement against rape - and I absolutely do not believe that it is - a completely inappropriate. Film marketing sex and titillation of sexual violence and the material is so graphic (everything except the actual penetration shown) that nobody but the hard core crowd like operation. <br /> <br /> Rape (s) in the film uncomfortable, brutal and hard to watch. There's something to be said to represent a terrible crime in this cruel world, but there was no reason for this scene to go on, it would seem, for 30 minutes, it does not. There was also a bit of character development, and the victim is only one of the rapists is slightly developed (mere moments before he was killed), so that the scene is not entirely engaged on an emotional level. In fact, it is simply presented for the sake of showing the extreme sexual violence, and you can tell from the films associated with ISOYG on IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.), which attracts crowds of operation only. <br /> <br /> Finally, some reviewers appreciated Zarkh the so-called documentary style and the lack of sound. But considering how inept everything else in the movie (acting, script, etc.) I suspect that it was a financial decision, and the film looks like a documentary, because he literally dislocated camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their thing. <, Br /> <br /> I'm not going to get everything on my high horse to talk about ISOYG content. I'm all for exploitation / horror and love video nasty. In fact, I give this movie three stars because it really does push the envelope a lot further than some of the other films. However, it is also poorly done, and after a rape occurs, just downright sad for the rest of the film, we watch a bunch of ho-hum, mostly Gore-less murders and wait for the credits roll. <br /> <br /> It is probably worth seeing once, if you're a hardcore fan operation 70s, but I tell you that the film as a whole is pretty bad, and really is not worth its notorious reputation.
