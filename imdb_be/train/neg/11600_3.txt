After the success of the 4, another sequel was a natural move. However, they need to stop it before it starts. Alice, having survived Part 4 reveals that she is pregnant, and it seems, of Freddy uses her unborn child to his victims, which, of course, are members of Alice. Amazing nightmare film, very hard on the religious imagery and bad acting. The special effects are good, but the film itself is not.
