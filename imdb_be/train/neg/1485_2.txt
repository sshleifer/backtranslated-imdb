For your own good, it would be best to ignore any positive reviews about this film. This movie stinks. Now, I like it (at least in theory) a low-budget horror films, but this one makes a worse mistake a low budget flick can do: It takes up WAY too seriously. And, unfortunately, it's not the only problem. <br /> <br /> This is the story of murderous Beane Clan British Ilses transposed to the present. Interesting premise, but there are two things that immediately confused about the movie once you start watching it. <br /> <br /> # 1 Why The biggest name on the CD box Jenna Jameson? It is below average looking woman, who can not act, and it has only a minor role. ANSWER: It is probably a well-known porn star (as you no doubt have read in other reviews), so I believe that this "cameo" appearance for her. It gives the film a much needed "name recognition" appears. Its top billing is not any indication of her talent, though, this is an indication of how worthless the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> # 2 How do filmmakers have been so stupid as to think Canada can be held in Ireland? He is not even remotely similar to Ireland. And the house that guests / victims to remain in the vast North American timber-framed Edwardian thing. They had missed the whole topic Bean and developed a story that took place in the NA In addition, if you are going to make a movie that takes place in Ireland, it is probably better to have more than one character with an Irish accent (and was really very bAD Irish accent.) Now, this would not be so bad if the director does not try to make the next "Night of the living dead", but it seems to me that he was. Too bad. He could have some fun with him. In fact, some of the scenes were not far from the unintentional comedy as they were. <br /> <br /> As with the notorious gutting scene, women were chained to the desk, stripped naked, and then cut and gutted. It's funny, you ask? Well, in a remote version of the scene, a mutant killer pulls out mile after mile after mile of the intestine. It's actually funny after a while. And he respects eater eats cancer, anyway? As we eat the intestines of cows and chickens? Heck no longer, we eat ham and rib and sticks. . Well <br /> <br /> Some of the other actors who were annoying: in a whiny, terrible Howard Rosenstein. I'm not sure, but I think he should have been cast as a stud. In fact, he is like a big loser and goof ball, as its name implies. That would explain why the character plays the same annoying Gillian Lee fell on him. <br /> <br /> I checked Lee Gillian on her link to IMDb, and, perhaps, it is important to know that she graduated from high school with honors. I can not decide if it's more funny or helpless to know that only a few years after graduation, honor student doing soft core porn nude scene in the shower with a guy named Howard Rosenstein. Interestingly, when her former classmates have seen this movie? If they have, I hope, they will receive a message: AVOID THIS DESTINY! GO TO college !!! I could go on and on, but why. If you like gore, you'll find something soothing in this film, but not much more.
