This movie was so scary it was almost good ... almost. We love musicals, but not this one. Even with a terrible sound quality, bad movie, and a lot of actors who can not sing or dance, Anthony Rapp really managed to give a good performance (especially towards the end). Marjorie character, drunken lady was nice to look at, too. <br /> <br /> The plot is very unexpected and might be funny without the awful singing and piano music cheezy. Admittadly, some of the songs (Fantabulous) quite catchy (but not in a good way). <br /> <br /> Open House is a fun movie to watch just because it's awful! We believe that this may be a good musical stage (with different actors).
