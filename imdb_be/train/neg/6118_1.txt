It is not very well telling epic Tarzan. There was only one occasion for this film. John Derek wanted to show his beautiful wife in the nude! After Derek in "10", at least the humorous movie, and there's a reason for the nudity and sex. This film is nothing more than soft porn. If you do that well, then fast forward to it and skip the rest! This film (as a bolero) was again the car After Derek to show its terrible effects. It is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, and a poster of her more exciting than the movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than that; it was one of his few mistakes! Do not waste your time on this movie ... go buy a book instead.
