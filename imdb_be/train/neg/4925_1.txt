Please do not waste your time. This film paraphrase the worst of Bram Stoker's Dracula (Van Helsing), Anne Rice's Vampire Lestat (rock music and silly biblical references) and the blade (high-tech toys). I love vampire movies and novels, and there are many out there that are very good. But it's not a bitch. Not even the soundtrack helps him, mainly because movies have resorted to absurd scary classical music instead of "Kick-Ass metal" some of them said. Only a few times I did not hear any metal; basically it was a tortured violin. Avoid it like the garlic and crucifixes.
