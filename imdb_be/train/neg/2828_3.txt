There seems to have been any number of films, both released in the 70s. And the fact that I can not remember the name of one of their hands is a measure of their influence. This is what novelists would call a "pot boilers". . They barely more than a means to maintain a film star in the eyes of the public <br /> <br /> We Micheal Caine, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden; more than enough names to get a bum on cinema seats. Each taste hero serve. Although one suspects that most of the audience all the same left disappointed. <br /> <br /> Their talents simply thrown away, and I am surprised that the star with so much money and such a reputation can be even so desperately needs, or in a good way, this kind of film is unlikely to resume add gilding. Sometimes, perhaps, the actors have to choose their director, and not vice versa. <br /> <br /> It was quite obvious that it would be crap, even from the beginning. It is ridiculously inadequate fights jazz music theme, which can also be seen every time we need some incidental noise, the atmosphere had all the belief elevator Muzak. Who imagined using jazz band when the scene is depicted sultry jungles of Central Africa, or the endless sugar with camels and palm trees in the background? Definitely a serious gaffe ball. Ennio Morricone would know what to do; and its results would be oozing atmosphere and enough power to raise my rating good two points. This director must worked Watch "Lawrence of Arabia", or even Westerns of Sergio Leone; He could learn a few things. But then again, maybe he would not. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock played the wife disappearing theme good effect in his film "Crazy." Later it was rebuilt with equal panache staring Harrison Ford. In each case, confusion and loss of its voltage chase was palpable. Here, when Michael Caine could be otherwise have to use a small brain and bravado, Rex Harrison kept popping up with no-where, as some clever old genius to put it back on track when the narrative stumbled. <br /> <br /> At least the picture was pretty good, with excellent use of the beautiful environment. But then mute the music must blow pipe and the atoms of the little atmosphere created. <br /> <br /> The action scene was too far-fetched and unnatural, such clumsily choreographic fight sequences, they may have been staged in the first-year-old drama class. And, of course, the players have to deal with jazz accompaniment - just like you <br /> <br /> But how many comments like this one point deserves .. Except to say that the script was pretty miserable as well . <br /> <br /> Stick to your hobby on it. Even if it contains your favorite movie star, you're sure to be disappointed too.
