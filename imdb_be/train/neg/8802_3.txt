Look, I loved CORRECT Anchorman movie, but it was reaaaaallly bad. Kind of bad that makes you want to get that time back in your life, the kind of bad that makes you think "What on earth were they thought to take it in the first place," such as bad, making you wish you made more than 50 minutes when going to the kitchen for a snack during the movie, like the poor, making leprosy look fun, kind of bad that makes you think you want, you made a movie Pauly Shore instead ... .seriously, I can not explain how it was very bad. <br /> <br /> Having said that .... there were some semi-funny QMS camping, but they are so much smaller than the ridiculous than Anchorman. Of course, they tried to make it interesting and fun, but all the story that left a TV host who made it here was really dropped for a good reason ... it was not even a little well. <br /> <br /> do yourself a favor (or in the United States, benefits), not to watch this DVD ... it will cast a shadow over a good movie, which has a TV presenter and you do not want to do it. <, Br /> <br /> well ... I'm good now.
