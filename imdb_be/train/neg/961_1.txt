Silly, simplistic and short, GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: WOMAN WITH NOWHERE) is going nowhere <br /> <br /> This short (just over sixty minutes) is not so much a tale inspired by classic spaghetti western as. plagiarism is Sam Raimi's Quick & THE DEAD (his acknowledged respect for the spaghetti western) are presented in a contemporary setting. RAPID and DEAD, character Sharon Stone is trying to avenge the vile sheriff (played by Gene Hackman), who, when she was just a hedgehog, put the fate of his father (a short cameo by Gary Sinise) in her hands; she accidentally shot him in the head. In GUN CRAZY, Saki (playing a deft Ryoko Yonekura) seeking revenge sneaky Mr. Tojo ~ d (played with minimalist appeal Sing Tsurumi), who, when she was just a hedgehog, located fate in the hands of his father; she let her foot slip off the clutch and dear ole dad and quartered on the floor of the truck. The only significant difference, in spite of the parameters is the fact that Toho sadistically maim Saki with ?? Well, I will not spoil it for you if you choose to watch. <br /> <br /> In short, Saki ?? pale imitation "man with no name" in the Clint Eastwood ?? goes to the city ?? Basically, there are auto shop and a tavern near the US military base, so I think that it is enough for the city ?? spoiled Tojo, local crimelord with a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored. Confessing their true nature as a mercenary, Saki takes on local militants in firefights, whose choreography bares more than a passing resemblance to the work of John and John Woo. Of course, the end of the movie Saki experienced its fair amount of torture in the hands of the bad guys, but it rises to the occasion ?? on his knees, in a ridiculous attempt to surprise ending ?? and punish all their enemies with the rocket launcher. <br /> <br /> Do not ask where she gets a rocket launcher. Just see for yourself. Try not to laugh. <br /> <br /> The image quality is average for the DVD release. There is a grainy quality of a few sequences, but in the end, it's not a bad translation. The sound quality leaves little to the imagination at times, but, again, it's not a bad translation. <br /> <br /> Most likely, this is a bad film.
