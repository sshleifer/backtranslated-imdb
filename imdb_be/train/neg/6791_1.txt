This is a film about animal cruelty. Under the guise of a marathon, we see scenes of extreme cruelty to animals, while those in the literal sense of a running horse to death in slow motion. The guy who did it, that is, his conscience spiritual cleansing flame of burial / burning horse, which, of course, still dead, being tortured to death. This is one of the craziest, slimiest movies that I have ever had the displeasure of watching. Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line on their dying animals, we have to admire their spirit to finish the race. I would like to put a producer and director in the marathon race; I'll decide when they are finished, probably about 20 minutes after breathing stops.
