Absolutely ridiculous movie. I live in London, and the plot is so poorly designed it was funny. No one can be terrorized on the London Underground. In a short time he was not in the service of the team every night there the staff there checking the tracks and carry out repairs, etc. That is homeless people living there, it is equally unlikely. Or is it at all possible to be recorded and do not have access to a mobile phone in this day and age ... <br /> <br /> The worst that is likely to happen if someone found myself there after last train that they could get the graffiti sprayed on them. Although it is already coming under control because of the huge number of security cameras in the network, another thorn in the side of the story. (Remember, in London as a whole, we have more security cameras than any other city in the world). <br /> <br /> If it were established in the city I'm not familiar with, maybe I could have liked out of ignorance, but it is not a quality film, so I just could not bring himself to stop his disbelief and try and enjoy its banal little fairy tale, it's there. <br /> <br /> I would give 0/10 if such a rating existed! Perhaps the most disappointing movie that I ever thought I would.
