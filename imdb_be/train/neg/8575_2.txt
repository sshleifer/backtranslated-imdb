****** ****** Spoilers <br /> <br /> unfunny radio quiz show Kyser and his team is an ordinary excuse for Lugosi, Karloff and Lori to take a salary in this bland, sporatically watchable haunted house parody. Lugosi mystic whose sessions are subject to fraudulent attempts to deceive the heiress to the state; Karloff is the butler and Lorre is a professor who puts fake mediums, but it turns out that both of them are in cahoots with Lugosi. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kay Kyser and his group of 30-something year old "children" to reveal the truth to minimize the possibility of humor along the way. We do not recommend to anyone but the absolute horror Completist.
