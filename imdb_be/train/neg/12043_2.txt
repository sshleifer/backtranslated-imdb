Like Brad Pitt tremendously. He is an actor with a brain and mind, not to mention the face, chest and everything else. Since I saw him in "Thelma and Louise" thought it was bothering me who he reminds me of? "Troy" did it for me. He is the new Brigitte Bardot. The differences are obvious known. Man, American, etc., but Bridget Bordeaux comes to mind, however. He's so handsome, he is at his most effective when he plays against him. "Kalifornia," "12 Monkeys," "Fight Club," "Snatch" His self protesting humor makes him a man, almost affordable. Fortunately, "Troy" will soon be forgotten. Only still pictures with Pete, half naked in a delightful position sprint decorate the walls of the legions of fans of salivation. Surprisingly, «Das Boot» is one of the greatest films of the second part of the 20th century. Wolfgang Petersen makes this direction? Well, I think it would be very difficult to say no to the opportunity to work with the new Brigitte Bardot.
