Repressed housewife (annoying lisp Angie Dickinson, whose body double treats / terrifies us with extreme close-up of her tender) sexually bored husband and decides to expand out. This leads directly to a series of murders that will soon involve a high class prostitute (Nancy Allen, obviously, I'm in the wrong business if it can bring home $ 600 per night) and her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you are going to watch De Palma rip off (sorry, "pay tribute") Hitchcock, see "Sisters" instead. "Dressed to Kill" and loaded with style and technical skills, it is one of the most sticky thrillers I had the displeasure of sitting through. The plot is absurd and tired. It really shows some surprisingly effective jump scares and the reverse sequence of graphic murders that should please all the supporters horror, by the time they can go silly storyline, which must be dated as far back as 1980.
