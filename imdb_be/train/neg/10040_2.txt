... for this film defines a new low in Bollywood and has set the standard against which all the c ** p should now be compared. <br /> <br /> First of all, the beginning were really elements of style ... .and if handled well, could become a cult classic, a la fiction pulp or thug Desi ... but the story (was there one?) He begins to ferment, and at some point loses it. <br /> <br /> Throw in a mad don with an obsession for English, call center clever Aleko fatal metronome story, which can wear a bikini and a sari with the same aplomb, in levitation, gravity-defying hit man and a cop IC hundred (or a thousand) black cat commandos on their trail .... good ingredients in competent hands. But this is where I would like to ask the director: Sir, you have been smoking <br /> <br /> I am confident that this film will be remembered in the annals of Bollywood film industry - for what should never be done - an insult? Intelligence brain most deaf movie lovers. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the only mitigating in this matrix Desi plus Desperado plus Grindhouse capers is music ... watch ... hear rotation, and you will not be disappointed. Vishal- Shekhar came up with some very hummable melodies. <br /> <br /> How I wish the director had the money in the creation of some of the more eye candy .... <br /> <br /> As I finish, I want to actually do not know much, as does Akshay- x bullet wound disappear in microseconds ... that you editors do? Tashan, maybe ...
