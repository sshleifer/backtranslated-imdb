Stinkeroo that it was !!! At one time, much earlier in his career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorite - great shakes as an actress, but it is very nice and pleasant (in particular, in such films as "The Mark of Zorro" and "Blood and Sand") but when I saw this monstrosity, memories of her heyday faded quickly. The history is incredible and farce, the second operating speed, the supporting cast is unbearable. I can not think of a more immature performance no one compared with Tab Hunter and Donald Gray was supposed to be the most boring leading man, which they could choose. In addition to this, there were horrible pictures (and I mean not only the colors!) All associated with this must have shuddered when it was revealed.
