First, let's all agree that Lamas can not be regarded as an experienced actor, barely even decent, sometimes lousy. However, in this part of the @ *! ^ Called SnakeEater, the film industry as a whole declined. <br /> <br /> First of all, let's start with the plot. Vietnam vet named Jack Kelly, who is also the soldiers (which should be as tough as genuine leather strap, and then some, you can believe it when he pushes the sky nails through the leg 2 guys and presses them to the floor) He receives word that his family was killed, and his sister is kidnapped. So he goes on a solo mission to save his sister. If some potential, but is still pretty slim to begin with. <br /> <br /> Now the action. Being an actor myself, I am qualified to say that this was one of the worst acting in the history of art !!!!! Lama, well, himself. The donkeys playing Clampets / Deliverance rejects must be stretched and shot them behind the so-called views that are offensive to the actors all over the world, especially the talented one who never get their big break! <br /> <br /> And finally, action. Gunfighting so-so, at best, and the carnage in tears. I've seen more realistic view of the fighting on the Renaissance Festival (and they were quite a false view) <br /> <br /> The readers, listen to me: AVOID THIS CACA PART AT ALL COSTS! If it was the only film in existence, you would want to avoid it! Count the sake of your brain cells, do not watch this thing!
