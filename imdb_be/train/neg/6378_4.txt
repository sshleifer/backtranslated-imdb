This movie was funny sometimes, hell sometimes it was even ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I got a leitmotif of the film, though, is that women are responsible for all human ills. Every time a woman is depicted in the film, it being lazy, being profligate or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason. I do not think that the message involved is good for women or gays. <br /> <br /> But it's a comedy, but a work of art, so it's just someone views. Even if I do not agree with this, they are still entitled to it. <br /> <br /> funny film, but some of the comments others have made it simple stupid. Best film ever my leg.
