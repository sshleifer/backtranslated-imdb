«New Best Friend» Another entry in the "steal another woman's life" subgenre; the best of which are the "Single White Female" and "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle", which is worse than you can catch almost every day on the Lifetime Channel For some reason, this type of identity theft occurs exclusively for women <br /> <.. br /> There are only two basic ways to play this type of story. you can make a woman evil at the beginning and let the audience watch knowingly as she nurtures and sells her evil scheme. Or you use Misdirection to make her seem a good man as seemingly unplanned series of break events in her favor s, until it is revealed the evil in the climatic scene. Unfortunately, the creators of «New Best Friend» could not decide how they want to play and things crash and burn early. We first met with Alicia (Mia Kirshner) scamming financial aid office college scholarship money. Now we know that it is a bad person, and will consider all further activities with suspicion. But the director and the editor seems to have forgotten that this discovery was made, and spend the next 50 minutes laying Misdirection, to make us think, Alicia is a good man. It introduces a single element of the unknown, and not on whether it is evil, but that when the director and the editor smarter and stop wasting our time with clear disorientation. <br /> <br /> «New Best Friend" is suffering more than most from the teen movie curse plaster is too old to be a student of painting. There are really only two major parts, Hadley (Meredith Monroe) and Alicia (Kirchner). They were 31 and 26, respectively, at the time of production. It works almost 26-year-old Kirchner, when she plays Mouse version of Alicia, but she becomes bright when it turns into glamed-up version of Alicia. Monroe casting just a joke, about how with Nicholette Sheridan trying to convey to the classmate on "Lizzie McGuire." She looks much closer to the mid-life crisis than a term paper. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers must be owed a lot of grace, because at this age, the problem applies to the majority of the secondary characters. Taye Diggs, who plays the sheriff of the city is younger than most of the students. <br /> <br /> The basic setup is that Headley and two other rich party girl (played by Dominique Swain age 21 and Rachel True age of 35 years) are an undergrad roommates in college. They share (their student residence) in a family house, which is better and better, than furnished house on the Real World-New Orleans (premises more plausible than soccer moms playing students). Alicia moved to the mansion and begins to take life Hadley. At least, so Swain finally gets a roommate of his generation, so that the two can have a lesbian scene. maintaining performance Swain is the only good thing about the «New Best Friend» and her love scene with Kirchner is fantastic, so cool and artsy that it does not fit with any of the other segments, maybe it was subcontracted to a good director and cinematographer. <br /> <br /> unintentionally hilarious story is presented in a series of gloomy memories, unbridled sex and non-stop parties, each proceeded by a shot from Alicia comatose in a hospital bed. About half of the screen time is spent Kirchner lay motionless, with a pipe in his mouth. Not good career move Mia. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
