I was crazy, who made this film. I was even more angry, I lost precious moments of his life sitting still look at it. I could have been the work of wax and was more entertained. At least, Cherri makes me laugh until it hurts. I was a little confused at first, but then I caught on and realized what was happening. So far, the film was half-way through, and I let a procrastinator, but I always want to see things through. So I'm stuck, I watched the whole thing. Moreover, the actors are not as attractive as in cruelty, they simply are not convincing. I saw my nephew cry for attention more strongly than anticipated lust are drawn on the screen in this film. If you like bad movies with bad actor to watch it.
