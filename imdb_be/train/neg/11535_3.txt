Gillian Anderson arrogant, mobile, career woman who raises the working class Oik Danny Dyer for a night of fun. After a stupid accident in the countryside, they were violently attacked. After his recovery, and after a chance encounter with one of the attackers, their thoughts turn to what revenge ... <br /> <br /> I thought that «Straightheads» was awful. Violent, brutal, misogynist and unpleasant. If I was not disgusted that phrase a lot, I would call «Straightheads» video nasty. Of course, it was a film that had a budget release entirely straight to video in the dark in the 1980s. Frankly, I do not know how «Straightheads» received a release film. <br /> <br /> I'm not a prude. I am not against sex and violence in films, but they have to be married to a movie with) a good story, or b) good performance, or c) preferably, both. «Straightheads» was not. There is no progress in the story or the characters and too much left unsaid and unexplained. Fortunately, «Straightheads» went nowhere fast. He was only 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It was a shame, because it was the germ of an interesting movie here with a particularly interesting twist in the plot in the last third. How often do I say this, but it would be nice if it was done correctly. What a shame. I like very much, Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they were in hiding to nothing with this film. She, in particular, is very underrated (and still is particularly suitable). <br /> <br /> If you want to see good British revenge movie, rent or buy Shane Meadows Dead Man's Shoes ". It is a small masterpiece. Last weekend I saw him« This Is England »instead. of Ce Sera Sera. ..
