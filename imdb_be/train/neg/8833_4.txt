In the absence of actors of guilt (they put on great performances), the overall story was not very well done. The film starts with a great Singer: crazy old man makes the car a young native girl from the road. But then, we are forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with a whole new group of characters ... and we do not know why 40 minutes not to. It turns out that they are the ones who eventually discover the girl's body ... and the story progresses from there. <br /> <br /> While the story does pick up at that moment, it really does not go anywhere. After 2 hours, I asked myself whether it makes sense it was, or is it just to see the characters deal with accusations of racism and stupidity about how they handled the discovery? The story was ultimately unsatisfactory and felt unfinished. While the acting is good, there is strong support in the film to justify recommending it.
