My God, I give this film three stars out of ten for the following reasons. Final sequence again very effectively handled, and it was absolutely fun. this is what it gets three points. In addition, it was awful. it was not meant to be funny is that it is very obvious, but the dubbing acting from dubbed voices dialogue, they said, where part of the fun. actions are carried out, and / or are not performed also lead to more fun and / or throwing things on the screen. for example, when the whole city is cut and a small group of people standing on the balcony, looking as if they are watching the cooking glass, or "attempt" will run from the church in which they sit. <br /> <br /> the evil Mayor: I think something is happening on the street, so you have to go upstairs and look out the window <br /> <br /> Hero :. ok <br /> <br /> Evil Mayor :. Now this is my chance to make some idiot to go out and rotates around the fire being completely ineffective and getting chopped <br /> <br /> sequence of the insert in which it takes place <br /> <br /> Evil Mayor :. . Shoot, wait, I'll get this little baby, and it will go on the street and cry Papp, seemingly, obvlious to ensure that these rotting corpses are not just terrible strangers, but in fact a zombie, without flesh and skin or either, and it will lead them away, and I will run! insert the sequence in which it takes place <br /> <br /> Hero (top) :. He tries to run away again, fool, and he left the door open, he is stupid, it's a good kind of <br /. > <br /> Woman: where my daughter <br /> <br /> Hero (bottom now): I do not know, I can not see it anyway, and it was not outside, because I could not see her despite her being out there me and having a view of the whole area, and it stands on the street, where on earth can it be? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, someone will throw things on the screen after 10 minutes of this. so watch the first film with a couple of friends who have a few drinks, and make sure that by the time you get to watch this, you're absolutely blind drunk and can just giggle at the stupidity of it all. and there was not even any decent Gore, such a shame.
