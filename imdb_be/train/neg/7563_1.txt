Unfortunately, this film does no credit at all to the original. Nicolas Cage, rather wooden as actors go, fills the screen with a range of skills, Sun plussed to the top. Sun supporting cast is not better. <br /> <br /> The story remains the same as the original in terms of the stage of progression, but it is much worse. It does not provide sufficient detail to allow the audience to buy what is being sold. It turns out that it is only the poor bill of goods. Lack of faith can not be stopped, can not befit doubt will be given. The only aspect of the preservation of this film is that it's very visual, as the environment demands, and who would place intelligence to be commended. <br /> <br /> There was a large audience laughter and a few boos, literally, in the end. <br /> <br /> Disappointed! Wait until the original to come on TV, pour whiskey and enjoy.
