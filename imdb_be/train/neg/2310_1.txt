It was really bland film. Performances third year, and the dialogue is so unnatural, that sometimes seemed just rolled over and died. May the reason for renting is simple: Find a movie with the writers. I needed a visual aid for my presentation, so I figured, why not use the clip? Boy, I was wrong. After searching my local video store, I came across it, where it was suspiciously called "let go." I thought, "what the hey" and decided to give it a try. Well, I was very unhappy with the results. It was probably one of the scene, which I could use, and yet I nearly fall asleep because of the enormous banality clicks. So ..... I took it therefore took Ed Wood. There's a film that I can use as an example. Again, nothing would be presentable as compared to the nonsense that "Starfaker".
