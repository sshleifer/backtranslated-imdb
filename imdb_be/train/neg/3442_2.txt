I made this film solely on the fact that the lid is being appealed to me. However, as soon as the beginning of the film, I had regrets. It seems that they were using a home video camera to shoot this film, and let the little kid to do it. They also used inappropriate ghostly faces and figures to try to scare people, but I found, to laugh, I could put that together yourself and make the best of it. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, I felt that it had some really good ideas, but because of the quirky lines, and in some cases they operate were overshadowed. He had no direction. <br /> <br /> I do not want to sit through the whole thing because it caused me physical pain to watch it, but I always finish what I start, so I took a deep breath and continue, definitely my 98minutes life wasted. <br /> <br /> I'd save yourself from embarrassment, knowing that you have watched "Ghost Boat» and find something more interesting. I'm a fan of low budget horror films, but it was a big disappointment, I thought that nothing could worsen after the «Terror Toons», but it made me reconsider. Summing up the genre. <br /> <br /> * to ***** (star for ideas that have their worst fears of those who came to them)
