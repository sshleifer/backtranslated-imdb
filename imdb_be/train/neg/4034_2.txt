Dear. good throw, but to write and direct an art, and wit to write and direct the mind is a little problem. Even doing a good comedy, you have to obtain a temporary moment and right. Im not putting it all there were parts where I laughed out loud, but it was in a very few times. The main attention I was on a fast flowing dialogue, which has made some people annoying film. This may sound like a lot, reading the script in his head, but to get that, and the camera is another problem. And handmade camera does not give power to some parts of the film. The general management was good, but the script is not all that with me, but I'm sure you've read the script in my head it sounds good. Sorry.
