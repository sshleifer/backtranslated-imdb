I'm not going to bet that none of you knew that the famous conquistador Hernán Cortés made a preliminary exploration expedition to Mexico, before taking on the Aztecs. Well, what he did, because he never would have known about the T Rexs, staying one particular valley, where locals worshiped it as a god. <br /> <br /> This was understandable. What was not throwing blue-Ziering Cortes. Even blond hair made famous in Beverly Hills 90210, painted black, Yang looked positively ridiculous. At least he did not try a Spanish accent. <br /> <br /> This character Tyrannosaurus Azteca Mark Sanchez and later television series with a semi-recurring role in the Walker Texas Ranger as a detective Sandoval of Dallas paid he finds true love with the Aztec princess and life would be just perfect if it were not were those pesky prehistoric animals natives worship. <br /> <br /> Tyrannosaurus Azteca looks like they have used some excerpts from the famous series of Sid & Marty Krofft land lost. All that was needed for a Sleestak appears. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in getting this reconnaissance expedition, not quite make the history books by all means check Tyrannosaurus Azteca. Then try and sit through it with a straight face.
