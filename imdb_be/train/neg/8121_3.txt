Time is valuable. This film is not. I have to learn to ignore the critics who are raving about the little films like Fargo and this waste of time <br /> <br /> theater was packed, and all left with the same reaction :. In this film the critics happy? That piece of shit! <br /> <br /> Crook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter searching for and finding her white trash family. Get it? <br /> <br /> Act beautiful. <br /> <br /> production (lighting, scenery, editing, sound) is about two stories above steps 60 minutes. small and silly characters. I was offended by the fact that these people could not understand each other, that it was obvious to the audience; the audience muttering movie screen, the characters need to talk further. <br /> <br /> I had more fun clothes.
