Poor Whoopi Goldberg. Imagine her at a party at a friend, and she adds a comment in-depth political debate continues. People just look at it and say, "Oh, you know, you were the star of" Theodore Rex "." How anyone could take it seriously after it fell to be the star of this horrible piece of shit? Even small children will be cringing in horror at this thing. It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of "Sigmund And The Sea MonstersÂ». In fact, if you think about it, "Sigmund" was significantly higher than that. <br /> <br /> And yet, did it get done? According to ply manufacturer with an illegal substance before to tell him about it? See this disgusting crap at your own risk.
