the opening line of Joe Don says that everything about this film. It takes place on the island of Malta (island of helpless men) and includes Joe Don Baker dogging Italian mobster. character called Joe Don Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo), and all that he does in this film is being shot and arrested again and Oginski. Everything in the film hates it as much as everyone hates Graydon Clark. I loved the early Greydon painting, "Angel of Vengeance", because it was for shirne thriteen old boys. Avoid this film at all costs !!
