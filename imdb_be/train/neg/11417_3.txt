Youth group "Fire of St. Elmo" who had just graduated from college with difficulty, seem to be able to make it through high school is much less than four years in any prominent university. For the most part, these children are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, but the co-writer and director Joel Schumacher, it seems, to keep them as touchstones for a generation. From now obsolete composition "and newcomers" on the background of the account, which sounds very similar to "pet", and leaves that the lords of complacency that circle above us, "Fire" is void blaze, one that is even more embarrassing as years pass. * 1/2 ****
