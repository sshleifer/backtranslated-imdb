This is a very bad movie. I laughed once or twice, and the plot sucks! There is, perhaps, one funny joke, it's stupid, and it's sad. Through the entire short film, I fell asleep and wondering when it will end. <br /> <br /> No one person acts, and each act silly and ridiculous. Rob Schneider is behaving like an animal, not what I would have paid to see. It looked ridiculous, but the bottom line: Do not waste precious time on YOU SO ridiculous and absurd MOVIE <br /> <br /> I was wondering when he was going to end, even if it is short. cinema. In the beginning we thought it would be better; but it's even worse. Silly, all the way through. I left the theater, and I remember that the film is very bad for all. <br /> <br /> The writer and co-producer of this film is The Simpsons TV writer, but it is nothing like The Simpsons (this film sucks !!!)
