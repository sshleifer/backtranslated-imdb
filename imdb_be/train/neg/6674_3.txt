I have to admit that the draw of this film directed by Eduardo Sanchez, who helmets wildly popular and successful Blair Witch Project. In addition, this film is a kind of alien, and it sounded something like Stephen King Dreamcatchers, one of those movies that critics hated, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> But there is, unfortunately, I felt that for the most part, the change is a waste of time, so I'll keep this review short. The premises are always promising, and the changes are not different. He tells about a group of people who have experienced the amazing match when they were younger, and as usual, others will accept you as a crazy imagining things. Stories of alien abduction ever have to deal with the probes into the holes, so I will not go into details, but you get the drift of it is terribly uncomfortable, and what you would like to forget. <br /> <br /> What if you are given a chance to take revenge? That is, you were able to successfully hunt down and capture one alive. What will you do? For this group, it is a joyful payback period, or so they thought. And this is where the film begins to develop in snoozefest, with a bad, boring dialogue and even worse acting. Even if it is a low budget, there is not much redemptive factors, whether the power of the storyline, or any help from the actors in creating their characters just a little interesting. This is a standard cardboard fare from the usual vanilla scenario, in combination with a cheap scare tactic that works. <br /> <br /> What is good, although it's makeup. A lot of effort has been invested in the creation of some of the things that I will not mention because it will spoil very few elements that makes this film bearable. In addition, there are the usual cheap special effects, blood and bloody moments that nothing you have ever seen before. <br /> <br /> Watch it only in extreme cases. Compared with other film Monster in the city - a holiday, it's one less pleasure, and takes itself too seriously. Bogged down in a sad direction, you have been warned.
