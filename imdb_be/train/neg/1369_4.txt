Hekerling second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of 1930s gangster films, made in the tradition of the company Warner Brothers. Michael Keaton stars as the average age, gangster, looking back on his life of hard knocks when he catches a child tries to steal something from his pet shop in 1935, Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) have permanent health problems, so Keaton get into crime at an early age by Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, Fargan Richard Dimitri plays rival crime lord Boyle and Keaton eventually climbs the career ladder. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Denis Vermin, yeah, right, Parasites! Griffin Dunne younger brother Keaton approached the District Attorney, Glynnis O'Connor his wife, and Marilu Henner played Moll Keaton. The film looks like it is known, is cheap, which makes it seem like a TV show instead of a movie theater. <br /> <br /> film starts great and then slows down as expected after the first half. Through a combination of dialogue and gags, the film has its own in the first half, but then it quickly loses steam and goes down to the mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery make it the best James Cagney impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that only unpleasant, but not funny. Piscopo makes "just" a little bit once too many. Some support the actors try to hold the fort, Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a street vendor, Alan Hale, Jr. as the desk sergeant and Sudie Bond as unfair cleaner. The second half turns into a type of tonnes hit TV show and never recovered. Closing scene using the Roaring Twenties as an anachronism Call Of The Wild Clark Gable movie seen on the tents earlier in the film. I think Heckerling should have known better, as the target audience will no doubt be aware of the actual date of release 1939 Roaring Twenties. * 1/2 out of 4 stars.
