Bought this movie in the bargain bin at Rogers Video store for $ 2 I like a good B movie now and then, and thought that it looked like a good one. <br /> <br /> In the film rather cliche "1970" and a very groovy for this. Unfortunately, the storyline is hard to follow, and not very much going on in the film. In fact, I turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and realized after a week that I should not look at it no matter how slow it was. <br /> <br /> The film has a good place in it, but you'll have to wait and wait and wait ....... for them. <br /> <br /> If you are in a movie, it might just be for you, just keep in mind that the film is slow and not very much is actually happening, and did I mention not so much a story or ... <br /> <br />
