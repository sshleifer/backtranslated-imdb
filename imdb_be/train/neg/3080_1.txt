Hee hee hee. This film is so bad that he was not even trying to hide the fact that it sucks big time. I remember the day when I first saw it on the MST. The sun is shining, it looked like a good day. Then I saw this product Rick Sloane, which consisted of a horrible plush dolls were wreaking havoc in poor the 80th Festival land. Kevin, wussy extraordinary, trying to impress his girlfriend, directs the security guard assistant job, struggles with a rake, and a lot of things in this very poorly done a series of shots. No plot or story is not required. Apparently, no action is required, as the film shows. Army man and his sex crazy girl will make you want to jump off a cliff, and a dull one that gets pleasure from sex phone will make you say. "He's got some good red shorts" Besides, I really hated the old guard, and wished he had an accident in a supermarket cart. Just when you think it over, wait until the scene Scum club. Ask Road Rash. <br /> <br /> I suggest that after watching this film, a good month to regain feeling and healthy. and if you see, Rick The Sloane, to give him a good kick in the groin, to show how much we appreciate it crapsterpiece called Hobgoblins.
