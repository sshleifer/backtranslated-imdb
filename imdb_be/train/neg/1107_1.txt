I've read the back of the box and spoke of Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, "Great! It will be great! "I was so wrong. The story was all screwed up. In fact, I still do not understand. It just seems to me that all the characters were doing was drinking, smoking (opium?) And sex. Not that those are not good quality film, but please! Where was the story? I forced myself to finish the film, and yes, it was to pick up until the end, and then the film was almost finished. Rent, if you really want. Just do not trust the back of the box.
