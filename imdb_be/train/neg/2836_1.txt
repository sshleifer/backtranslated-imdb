I saw this obvious schlock festival on video store shelves. And before I got my first VCR I decided to christen him with this little gem and it's bad shooting at its best! <br /> <br /> In the dialogue unintentionally oars. And it includes a cameo by Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn, it is inexplicable. And just like Christopher Walken, he seemed to want to appear in every bad movie in recent years. This movie is Mr. Quinn Country Bears. <br /> <br /> It has the line, "Shut up and let me fight !!!» <br /> <br /> And, "You want to say that a lot sh_it! »<br /> <br /> And a priceless return:" Unfortunately, it sh_it, tough angry sh_it »<br /> <br /> You will be awed in the fight scene, Bo does SOMMERSAULT through the billiard table! And he does a good kung-fu kick, when it comes from a roll! Cut socky action and T and thrill !!! <br /> <br /> What's schlock movie fan could ask for more? Oh, and if Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide, and, and returns to haunt After all, as a ghost, she asks him why he killed himself, and then to deal with his debilitating illness? He says, "Real men do not eat quiche.» <br /> <br /> Well, aah, yes. After all, if it was a smart cookie I could have been called for an exorcist right here and now!
