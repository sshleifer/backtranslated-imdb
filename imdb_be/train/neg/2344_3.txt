For me, it just comes off like a soap opera. I believe that any image wasteful people can be considered "social commentary." But ultimately, I do not care how you describe this film. None of the characters are not very pretty or interesting. I did not feel the chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story here, she lost in the disease. And, despite the end of the twist given to the full and immediate (and, therefore, not clear) reversal of Dorothy Maguire to witness history is not enough to keep my interest. No matter how much Freudian symbolism and psychology thrown in, this story is not running, melodramatic and trite. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson noble wood. This is the least attractive role of Lauren Bacall and one of its poorest performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack provide more inspired performances, but her character is ugly, and it is a pity. Robert Keith, how to love, is the father of touch Miscreant two adult children, is the most sympathetic character. The most interesting thing, however, is that looks heavy Robert Wilk in a small role as the owner of the bar. He is best remembered as a nasty henchman in countless Westerns, but here he is an honest, good-looking guy. <br /> <br /> I take a social commentary with an interesting, engaging story and a couple of cute characters, thanks.
