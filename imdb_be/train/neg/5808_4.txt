So when Alec Baldwin and Kim Besinzher was mercurial, violent, powerful couple of Hollywood, they filmed it (almost) scene for scene remake of the 1972 Steve McQueen Ali McGill thriller fluent together. It almost worked for the first time, because McQueen was such a vital presence on the screen - even a stone quiet and tired, felt his clock is ticking, its secretive magnetism. Baldwin is not in the league of Steve McQueen, but it has its charms and is probably more versatile actor - if so, this is not a showcase for its attributes. Basinger doing well and, of course, looks good, but James Woods artificially unnatural in a silly role crowd magnets. Assembly area with another couple taken hostage by ex-partner Baldwin was unbearable in 72 film and plays even worse here. As for the scenes, they are rather old hat, which makes one wonder why even remake the original? ** from ****
