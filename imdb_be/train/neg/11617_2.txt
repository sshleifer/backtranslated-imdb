The film "Joshua" is extremely alarming, and completely meaningless. It really makes me shudder to think that there are people who will enjoy watching it. Without divulging the story is about a young boy's reaction to his newborn sister, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Overall, this film is exposed to the audience some of the most disturbing behavior of the child can imagine. Adding insult to injury, the end of the film there is absolutely no real results except fruiting pure evil, however, who outwitted the entire group of stupid adults in the child's hands. There's no redemption, no justice is not served, but a group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is happening around them. Honestly, I did not like to watch this movie. It was very disturbing. Even for those who can enjoy horror movies, this film may be too much. Despite the fact that this film was well acted, the story itself is so alarming that it was equivalent to watch 90 minutes of waiting in the dentist's waiting room in anticipation of some painful dental procedures.
