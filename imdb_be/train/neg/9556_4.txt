This film is basically pursuing scenes and special effects. She is very weak in the area. Most computer conversation was simply a fetish. I watched it because I was a big fan of the original War Games movie, which was based mainly on the fact that the computer and the real computer terminology. This film has not been anything like it. Most computer scene is not only impossible and unreal real computers and networks, but simply lame. It's like it was written by someone who has no real understanding of computers. <br /> <br /> Ripley game was lame and was essentially just an arcade game. No real break, so that was not the case? The film was boring. Lame continued.
