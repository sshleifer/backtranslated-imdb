the intention of the director is this movie is very honorable, but his story of his production has received, I realized that it can not get a lot to the terminal, as well as other filmmakers could do it. holding it for more than 30 days as a television series, but also relies on its production of the MTV "I'm sure you will," which is opposed to its severity in any of the questions, he documents, as well as considering it a very disappointing production "supersize me" I did not have my hopes high. enough, unfortunately, this film has not disappointed me yet. as a "supersize me" after a while I even ask myself what the point of all this. important statement becomes clear enough, half an hour, but the rest of the change is filled with rather pointless thing again and repeat things that have already been shown in this way or another earlier in the film, so that it wears out and becomes extremely boring towards the end.
