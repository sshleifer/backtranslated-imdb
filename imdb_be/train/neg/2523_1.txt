Sun R O B O O T J X. <br /> <br /> Burn master <br /> <br /> grotesque hit <br /> <br /> Many end ..; NO closing. <br /> <br /> A fully and absolutely the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Replaces "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" as the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> I hate it quite imperfect, unedited, untrained, non-produced non-oriented mess things called «Robot Jox» - and I just found out - they made the second one!?!? I apologize to Adma Sandler (Zohar Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for hating his movies. This disorder makes things these films just bad - not terrible terrible and grotesque as this thing. This is the only film for which I ever said it - REMOVE IT FROM the Netflix - NOW !!! 10000 out of 10 people found this comment useful.
