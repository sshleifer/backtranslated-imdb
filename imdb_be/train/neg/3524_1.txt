This is one of the worst cases of nonsense movie I've seen in a long time. It is so terrible that I do not know where to start, or even if it's worth it. The plot is a real problem, and I feel sorry for «Sly», he hung performance for his unit. But the plot is ... Oh, God. I especially love how near the end he manages to jump from the foot of the mountain to the top, while the helicopter is on its way. Climb for a day or two it takes only five minutes! I could: but it's not worth it. In addition to the gloomy opening (which even five years will be able to predict the outcome of) the rest is nonsense. Sorry people, but that's about as bad as the creation of the film becomes.
