It's sad when you can see that the film is trying to do, and it is quite obvious that it fell far away the sign. Film students should take this as a lesson and a warning. whether a graduate has an idea. He wants full control. Thus he writes, directs, produces its cinematic masterpiece all by himself. As a rule, his concept goes far beyond its budget. He usually writes bloated script, full of every slogan he can come up with. As a rule, he is more interested in the grand sweep of history, rather than the nitty gritty of working with actors on the individual scenes. Usually it ends with a film that is weak in an attempt to create miracles on a tiny budget. Usually it ends with a series of meetings (we can not do justice, calling them the scene), who feels that they have been written 12 years. And it usually ends badly acted scene to capture the viewer. When you look at the judges at this point you can just say that it's just the usual fare.
