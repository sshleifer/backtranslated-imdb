A friend once told me that the art-house independent film ran in the cinema once after the close of the film - the audience were so angry, they precede the tear film in place. Of course, my imagination, rampage, trying to conjure up the content of a piece of work. Well, now my imagination can be put to rest. <br /> <br /> I am a life-long supporter of Andrew Tarkovky and passionate admirer of his work. I have met many people who thought that Tarkovsky's films move slowly and inert. Opinion is that they are, I have found that it is not truly remarkable works of the late film director who forged meaning beautiful compositions and complex philosophical questions. Hearing Alexander Sokurov named heir Tarkovsky, I was excited to experience their films. <br /> <br /> With the exception of open-air driving through the field (Stalker), this film does not have any relationship to anything done by Tarkovsky. It seems to have not the slightest sense, even completely meaningless level. This supposedly "perfectly stunning" cinematography devoid of any composite vessels. There is no balance or proportion, and exposure meter seems to work is low in the freezing snow. The main character is so inept and indecisive, it makes you wonder whether his father was alive could, if he chose before. <br /> <br /> I'm not adverse to non-graphs or storylines that progress on several nonlinear. But even non-story here. We must, of course, enter the viewing of this film with a shaved head, if I had to get out of it is nothing gained and nothing is lost, since pulling the hair is the only possible response to a pace that would make Tarkosky time sculptures look as if Jerry Bruckheimer was shot Charlie Chaplin short. <br /> <br /> I do not rule out that this may be one of the ugliest types Sokurov (Tarkovsky's Solaris), but conclude that it is one of Tarkovsky's successor, on the basis of this film - could be called Paris Hilton Aristotle's successor. Come on, guys, do not be afraid to say. No amount of great big words is not going to magically bring the corpse back to life celluloid. I'm not saying that to fully understand Russian culture, and I'm probably not the Russian values, but I immediately took on Tarkovsky's work as something magical, a treasure and a gift to the audience. <br /> <br /> If it was not the name of Sokurov at him, and he will say on the air, Saturday Night Live, I'm sure no one will be "read" all this excellent analysis of this wet noodles with Flick.
