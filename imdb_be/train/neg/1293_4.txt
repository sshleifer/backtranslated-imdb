I'm probably one of the few spectators who would not recommend this movie. The idea is visually stunning, like all works Ang Lee (each frame still seems worthy of print), I was very disappointed with the pace of the film incoherent. It really was too long. <br /> <br /> The story is set in the Civil War Missouri, and a young man (Roedel), who joins the feral forces Bushwackers, his native renegade Federal sympathize conducting geurilla type fights Jayhawkers, their Union counterparts. He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles played Skeet Ulrich, to join the group after Chile's father shot at close range, and his house burns down, presumably Jayhawkers. The story follows the adventures of raids in Roedel and Chiles and their interaction with other war victims, including ex-slave who fights for Bushwhackers (Daniel Holt played by Jeffrey Wright), and war widow who play Jewel. <br /> <br /> it seemed that every time the film was developing the story interesting point, it would be transformed into some other story and leave undeveloped things. For example, Roedel group agitation caused former slave Holt, who participates in the Union actually briefly displayed after a conflict over the propriety and protocol, and then dropped until later in the film. Young Willian / tramp bully hates Roedel and sends a lot of angst and violence against him, but we never know why. Some of the characters never give up the surface; I think it's because the film covers too many of them, and to take on high-volume history. <br /> <br /> The historical detail was wonderful. I loved to look at a house, furniture, clothing, etc., and I thought that the leading actors did an excellent job to humanize the characters, even though they came from a little dialogue. If you really enjoy the story or a big fan of Ang Lee, however, take a pass on this one.
