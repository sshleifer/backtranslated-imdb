Mike Hawthorn (Gordon Currie) is witness to the brutal murder of his mother's suicide and his father Mort (Jon Fedele). Twenty years later, Mike gathers a group of his friends in his family's cabin in the woods on Halloween party. During the game, where guests confess and confront their worst fears ... Mike tries to evoke the spirit of his late father. He soon discovered that the spirit inhabits Mort in wooden Indian in the cabin. The statue comes to life and begins a bloodbath. <br /> <br /> Most of the F / X is not very convincing, and the film takes on a cheap theme grinder Adolescents. Overdue story acted deplorably. Cast members should be noted: Kelly Benson, Philip Rice, Vozhitse Byron main moon and veteran actress Betsy Palmer.
