This film was, as Homer Simpson would say, "more disastrous than the church." Maybe I do not understand it well enough, and I think he started quite well, but after the (START spoiler) German Brown is sent to prison, and Maria began working / sleeping with her boss, he just started to pull, and I did my best to stay awake forces. Again, maybe it symbolizes something, but at the end of the explosion seemed forced and out of place. (END SPOILER). In the end, I do not understand why others think that is so cool, I found it very sad. By the way, I have not watched this movie on their own, so I had to see it for Film class.
