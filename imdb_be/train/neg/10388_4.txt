After reading all the comments posted here on IMDb, the film seems to be getting ragged on a lot, but I do not think it was bad. I've seen much worse, in fact. <br /> <br /> «House, where evil dwells" ghost story about a husband and his wife, Ted and Laura Fletcher, and their daughter, Amy, who move into an old house in Japan. Little do they know, the Japanese ninja brutally killed his wife and her lover and then killed himself 100 years ago with a samurai sword. How strange things are happening in the house, the ghosts of the former inhabitants begin to master the body alive and plan on re-playable bloody murder, which took place 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie and decided to give him a chance to cover it looked like a decent ghost story. It was common, and it was obvious, but I've seen worse in my day. Sequence ghosts were a little more done, we will see a translucent tinted shapes randomly pop up at random around the family, and take their bodies. Frankly, the ghosts in this film kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland. Maybe I'm wrong, but after watching this, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror film «Ju-On: The Grudge" and the American remake of the film ripped it from a little old Japanese house where the massacre took place, a ghostly activity curse put. at home, and so on but I could be wrong. <br /> <br /> In summary, it's pretty corny ghost story. does not go out of your way to see it, but if you like this sort of thing, and it happens to come to the TV, you can give him a chance. 4/10.
