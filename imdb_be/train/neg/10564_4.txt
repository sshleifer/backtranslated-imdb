Real shame «The Gathering» is not a bad actor, nor his vile small area. This is a shame that it was much worse than the series it began, despite the fact that one has made the main attraction: Takashima. I would like to see Laurel Takashima in the room with Susan Ivanova, even for just five minutes. It has the sarcasm, that the mind, which edged face that is both changeable and sweet. Unfortunately, though, "Babylon 5" pilot movie has an incredibly sad story involving murder. Patricia Tallman-- who never really returned to the series, while many later-- fortunately, there are far better with age as Lyta Alexander, who here is a bit more whiny, tiresome telepathy. I leave you with one final thought-- why is it that the division looks like some external human frog space (despite the fact that she is a woman)? Thank God for the way Minbari watched later in the show.
