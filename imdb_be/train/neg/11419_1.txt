I think I've seen this kind of thing before :. College graduates do not realize that they have it pretty damn well, all the while complaining that their lives suck <br /> <br /> This film is a derivative of the Big Chill and Reality Bites from what I can make him :. They have almost the same story <br /> <br /> If anything good came out of this snore-festival, it was the music. That was it. <br /> <br /> As far as I understand, I'm not impressed ... but then again, I never expected anything less. This film was directed by the same person who directed Batman and Robin; . Another film that should be seen only with a bandage on a tow <br /> <br /> At present, the verdict: it is 1 in 10.
