At the panel discussion I attended after watching this film, the filmmakers said they need to look at it is not like in the movies, but the thought provocateur. Well, the only thoughts that were triggered by the time I had wasted watching a movie. Tricks of the film (a documentary style, futuristic setting) served as a distraction that was supposed to be a thoughtful examination of the debate on abortion. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use the film as a platform for their political views - are usually very sad movie that teaches choir.
