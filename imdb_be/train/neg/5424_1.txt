Mirror. Mirror (1990) is a flat from the film inaccurate. Why do I watch movies like this, when I was younger? Who knows? Maybe I'm the one for punishing herself by watching a terrible movie after another. I do not know, I think I need a hobby during my adolescence. Teenage outcast (Harvest Rainbow) seeks solace in an old mirror. She soon learns of the terrible power of an ancient mirror has and uses it to strike against those who wronged her. Films like these, which gives power to have an unpleasant side effect. This one changes it inside and outside, if she likes it or not. <br /> <br /> mess the film, which for some reason has been restored to d.v.d. a few years ago. I do not know why. They had to leave it on the shelf and gather dust. People love this movie the enemy for some reason. If I wanted to know why. By the time I do not like this movie, and I have no reason to ever see him again. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended at all.
