It's kind of a strange film, given that Santa Claus lives in the cloud in outer space and fight against Satan and his minions ... but it's still an interesting fun. <br /> <br /> It has some genuine laughter .. .whether they were intentional, of course, is debatable, though. This film is not very good, but I can say that I really enjoyed the view. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film again "Santa Claus will punish the Martians", "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "Santa Claus" with Tim Allen.
