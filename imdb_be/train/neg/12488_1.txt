0.5 / 10 This film has absolutely nothing good about it. Action is one of the worst I have ever seen that actually wonder everyone terribly, not just a few here and there, everything. Direction is a joke, a low budget is hopelessly obvious score badly, I would not say that the film was edited, brutally chopped to a more appropriate phrase. It combines the serial killings, bait and tarot cards. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. It's not scary at all, hopelessly lame special effects. ridiculously bad everywhere. Drafting was terribly bad. Cinema looks very cheap, and very granular time and the camera-work is terrible. Again, what really makes the film is how bad all the actors. Cheese.
