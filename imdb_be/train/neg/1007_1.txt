I found it very very difficult to watch it after the first 5 minutes of the film. I managed to digest the 45-50 minutes before turning it in disgust and watch Monster House instead (which, incidentally, a lot of fun). <br /> <br /> The story has huge holes in it. The plot line is huge over stated and dull acting badly, especially with Justin Timberlake, to be sure to follow what he is good (if you look crazy and sing like a castrato). Morgan Freeman species is incredibly uncomfortable, especially when made to dance around the rock for no apparent reason halfway through the film after he and Timberlake found. Freeman and symbols Timberlake seems to have to have some sort of father / son relationship birth or something that simply can not see, not counting the fact that; although the nature of Freeman seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather silly character Timberlake, he never less do not pull out all the stops to help him uncover a completely inappropriate cover. <br /> <br /> It will take some incredible suspension of disbelief, to give any credit to the storyline, simply absurd and blown all proportion. <br /> <br /> do not watch this movie, it's a waste of time.
