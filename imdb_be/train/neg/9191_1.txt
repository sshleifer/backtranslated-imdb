Well, I had to sit down at the computer and write a review immediately after watching this puddle of slime. Why? Because I have to let it be known to all of you how bad this film. It is incredibly bad. Just give you about how bad it is, I offer this little piece of film. During the pogrom scene, which usually consists of taking pictures of people or zombies feet, they are interspersed with scenes from video games. Yes, you heard me right. This movie really sucks. In fact, it makes me think that he is worth ten dollars these days just to get into the theater these days. And to see corn filled with shit like this? There's no history to speak and the movie basically has nothing to offer, apart from the occasional boob shots and really cheap kills. I am very disappointed with this, knowing that I watched it. Well, I was dumbfounded. It's so bad that I can not even find words. Rating: ZERO with *****.
