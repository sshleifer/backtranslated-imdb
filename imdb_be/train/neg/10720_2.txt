I saw this movie last weekend, and it is stupid and pointless. Ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in your pajamas? Victims are afraid meaningless and can not work with slow moving old. They throw their torches and tremble instead of trying to take him on, or spirit, to burn it. Quentin alias Mr. Fabersham of Young Married to Diane Brewster alias Miss Canfield from Leave it to Beaver fame, who was unhappy in the marriage. Wow, love story. The rest of the cast is just standing in each other's graves and wait for the screams to respond and work with them. Egyptian girl looks not bad, but does not allow a lot of film. Where's mummy? In fact, just the curse unleashed. It does not hold a torch Universal Mummy movies least.Watch this movie, if you need to sleep, because you will be dosed off.
