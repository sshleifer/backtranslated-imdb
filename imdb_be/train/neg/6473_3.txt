As a child the first installment ( "The Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie. It was filled with great characters, songs and fun family film. After a week or once I watched this movie for the first time. I believe that this film was, like most sequels, and does not exceed the original. I think I feel that way, perhaps because I had high expectations, and I grew up. However, this is not a bad film. <br /> <br /> It begins when Ariel gave birth to a lovely child only, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgan (sister Eurselas'), so they build a big wall around his house, which is on the seashore. As Melody grows it begins to wonder, outside the walls, where it is forbidden to go. The problem muddy as Morgana tries to take control of the seven seas. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give away any of the film, so you have to see it to find out. I did like that the voices of the same, and again beautiful singing. I think this is a good family film, although in general!
