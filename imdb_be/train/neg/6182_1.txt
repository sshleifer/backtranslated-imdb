This film does Peter elf Robin Hood costume instead of a human boy as possible-nya-Robin-Hood-suit and ignores any particular person in it, what's really important. This film makes Wendy murmured idiot. And poor Captain Hook TOTAL clown. And, of course, like every Disney animated film has to have a character who has had too many hits to the head, they made one of the Lost Boys, that one. The only character who was not a disgrace in this film Tink. The only star for her. <br /> <br /> The story itself then? Parents Darling did not even get the time to notice what their children are gone !!! Probably one of the most important points in the original story, and they spoiled! Also known nursery scene between Peter Pan and Wendy stunning piece There OF-there is no thimbles and acorns - one of the smallest things that makes the original story in a unique one. It's amazing that he even lost his shadow, and she helped him to stick with it. (Despite the fact that his shoes and it does not make any sense to me.) <br /> <br /> Ruining a great story like this just to please the children, it should be prohibited by law. So you know, if you did not know about this before - this version of Disney has nothing significant to do with the original story -., Which is not really a children's story, but just a big, big story <br /> <br / > it just irritates me no end.
