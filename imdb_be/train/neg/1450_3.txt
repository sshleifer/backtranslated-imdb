If someone really wants to understand Hitler, read the story of the First World War, not the history of the Second World War. Find out what happened during the war, the soldiers had to live around dead bodies all the time. Like so many soldiers went mad from what they have seen during the First World War, at that time they called it «shellshocked» is now called post-traumatic stress disorder. If you know the real horrors of the First World War, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how a person can become insensitive to the death, not because they are evil, but simply because it was the only way for them too to cope with the horrors around them. <br /> <br /> This film, unfortunately, does not get that, like so many others. Read a few books on the subject, and you have to watch the movie "Paths of Glory", the only good WWI film has ever done. You will see a frustrated soldier in this movie, the feeling of helplessness and total devaluation of human life as nothing more than a bullet catchers. <br /> <br /> The fact that this film misses, it is really the key point to understanding Germany. Reproduced War, where millions and millions of Germans were killed, no real reason. Then comes a complete economic collapse, after the war. The factors that create extremism. <br /> <br /> loss of family members and mass poverty will create always lead to extremism. Unfortunately, this film ignored these factors and simply become another long-range throw a piece of shit to throw on the heap. With exactly no real value, there are fictional characters based on the fictional film that can give you a better idea about Hitler than it does. They just threw Hitler's name on it so it would sell more.
