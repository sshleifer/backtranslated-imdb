MST 3000 should make this film. This is the worst film I acted ever seen. First of all, you will find that the shooter has no bank account and no history after leaving the Army in 1993, and pay the rent in cash. There is no way in hell that this man will ever be allowed to be that close to the president, not to mention a high profile job. In addition, the head of security will not be so emotional for POTHUS, he starts to drink in the fog, when the president was assassinated. This movie sucks. I can not express extremite, that this film was. Each actor was terrible. Even the chicken in the park trailers. I shit on this garbage. What a waste of time.
