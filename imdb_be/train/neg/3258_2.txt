DOC SAVAGE: BRONZE MAN (1 Outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> A terrible, terrible film ... on the basis of the pulp magazine / series in paperback Lester Dent / Kenneth Robson ... a super-heroic adventures of a hero in 30s and his five assistants, all experts in a particular field of activity, allowing them to fight evil. It was rather a series of false ... but curiously interesting to read when I was a teenager. I knew that they did a version of the film in the '70s, starring Ron (Tarzan) Ely ... but I never got a chance to see him. He never played in theaters, where I lived and was not shown on television. Now, when I finally saw the film, I can understand why. The plot and characters are never taken seriously ... it's all kinds of phony and mannered ... kind of like the old series Batman TV ... only without the benefit of funny ... or have any visual sense of smell. Corny dialogue, cheese special effects, dull stereotypes, lousy scene and the bad, bad acting. In fact, I think it's kind of exciting in its harmfulness ... that they could possibly think? Arnold Schwarzenegger is rumored to be starring in a modern remake ... but I can not imagine that it would turn out much better.
