I came to the conclusion, watching horror Euro, especially films made iconic lighting Jess Franco, you can not expect a story that makes a lot of sense. However, Franco went overboard with this film; and, despite the surreal atmosphere, and the film's reputation as one of the best director - succubi, unfortunately, it's really a terrible movie. I must admit that I have seen the American version of the cut, which takes about 76 minutes; but if it was not just the logic that was cut, I'm sure more than the European version of the same boring. The plot has something to do with a woman, looting around; S & M practitioners and nonsense, and all this is really boring. There's no gore and sex boring, and most of the runtime lifted boring dialogue and, despite the fact that this is a short film; I could barely make it all the way to the end. I must say that the place to look good and Franco have done a good job using its surreal atmosphere; but positive end elements. Jess Franco, of course, a talented filmmaker who has made several classic films of garbage - but it seems that it was one he had for the money, and in general, I recommend to skip it and see some of the most interesting works of the director.
