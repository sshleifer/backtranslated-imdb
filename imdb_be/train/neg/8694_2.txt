Actress was a terrible actress, which made the whole movie is mediocre. She smiles too much when she first went before the cameras to talk about her daughter. This should be done police suspect her. I would be inconsolable in an identical situation. She seemed relaxed way for a mother who can not find his daughter. It was as if she did not want to even be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would play the role better. And it would make a lot more money for such a controversial, important issue. Everything else was fine. I do not know where the leading actress, but I hope she got some acting lessons.
