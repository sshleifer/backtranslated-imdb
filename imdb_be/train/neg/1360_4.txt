Reasonable effort to resume the movie. Good movie of the sixties, but it lacks any sense of achievement. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance, which was plausible enough, but not as good as it could give the other actors were just awful! Scary image. It was not very funny, and therefore does not really achieve its genre, as it was not particularly funny, and it was not dramatic. The only genre has reached a satisfactory level was having an affair. Target audiences were not impressed, and the film sent out misleading information. Very simple plot and very storyline were not dragged or carried out on all the good and the people were confused as to why the film was not so good, and who the target audience was, etc. However, Maggie was pretty good, and the plot was good with moments of opportunity. <br /> <br /> 4.
