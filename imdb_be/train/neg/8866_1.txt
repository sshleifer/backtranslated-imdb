Theoretically, "comments director" should have been executed. Talented Rob Bryden plays Peter DeLane, former director of the TV Talking about his experience behind the camera. Among the programs he allegedly worked in "Bonanza», «Flambards», «The Duchess of Duke Street 'and' The Bounder. His comments are not the least bit informative, due to his habit of wandering point. <br /> <br /> But in practice, it went bankrupt. This is one fun show, and jokes are not particularly funny. Scenarios completely lacking in wit, and Bryden is unable to convince the old. Every time lingered on something funny to say, that as every five seconds, it produces a hissing laugh. Instead of being pleased DeLane, you want to shoot him. If senile old strike you as funny, then this is for you. <br /> <br /> It did not help that the show had been abused, with the exceptions «Mr & Mrs», and "Crossroads" and the good sake of the joke to work, they must be really awful, such as "Charlie's Angels," " OTT "," Tel addicts "," Neighbors ", and" New faces. " <br /> <br /> The show Tanked great time, so that, fortunately, we are spared from the horrors of future editions. Would not it be extremely ironic when "comments the director" was ever the subject of the parody itself?
