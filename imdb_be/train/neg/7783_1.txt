Hey HULU.com plays Elvira late night horror show on their website, and this film is called their Monsteroid, good fun to watch Elvira comment on this movie Crappy .... Good luck with bad movies. In any case, this film really has very little value, but to see how bad the 70s were for horror movie bad effects, Bad Dialog, just a bad movie decisions. Avoid it if you do not want to laugh at him. While you are on Hulu check out other movies that it now has 10 episodes, and some of them are pretty decent movies with a good story and production, and you can watch them in 480p as long as you have a connection decent speed.
