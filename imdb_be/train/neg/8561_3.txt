Cowboys can leave you a little sore in the saddle. Definitely not one of the best films of Jones. Do not get me wrong, any John Wayne move there is always some good places. And this one has its fair share. But most of all the picture moves slowly and simply does not justify the hopes it might be. Bruce Dern again does an excellent job as the villain. Roscoe Lee Browne is another bright spot in the film. Children in the movie were average, but it could be better to cast. This is a good movie for eight to fifteen years old movie lovers. <br /> <br /> This is a good family movement watch with their children. You just need to know there are a few scenes that you might want to look at before allowing young to see. But most of the children I know who saw the film as it is. Maybe it's because they get to see the kids their age are doing all the work grown.
