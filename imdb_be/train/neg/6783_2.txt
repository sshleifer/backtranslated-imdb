There seems to be a surprisingly large number of reviews 8-10 stars here from people who have never written a review before or after the IMDb. Given the extremely low average rating given film of other people, I think you can draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad movie. I admit it, I thought the concept was cute, and I was glad to see the actress who played Eve and harmony on Angela to get a job, but it did not take long for the sheer awful this film to make yourself. Of course, <br /> <br /> Responsibilities: Conductors seemed competent enough, but all the others? . Terrible <br /> <br /> The plot: Chock full of holes big enough to drive a truck through <br /> <br /> Direction :. Nonexistent <br /> <br /> Humor :. Do they really think people are going to laugh? Oh boy <br /> <br /> Eye Candy :. OK. there were some really beautiful women in this film. Not only the three main female characters, but right across the board. It was as if the producers had hoped that the scenery will keep the audience distracted men so they do not notice how awful everything else was. If so, they failed miserably. <br /> <br /> In the right hands it could be nice, but darkly funny camp classic. It was not even close.
