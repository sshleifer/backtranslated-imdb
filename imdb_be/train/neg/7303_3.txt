Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth.Roth Randy Pearlstein and co-wrote the script with a story Roth.this zombie film that owes much to George Romero and his previously "living dead movies", and the original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot mention Sam ramie in "Evil deadÂ» .there is nothing original here, and the story is not compelling.the action on a par with this genre, it's just that the story fails.we pretty much seen this movie before, and better made.having said that after reaching commercial, if not an artistic success of this phyla ma, Roth decided that he was the director and left the unfathomably brutal, energetic mean, senseless (though much more ambitious) Buckwheat Festival Hostel.Roth should leave until he was behind.Cabin Fever movie is good, but compared to the Hostel this work art.I hope someone (preferably a psychiatrist) convinces the guy that filmmaking career choice.as wrong for fever, 3/10 weak for not being anyhow Smal as Hostel.
