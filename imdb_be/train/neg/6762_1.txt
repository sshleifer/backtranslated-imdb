This kind of film that all participants have to be embarrassed anymore. Poor direction, over the top acting and a story that on the Rambles with no meaning, but to show the violence. I thought when I first saw it, that it might be, the media satire and how it shows the violence, but it is not. I'm not sure that makes the film worse. Oliver Stone makes it worse director ever. With scenes where the person Woody Harrelson morpheme without cause or terrible performance by Robert Downey Jr., Wayne Gale, who is a reporter, who seems to be completely obsessed, this film is just a mess.
