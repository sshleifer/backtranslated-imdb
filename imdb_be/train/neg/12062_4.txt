If large combination of director / actor who spoke about the team J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson, is usually not mentioned. Probably because the output of the nine joint ventures between the two of them runs the gamut from very good action fun to mediocrity. Unfortunately Kinjite: prohibited items falls into the latter. <br /> <br /> It's sad, because Kinjite could be much better. But for the life of me I do not understand why it was necessary that the father of the missing Japanese girl, the guy that used to get some cheap Jollies, because the romance ended in marriage. It might be nice for another film in general, but it does not make sense here. <br /> <br /> A simple police drama with Charles Bronson as a vice cop who had seen too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against Orientals. This part could also be used to explain a bit as well. But he will have to overcome it, when he and the patient's partner, Perry Lopez are going to find a captured Japanese school girl. <br /> <br /> time in Bronson morality police told him exactly where to look for the thief. Stylish, murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez guy and he and Bronson have some history. In fact, in the best scene of the film, Bronson made him eat expensive Rolex watches and set his car on fire. <br /> <br /> At some point, Fernandez happens to find Bronson and Lopez in the night and after the delicacies of this being his Rolex snacks, it sprays a place to kill all the Tyrant, but Bronson and Lopez. I really think that little incident would have had more than a couple of vice cops from the LAPD after Fernandez. But that's another very big hole in the story. <br /> <br /> There is still a very rough justice in the end for Fernandez. I want the whole movie was better, though. It was the last film team Bronson-Thompson, J. Lee Thompson in the past as a filmmaker. He had to go with something better.
