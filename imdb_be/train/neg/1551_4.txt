Ladies Man funny movie. There is not much thought behind it, but what do you expect from a movie SNL? It is actually better than most SNL films (ie Superstar or Night at the Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene (one of the funniest in the movie). In addition, the rest of the cast in the middle and is only there to support Meadows. I definitely saw a funny movie, but I've seen them, too stupid. Again, this is not a deep film, but it's good for a few laughs. It was funny as the skit, though. But still, if you are looking for a pretty funny movie, I would recommend it. Just do not think about it too much or you'll hate it <br /> <br /> Rating :. 6/10
