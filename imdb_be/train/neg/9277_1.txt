I saw an omen when I was 11 on television. I enjoyed the Trilogy. So when the chance to finally see one in the movie came around, it was not him. I went to a movie, knowing that I was going to see was no release of the movie, but made for television movie. However, being a fan, I could not resist. But this Omen movie that I have seen in midnight screening didnt bring ants he brought laughter. Risible dialogue, such as "it is written that if a child cries during the baptism they deny there is a God." What nonsense.No decent set pieces. Faye Grant as well in V is lost with this script from hell. Surprises and no fun. However, I did laugh out loud a few times we have bad was.Truly Pathetic.1 10
