Genghis Cohn (very) mildly entertaining British film about the German police commissioner in the late 1950s, which has a ghost of the Jewish comedian that he killed 15 years ago while serving in the SS under Hitler. Ghost comes back and wants his killer to live as a Jew in order to atone for a murder he committed. <br /> <br /> Otto, a German policeman really knows the name of this ghost, because the last thing he did before he died was said in Yiddish, `Kiss my ass. The policeman did not speak Yiddish, so he asked around until he found a sense. `Kiss my ass I left the impression that everyone involved with the murder learned and memorized the name of the comic, Genghis Kono. <br /> <br /> There are lots of people who are killed in the conduct of the police commissioner, and no helpful tips. Men are killed with a set of knives that are missing from the local butcher. Butcher announced that its blades are missing while the Commissioner is in the store to get liver and onions sandwich, so the Commissioner is suspect. The first person died, making love to the butcher's wife, so that the butcher is a suspect. But the butcher says he will be very busy if he killed everyone who was sleeping with his wife. All people are killed immediately after the climax of love. <br /> <br /> I think I might be a little meaner than the specter of Genghis Cohn, if I was killed as he was. He seems to be very good-natured about it, as if it was only in the light car accident. I can only assume that this is because it is a British film, and they are known as very friendly people. It uses some of his material from his standing routing, and I just do not find it very funny. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 4, because it was only partly stupid. I thought it was supposed to be a little more serious than it was. The film is a murder mystery (where did that come from?), And it seemed that Khan should have been more useful than he was. The film gave me a wee look in the Jewish culture, but only skin deep. Are all Jews love liver and onion sandwiches? Do they all say `shtoop« and `meshuganah» in their everyday vocabulary? There is no more important things that we need to know about the culture? <br /> <br /> I saw this film in the Jewish Community Center in Berkeley, California, and I was the only person in the room, whose hair was not completely gray or white. (I do not have gray or white hair.) There were 18 of us, and after the movie they stayed for about 20 minutes to discuss the film. There were 2 main problems found here: 1. The film was too carefree and future generations can not understand the seriousness of the incident and 2. As survived the Holocaust are dying, future generations will not know what really happened. I thought that this second concern was funny, and I told them that I thought that they should not worry because there is a ton of literature out there and there will always be people who like to watch movies, just like me. The murder of 6000000 people, a very bad man will never be forgotten. I am writing this last paragraph, because they charged me to tell others about their experiences on the same day.
