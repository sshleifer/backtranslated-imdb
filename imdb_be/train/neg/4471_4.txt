The best thing I can say about this movie, it was mildly amusing time, and it was enough time killer. Unfortunately, this movie too, so annoying that I wanted to slap these symbols around. It's kind of a film that is so sweet, painful teeth. The intentions were good, I suppose, but it becomes very tedious, if the dialogue is so nauseating. If two wires are not together on the screen, it's really not bad, but is afraid in those frequent moments when the couple begins to talk to each other.
