I actually had quite high expectations that go in this film, so I took what was given with a grain of salt and hope for the best. About 1/3 of the way through the film, I just had to give up, just enough film hodgepodge of material occurs for no apparent reason, and it's all off. I like movies that make you think, but this movie was just a bunch of ideas thrown together and never really linked. <br /> <br /> I do not think David Lynch-squire, as some would have you believe, it is nowhere near this area, except for some hypnotic visuals. Saying this pretentious to hide the fact that there is no apparent plot or story is the only way or justifying why you wasted 1.5 hours in the film. The acting was good, but it can not save the absence of history. I agree with one comment posted earlier ... "It's like the head of some other person ... while they are on drugs," in other words, has nothing meaningful.
