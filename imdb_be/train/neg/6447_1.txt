I bought this movie for $ 5 bin at a deal at a local video store for one reason only, Chase Masterson, but I must destroy to five, threw it into the toilet and flushed. The film is about a bunch of twenty-somethings that peaked in high school and join in the anniversary of the death of their stupid friends who got drunk and went into the woods and died. There is a problem reptile monster hunting them one by one. Acting pitiable, ridiculous these people seem to cast off on the show like 90210 and Dawsons Creek. The guide was on par with the twelve-year-old and the script will probably make a thirteen year old. The whole set looks like someone's backyard in Malibu. People on here who praised the film, apparently friends of the director and / or actors. Avoid this bunch of garbage at all costs.
