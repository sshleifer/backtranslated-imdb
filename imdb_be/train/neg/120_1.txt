When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who played the role of Lucille Ball. portrayal of Rachel York Lucy is absolutely horrible. Lucille Ball was a strange comedian with an incredible talent. In order to think about how the legend Lucille Ball is depicted as she was in a terrible film. I can not believe that of all the actresses in the world who could play much better than Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. It may be a good actress in other roles, but to play the role of Lucille Ball is fierce. It's pretty hard to find someone who could be like Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone, a bit like in appearance and talent. If you notice image York Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy, as the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing like any screwed her words, voice or movement. <br /> <br /> On top of that, Danny Pino plays Desi Arnaz terrible. Pino has no right to play like Ricky. It is small and thin, his accent is unreal, and again, its effect is incredible. While Fred and Ethel were not like no, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. <br /> <br /> In general, it is very terrible casting and story badly told. If people want to understand the situation in real life, Lucille Ball, I suggest watching & E Biography Lucy and Desi, read a book with the Lucille Ball, or American Masters PBS Â»: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, "to laugh" would be a better choice. Casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "To laugh," is much better compared to this. At the very least, the same aspect is shown faster than anything.
