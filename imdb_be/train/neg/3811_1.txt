I hated that shit, every Friday, as part of the TGIF it was included, and subsequently sucked big time with nonsense every week. If you want to see something funny go watch "not to be said," Actors Candace Cameron and Fred Savage, it's really fun, shows why no one ever goes to a good film career after making a terrible TV show. This show really makes me sick, I hate these children, and Bob Saget should go jump off a bridge for all makes this crapfest. I saw funner stuff everywhere but here. I ahyu write 10 lines! I watched full house ", to see at least humanity has to offer in the way of art and entertainment.
