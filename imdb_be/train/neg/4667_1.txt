Visually, the fuss, the plot less, incredibly intoxicating junk. not even close to the best work of the Greenway. Avoid any account! <br /> <br /> overlap "split screen" effects do nothing more than confuse, the film is very dark for a long time and "artistic" works images pretentious in the extreme. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film; even nudity incredibly unerotic, which sees it fills most of the film quickly becomes very sad. <br /> <br /> In addition, as one might say that acting with Ewen McGregor is brilliant beyond me. He showed more features in Star Wars series, and that's saying something. <br /> <br /> I was not so impressed with the film, because I've seen, "Darby OGilla and young people"!
