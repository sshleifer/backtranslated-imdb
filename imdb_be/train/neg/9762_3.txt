Alan Alda plays the real-life writer «Sports Illustrated» George Plimpton, who was once invited to join the football team Detroit Lions as an honorary member. Rather dull, uncompelling drama curiously tempered with imagination. Director Alex March takes an interesting tactic for this stuff, shooting it into a quasi-documentary fashion (with comment macho) and yet gives a fairy tale touch Capraesque whim; still, by showing cinematic bad taste in this setting, it makes the main story in the mess. smug, uncharismatic performance Aldan is another obstacle, although the supporting cast filled with real life pro-athlete (and shimmering Lauren Hutton as a friend Aldo in - How's this for a fantasy). * 1/2 ****
