This film was an attempt to go to a place, most of them can not be, and not worth the risk in. It was a similar process in a bizarre, head of the event, given to us in the cell, but not near as deep and well painted. The plot is built just to the initial mannerisms feel to it. Then, as the film takes its alleged "dramatic" turn, the plot falls apart that she was a few feet to stand on in the first place. <br /> <br /> Basically, the idea is that a child (Chris McKenna), who needs the money. He takes on the role of the killer, killing the town accountant. Then he does not pay for his work, but instead gets tortured for several days, because he came up with the "brilliant" idea of ​​trying to use a backup file, it had as leverage for payment. This idiotic step in an attempt to force them to pay him disliked him terribly and infinitely abused. He starts to go crazy (some very disturbing scenes). Then, thinking that he had paid for their sins and can begin, he visits his wife (Kari Wuhrer), the man who he scored and wins her love. Soon after she finds out who he is, tragedy and revenge sweeps through the air, as the boy goes after his executioners (Daniel Baldwin, George Wendt, Vernon Wells) for their pre "kindness." <br /> <br /> I have to ask, though, that this is from Kari Wuhrer and horror / gore movies such as? <br /> <br /> It seems that everything that she set the last time it was in this genre. Of course I loved her in "octopus freaks", and it was good in "Anaconda". But, despite its obvious wit and attractiveness (wow, it's hot!), It can act much better and choose the best roles. Or maybe I'm wrong and it's just a hoax. For all you guys out there, you get to see the "full» Monty about it in this film, although it is quite strange and short-lived. I almost felt like she did some soft-porn after watching this film (which is not strange career Curry). Sex-modeling is that it should make you wonder how things really go during filming. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I will say that there are some good action. Just do not expect much from him, Daniel Baldwin, whose career seems to be forever destined to second his brother Alex. The film did reveal a few of the old greats, though, George Wendt (Norm from Cheers) and Vernon Wells (Commando, Weird Science). First of all, Chris McKenna does a better job in playing the main character, Sean Crowley. His little acting experience, and yet its true nature as a naive youth to bring some elements of the film material. <br /> <br /> I would not go out of my way for it. If you are bored and tired of the same old "Hitchhiker" episodes, I would recommend watching it. <br /> <br /> And Kari, please take action in some of the best films!
