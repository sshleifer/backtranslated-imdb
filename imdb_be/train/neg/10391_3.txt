I've seen movies Gator Bait, and it's almost exactly the same as those. Woman raped by a group of degenerate men and systematically collects its vicious revenge on each of them. The fact that distinguishes this film, except those of them (though not very far) is that sexual content is not glorified. There is a full frontal nudity many times throughout the film, but not for a second it ever sexy. Some rape scene may seem a little wide, but it is only because the film is trying to increase the need for the audience to see this woman to take revenge. <br /> <br /> This is a weak film, it has no other way to maintain interest, in addition to manipulating our natural desire to see this woman to take revenge on her attackers. I spit on your grave is not the kind of movie that you are expecting to put a serious moral, but I was glad to see that, because it contains a significant amount of violence inflicted on women's role, he was not supposed to give T & film. <br /> <br /> in the movies are notorious for being driven nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality, and while I spit on You Gravel accurately in film, and contains more than its share of nudity, nudity It does not drive the plot. On the other hand, the only thing that moves the plot empty need for revenge against a group of rapists. These individuals Evolutionary dropped out just as they were in the films Gator Bait, and the biggest problem for writers, it seems, has come up with new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason why the film can never be anything more than a meaningless B -movie because it does not deliver a message of any kind, but instead he simply meets the audience desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve. <br /> <br /> One problem, it turns out that we have to sit through a sexual assault. Oddly enough, the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity (although not much), but it is certainly the most painful to watch. We even let them down a little, as we have seen a woman get revenge because some deaths were so complex that they are obviously not possible (it seems like pure luck that the boy in the lake at the end of felt such an irresistible urge to hug motor boat and press his genitals against the propeller, remaining so while woman yells some final words to him and carries the cord), but again, this film only satisfies the desire for revenge that filled the first half of us. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) Do you know what it means to do the entire movie, because it literally ends the moment the last man dies. The woman does not live happily ever after, she wrote the book, it will never leave and not to return to this nightmare place, it just sits down in the boat and motors around the lake, and the movie just stops in his tracks. But hey, what else did you expect? <br /> <br /> Yes, you've read the subtitle? If you decide to spend your time watching it, try to find any man getting broken or burned. I'm really looking forward to those who ??
