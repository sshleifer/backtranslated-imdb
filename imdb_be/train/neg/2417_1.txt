It was, without doubt, the worst that I have ever spent money. I feel dirty for the recognition that I shot this "film" and actually pay money to see it. It's not even garbage speed. No, no. This juice, which collects at the bottom of industrial waste containers located in a particularly dirty areas after an unusually wet summer. To call it a waste will degrade trash everywhere. It was so bad, I felt that I had to sign up for IMDb to warn my brother. This luvahire character claims that this film is great. It is necessary to question him gripe really. Let's take some of his observations and analysis. <br /> <br /> «The actor, who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a very good job." <br /> <br /> I see. Well, if the director assumed his audience flattering and shuddering at every sentence uttered Rica or alternately bursting into uncontrollable laughter at times when most directors would be more gloomy response of their audience, then yes; Ricky did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> "I'm an aspiring actor himself takes theater in my school, and I had to make a game where I had to cry, and it's not easy to be emotional in the scene so I give props to the actors who have to do emotional scene and can pull it off. "<br /> <br /> Wow. I also have to give the actors a support that can remove the emotional scenes. Luvahire, you may want to look for another line of work there is one, if you think that the chuckleheads pulled it out. However, they can help you if you need to practice to cry. Just watch the movie. ha. ha. ha. <br /> <br /> «self-fulfilling sequel» <br /> <br /> If I was your theater teacher at the school, I was not able to you solely on the basis of only this comment. <br /> <br /> I'm too disgusted to continue. Now I have to pass to the movie bashing my assistant, Mr. Bangla. <br /> <br /> Howdy! If you continue to read this far, I take it for granted that you have already seen the movie, and you are now looking for one of two things in this commentary: 1) Additional caustic humiliation that you agree it was only poor films. 2) Additional acrid humiliation that you feel was a good cinematic effort that needs to be protected from such slanderous scum like me. If you want to help your articulation of revulsion or mixing ammunition, ingenious, if I say something good that will only disappoint you - so let me assure you, there is little chance of such a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Other negative comments here on IMDb has listed the specific shortcomings of the film (eg, action, soundtrack, directing, dialogue editing, etc.), but all these faults can be easily forgiven, and themselves on its own. Few people will rent a movie called «Hood of the Living Dead", when they require these elements to be top-notch. The ultimate failure of the "Hood", however, is its inability to deliver on the rich promise of its name. «Hood of the Living Dead" is practically jumps off the shelves in the store video with its consequences banal jokes and brutally kills creativity. Here was the opportunity to mix cheesy gore in a zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto, to gangsta-thug zombie Bombin on innocent life while Rockin 'do-rag to indulge pimps Drivin' on the all-too-deadly for lice have tricked-out rides. A mixture of two genres could be fun. Instead, the film is more like watching high schools children timidly deliver lines in combination they do, but do not understand. To avoid feelings of betrayal on the part of their audience video rentals, I believe that the brothers Quiroz to re-release the film next new name: «Hood of the Living Dead: homemade horror video we shot on our video camera with friends on weekends in the summer of last year, because we were bored ". Or, perhaps, they could release it as a documentary. "Day of Dead art: a study of how low budget film can still be completely devoid of sound or original thought, despite the absence of a major movie studio.» <br /> <br /> A potential employer, whose interests were not depressed You should find the following statement on the back of the video case: «The Quiroz Brothers have once again proved that the observation of things you can easily do on your own is not very interesting," - Mr. Bangla..
