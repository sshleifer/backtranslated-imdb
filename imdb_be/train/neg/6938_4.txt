In this film, the old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman again. He meets her at his restaurant. The younger woman, Tabu, flirts with him. He does not know what to do, and asks her. Her reaction to his invitation rather strange. It is assumed, it would be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> And it irritates me the whole movie. It was not funny. Jokes and script were terrible! Only jokes I loved were on the waiter's mouth, but after a few times, even the fact that the beginning of the bore. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has a little friend called sexy. It was a strange relationship! Little girl with a crazy old! It was scary! I know that someone may be attached to the baby, but this man has grown conversations with the child. It makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Father Taboo is Paresh Rawa. He must give Amitabh a difficult time, but we all know Paresh, he can not do it. So even talk in the end, when they sit around the table, even what was supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> I just like movies that are actually funny. I guess I'll never watch this movie again.
