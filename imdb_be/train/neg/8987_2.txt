Only redeeming quality of this film is the actual story ... Otherwise, this movie was terrible. The action was ridiculously bad, and the set design was poor and very sticky. The story was decent, but it was very difficult to observe because of all the hardcore action. I would not recommend playing this ... only redeeming quality of this film is that the actors were more attractive ... especially Ryan Bauer, the man who plays a soap opera star. Some editing was well done, but there is a continuity error everywhere ... I'm just starting to look tired gay movies that bad ... We can get a good in the near future?
