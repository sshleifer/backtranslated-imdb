I do not agree with much that has been written and said about this alleged "masterpiece" of the German New Wave: <br /> <br /> 1) There are serious shortcomings in simple terms, mainly due critical plot points, and related abortion Mary and secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers understand that the husband agreed, in exchange for a substantial financial reward, not to return and reclaim their wife, while Oswald was not dead? <br /> <br /> 2) ending very unsatisfactory, since arbitrary and random. The original script called for Mary to commit suicide after reading the freedom Oswald, on learning that her husband was at work sold their marriage Oswald. In a final embodiment, however, only works Maria tap water through her wrist in sign suicide. Maria then summarily blown, instead of to confront and live with the consequences of his self-deception and moral compromise. <br /> <br /> 3) Fassbinder seeks forcibly imposed on the private public, political to the personal. Contrary to what the critics and "experts" say, I do not think it works. Just interfering historical news radio or the sound of jackhammers German reconstruction in the soundtrack to the dramatic events of the film does not make these historical events are an integral part of the drama. <br /> <br /> Mary strife rise from poverty to prosperity is designed to parallel the so-called economic miracle of post-war Germany. Mary, therefore, is intended to be a woman-specific and reflects its time and place, but in reality is not a genuine and non-specific. Women were to assert its independence by using sex for self-promotion in the century. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, there are several cases of inexcusable carelessness and inexperience - addiction Fassbinder and, as a result of impatience and carelessness had their effect. Unidentified people talk behind the scenes never to be seen; Music ineptly obsession in the field; and melodramatic posturing sporadically replaces action. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the film condemning the country for malicious collective amnesia of the Holocaust, he never mentions it once.
