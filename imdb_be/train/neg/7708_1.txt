The only aspect of this film, which keeps it from my least favorite piece of celluloid waste represents one line spoken by an agent who is trying to break into a man-eating tomato, dressed in a tomato suit: "Can someone please pass the ketchup" I strongly I call someone from sleep disorders to use this film as a sedative; it works better than demarol overdose.
