This must be the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is a smoothie? He looked deformed. I wish I knew that he and Naomi Watts is a commodity in real life, because I had 2 very long hours of my life I wonder what she saw in him. <br /> <br /> heartthrob Orlando Bloom? With the skinny beard and deer-in-headlights look about him, I can not say that I agree. <br /> <br /> Rachel Griffiths was just a fairy tale itself, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he could not wait to get out of the set. <br /> <br /> I have to regret bankrobbers and murderers? This is far from Butch Cassidy, who was actually an interesting film. It was corny, clich√©-ridden and dull. We stayed only because we were convinced that it will be better. This is not so. <br /> <br /> In the last 10-15 minutes or so it was unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are hiding in the border the hotel, while women and children are dying because of their presence. It's not funny. But it was funny, when they left the hotel with the armor, because everything that we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say: "I'll bite yer feet!" We howled with laughter, like some other members of the audience deformed. When we left, almost everyone said that it is a waste of time this film was. <br /> <br /> I did not pay money to see this disaster (watching the film), but it certainly was not free. It cost me 2:00 of my life that I will never go back.
