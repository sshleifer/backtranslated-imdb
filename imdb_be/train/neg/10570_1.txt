Do not let the MPAA fool you with their Â«Rated R for extreme violence" there is definitely no extreme violence in this sad peice with s * t. I was expecting some cheap Rambo 3 types of actions that the trailer promised, but it's just boring sad stuff with tons of lame may slow flashbacks that make no sense. AVOID!
