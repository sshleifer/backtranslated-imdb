I could not believe it. I had to rub my eyes a few times. Was it true? <br /> <br /> Yes, there were, Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Scoggins - they all have some way of talent, but here they were all in the fact that basically boils down to a slight movement of Cinemax leather style set on board the spacecraft! <br /> <br /> Sad as it is, «Alien Intruder» tries to be unique to the computer virus / alien demon / harpy / whatever you want to call her name Ariel (Scoggins) infiltration of this kind, a high-tech virtual reality station on board the spacecraft, where four men are allowed to live out their fantasies, the system will no longer see their captain (Williams). <br /> <br /> I wonder? Maybe, but everything plays out just how well laid episode «Red Shoe Diaries». Williams classes all right and left, and it seems that he would prefer to do something else, somewhere else. Oh, all people do for money .... <br /> <br /> FX fairly static, maybe even less than you'd expect for a straight to video a song like this. Unfortunately, even the nakedness of women is less than might be expected. Sexual innuendo is the real star here, and, of course, he gets all the best scenes. <br /> <br /> If you like the film that all tease and no brains, check «Alien Intruder». Of course, you probably look no further than Cinemax at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. <br /> <br /> no stars, not even for the fact that the power of the stars, this film can muster. <br /> <br /> Leave the lost in space.
