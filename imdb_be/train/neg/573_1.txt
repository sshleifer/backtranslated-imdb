Last reviewer was very generous. I silently, as in the first film, but I can not say I enjoy it very much. Start tolerant, but it goes downhill pretty fast. I just do not see Jon Bon Jovi as a "badass vampire hunter" and a vampire princess or sexy or scary. Many scenes simply does not make sense. I mean, any normal person would suspect something if a strange woman suddenly appears out of nowhere to tempt you, not to mention an experienced hunter. Why Una is able to talk to Jovi? Nothing was ever to explain in this movie, you would not mind if it was interesting, but it was too much to ask. This should be one of the worst vampire movie I saw.
