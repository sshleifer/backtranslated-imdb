Supporters of the horror we all know that a blind hire is a crap shoot. Sometimes we find a real gem, but many times we find that the movie we just spent our hard-earned money on it is nothing more than rotten steamer is deteriorating quite undeserved rave reviews and awards Fest films listed on the packaging. Such is the case with the five Across the eyes (the name I'm sure that this ambiguity in mind and budget movies and obsessive who watched it, you may have to use all five fingers to strike their eyes). <br /> <br /> history, or at least that * ahem * writers think passes for one, centers on a group of teenage girls who unwisely decided to go to the wilderness Joyride late at night after leaving the game of football and broke Var 'yatka woman who plays cat and mouse with them as a punishment for what she thinks the girl was found in his car after a fender-bender in the parking lot of a gas station. <br /> <br /> In fairness, it's an interesting idea. Some of the best horror very simple storylines. This is performed by Five Across eyes that this idea falls flat. The film tries to be a cross between The Blair Witch Project with its shaky camera work and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its minimalistic approach to the material, but success has being neither. What we get instead of redundant chase scene, torture, exemption; chase torture, deliverance, in the order, within 94 minutes, with long breaks whine, wail and incoherent doubtful actions as many additions in between Chase sequences. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the film is incredibly grainy and dark, that is, in the best of the film might increase tension and realism. That's just annoying. The characters are underdeveloped, and the audience is hard pressed to find something to sympathize with them. One character stops to get the first aid kit and, as a rule, a few scratches on his face, and the shots heard in the background show her friends can be killed. Another girl mumbles funny dumb lines like "Do not go there, it will get you if she gets you it will kill you, and if you kill us, you're dead." <br /> <br /> It was the honor of Fangoria magazine and Dreadcentral.com listed on the box, which made me check this. We are talking about a fake orgasm! Perhaps my expectations would have been met it was in the comedy section. I'm all for a low-budget Indy horror, but this one takes the cake shit. Let the fear of eyes (or fate ;? Get). Skipping <br /> <br /> RazorFriendly gives DESTINY 1 slash five /
