I grew up with Scooby Doo my whole life, my father grew up with Scooby Doo. We just watched the first episode of the parody, which calls itself Shaggy and Scooby get a clue. What planet Warner Bros on allowing it to slaughter in the air. Characters could be done better than my younger sister. The story could have been better written by my 3-year-old twins cousin (who are supporters of Scooby Doo, too). Scooby and Shaggy simply !!!!! if anyone but Casey Kasem does voice Shaggy's just not going to work people !!!! believe me. <br /> <br /> This program has been disgraceful. What's New Scooby Doo much better. Why change a winning format. Bin this piece of trash and return to the true Scooby
