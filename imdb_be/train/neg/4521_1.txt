Biker entire genre film should be made up of the worst films ever made. It gives one a lot of struggle, a generous amount of blood, bikers fighting Indians and the slums of the city, which is inflated and took one hut while. Action goes badly. What happened to Robert Walker, Jr.? At some point, he was in some major studio, and then he just disappeared. This film is really blowing, but if you have not seen the movie Biker for a long time, it's a good one to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel a bit cheesy for what looked it!
