Steve Martin should quit trying to do a remake of the classic comedy. He absolutely does not correspond to that part. As a slide, a remake of Out Of the newcomers, the film falls flat on his face. How anyone thought that Steve Martin could even come close to the excellent performance of Jack Lemmon it is beyond me and the same is true for this film. Aykroyd could play a role Bilko better. Martin is great when doing their own original characters, but fails miserably trying to recreate the classic work of others. It is a sad statement when the funny part of the movie is contained in the first row of titles when the film is over. The line "manufacturers are grateful to the total absence of cooperation on the part of the United States Army" just a single line that really made me laugh. If you want to see a real Bilko, to get hold of the original episodes of Phil Silvers Show. They are guaranteed to make you laugh, unlike the error that never should have happened. I put this film in the same category as the aforementioned Lemmon and classic remake of psycho. None of them should not have ever happened.
