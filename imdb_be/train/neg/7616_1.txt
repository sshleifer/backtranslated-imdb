The good news was to make a movie based on the alleged Aztec myth and showing unusually Aztecs-US (such a word exists) shade. The bad news is that he died at birth. <br /> <br /> If Ed Wood retired and George Romaro coached through his classic "Night of the Living Dead", this is what we could come up with. "The Legend of Diablo" clearly fodder for all future resurrections «Mystery Science Theater 3000!» <br /> <br /> I do not think you can even call it a film «B». the production values ​​are so desperate that I keep getting the feeling that I was watching a long scene from variety of household or 8-mm film shot by a group of schoolchildren. <br /> <br /> Some SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The main storyline sounds interesting enough to entice me to hire him. In rural areas of California sheriff finds a box Aztec demon and accidentally frees him to an unsuspecting community. His daughters, one hot and one home, a team from the gringos FBI man and a priest to try to re-demon cage. <br /> <br /> At the same time, each one zombie scenes ever seen in the previous films immortal re-enacted, bad. These zombie walk more like an army Nutty professors than the undead! Prospective infrared scene from the perspective of the demon is nothing special ?? he / she / it sure seems like a lot of backup (as opposed to turning around the forward movement). And the scene where a priest tempts the devil out of the cave in the fast movements ridiculous! It is actually, in fact, it seems to be done for comic effect, although I know that it was not! I kept waiting for the title music of Benny Hill to start the game and the whole gang of zombies to start chasing the priest all the beach! <br /> <br /> Of course, Darth Vader / Area Dreams voices calling an FBI agent becomes completely comic. Then again, so that most of this cheese ball! Robert Napton, director and writer, has to win something for this effort! (How about a lifetime blackballing, as the "Hollywood 10?") This is one, I now see the estimated 1.5 to 10 scale. I fear that this may be a bit generous! <br /> <br /> What is good about this movie? Well, Lindsey Lofaso looks pretty hot, as the youngest daughter of the dead sheriff. This is probably why her homely older sister (Calvo Pabon) really ran away from home! Fred Estrado reasonably decent as an FBI agent. Interestingly, when Mario Soto, who played the father Rodriguez, the same Mario Soto, who pitched for Cincinnati? If so, he should stick to baseball. In fact, they could not do worse if they went with a baseball theme and called it "Demons in the distant!» <br /> <br /> If I find out that it was actually a project for a college class cinema I'll give an apology. This may be good enough for a B or B +, as long as the band got back to the camcorder college campus in one piece! «The Blair Witch Project» proved that cool, campy film could be made on a shoestring. "Legend of Diab", although it would appear, has no shoes or lace to work with! It was a low-budget, low-talent, low everything. The very final scene, and I mean the last 10 seconds of the film and only mildly creative or interesting point. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 3.45 to rent it. I could better spend it on a hamburger!
