"Terrible people" should be the subtitle of this terrible film. If you want to see ordinary people doing ordinary things, then look out of the window in real life. But if you want to see bad people doing boring things, you'll have to look that awful film by Mike Leigh. The characters speak in detail, but never actually manages to communicate with each other. Why not? Presumably because Leigh that all of us is ineffective and pathetic as his actors, and he wants to shoot real life. But we are not so, and he failed.
