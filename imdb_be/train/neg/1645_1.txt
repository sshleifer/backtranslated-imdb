I just watched this movie last night and I had to put a warning for anyone else is considering the opportunity to see this film. In a word - no. I seriously feel that this is something that the student would write the scenario in phase Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy, that is, every word was a curse. I have no problem with a rich evil, as in "Good Will Hunting", as long as it helps to understand the characters. In this case, it was just banter with a hollow attempt to draw occassional * * choking or laughter from the audience. The three main characters all of their own unique stereotype breakthrough wall street, cafes jerk, and "I-not-gay-Just-In-Touch-With-My-feminine SideÂ» slightly low toxicity in your dash. You just do not give a damn about any of them! They are all small, unredemable losers who want to see you lose. For those who dare, this movie has a couple of funny moments at the beginning and the end. Toilet / vibrator scene funny in a sick kind, "Well, yes" means. Really, though, I would only recommend this film has the worst of enemies.
