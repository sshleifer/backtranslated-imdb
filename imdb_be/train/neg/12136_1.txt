I saw this movie on TV in the afternoon, and I can not see how anyone can sit through this piece of garbage. This is not funny, and it takes your IQ down a few notches. I know that this film for children, but it does not mean that writers should take their intelligence for granted. I bet the writers sat around a large wooden table and realized that a) the word "food" still a lot of laughs. b) four feet tall child can soak for ten foot tall basketball net. c) Children should always deal with the kidnappers, armed with firearms, as thieves will fall for anything, and d) 3 months karate training is all you need to beat the so-called "ninja" with swords. One good thing I can say about this movie, it contains the weakest suburban "gang" in the world that can not frighten anyone. Maybe the guys in the MST3K could use this film for a good laugh. Do not mess with this lame ass reason for the film.
