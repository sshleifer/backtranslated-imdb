Jeez, only in the 70s ... Margherita brings us this bizarre hybrid of a spaghetti western and kung-fu flick formed around hunting treasures. Spices of the bad co-production between Shaw Brothers and the one-time Italian companies include humorous story, off-the-wall events and some very tame T & A. Additional campy moments, serviced reverse wig Lee Van Cleef, leather-clad bible-thumping psycho shot Yancey Hobbitt (loveably hammed to Julian Ugarte, a man who had to make way more obscure European genre productions than he), Wanna -be-witty dialogue, cheerful background music and very funny sound effects that accompany various small events (and pour over each jump made by Lo Lieh). <br /> <br /> while this little piece of the action falls fare and the area on the territory of Turkey, it is great to see the Van Cleef and A l on the same screen, and you can not deny the charisma of the duo. Do not expect too much and you'll get a lot out of it. <br /> <br /> This is my truth. What is yours?
