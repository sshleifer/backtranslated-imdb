The dance was probably the only watchable thing about this film - and even that was a disappointment compared to some other films. ! My Gawd <br /> <br /> For me, this is the worst kind of film - one that provides that a work of art, because he has all the attributes of the film-as-art. Yes, it's nice to take a picture, but ultimately lacks the depth and strength of dance, around which the film is supposedly surrounds himself. Tango tease, it's hot, there is drama, this bold - just what this movie is not.
