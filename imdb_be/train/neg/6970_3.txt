Now, it would be kind of cliché, when I started with a little bit of a name, so I'll wait for it. Firstly, this film made me wonder why kids do stupid things, like hanging around in labs and break bottles. Then I realized that this is a film with a message that the message is hitting a child and things like this will not work. Things like that you ask? Things like insectish giant monster grow and cause a little mayhem before his death in a typical "kill the monster indirectly" fashion. Now, as promised ... Blue Monkey ... has nothing to bluish or any Simián of any kind. Now snot, I was a fool or something. The picture on the cover was a huge mistake / crab / idiot / thing on the front minting some shouting nurses. It was interesting, but I would like monkeys! just enjoyed the most extreme Primate few nights before (half-drunk on brandy vats Creame in the form of you) I was in the mood for more monkey-style hook 80. Not so much. If you love snowboarding monkey or blue things, this movie is not for you. If you like bugs and a good reason to hit a child, to take it off.
