I read the novel "Jane Eyre" for the first time in 1986 was around this time when I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was a great option, and is very similar to the book. A few years later, I had his eye on this version, and I was horrified. William Hurt completely miscast as Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is hot in nature, where, as William Hurt reflects it as a block of ice. The same applies to the Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like two zombies together. This is a story about love and passion, but I could not see it in this version. No, go back to the BBC-version. A great time is guaranteed.
