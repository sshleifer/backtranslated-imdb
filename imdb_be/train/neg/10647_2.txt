The last film starring Weissmuller Tarzan (looking surprisingly at the age of a year after "Tarzan and the Huntress") poor in spite of all the little things you can add to make it better. Obviously, the CSC tried to make a great farewell for Weissmuller, shooting in the beautiful scenery in Mexico, with the top star of the country (Andrea Palma) and several awards cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa, carry prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin make evaluation. While it may cost less to shoot abroad, it looks more expensive than any other film RKO in a series, using the beaches of Acapulco and real pyramids as Aquatania, and with great decor for all scenes associated with the temple of the god Bala (especially appearance, built on the steep rocks.) Kurt Neumann was to remain as a director, and Robert Florey, which gives it a very slow pace. Neumann did an excellent job with the "Tarzan and the Amazons", "Tarzan and the Leopard Woman" and "Tarzan and the Hunter," and ended his career, directing the classic «The Fly» a year before his death; while Flory became a television director, after a career of several great films. If Weissmuller looks tired, Cheeta the chimpanzee plays not as good as others, but the worst character Benji ~ d, reverse postman who sings awful songs (which have a Caribbean air in place, presumably in Africa and shot in Mexico!) Sad and obviously questionable taste, it was a sad farewell with Weissmuller Tarzan in.
