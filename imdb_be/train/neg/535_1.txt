Some of these comments are ridiculous viewer. It does not hurt to watch with your significant other? I apologized to my friend the film. <br /> <br /> It was so slow and very strange. <br /> <br /> And Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were unsuitable for this, especially with Vanessa makes this funny cheeky American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes had the same wavy lip awkward girl, she was in my so-called life. She still does not push himself in any way. Girl, find a new way to pretend to cry! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was one of the only saving part of this movie, it was on the screen for five minutes, and I swear to God, she is stretched out on the silver screen and hit me awake. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, who gets better every time I see him. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins also high in these two and a half scene. <br /> <br /> I mean, it was a good shot the film, it was very beautiful, the settings were dressed interesting, providing relief I felt an intense longing for. <br /> <br /> I do not know, it's just some miserable when a film that has a shade consisting of "the greatest actresses of our time" sucks so much. It sure has been more than a few notable editing errors, and the protagonist (Anne) was a huge jerk. I was glad that she had died. But it's because I felt bad for Lila, friend Anne - mainly because these two women are the best actors and made me feel a bit of sympathy. <br /> <br /> Uh. BAD work, evening movie. You were not interested in, and you do not even makes you think. I very much hope that this book was better, so do not waste any more time people. 3/10
