In the first scene with "Malta Story" Man A.Guinness wore a striking resemblance to the Noel Coward that I expected, his first words to be "Some women have regularly surprises - like a gong," or some kind of world - weary Bon mot.Unfortunately his dialogue is hardly immortal prose and even the master would have problems bringing it to life.Indeed Mr. Guinness travels through the painting, as if looking for a coordinator and not finding one.And therein lies the fatal weakness of the film. Mr. J.Hawkins also enables early and ends up giving performance "Jack Hawkins" without an ounce individuality.It can be fused with any of a dozen British war movies.Many in the early fifties the usual suspects turn and do their shtick very few goals. The Air Force could not bomb the Malta into submission in much the same way as it did not bring him in London knees.The courage of the Maltese people in the face of the continuing danger was recognized by the king, and the island was awarded the George Cross.A worthy subject you would think a movie, but "the history of Malta" did not even qualify for the term "decent" in his most condescending sense.It it gives the appearance hastily knocked together to get the job done in time, perhaps, before the actors have lost will to live.
