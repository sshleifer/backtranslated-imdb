I would not call it terrible, but generally do not shine in this film, and it is burdened with some seriously incredible basically the story. It starts well, but after the main attack has been made, it goes a long scene around a young girl who is not conclusive, and some action scenes that theater of the absurd unreal. For example, there is a long exchange of fire at the airport in which all strobe lights. No explanation for this. How plausible is it that a storage area of ​​the airport will have lights that flash on and off mixing, and enough to allow Snipes to make his incredible escape trick? This is one of very few scenes interspersed aimlessly pulled a lot of windows, which are simply not able to do one in the suspension of belief. <br /> <br /> In addition, the entire room, it seems that the CIA team may shoot the place up, but get away with it, saying, "national security" to the British. This trick is based on the stereotype that has far from reality, to be satisfactory. <br /> <br /> There are many better fighters out there. It is better to formulate better executed. This is one time entertainment, but there just is not enough meat on the bones, and after a while it becomes very sad - that should never happen in a good action movie.
