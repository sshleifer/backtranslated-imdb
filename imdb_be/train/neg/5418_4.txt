This film material SE Hinton wrote in the 1970s and Copola adjusted to the screen at the beginning of the 80s, and if in fact it was a product Trueblood, the results may have been much better (especially in the department of acting). Instead, we get quite so bad, his pitiful piece of mediocrity. <br /> <br /> Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street Rumbler, I believe, is an accurate description. This was in the days of the militants, who used the guys in their 40s and mid30s and put them in the Greaser filaments or some more feminine apparel choices gang, and they fought with lousy music 80th. However, Ray is the lone caretaker of his younger brother, Donna (Chad Lowe in the part where he cries a lot), he is forced to leave inexplicably at the station, when on the run from the cops, he was caught and forced to serve his sentence in the sea infantry. Fast forward to the present day, and Ray returned to the city and looking for his brother, who also became part of a gang, but the gang, which was against Ray and now old scores should be forcibly settled (and, again, the police must be dodged, and this time , defended the honor of the women in action meaning the film) before Rey could lead the life of a normal pace with his brother Donnie. <br /> <br /> for the most part, the film is quite funny. For me, much of this has to do with too many replays, though not Fahey or Fenn, who plays waitress he befriends. The guys in the band and Lowe himself seems to do quite a bit too exaggerated, like street thugs New York. Although, the more you hang it recycled storylines and perhaps a kind of film that was well past the flowering of the product in 1989.
