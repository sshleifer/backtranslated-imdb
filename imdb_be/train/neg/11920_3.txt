Oscar Wilde comedy style, perhaps a witty play ever written, but it is destroyed in the hands of second-rate actors. Sanders, as would be expected by chance, without a brilliant job in the role of Lord Darlington, but the rest of the cast makes the whole process a waste of time. Jean Crane tries to stage the emphasis in alternative sentences and other members of the troupe seem to believe that this is a melodrama and comedy; in fact, all products are bookend, reducing it to a tragedy - no doubt, Hays office insisted. Preminzhera direction seems to lie mainly in the fact that there are a lot of servants and even music seems banal. Stick with visually perfect dumb charade, as a director Lubitsch or even 2004 version of the screen with Helen Hunt, Mrs. Erlynne; or try to read a play of words to meet. But skip this version.
