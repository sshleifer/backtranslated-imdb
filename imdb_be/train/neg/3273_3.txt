The Dukes of Hazzard is quite the achievement ?? $ 53m film, which is worse than any of the 25-episode downmarket summer shows. The plot is quite serviceable, but mindless fun is rare to find and cast a rather brutal: Johnny Knoxville more than a passenger hero, M.C. Gainey in Sheriff Roscoe is bland thug Enos Michael Weston tedious, seemingly perfectly-cast Willie Nelson just seems to be waiting for checks to clear and Burt Reynolds, stuck in some kind of purgatory, where he is doomed to relive his old movies like bit player, a curious choice for Boss Hogg, to put it mildly, but there is one good point with Heckler and hundred-dollar bills. You know that the film is in trouble when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic screen presences ?? But worse than the script or casting hopeless direction of Jay Chandrasekhar: seemingly born without any concepts of comic timing, are not able to do much more than the basic two shots and seemingly ignorant of how to shoot a car chase not to mention the a pair of decent stunts in the film, he seems determined to blow up the film of any sign of life before they materialize. There are a few neat postmodern moments that revolve around the stereotypical role of the flag of the Confederation and Daisy in every episode, but not a movie that makes you miss the days when Hal Needham directed this kind of thing (and bad) can be a good thing.
