I'll say it again: this film was completely inaccurate. Kids will love it, of course, but the adults ... doubtful. All of this was basically a retelling of the original, which was to be expected, since they are largely explore the whole concept in the first film, but still they have the whole movie were completely recount? I mean, all newly made from the Little Mermaid. The worst part of this "crazy sister UrsulaÂ» Morgana, who appears out of nowhere and threatens the Melody, that's funny, because Triton is, with his magic trident. Triton why not do anything about it? Since the plot required to do nothing on it. I could go on, but I will not. All this shameless attempt to rake in more money from the Little Mermaid, and obviously thrown together without any thought because they know it will sell. In general, it is a terrible waste of time.
