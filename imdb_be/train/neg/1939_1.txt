Come on! Overcome with guys bashing Pakistan. Bollywood can not only make a brilliant movies-, but can seriously affect the generation of viewers. <br /> <br /> I am a huge Bollywood, but the fan anti-Pakistani films just make me wince too much to enjoy the ScreenPlay, cinematography, action sequences- all. <br /> <br /> I am very pleased to see that the audience on both sides reject the propaganda, and there are films like Main Hoon Na, there did brilliantly, not only because they deserve that because of the quality of its Bollywood masala-, but also because he is trying to say: give peace a chance and shows that there are psychos out there on both sides, which do not represent the masses.
