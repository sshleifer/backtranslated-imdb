Wow! This film is really awful. I can not imagine how someone could read it poorly written script and gave it the green light. The cast is uniformly high speed with some really most performance from virtually all the actors. History inconsistent, fragmented and incoherent. Eloquent, leaden and predictable. A lot of wit or charm or humor. Not least in sexually. Symbols remain flat as the proverbial pancake. There is also a strong current of misogyny, which is becoming more and more difficult to digest, as the film went on. If the lead (Karel) is unfunny and unattractive it is downhill from there. Despite this phony turnover end where love wins over lust I stayed with a sick feeling in the stomach. If this is what passes for humor and social commentary, we definitely condemned.
