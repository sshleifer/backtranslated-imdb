I loved the first two movies, but this film was just a waste of time and money (for me and the studio). I still wonder why they did this horrible film. The thing with a plastic gun and a toy car that can go to the other house is ridiculous. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two films, so funny, but the terrorists in this so stupid and not funny. Believe me, this film is just a waste of time.
