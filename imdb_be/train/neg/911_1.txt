This must be one of the most terrible of Swedish films ever. <br /> <br /> It is inconvenient that such a bad scenario allowed to become a film and shown in cinemas as recently as the year 2006. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many visible sponsorship products in one and the same film. It should be obvious. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why so many famous actors, even thought the idea even be seen in a film like this. If I had no respect for some of the famous actors in this film before I saw the film, it was precisely now. <br /> <br /> I heard that will follow the film before, and I can not understand how this is possible.
