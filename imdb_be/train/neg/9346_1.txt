This film was a yawn from the rights to loans, it is sad to the point of boredom and the current wooden and unnatural! However, it was directed by Richard Jobson direction debut, but who on earth the green light scenario as underdeveloped as this? It seems that more money (surprise, surprise credited Scottish Screen) to wind a government project. I almost fell asleep three times, and my review will unfortunately have to be more restrained than this. Please, please, Mr. Jobson what you've done in this direction soothing film, come back to it!
