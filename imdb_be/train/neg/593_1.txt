This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Worse than the hideous US waste; worse than the Glitter - Mariah Carey at the American slag par excellence. I can only imagine that the writers and producers take a huge amount of recreational drugs, as well as the discussion of the plot actually thought it was a good idea. it is not. It is pathetic rubbish from the very depths of Satan himself (which would probably have written a better script was he put his mind to it). Robert Jones as Exce Producer, spending our taxpayers' money (lottery money people) on this piece of nonsense, must be held accountable. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re-do Deathline ??? I ask you - the camp like a Christmas tree, Deathline ... Â«Beware of the door" is a classic British film really bad, we really do not need a reminder. And we certainly do not want a bad, a second course, bad scripting, poorly developed and poorly piece of garbage like this. All this is funded by the UK agency that brought us the sexual life of men potato ... I rest my case. <br /> <br /> Do not pay money to see it. This is the absolute and complete crap - Rescue grace one for manufacturers is that they received a huge wedge of cash ... our money ... to prepare it. They should hang their heads in shame. <br /> <br /> I am staggered at the low, low level of this film. It makes me, Monsignor, that our national body to support the film actually thought that should be supported. There is no hope for the British film industry while idiots ball. Harvey Wienstein where are you? Come back, we forgive you !!!
