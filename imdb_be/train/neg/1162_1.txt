I went to see this movie in our College Theater thirty years ago because I liked Bruce Dern in Silent Running and family areas. On this day (sorry Jack Nicholson), it is still a sad movie I've ever seen. He just went on and on without any noticeable point, and then - it just ended. The lights came on, and I watched all looking confused. If projectionist missed coil? I never had a desire to learn. All I remember about the movie, it's not a drama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach. The most pleasant part of the film looked completely Mystified epilogue audience. Fortunately, this is only an exception for the Jack Bruce and Karen Black.
