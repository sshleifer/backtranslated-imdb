I do not want to be the one to rain on the parade (even a small one like this), but from the very first scene, you could say that this film was supposed to be the absolute shit. Its a shame really, I just like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I was intrigued by how they are mixed together in the film, but to my dismay, they do not even have a scene together !! I think I need to repeat it - the two leading actor (which stand side by side on advertising posters and DVD covers) do not have a scene together !!!! They are not talking to each other and do not show up on the screen simultaneously. Just about sums this poor excuse for a movie. False advertising. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was painful, every character in the film was unreal, and non-human like. The scenarios were far-fetched, the story was crap, jokes were thin, Freeman tried too hard to be funny (and played a poor mans Tim out of the office), no one was cute, and worst of all, some of the characters were so annoying that almost drove me to exclude because I could not watch, listen to them anymore. <br /> <br /> This low-budget bitch was an epic failure. Even Danny Dyer can not bring some humor and charm in this, but to bless, he tried. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> How anyone could appreciate this film, like "ten stars" me. Ten stars? Seriously? Well .... I'm not even going to give some of the big ten stars, as well as ten stars means that the film was perfect. This film was far from perfect, almost opposite, which means that he was almost completely disastrous everywhere. <br /> <br /> See if you like, but if you've seen a lot of movies, and watched a lot of great movies, your feedback is likely to be similar to mine. <br /> <br /> 1/10
