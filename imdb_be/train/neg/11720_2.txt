I read in the newspapers that W.Snipes exploded so it is not surprising that he would be in the low part of the project budget as The Contractor.He not only the next action star to join the growing club: penny star steps 90s (Van damme, Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here he plays a leading role in a cheap action movie, which was filmed in Bulgaria (we must believe that the London location as only a complete idiot would buy it) The story is one of the 1,000 other films: a retired special forces good guy gets hired by the government again make wet job- after that the government wants to get rid of him- good guy gets away after killing the bad guys (that spoiler guess not ?!), stars of the film: a little girl (Eliza Bennett) is superior to all the others in the cast !!! one star for her plus one star for eye candy Headey is 2 stars. Only for lovers of the hard pressed Snipes everything else: avoid!
