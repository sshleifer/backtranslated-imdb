It was the worst movie I have ever seen in theaters. It is simply a compilation of recycled material. People get hit in the head is not funny. People push is not funny. After the third time a guy threw in the balls not even the youngest member of the audience was laughing anymore. He just got tired quickly. <br /> <br /> I went with my younger sister. In fact, she laughs out loud at the king of the hill, but this cinematic masterpiece bothers her. I'm not surprised. The story is quite inaccurate. Dwarf thief stealing a large diamond that is undoubtedly the easiest robbery in the history of Hollywood. Then he disappears with his family, pretending to be a child. I know that this sounds interesting, but it's a long story. For example, these two lines again and again for 1.5 hours, and you get the picture were the predictable jokes galore. I really felt ripped off after seeing this. I was not expecting much, and I was still disappointed. I would like Keane simply hire a writer to write a decent jokes and / or the following scenario. It was even worse than White Chicks, if possible. I saw a middle school play, which was better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about this film. I do not like my entertainment to be dumbed down.
