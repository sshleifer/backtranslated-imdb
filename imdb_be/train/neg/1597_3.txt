This movie is designed classic sentiment than on any quality movie making. It moves from unlikely incredible, from the unreal funny. <br /> <br /> The incredible story revolves around the attempts of two British soldiers and a Hindu boy on errands, to save a third soldier who was captured by rebel Indians. In a later scene, we see a full regiment of the drum and bagpipes marched into an ambush. In the British Army, the sergeant orders not to attempt a rescue, and if you get past that it does not try it just one other soldiers and an Indian slave, if there is a full regiment of the arm. Indian militants so incredibly inept it is ridiculous ... there are hundreds of them, but they can not keep them in captivity or kill two rescuer, of course not. At one point we see the British soldiers threw down the stone blocks with loopholes on the rebels, who are scattered across the mountainside in an ambush ... one will have eggplant for the brain to think that it will do any damage. After Cary Grant as the rescued prisoner was shot, he was lying on the floor, looking around in the water boy ... is hardly the action of someone who had been shot in the back. Water boy bravely blowing horn (that comes out of nowhere) to sound the alarm ... he does, standing high on the wall so that he could see and shoot bad guys, and we tears, he keeps trying to sound more music like it repeatedly shot and Bell falls into faint cries ... instead of blowing horn, hiding behind cover, as well as anyone with half a brain would do. This scene is deservedly been parodied in comedy sketches. If they wanted to make a comedy of Buster Keaton, they had hired Keaton and make it better.
