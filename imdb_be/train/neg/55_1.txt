There are only two films, I would give 1/10 for this bitch and "The Man Who Fell to Earth." I remember, as a protocol to the theater in the early '80s, when I was in high school. The scenario for all offenses (including high school student) intelligence. He completely lost me from «Hillarious» gag someone get shot in the ass. Goldie Hawn must be charming, but it comes across as sad and feeble-minded. Then there is the offensive stereotypes about Arabs and then Goldie victory over all of the batter populist dig. The acting was terrible, including Goldie Hawn years. I could not see another movie, it was as IMO it is not redeemed himself in Everyone Says I Love You. This is the kind of movie do you do when you want to put all the efforts in the scenario record. The worst.
