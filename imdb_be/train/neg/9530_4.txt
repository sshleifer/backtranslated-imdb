I think that this film is based on some real history .... It is about two young girls who pester adults within 48 hours.; I do not see where the fear comes into play here .... There are some "strange" and "surreal" sequence in the film. And two girls (Sondra Locke and ... ah ... oh well) to play the roll of two psycho-human contempt for the handle ... they do a very good job (although some of them only slightly above) the film is not very good, and it has not got ,. it's just really really from! I mean, it's dripping with 70s .... it's not so bad, if you like that sort of thing ... you know ... that thang?
