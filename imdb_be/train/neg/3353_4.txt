Pretty bad movie offers nothing new. The usual creaks and groans are trying to make up confused, but fine stories. Acting just above miserable. Why Liam Neeson has signed on to it, one can only guess. Owen Wilson is really turning into one of the worst performances in the recent history of horror cinema. Catherine Zeta-Jones is fun to watch and not much else, although Lili Tayor made above-average performance. The special effects were quite memorable, and the house itself was breathtaking and hauntingly gorgeous. However, they can not make up for the poor action and a story that seems to have been thrown together at the last minute. Do not disturb.
