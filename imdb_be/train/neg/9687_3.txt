This confuses the film. <br /> <br /> Beauty in sexual relationships between men and women showed degraded set of men and women that can only be described as a collection of weirdos and losers. <br /> <br /> Greenway admits his inspiration for the Fellini film "8 1/2," but while Fellini titan of world cinema, Greenaway no. <br /> <br /> He does not have the ease of maestro touch, nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with the agility of clarity. <br /> <br /> It is pretentious, the film is divided into chapters with a written introduction to each as if the viewer must navigate in the film except that written statements only stay on the screen for a few seconds, not long enough to be read by the audience, with the result that they are basically ignored. <br /> <br /> As for the women, only two can be described as Lookers, Palmyra, played by Polly Walker and Gioconda play Natacha Amal. The remaining sludge from the routine. Both women and men are retreating from the harsh reality of light in dull shades of fantasies. <br /> <br /> Greenway obviously wants to make the point that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness. Women depressing themselves, as they provide their services in exchange for money. . Relationships between men and women humiliated in a commercial transaction <br /> <br /> There's no sense of joy or happiness and love in the film, in fact, there are a few scenes that deeply disgusting: <br /> <br /> suggestion incestuous relationship between father and son, Philip, and Storte Emmentaler played respectively by John Standing, Matthew Delamere and. Callous disregard of both men that the Mona Lisa is a child, she actually got pregnant twice, the first time the fetus is aborted, and the second time, she was sent to a destination, select the person from the flight book. The two men who have sex with a woman who has no feet (half the women in the name). Beastiality, which exists between the Beryl, played by Amanda Plummer, a pig named Hortense. Father and son exchanged between the two women. Women enjoying the knock sexually. Father slept with the corpse of his dead wife. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, none of these scenes are shown sexually Sun, only hints. <br /> <br /> hinted degradation of women is such that it can not be surprising that the film was booed at when she was the first premiere in Cannes. What is more surprising is that the actress in the film began to protect him, showing once again that there are no restrictions on the naivety of women and that women deceive themselves exploited people. <br /> <br /> directorial style Greenaway pretentious, is a triumph of style over substance, shown as an art film is accompanied by a rejection of the common sense. <br /> <br /> Greenway is trying to reach the hill of surrealism, but only succeeds in showing the banality of human relations.
