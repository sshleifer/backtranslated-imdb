Family sorting parody mixing "An Officer and a Gentleman», «Heartbreak Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (and no doubt others I can not now recall the films) in a rather vague cinema, with some bright spots. The gags are always there, where you can I would expect them to, and the line of Damon Wayans is, well, predictable. As I said, unfortunately, this movie never surprises ...
