I remember, and enjoy it a few years ago, but again comes to it, I wonder why. I believe that it always looks good, and the girls are doing quite well, but the men, and let them down. Why oh why so many British films about sex, we need to have such inept men along the side of beautiful girls? Moreover, this begins predictably enough, as a sex farce like this in a spirit of confession movies, but about a third of the way through (while we begin to enjoy the presence of the beautiful Me Me Lai) film asks us to start taking it seriously . Not only that, but the central sequence of a rock club and cannabis is very forced and just look unnatural. In short, it is not as innocently stupid or clever serious, as it seems to intend. Richard O'Sullivan, perhaps as a central figure, could help, but I think this is one of his worst performances. Just worth it for the ladies.
