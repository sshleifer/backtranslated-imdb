If the writer / director is reading this (and I think you are now so you have to be out of work), then I must tell you - I've seen some bad movies in my time, but this is only one receives the difference between the presence of the worst room I ever heard, <br /> <br /> spoilers. - Nothing happens! <br /> <br /> A total waste of time. I laughed out loud at the end. <br /> <br /> A side note - (when the entire movie was her in a coma, or a scene where she was sleeping with this guy means someone raped her when she was struck?) <br /> <br /> utter nonsense.
