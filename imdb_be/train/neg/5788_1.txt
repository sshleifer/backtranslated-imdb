OK, so the company g-Agrama (which is involved in some questionable business with former Italian Prime Silvio Berlusconi) has made a terrible mess of to Mr. Carl Macek. <br /> <br /> What a monstrous Misha-mash I say? Well, Macko took three totally unrelated Japanese science fiction animated series (namely, the Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada), added a ton of dialogue - firmly believing that the American audience is too stupid to understand the story and art charity of silence - and edited the entire party to a large extent for the forcible retention, added some metaphysical fetish, duplicate it, using some of the worst actors this side of the voice acting singing hell (Reb West was - and still is - intolerable and total outrage, especially cf. al Vinniemu with Ms. Mari Iijima) ... and the result was a series of 85-episode continuity with hundreds of problems and plot holes. <br /> <br /> known mechanical watch was great (especially in the «Macross Saga») and plot portion that remained intact were good. But all that was good Robotech was not the result of Maček or "voice talent", he recruited. It is because of the work and effort (uncredited - Why I would be too bold to accuse of plagiarism here HG) Japanese authors. Those of us who eventually got wind of the real deal and compare the original Robotech want to now we have never been exposed to Robotech. . Original much better, of course, and make a lot more sense <br /> <br /> Robotech, however, something worthwhile: it prompted the legendary anime creator Leiji Matsumoto to start a campaign to protect Japanese anime creators' intellectual property from such unauthorized and unclaimed revisions that incompetent people like Carl Macek produces.
