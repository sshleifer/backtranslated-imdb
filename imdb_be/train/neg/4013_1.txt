After seeing some of the great stuff the HBO - Band Brothers, Rome, etc. - I must say that I was pretty high expectations before watching the first episode of «True Blood». Jeez. Often the script seemed written in 8-year-old, some of the awful removed, (The scene in which she "saves" Bill, I mean come on. She throws a chain at the guy, and oh! She walks around his neck, and that magically chokes him! it was very inconvenient if you want my opinion. Or a few moments before the scene when she learns that the pair went with Bill, it's ridiculous. she can hear how they plan their stuff, and like 5 seconds later, the magic ! 3 of them are gone, and without any struggle or noise or anything! <br /> <br /> I have in mind the idea of ​​the show, it seemed interesting, mysterious second, intriguing vampires co-existing with a person in our modern society ... but to be honest, I do not think they really wanted to do more than this petty Soap show that the average teenage girl is looking all the time, but no one cares about ... Unfortunately, the script is written poorly, at best, mediocre. this small and very predictable. I have often thought that it is some kind of joke or something. <br /> <br /> the actors put a very unconvincing performances, if you want to to know my opinion. They seem to take the show very easily, as if it were some ordinary, low-budget TV show family (well, maybe that's what it is, when you take the family side). The only actor who seemed to be somewhat good for me was Stephen Moyer as Bill, given the poorly-written, very short answers he had to say: "What are you ..." "Can I call you sometime ..." I I think that he has done well as a result of a number of mysterious scary part vampire, that any of the vampire role should be, in fact. Anna Paquin was good as well, but nothing more. but the guy playing her brother, although hell, it's awful. The scene in which he bullpen is just a shame modern television. Effective trash on, looks like a fake construction site to the bone, and the other two guys, "Why is he arrested? Uh .. I do not know ..." It was quite inconvenient. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I think was completely missed was the way they presented the mental strength Sookie. they make us to hear what people think and say in the same time, and that's just wrong. it just seems often too chaotic, as if the thought of people had some annoying radio and that when it approaches em it hits the desired level and frequency should hear what they think. <br /> <br /> Finally, the sexual scenes are clearly excessive, and vampire sex tape thing was just totally disgusting. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong - I wrote all these comments, not because I thought that the show was bad, but because I was very disappointed. I expected the quality of the material. I do not think it's going to be like that. This is definitely not a good show, though. At best, mediocre.
