Beaudray Demerille (weak Peter Fonda, who also directed), aging gambler wins young teenager Wanda "Nevada" (nice, but not talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game. However unlikely pair (of course) to get up to look for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> This is the story, and there's really no need to look for a deeper meaning in it. It simply does not exist. Action is very weak and it was very strange, considering the fact that Peter Fonda was in the lead. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something interesting in this film, look at the beautiful scenery and some good views of a young Brooke Shields. Her character, but it is so annoying (especially at the beginning), and it is that it never really comes off as sexy or attractive. Too bad, but given the history, I doubt that anything else could have done it. I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and starred in this film. He must have even persuaded his father (Henry Fonda) in the (useless) cameo in this ridiculous mess. Unfortunately, it was their only film together. Could not Henry be in Easy Rider, for example? 3/10
