Toward the end of the film, I felt that it was too technical. I felt like I was in the classroom, watching our fleet carries out rescues at sea. I like to see that the engines have fire extinguishers. I suppose I should have realized it before, but I never thought about it. Using the 747 for the transportation of valuable old paintings with very little security odd and not realistic. The action was very good, as they are experienced professionals, but if you're going to stretch that far from what is likely to happen, it must be more than a fantasy, comic, etc, it was very serious 'ozna. At least, the film was Felix Ungar as a pilot, with Buck Rogers, the night stalker, and Dracula is also on board. The film was filled with well-known faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a little for drama, but it will not hurt the quality of the film, when the serious issue turns into a caricature. That's why I said that it should have been more comical. My pet peeve with films about air travel is that all just happen to move. They go with the drinks, setting them down and pick them up after 5 minutes, just as if they were in the house or something, and act as if turbulence does not exist. In addition, I know that this is a film disaster, but the unknown should not include the 30-second freeze after hitting something. Anyway, experienced actors and actresses keep this weak scenario of having been made into a film, which got canned after its first screening. I like Lee Grant, but it was interesting to see how people get psychotic deck ... :)
