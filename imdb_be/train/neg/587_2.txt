The film distinguishes itself from the "miracle of the human body" mediocre documentaries on bravely, if quirky, preferring to cause revulsion in the viewer. In one scene, the chamber is closed at 50-foot giant pimple as a teenager squeezes manure and liquid therefrom.

In the final titanic power, the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through the woods ... teenage armpit hair. Unfortunately, I do not do any of this up. See this film if you have to, but: bring a vomit bag, and pasta salad in advance.
