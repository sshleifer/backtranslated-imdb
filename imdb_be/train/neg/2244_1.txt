There are two points I need to make clear right at the beginning. First of all, we all know that this year's Oscars were really all in this year. That was the way the Academy to show people that they are not racist, and never has been. They wanted to clear all the preconceived notions about themselves. Secondly, it is a kind of meaningless to make comments about the show, because in fact, what difference will it make? But, it is interesting to write about it. This year, I became bored with the Oscar! I will never watch the show again. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crowe wins «Gladaitor», when they should have a real winner with Ralph Fiennes on the "Sunlight". If you have not seen this movie yet, watch it and you'll agree. "Eyes Wide Shut" when released Sun receieved NO nominations. And as far as this year is, well, bad choices were everywhere! Baz Lurhmann not received "Best Director" nomination! Are you kidding !! "A Beautiful Mind" is for "Best Make-Up» ???? "Training Day" gets nominated ?? The film was terrible, and it seemed that Washington did not even turn in a performance, all that he has proven he knows how to use a four letter word! That's what won the award for hours! Take the language, and I'm sure he was almost playing himself! I liked the "Gosford Park", I really did, but why 7 nominations? And how on earth they could not give him too Altman! I mean, come on, if you just give people a reward, to clear any bad feelings about Altman? The man was not in the public eye for 32 years and an Oscar! There were many, many things that bothered me about this year's Oscars, but I'll live with it, as long as I never have to watch another show again! The culmination (and only one) of the show was when Woody Allen made his first appearance ever at the award show. It will go down in history as one of the greatest moments in the history of it shows.
