I was very surprised to see that this film was such a good rating when I checked it on the IMDb after viewing it. This is truly one of the I've ever seen the worst films, and I've seen a lot of bad movies. It looks like a good movie in the beginning, but when it comes to surgery, I could not believe how bad it got. This destroys all the voiceover! Just imagine that you are being opened like this, and then listen to what he says. I saw the movie in German, so I do not know what he said in English, but the ironic things like "Yes that's right, it does not hurt? .. "... what is it? Telling yourself to" think about something else, "and then forget their pain just thinking about his girlfriend just ... stupid. And his mother ... what the hell, it is clear that something like that from? Someone came to tell her that her son had died in surgery (she kind of had to wait). plus, she found several letters to Jessica Albas bag. plus, that "she knows that in the hospital "things ... and then takes her" one second "to figure this out? What is hell? ^^ And the ending ... why the police to ruin them? The patient died in surgery, and that's all that happened. It was a drunken doctor does not know anything, either ... and then ruin them all, even a girlfriend ??? Why ??? Despite all that, I think that Christensen did a poor job, but that does not really count on me ... these mistakes and stupid things, I wrote about the above problems. I watched this movie with my friends and we were all very disappointed ... As I said, one of the worst films I have ever seen ... Do not look;)
