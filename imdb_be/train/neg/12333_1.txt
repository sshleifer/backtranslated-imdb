Un-Bleeping-believable! Meg Ryan does not even look her usual saucy engaging itself in this, that usually makes me forgive her shallow Ticky acting chip. Hard to believe that it was a producer of this dog. Plus Kevin Kline: what kind of trip the suicide of his career has been on? Whistle ... Banzai !!! Finally it was directed at the person who made the Big Chill? There must be replay Johnstown - Hollywood style. Wooofff!
