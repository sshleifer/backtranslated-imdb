Routine mystery / thriller with respect to the killer hiding in the swamps. In the early days of television, this one has been shown so often when my father said, "What's on TV tonight?" And we would say to him, "the strangler of the swamp," he would pack us to the movies. We went to the movies a lot in those days!
