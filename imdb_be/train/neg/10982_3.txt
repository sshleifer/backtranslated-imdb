The film has good performances and good moments (although obviously a fairly low budget), but a poor rating because the basic premise to be poorly developed. The main point of conflict between two terminals is not played in a realistic manner whatsoever. There are a few scenes where they differ because of him, but there is no discussion of any great depth, which do not explain to how they can be together, seeing the world so differently, the more that employment Glen so wound up in this part of his life (Adam and active enough of it, that he supports it with the passage of time and money.) in addition, several times Glen portrayed negatively, the way it is (sorry Adam for his past) while Adam shows decent and "traditional", a film says to be "good" way in the end. I do not like being preached like. I attended a discussion session with the director after watching the LTR, and he said that he presented the conflict between them, because, if he was in Glenn footwear (and it is said that in reality belong to Glen opinion) that he I could never date someone with views of Adam. Well, then, I think he should have done a much better job of explaining how Glen could make it in the film. In addition, the director said that it is aimed at this, his first film, after reading (directing for Dummies.) Directing was not so bad, but far from top notch effort. I've seen worse, but I rarely go out movies the feeling that it's frustrating.
