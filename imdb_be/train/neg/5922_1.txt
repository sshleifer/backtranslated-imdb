My mother keeps a tape of the film as a common threat to any movie-loving person who irritates her. Everything about this stinks. <br /> <br /> So, it is a real classic. <br /> <br /> Who gave 10/10? Were you a chance to see a good movie and accidentally voted in favor of this? <br /> <br /> Everyone involved in the film creation process should be forced to look at least a small part of this film. This should be an indelible stain on the minds of all that keep the film saints and revered like a tidal assessment kinematic deplorable.
