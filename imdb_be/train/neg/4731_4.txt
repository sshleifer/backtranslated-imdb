Half-hearted attempt to bring Elvis Presley to the modern day, but despite the small shower sex scene and magazine story pseudo-Playboy, Presley is surrounded by the same old How wink clich√©. Woman chooses ER on the beach, and then proceeds to take over his life - and he does not seem to care! Dick Sargent is debilitating to another side panel, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) Try the two boss Elvis (he worked part time, you see). Some of the songs are very good, especially the "Almost in Love", but if you want to see a looser, Hipper, updated Elvis sex comedies - look elsewhere. If Elvis and his Fatal Attraction in bed together, there is actually a wooden board between them! Get real. ** from ****
