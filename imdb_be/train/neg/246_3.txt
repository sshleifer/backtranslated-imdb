This is clearly a futuristic adaptation of "The Mysterious Island" by Jules Verne. sound editing is very bad. You hear dialogue on the set, and you hear the voice recorded in the recording booth at the same time! This amateur film with actors from Boston and shot around New Hampshire. For those who live in New-Engalnd and who reads this comment will be beaten with a capital W. This film is full of flaws. You get to hear the director's voice command or give instructions to the actress. "Okay, now I get up." As for the other characters. There is this guy who talks to his mind, not his voice, and blue, to foreigners. A foreigner guy says with a deep voice. If he yawns or grunting when he fights you hear a voice actor. As for the special effects, man! It was at the beginning of Brett Piper to call out loud! These creatures are good, but the animation jerks. Really jerks. Like Karl Zeman animation on a journey to the top of the time (1955). The special effects of the imagination. Thge the music is good. Bottom line, this film does equinox or Dinosaur Planet looks like epic Harryhausen. Do you know the mysterious planet was a movie house and was on a shoe-string budget? A must see for first-time filmmakers.
