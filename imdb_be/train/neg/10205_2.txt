So I'm wondering, while watching the film and the producers of this film get to save money on your wardrobe, Sandra Bullock, tightening her "before" clothes from Miss Congeniality? Perhaps Ms. Bullock also get sleepwalking through the role, directing the "front" of Gracie Hart? As many observers have noted before, the film is very formulaic. Add to that the viewer is experiencing deja vu with the character as a cashier Maywether slightly darker Gracie Hart of the more backstory and quickly become a nap Festival. <br /> <br /> The two serial killers bad boy has been done before (and better) and other films. How is the "good guy partner is trying to protect his partner, despite the evidence" nature seen before. In fact, none of the characters in the film ever to go beyond the two dimensions or try to be anything but banal stereotypes <br /> <br /> One of the last corn. - using serial killer term is false advertising. Killing one person - even if it's premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer. You can have the potential to become a serial killer, but you're not a serial killer, or even a spree killer.
