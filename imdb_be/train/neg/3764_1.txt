This is by far the worst Bigfoot film I've ever seen, and it is possible, in general, the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Actors and actresses were terrible, and it seemed that they were trying too hard to play his role Dorks, tough guys, jerking, know that it Alls, etc. Both the Yeti was awful. It was found that some computer images from the days of Atari & Intellivision. At some point near the end of the film as sasquatches army were chasing after those that have survived, one gets shot, and how it works, it looked like a poor man's version of Donkey Kong! And one gets hit by bullets and blood that comes out of it was simply terrible animation. Another thing is that the music was annoying. Way way too much music (classical account or what you call it) during the whole movie. It never ends. Ah yes, the film is boring too. Absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. I highly recommend taking your $ 3 or something they take for rent the movie and spend it on a gallon of gas or menu value anywhere. Really terrible!
