I bought this film over the weekend at my local gallery Movie. It was a buy 2 get 2 free, and I need another one, so I chose this. Terrible mistake. Window reads like it would be a really good movie. Well, it starts, it will be a great film. Within about 5 minutes, that is. The film is about a young woman, Leila, who is killed trying to save her boyfriend, Jack, from a bull. Dad Laila in Cordobes, is the owner of the ranch that the citizens are afraid. He believes that Jack killed Leila because she allegedly was afraid of the bull, and goes on the hunt to find it. This is the first 5 minutes, it's good. What follows after that is only going to get 100 times worse. Whoever wrote the script, in my opinion, he should have been on to some kind of acid trip or something, because nothing else made no sense what so ever. Jack on the run and believed that this journey radio DJ named Mary, who gives him a ride. I think Mary should be a virgin Mary type character. You know, the mother of Jesus. But who knows, I could not make heads or tails of it. How they work ... we will see the bad guy, the magical vision, ghostly meeting, memories, etc. ... And all these things are done in a way that hurts your brain from trying to figure out what's going on. Needless to say, I took the film back and exchange it for something else. It's awful, I tell you that I got. And there is absolutely no bulls fighting in this film. Except for the first minute of the movie. I hope that I have helped some other people continue to waste your time on this movie.
