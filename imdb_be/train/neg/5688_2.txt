Short version: The seed is not necessary. It's just a derivative and worse. . And soulless <br /> <br /> The long version: If you have never seen any of the films containing the vaguely defined "psychological horror" genre, this film would probably melt the face. Maybe not, but it will give you a good burn. Opening montage of real cruelty to animals will be enough to open your eyes to the possibility of brutality-to-video, and (only) a memorable gore scene later in the film, it may be more than you can handle. The culmination will be playing with your emotions so that perhaps no other film has. <br /> <br /> But it if you do not have much experience with the genre. If you've seen the real thing ... "Repentance August Underground", for example, you, as I think it is very difficult to stay up until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer compared this video nasty old. I understand the comparison. As the video stuff, "Seed" is stronger than a horror movie mainstream and less subtle. But the reason the video nasty yet known to us not only for the above reasons - the ones that are still popular was something special. Allow me to be controversial, I think you will find that those who stuck around were the "soul" <br /> <br /> Take this quote from Gabriele Crisanti, director of "burial" in an interview to the next. -ish DVD: Â«... we will never have more movies like this, because today, technology has surpassed the imagination and technology of cold So many things will disappear, because the small films, they would not be issued more than we have today. .. big, exclusive techniques, which are very expensive, but they are cold. Today, the horror, the terror film of this kind is worth more than a million dollars. These films were not so expensive ... they are real effects, made with our own hands. "< br /> <br /> Maybe it's wrong to consider the comparison with the old-school horror so seriously. But Cr Zante hit the bull's eye. Even in its most seemingly performance, the best video nasty pursued primitive "truth". And this is where the Ball falls short. This is how it is seen in the movie and did not understand them. All of the list there ... BS about "making a statement about humanity," obscene torture scenes, etc. But it is Crisanti put it, "cold". gusset all the CGI. all this feels like pieces of scenes from other films of different genres. And ex sooooo slow. . Man, so slowly <br /> <br /> Another great. Note: one blood scene really reminded me of video game <br /> <br /> In any case, enough BS. Weak film.
