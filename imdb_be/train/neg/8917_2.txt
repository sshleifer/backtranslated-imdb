A prerequisite for the creation of such a film is a complete disregard for the work of Nietzche and persons psychoanalytic technique and the history of Vienna. Take a good knowledge of a genius you have not read, describes him as insane, includes the most insane doctor to cure him, a couple more pretty women, his role is played by an actor with a huge mustache, each character speaks with a strong accent, show absurd dreams, include another prestigious figure who had nothing to do with the first (Freud), to mention a few of the words used in the genius works overdo everything that can be, in particular, the music, and you're done. Listener, please stay away.
