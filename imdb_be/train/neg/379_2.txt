TV Guide calls the film a secret. What is a mystery to me how it is possible that the culture that can produce such complex and sophisticated classical music and brilliant mathematician can not produce a film that will rise above the level of despicable trash this movie is so good. This Bollywood at its best / worst case, I honestly can not tell the difference. Sickeningly sweet, kitschy clich√©s at every level, storyline, situations, dialogue, music and choreography. Simply put, you must be a retard to enjoy it. I watched it, to satisfy their cultural curiosity, but there were times when I had to get away from him, because I could not take it anymore. Only redeeming quality of the film is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses. <br /> <br />
