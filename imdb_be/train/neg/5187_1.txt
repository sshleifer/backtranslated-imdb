I will not approach and criticism RAW theories. I mean, this is a site about the movie and the movie or deliver or well done, not a poster discussing philosophy. <br /> <br /> Having said that, this video is really blowing. It says one shot to the head of RAW after another. Some of them are archived video, so you can see how he had aged over the years, and it's pretty cool. But, otherwise, the viewing experience is inexorably monotonous. <br /> <br /> This is a strange comparison, but I kept thinking about Sunday afternoon, when I saw some stars Barbra Streisand vehicle Funny Lady * * (another very bad movie). After a while, I was so OD'd on Barbra, I'm willing to be there one scene that she would not appear: You know, "Meanwhile, the other characters in the film were on something else ..." moment . But it was all about Barbra. Well, this video Kas * Funny Lady *. <br /> <br /> So if your idea of ​​a good time to look at a few takes and RAW face angles as he talks on his theories, collected in a lame structure that does not add any interest or understanding, then be my guest. I could not take it after 20 minutes for me.
