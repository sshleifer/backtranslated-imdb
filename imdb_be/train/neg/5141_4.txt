1914 was an amazing year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in the movie and he appeared in more than 30 films! While most of these films were not particularly good, they give him the opportunity to slowly evolve his screen persona. However, this film, the familiar "Little Tramp" character was still in the development stage. Of course, Charlie looked the part, but his character still lacked sweetness and decency, he later developed. Instead, Chaplin was often beaten, legs, or other nasty people, seemingly for no reason. <br /> <br /> As for this very small film, it is interesting to watch the throw. Despite the fact that they are not familiar with today, Chaplin star with Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain - all very popular stars of Keystone Films. The problem with this film that while it does have a few good scenes, the story seems very vague and properly developed. Chester and Mabel got to the race track (a very common theme in Keystone productions - it should be located close to the race track). Charlie Mack show and penetrate. Mack is pursued by the police during this time Charlie Chester pops around and steals his girl. In the end, for no apparent reason, the policemen take Chester Mack and away - leaving Charlie and Mabel (who, oddly enough, does not look like Charlie postponed boorish behavior) <br /> <br /> If you do not. a huge fan of silent comedy or film critic, is very forgettable film that is only relevant in the evolution of Chaplin. That he and the other actors are actually on the stage, and it is not unusual for the Keystone film, not particularly funny when seen today.
