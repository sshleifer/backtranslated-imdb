I just rented this movie because of the promise of William Defoe and Robert Rodriguez. I assumed that when he saw the name on the cover of RR (as an actor), this film will be good. It sounds like a movie that Rodriguez would have done so if he's going to lend his name to it, than it must be good right? Wrong wrong wrong. Until now, the worst editing as Â«Manos Hand of Fate". As it has been edited it does not make sense, and the film can not be made to stick, and after the first 30 minutes, you do not even want to try to follow him anymore. I have no idea how Defoe and Rodriguez was included in the film, maybe they do not have someone, but they are way to good for this. In addition, they were only in the movie for a few minutes apiece and Rodriguez is not even talking. So if you want to watch a movie with bad editing, bad acting and confusing storyline than be my guest, but do not say you were not warned.
