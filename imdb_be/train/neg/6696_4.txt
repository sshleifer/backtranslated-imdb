(There are spoilers) homicidal nymphomaniac prostitute Mia, Kari Wuhrer, takes on the life of the car and 18 virgins, despite the fact that he was too embarrassed to admit it, a collage freshmen Trent Colbert, Kristoffer Ryan. By the end of the film, not only Myia deflowers but gives a poor, innocent and naive Trento lesson in how to identify dangerous nut job and keep away him or her to keep from ending up turning into one. <br /> <br /> Hanging around trucker rest stop Mia picked up Roy, Burt Young, for some hot and heavy action on the back of his gods. Roy or too drunk or stupid to realize that Mia is not another, then his ex-daughter! Angered that Mia does not want to get him Roy almost strangling her to death only to be interrupted by the first student year collage Trent Colbert, who plows the field in the direction of mind to hold his finger one of the truckers. <br /> <br /> Seeing her chance Mia jumps in Trento car and removed two that is strange car chase ever put to film. Going across the Northeast United States two eventually dragged into a truck car smash up the murder and shooting with the patrol, which then leads to Trento parents home with them as hostages. It is there that there is another wild shootout between insane Mia with a whole SWAT team, reinforced by local police and state troopers. <br /> <br /> You would expect that a film like Â«Hit And Run", to be intentionally or unintentionally funny, but it is not. In fact, the film is very hinders as Mia treats everyone in the film that it comes into contact even with its distorted and the child-molesting father Roy. Trent led her around the Northeast Mia gets poor slob having drunk with him in a motel room, with bars of handcuffs and a burning candle. Mia also gets his own motel with horny Mr. Foster, tricking him to give her a gun as part of a strange sexual games. After the Foster up she removes Trento, which was cold in his motel room, wallet with some $ 400.00 until it does not bother to drive away with his car. <br /> <br /> Needing money to pay for gas to get back home to her parents for Thanksgiving Trent receives a call on his cell phone from Miya, to take her to a local diner to get their money back. Like a jerk, he selects Trent Mia, who is now a fugitive from the law, he then becomes involved with her father Roy on the open road, as he tries to escape Trent & Mia from the road. <br /> <br /> The chase ends in the desert to demolish the house, Roy chases Mia, running it on a dirt road in high heels in with him to get him in the you know where with a blast of his own gun. Roy was so busy trying to take his pants that he forgot that he had left the gun unattended. <br /> <br /> In both the robbery and murder, as well as hit and run, imposed them two thugs to stop off at S & M / tattoo boutiques where Trent gets his ears and nose pierced, and dressed in leather and chain of Myri, together with its corresponding and its dog collar. This is done in order to satisfy his puritanical and conservative parents Thanksgiving dinner. <br /> <br /> Having a running shootout with state troopers, one of them end up seriously injured, two fleeing from the law eventually Trento parents, Mr. and Mrs. Colbet, David Keith and Elaine Martin home with all local police with the Special Forces team, awaits them there. <br /> <br /> Bad movie with really disturbing final ending that made you wonder what the film is trying, if not to say that this audience. You feel sympathy for Mia at first, but as the film rolled down to its dark ending that evaporates as quickly as young ice tray in Death Valley. While Roy was the most unpleasant man in the film the first time the film ended Mia completely overshadowed it.
