After reading another review, I thought that this film will be really good. I really enjoy the «B» movies, but it can not even be classified as such. Photo probably only halfway decent thing in the film. But the editing leaves much to be desired. It was very choppy and jerky. Whoever I chose the music and the sound did a terrible job. The music was terrible, especially personal atmosphere or setting the scene. If the action were better, they could have pulled off the film. Unfortunately, I've seen better acting in porn movies. If you want to see «B» vampire movie, check "Bloodlines". You will be much more entertaining.
