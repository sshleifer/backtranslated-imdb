The ultimate goal of Big Brother, we know what to think, before we think that it has been implemented. Is this some kind of a miracle, or a sinister joke that people are not mental straight jacket of her own free will, to twist yourself in a distorted form, and grinning like monkeys? Movies, art is no longer the risk is unknown, but rejected the conclusion, drained of life. <br /> <br /> Â«The Notorious Bettie Page" is a bland history, suitable for feminism known college freshman. His lesson schematically, rectangular and linear, "Look, women objectified, exploited, abused, and then threw it into a pile of garbage, which is dominated by men of society." <br /> <br /> Betty Page was allegedly "Pin-Up Queen 1950," ass millions of men ejaculate in. (All reviewers repeat the phrase, "pin-up queens of the 1950 year," as the chorus of monkeys.) Its history as the American sex bomb familiar: South, abused by her father, raped, etc. In this film, she ' is naive, innocent do not know about the prurient interest, and it is shamelessly cashing in spite of the fact that she believes in Jesus, she loves to frolic naked in front of the camera lens -. only healthy girl neighborly sex slaves American men supposedly fantasize < br /> <br /> Out of the mouth of the writer-director Mary herself Harron., education about Sfard and former Punker (you smell the rot in conjunction privileges and "trendy" as I am?). "I feel that without feminism, I would not do that ... I do not feminist films in the sense that I do not anything ideological. But I think that women are better than my films. "what a cozy clique. <br /> <br /> The film is simply going through the motions of telling the story of human life, it is the object and purpose of being eulogized and buried long before the beginning of the film. Ms. Page has a boyfriend, but we have shown almost nothing about their relationship. In fact, there is no detailed or intimate relationships in the film. <br /> <br /> You can not ignore his smug ease. In New York, where Ms. Page tries her best to fit in a man's world, and reconciliation, allowing themselves to be bound in rope bondage and pulled together in black leather boots and a corsage with S & M, black and white film. But down to Miami, where she is going to get away from it all, happily takes off her clothes and take pictures of "liberated" woman, the film turns into a color. <br /> <br /> How the hell Harron doesn "t" to make a feminist film, "not" do anything ideological. "The ideology has become so learned, so it is assumed, so programmed that it is almost invisible. Big Brother has to smile.
