It would be watchable Hollywood mediocre, if it was a good editing. It is based on the typical American thriller story - "who is going to outsmart everyone." Duties below the average, but with a great view of a detective who is the best actor in the film, and it is primarily responsible, when the voltage in the film rises. The film was completely overwhelmed by a blank video and audio frames, and most of them look like film materials. In general, if you do not mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project, this is a movie to watch. I think that would be enough to say about this movie, everything else can really ruin a voltage which is probably quite low.
