Combo Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawa was previously with the likes of gold HERA Pheri and Hungama so I went to the movies (in the Indian multiplex) with great expectations, especially after a promo spot. Unfortunately, as HULCHUL in front of him, this film was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> As others have noted, the movie room, which was already stale to begin with, just to stretch and without any development or additional layers. After a while, you just want the movie to the end, so you can go home (when I watched it at home, it would be much easier to cut your losses). Performance Akshay Kumar in average at best, and John Abraham should not attempt to do comedy again. In the comedy aspects of the film as a whole was quite a week. I just remember giggling like two times during the film. Definitely not Gromov belly laughter that consumed me in the HERA Pheri, or even to a lesser extent, in Awara Paagal Deewana. Paresh Rawa had a few of his anticipated classic moments, but in general, because of its role and the nature of it were given a lot of room to grow, he did not make much of an impact in this movie. <br /> <br /> nehuy Dhupia, who makes only appearance in the film, it was interesting to look at while she was on the screen. And some of the songs, have fun. Especially the opening and closing songs and ADA Kiss Me Baby, respectively. Otherwise, you're better off just passing through on this film.
