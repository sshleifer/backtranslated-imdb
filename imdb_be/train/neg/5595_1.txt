Wow ... OK. Thus, after reading a small feud here, I decided to see the movie for yourself. This movie is terrible. I stopped watching. I highly recommend the cleaning cupboard instead of watching this film, you will be more scared of / entertained. <br /> <br /> This is a low budget with bad acting. <br /> <br /> Anyone who gives this film 10s is completely wrong, and should be taken into account. <br /> <br /> I'm in no way affiliated with any of the other reviewers. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this movie is not worth watching. <, Br /> <br /> very, very bad film.
