If Ben (Red Foxx) discovers that his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) disappeared with his brother, he is sent to his son Norman (Michael Warren), to unload his tale of woe - only to discover that Norman has a secret lover: feminized Garson (Dennis Dugan.) Needless to say, Ben does not take it well, and many complications are - (. Tammy Dobson), including attempts to Ben to get Norman over being gay, fixing him with a prostitute unfortunately, this movie sounds a lot more entertaining than the film itself. <br /> <br /> Originally written for the theater Ron Clark and Sam Bobrik, Norman ... This is for you? It was an absolute disaster on stage in New York. To give the play its, I actually saw it set in 1970, as the production of amateur theaters - and still no one would accuse him of being anything other than petty farce, the cast played so well and this revealed a dead image that it was quite amusing. Sorry cast of this film is not to do the same. <br /> <br /> It's awful movie runs. Red Foxx, one of the funniest comics of the 20th century, is about as funny here as yesterday's wash, Michael Warren (who later appeared on the television series HILL STREET BLUES much better effect) competes with Fox to see who can give the worst performance, and Pearl Bailey Sun far behind; In truth, only Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson and a cameo by Wayland Flowers have any spark - and, unfortunately, this is only in comparison with the rest of the cast <br /> <br /> This is not just a movie. poorly executed, it looks bad. According to the film legend, it was the first attempt at a large screen to be shot in videotape, which then flows into the celluloid for the project - and believe me, it shows. The film looks like a bad 1970s sitcom until the painted horizon is visible through the window of Norman and Garson apartment. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad that they become ridiculous, but NORMAN ... IS THAT YOU? not one of them. I can sum up my reaction to the film in a nutshell: to miss. Do not buy it, not rent it, do not touch it with a ten-foot pole. Just back away slowly, then run like hell. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, known GFT, Amazon Reviewer
