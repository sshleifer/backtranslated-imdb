This show is not reasonable. This is basically what it boils down to. "The original humor" that these authors are trying to pull together, to completely get rid of the bites from other worlds bush scrape only unfunny. In other comments, someone quotes a couple of funny lines. Standout for me was George H.W. Bush told the children that they should not watch television any except Fox News. Wow. I thought the scenes that I saw were bad. The fact that this line is the highest point for a series of moody. <br /> <br /> My problem with nonsense like this boring excuse for a political satire is that these people get a second season. I am a liberal Republican, and I know, Bush has not been a good president. We all do. But that is no reason to extinguish this very poopie waste of time. I put these authors on the same level as that of a genius "Meet the Spartans." Their formula, bite off as much already expired unfunny jokes as you can and toss in a worse original material to actually be able to give yourself writing credit. <br /> <br /> Again, just bad. Unfunny, and it just makes me more and more unhappy, that shit as it is updated, but the strange and original shows like Arrested Development preserved after 3 solid seasons. Please do not watch this shit, if you are not one of those green-blooded liberal hippies who think that any proposal with the words Bush and dumb comedy gold. <br /> <br /> Yes, Bush's voice sucks. All he does little to emulate a Texas accent, and exhale very hard at the end of his sentences. At least, South Park recognizes the voices are not true. If you want a funny political satire, watch Daily Show / Colbert. Or seek any political sketches on Robot Chicken, which is fun to watch, because the stop motion animation figurines are very well done. Look at George W. Bush, as the little Jedi on YouTube. invaluable
