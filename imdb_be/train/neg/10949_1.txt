I go to the movies to be entertained. There is absolutely nothing entertaining about this movie. From start to finish, NO respite from the gray, grinding reality of the life of this woman. This is one the tempo without changing the mood. I stayed until the end because I was convinced that everything should be better. They do not, and I do not think I was the only one, as evidenced by numerous groans ringing around the film as the film mercifully drew to a close. I honestly do not reflect the social depravity is not a crime, but it is boring your audience groans not the way to gain the sympathy of the public. Scary movie.
