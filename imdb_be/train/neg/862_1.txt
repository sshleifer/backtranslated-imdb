"Succubus," edited version «Necronomicon Geträumte Sunden», is to fight through the sitting, even in the lean 76 minutes; more of this awful boring and pretentious tripe Euro horror, and I could have got into a coma. <br /> <br /> Jess Franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of garbage 60s, which seems to have been made the cast and crew with their heads on the hallucinogen class, as not a single second of this disorder made no sense at all. Apparently, this is one of his best films 180+ ?? it is hard to believe that there are worse efforts there. <br /> <br /> incomprehensible plot has to do with the usual Franco themes of sex, violence and lesbianism, and throws in a little S & M for good measure, and yet he still manages to stay the mind numbingly tedious. <br /> <br /> I can leave it long ago, before entering the world of the bizarre Horror euro again ?? Life is too short to waste time watching the hold like this.
