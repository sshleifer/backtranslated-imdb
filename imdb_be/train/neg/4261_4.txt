Helpless. This is what happens when a director comes to work just because someone is paying him. <br /> <br /> intentions were good, great location and setting for a film of epic proportions. But the performance, damn it! I swear, some pictures you can see the extras on the background, looking at camera, or looking at the actor, because no one told them what they should do when they hear «Action!». The fight scenes are so bad, you're wondering - these people really? They could do more harm, just hugged each other. In slow-mo scenes you can see people on the battlefield walk or simply stand, waving their hands. <br /> <br /> Only the action in the foreground once emphasized. But for what? History is so illogical and intermittent seem random situation, in chronological order, and sometimes not even that. Dialogues stupid love story is more embarrassing and ridiculous than the militants Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> With a budget of 40 million, and you can see every dollar invested on the screen, in the best case, the end result of all these efforts is the huge round-brilliant laser disk in a thin cover is placed on the shelf in the store video.
