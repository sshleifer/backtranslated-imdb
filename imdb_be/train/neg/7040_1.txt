Just I bought a VHS to this film for two if I spend money bucks! Hey, I dig Adam "Batman" West and Tina Â«Giligan Island" Louise, but hello! This production is the third speed is paraphrasing a dozen other films cyclist; crazed bunch of loonies bikers ride in a provincial town, beat up everyone and everything, and then defeated in a person from the dashing hero. Adam West looks the part as a hero, but he lost his cloak, and his Batman uniform. Unfortunately, just not the same. Tina L. looks very nervous and frightened the whole show, but at least we know what happened with "Ginger" as soon as she was rescued from the island ... LOL! Bikers are a motley group, and well-known of them had ever acted again, or at least should not be. Hell Riders Hell watch!
