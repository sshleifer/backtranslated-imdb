My mother worked with Denis L. Raider for eleven years, not to mention shared an office with him. When it was announced that he was BTK, she was shocked. The whole day was just her story about how she'd never seen him like Wichita Killer. I heard her recite them many times. I asked her about many things, and went to all the interview that she was asked to go. I read the entire book written about the Raider, Wichita is my hometown, and I was surprised that such a thing could happen in Kansas. <br /> <br /> There was another film BTK on TV not so long ago, and I thought it would better reflect the murder of Dennis, maybe even have some smart touches to his motives. <br /> <br /> I will be very blunt with disabilities in this film. This is based on the figure of my mother from him, all my reading on it, and I saw the video, he said. <br /> <br /> First of all, the angles were terrible. It looked as though it was shot on a home camcorder. The acting was terrible and I could not even bear to watch it. <br /> <br /> Dennis Rader never had long hair. Dennis Rader was "very anal people" and was "follow the rules of the book" guy. He was not as good as the film made him look, he was very polite and sharp, like a business. The same goes for his murder, as we all know. If you've seen his confession in court, you can already guess. <br /> <br /> And the obsession for slaughter? No. I have never read or my Dennis Rader admitted that problems with the abuse of animals or people squish bugs. In fact, he practiced on cats and dogs for choking techniques. However, through out the entire film he put the animal in the face of his victims and act like he cared about the welfare of them. <br /> <br /> Dennis Rader never killed a man, he knew that he was admitted to it, but in the film in his first murder he says the lady that he knows it. <br /> <br /> I do not even want to go to this movie, and I have to talk. It's not what you want to see if you are interested in real events in BTK. It's not what you want to see if you want a good horror film. If you want bad shot halfway porn with some death scenes I served on the side, then this is your kind of movie.
