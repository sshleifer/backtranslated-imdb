I saw this film festival in Rotterdam, as well as presumably all other voters. Director attended and seemed to work very hard and are very committed to the project, which I think explain the above-average reception and label it received. This is the most similar to the feature-length episode of Aussie kids favorite "kooky", but it takes itself too seriously, to have even that extenuating. The film itself may be worth a look if you are trying to make a cinematic world tour to visit all the UN member states, since I can not think of another fizhiyskom movie, but overall it was an ordinary, badly acted (although gypsum fan) and mining slave mentality. The moral of this story, it seemed that the native islanders are trying to screw each other again, but as long as there is, in fact a decent white governor to intervene, all problems can be resolved (leaving the island).
