After seeing this film, I just did the first time on Turner Classic (which lists it as Â«Dangerous Woman"), can only multiply its appreciation for the 1941 Bogart-Astor version. Ricardo Cortez was to receive money from a smile. I hope that he remembered my dentist and his Brylcreem seller in his will; they made him an actor he was. Women are not so good, but no better than that. Well, Una Merkel, a little better. More interesting are the "original" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman, who competently put many individual tics, but almost nothing of changing atmospheric set their successors starring Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor something beyond the scope of significant run-down of his characters in the remake; Here, Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) can not. <br /> <br /> This film definitely does not stink; it lies there like a big piece of ham. Its main value today as a reminder of that great movies like 41 "Falcon" for a reason. On a scale of 1-to-10, I rate it at 4, mainly to operate the camera and supporting players.
