One day in the mid-1990s, I used to write for DOCTOR WHO fanzines and fandom all keep it breathes a new American production DOCTOR WHO TVM. As soon as it was announced that Doctor`s archenemy Master was going to play Eric Roberts all they scratched their heads and said, "Who is Eric Roberts." I have to show this before IMDB come online when all you need to enter the name on this site their resume, but one helpful soul wrote in the publication, I wrote to explain that Eric Roberts was best known for the role where he starred opposite F Murray Abraham, the film was named the sword and was about fencing schools. In fact, looking back Roberts is best known Pope of Greenwich Village and a runaway train, but that didn`t stop the man, putting the boot in both Roberts and the sword, and his mind was made up that the American master with its southern stretching had to go fiasco. Oddly enough, most of the fans were furious Roberts plays the master, but once they saw that DOCTOR WHO TVM so many fans (Myself among them) thought Roberts' performance was the best thing about the disappointing US manufacturing <br /> <br /> so I` m leaving, but BY balls was a movie I wanted to see just because it was the first time I`d heard the name of Eric Roberts, but I `t didn get a chance to see it up until this weekend, and I was pretty disappointed with it. I do not know anything about fencing (Everyone else on this page seem obliged to mention when they fence or not. I don`t fence), so I do not know how accurate it all, but as mentioned in the film feels somewhat anachronistic even if you've seen it on its release in 1991, hairstyles, it seems, a few years out of date with its mixed teenage actors do a little dance routine, which makes you wonder if it wouldn `worked much better if it was it`d Jerry Bruckheimer produced in the mid-1980s. It can be argued that this would mean the relationship between Max and Alexandra Villard Subom be offset from the center for most of the movie, but I am convinced, wasn`t about their love / hate relationship, and Abraham and Roberts gave significantly better performance before and after the BY SWORD
