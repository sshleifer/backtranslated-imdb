If this guy can make a movie, then I sure as hell can make one too <br /> <br /> In fact, if you hire me to do a movie for you, I promise to do the following :. <, Br /> <br /> 1) I will add more naked women. This film was not. I think horror movies cheesy B-Class only in rent because of their traditional female body operation. I would not want to let my audience down. <br /> <br /> 2) I will refrain from too many scenes where the character wakes up to find that it was just a dream. I think HorrorVision was about 4 of these scenes. And, given this film was like an hour, the ratio of the length of the dream to the movie was pretty high. And if I decide to make a dream sequence, I will make sure that the person wakes up naked. I mean, who sleeps in leather pants ?? <br /> <br /> 3) I will not break any movies like Star Wars or The Matrix, because I know that my budget is small, and I do not want to disguise my contempt for mnogobyuzhetnym Hollywood movies, adding satirical references about them in the mine. <br /> <br /> 4) And finally, I will not be confused with the modern technology of the undead. I mean, palm pilot can be just as scary ... at least, they turned it into an evil monster Roll-Poly, before the screen blew up or something. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for a higher quality of your next production horror, count on me: the director wants to b-movie extraordinaire.
