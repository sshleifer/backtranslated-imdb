I saw the movie today in a free screening of the preview, and despite the fact that I did not pay a dime to see this movie, I still felt ripped off. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money, and if you see this film you are leaving Benjamin in his place. Torpid act in the best case; Kiefer Sutherland phones in its worst incarnation of Jack Bauer and Michael Douglas looks like he realizes that he made a bad choice of leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones for a shoot that took the turkey. Eva Longoria is not a legal entity; she looks like she's reading her lines from a teleprompter. And if you can not find the "mole" within the first 20 minutes, then you just landed on this planet from the world without television and recycled storylines. If you really want to see a good secret service thriller, rent the line of fire. If you can see and buy it, you begin to fear for the safety of the President, because the Secret Service looks and acts like a grown up version of species from 90210. Regardless of your feelings about the W, let us hope that this "art" is not imitates life.
