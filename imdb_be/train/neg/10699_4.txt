Yes, I sat through it all, God knows why. <br /> <br /> It was a long day, I had nothing to do, it was very cold outside, well, all those lame excuses, but they are the only ones I have <br /> <br /> I gave Darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10. - I've seen worse movies, but this one is definitely right up there in the old dirty tricks filmdom bad - bad. the script is bad, bad lighting, and cheesy special effects <br /> <br /> storyline, which never completely does not make sense, revolves around this simple little family, father, mother, and little girl - I think the viewer should be "identification" with all three of them were boring and annoying. You just want a darker side to every one of them. <br /> <br /> Daddy is a cook whose hobby cars. Pope meets a rich man named Ruby, who collects cars and who also owns a creature, it has acquired in the "mysterious" East. Rubin holds it in a bird cage, and treat it as "Twilight." <br /> <br /> In the course of the film, Darkling explained as about 3 or 4 different things: a shadow without the person, the inner darkness that exists in all of us, and the devil. So take your pick, depending on whether one of these explanations suits your fancy - because, believe me, it does not matter <br /> <br /> The main problem darkling, it seems that she craves having a companion. - it gets a human companion - and then ultimately unhappy people. This, of course, leads to great wealth, following a natural disaster, for a person who intercepts from The Twilight <br /> <br /> And for all of us. - it just leads to a very long, tiring film. <br /> <br />
