It's so sad that the Romanian audience still filled with vulgar and uneducated people who relish this kind of cheap and index shows how superficial and brutal series «Garcea» or «Vacanta mare" kids games ... The difference lies in the fact that Mugur Mihäescu, Dora Octavian Dumitru and other such sub-craftsmen never taken to assert their shows as "art." Pintilie, who 40 years ago made a very good movie ( «Duminicä and op SASE"), and then another, quite well ( «Reconstituirea»), tries to declare his movie-length "work of art" - but unfortunately he gentleman on the way too limited to a specific level of cinematic means of expression. Thus, «Niki Ardelean» again offers a sample of "As there is no" - this time its only merit.
