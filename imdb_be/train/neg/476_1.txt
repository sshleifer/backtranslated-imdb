When converting the book into a movie, it's usually a good idea to keep at least some of the alleged author or move tons of concepts, rather than paying attention to the author as a whole. While it is clear that the director had access to the advice and went to the children Eleanor Stewart, it is key to note that the children believed that their mother to be a complete liar in respect of good, enriching, consolidating its experience Homesteading land book details her life on it and the surrounding hamlets of her husband in the vast Wyoming border; it chronicles the daily adventures with his many friends and acquaintances, although they lived tens of miles from each other. The film, however, takes a standard position for the time it was made, drawing the experience of this woman as a harsh, unforgiving, and almost senseless. Perhaps the director was leaving some of his experience in the Vietnam War with him in this film (as some moviegoers have already mentioned), but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and turning him into a gloomy , odious landscape devoid of friends and hope. Do not waste your time on this film; read a book instead.
