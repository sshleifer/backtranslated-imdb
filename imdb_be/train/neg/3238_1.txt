Devil's Experiment: 1/10: Hardcore porn films are divided into two categories, those with the plot similarity (Gee, that one lucky pizza), and those who do not (Anal amateurs 36). Devil experiment falls solidly into the latter category. <br /> <br /> Of course, this version of the horror hardcore porn. Almost entirely of land less than 43 minutes to wait for the money shot. Shot on video in 1985, it consists of three relatively nondescript Japanese boys tormenting a rather unattractive Japanese girl. Torture in the range from the banal (slapping her 50 times, pushing it a hundred), stupid (strapping it on an office chair and spinning it around), the fear factor (larvae bath and sheep intestines), and finally, the money shot, (A also configured eyeball piercing). <br /> <br /> So, no plot, no theme, just Blair Witch Boom tree and torture. She looks bored, and except for yelling, "nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition" during an office chair was a scene I'm bored silly. He stunned staring at the screen, waiting for the money shot. Just as hardcore porn.
