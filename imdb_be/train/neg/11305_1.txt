That's too bad western, largely because it is historically inaccurate. It looks as if it was shot on a movie set in California instead, where Jack Slade lived and died, Idaho, Colorado and Montana territories. It fictionalizes all that is known about this mysterious "bad man", "a good man". a horrible scenario; there is very little direction, and filthy action. Dorothy Malone completely wasted, as his wife. Mark Steven never knows how to reflect this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a very good stage line overseer. He was afraid of his local residents of the city for his drinking. When drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in Virginia City, Montana. In order to ensure that he could never terrorize them again, vigilantes lynched Slade Jack after he ignored their warnings to leave the city immediately. This is a terrible movie. I can not recommend anyone to watch this movie, but to see how Hollywood history butches at will, even to this day.
