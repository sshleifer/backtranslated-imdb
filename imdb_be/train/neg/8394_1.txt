"(After he is a man in the basement) <br /> <br /> (and take a listen to what they sing) <br /> <br /> - it is not that clear what the film shot in the era known to post-structuralism, in fact, that or simply a bad film. Brutal act, but some of the actors that I know, so they replay it? <br /> <br /> old house, carved, obviously, with modern housing, it is the murder site. A (bad) film made on the basis of history and repeating again.
