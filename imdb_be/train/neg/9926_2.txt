I just looked at the 30-year anniversary edition Blazing saddles, one of my favorites !! TV Pilot for Black Bart smelly. The plot was non-existent and acting was not good. This was obviously an attempt to profit from the success of Blazing saddles were television shows that have succeeded in this takeoffs great films, but this one has never worked. Given that for many years, television will not play even humming noises when they televised the film, it is inconceivable that they thought that they could put on a show on television with the word «N», thrown around. On the other hand, I liked to see a lot of familiar face !!! There were quite a few actors / actresses that I have learned from other shows over the years. I had to write down all the names and do a few searches. It was fun. I argued with my mother, when Steve Landsberg was Barney Miller or Mash. I won! :)
