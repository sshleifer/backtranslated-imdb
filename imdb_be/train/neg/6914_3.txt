I've seen this movie a while ago (while working on a trailer for the film's production company), and it was awful. Hewitt, at best, mediocre, Hopkins phones in his performance (but still blows Hewitt in their scenes together) and Alec looks bored. Believe me, you should avoid this movie like the plague, if it ever is released. It seems to go on forever, like a tired plot unfolds at a snail's pace. It relentlessly unfunny, cinematography and direction dirty pedestrians. Alec Baldwin to go to film school, where he plans to re-send. From the point of view of his actions, his character is totally unpleasant, making it impossible to eradicate it. Aykroyd's pretty funny and surprising the jury about the end of the film likeable, but this film is simply awful.
