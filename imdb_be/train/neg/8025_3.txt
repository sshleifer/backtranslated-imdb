So, even as a fan, as the survivor and the apprentice, this show is very bad. I did not mind the first couple of shows, but then I realized how pathetic it was to actually go to the show in the first place.The natives Alex and Aaron give people a bad name to the way they changed or dropped their choice as soon as possible on the It was not really a good look at the show. <br /> <br /> Ryan, you can have three hundred. She had the most annoying voice I have ever heard on television, and this idea has not been the smartest girl around (very savvy media, but I doubt that there is much more out there). <br /> <br /> I have not really watched any of the shows, after all, except occastional restart on daytime TV. I think that the point of the reality show, to treat it as "rubbish entertainment". Consider it as something you can laugh, and not too hard to think about (I do not watch CSi it as reality tired and formulaic, but you have to think too much in any case, during playback). <, Br /> <br /> couple of thoughts for some reason here we are going to the show. The very first "women tell all" A woman like Amy (who had a lot of class about it) commented that she tried every scene aka bars and the club scene to meet the guy, and it's not happening for her. Hey, hey, how about joining the club? get a hobby? to do charity? changing their job at one, where you will meet more guys? Gees, I know that going to a bar, is not the ideal place to meet your future partner. <br /> <br /> Amy and many other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of ​​the meeting of the "perfect man." Clue ladies: it does not exist. There are, however, many great guys out there that will make great men, some of which may be for you! they can not earn six figures a year, or be younger JFK alike, but they're great guys though. The superficiality of women on this show is absolutely incredible. Im still a boy, was to lead to believe that a woman is gradually increased due to their surface as they got older and more realistic about their future partner. This show is different. <br /> <br /> In general, this show does much to confirm many of the stereotypes about how men view a woman in society. It's really a terrible show, and I think that all of these kinds of shows just have to stop being made. Looking for the best shows are a country mile Blind Date and fifth wheels, because they are fun. Nothing is equipped with more than between "couples" than just a night. bachelor, unfortunately, takes itself too seriously.
