Disappointing musical version of Margaret Landon's "Anna and the King of Siam", he was shot in 1946 with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, was Deborah Kerr cast as a widowed teacher, and a mother who travels from England to Siam in 1862 to take a job as a teacher many of the children of the king - and perhaps teach a Royal thing or two in the process! Unnatural picture begins well, but quickly loses energy and focus. Yula Brynner, reprising his stage triumph as King is domineering presence, but used - for invented stories - like a clown. Kerr keeps her cool dignity and fares better, despite the vocal soundtrack Marni Nixon. May have already played this part before his death, Brynner looks as if it was a relic of the personal screen translation, besides of bombast. The second half, with Anna and moppets who arranged the music, "Uncle Tom's Cabin" version is quite funny, and Rodgers and Hammerstein songs mainly timber. Brynner won the Best Actor Oscar, but it is an evil Kerr, who holds the trinket above water. Long, heavy, and "old fashioned" in the worst sense of the word. ** from ****
