This is a bad film. Not one of the fun, too bad. This is a lousy bad. It was really painful to watch. Direction was horrible, with a lot of jumping around and the green and yellow colors used in the film makes the characters look Hilo. Knightley is not convincing as a tough chick at all, and I can not believe that Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke has signed on to this criminal waste of celluloid. The script was terrible, and the effect was like fingernails across a blackboard. If you have not seen it, do not. You're not missing anything and will spend only two hours out of your life watching this nonsense .I saw bad movies and even to use them for their mistakes. This alone is a waste of time.
