WARNING: The review contains minor spoilers <br /> <br /> There is a parallel universe, where Gone in 60 seconds, a dark, edgy, controversial independent film. Unfortunately, in this size ... Gone is the flashy, meaningless, testosterone-fueled moronfest starring Nicolas Cage. <br /> <br /> For the reasons, in fact it is not necessary to get in, he and a large number of close friends have four days to steal fifty-expensive cars, only one of which is having trouble. This team consists of a guy with a funny-shaped ears, which is rumored to be the new Superman; the guy that conduct electricity in X-Files; former professional football player and two tokens black men. <br /> <br /> They are the enemies of a cop, a rival car thieves and Bilborough on Cracker, his Manchester accent accordingly flattened and widened to American audiences, which are currently used for this kind of thing, because Daphne Fraser. There's also Angelina Jolie, who receives no character; save to be a receptacle for the sexual desires of men. She and Cage have to be old flames, that is surprising, since they never have anything approaching a normal conversation all the time too long 135M control film. <br /> <br /> In fact, the characteristic is so poor that every time someone has a "moment" of violin playing in the background to emphasize the "emotion". This is not a spoiler to reveal that Vinnie Jones (who restores his famous Paul Gasgoine «hand ball" maneuvers and quite alarmingly, when silent) receives only a single line; not because of his inability to speak is an integral part of the story, but because of his eloquent summing up the dubious morality of the film after the appearance of the silent all the way until the end is ridiculous. Allegedly. After he fights through it in his "not exactly acting but-it'll-up» London drawl, smiling Cage: "I always thought you were from Long Island." My ribs, as you can imagine, were well and truly tickled. <br /> <br /> In fact, humor is the most undeveloped aspect of tact comedy cop in two token black characters. It is to see the biggest aspect of the master of Hollywood; why is it that a black man can not appear in a major motion picture without being constantly aware of his skin tone and infinitely refer to it? The young man, who, like older, Jive Community for the whole period, says: "We black people do not like the cold ... we tropical people." He then goes on to express the desire to smoke a joint and watching the roots. Of course, he parodies the image of black people, but how ridiculous is that? His senior colleague can not speak without resorting to itself, and therefore its color, in the third person. "My black ass" this "my black ass" that. Does anyone know some black people who actually speak like that? I thought, <br /> <br /> The film's soundtrack is played almost non-stop and with an increase in the amount of some of the tracks -. Especially Apollo 440 "No Stop The Rock» - so loudly that they are actually more audible than the sound effects and dialogue surround sound system even separates the two to such an extent that it makes them sound like two different films. that work together. Background music concept here is not the aural equivalent of trying to watch a movie while someone in the back of the film turned out to be their stereo at full speed. "Keep the music down, young man!» <br /> <br /> this is not the worst movie in the world and in many ways I liked it. it's just that it is predicted but lazy and stupid, with a minimum of effort in its construction. Apparently Cash expectations significantly down for this film. After being fed junk for several years, it is the general public begins to wake up to the fact.
