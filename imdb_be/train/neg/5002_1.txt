As such a horrible scenario could involve the shade? Funny, predictable and incredibly carefully, it is well acted and slickly directed, but the material is so bad that it still qualifies as one of the all-time worst thrillers I've seen in recent years. Surprisingly bad, and not in a fun way. Avoid at all costs, even if you're a fan of someone in the cast.
