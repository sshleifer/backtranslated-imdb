Thoughtless, ignorant, ill-conceived, career-killing (where talented Angela Jones now?), Deeply unfunny trash. This is not surprising, Reb Braddock Sun sent anything else from - who have the chance to make his first film on their own rules based on his own script, with the help of Quentin Tarantino, and create something like that, anyone who feels like it was a story worth telling the world, does not deserve the second break. Under these conditions, good performance - actors do what they are told to do, and they do it well. It's just that they did not have to do it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 0 4.
