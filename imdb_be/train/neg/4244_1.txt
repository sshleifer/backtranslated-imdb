Contrary to my principles, let me first come up with a conclusion, because I just saw this piece of "art", and is still under the strong impressions. The reader will excuse my strong vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is absolutely horrible and I would never have bothered to write a single word about it, if not for the fact that "44 minutes" I'm sick, that rarely happens to me. The fact I paid for it does not exactly make me feel better, and the fact that the film has earned praised by users here <br /> <br /> So what happened to the film, he has a trendy name -.? "44 minutes" . One of the first is thinking about "15 minutes," which, incidentally, is much better than the movie, but still bad in my book, and in fact, the two can be compared to how some th degree. But, unfortunately, what they share is their worst characteristics. They both have Mr. Oleg Taktarov, who with his thick Russian accent, clearly meets popular expectations and prejudices. His goal is to refer to the form of the cold war. Ah, we miss the good old days. Now, I do not mean that he is a bad actor, I have yet to judge its true performance, but it just is not true individual is here, it is more similar to the archetype. How can you even do such things quite beyond my comprehension. We can recognize contemporary American xenophobia here. The point in the film when Taktarov explains his companion that Romanians are not Germans, and that they are in America, really funny. Are we to assume that the greatest desire of the helpless duo to become a "real" Americans? <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a question of the media. Yes, it seems that much of what we learn comes from the cameras and reporters interview. The director should make us feel the rhythm of the estimated 44 minutes. Instead, it bothers us interviews throughout the film as a cheap television show, trying to reinvent the wheel. Within 15 minutes of the release media is a central point one.The presented in such a way, the teacher turns dull pupil, but deserves a separate comment, we focus on the 44 minutes currently. Thus, I tried to determine the purpose of the film. What is it? In order to ensure a good time for the audience? To glorify the gun? To glorify the police? Showing the violence? Ah yes, the officer gives the Bible juvenile offenders. Thus, it should promote peace and mutual understanding in the end? I do not think so, but do not ask me. I only know that I did not enjoy it all. <br /> <br /> Oh, Michael Madsen. I admit that I am a big fan. I was hoping that he would be a bright point, but I was wrong. It's not his fault, though. <br /> <br /> As a final note, comparing the "firepower" to "will power" at the end of the film was one of the worst line I've ever heard. <br /> <br /> So, on a scale of 1-10, I give him a pure, unadulterated 1.
