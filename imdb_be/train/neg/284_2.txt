I just today, picked it up at 99 Cents Only store today, and I still think I was ripped off. "Dream Believe" it is quite boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and $ 1 is just too Freakin 'dearly for it. This film probably differs only 2 things: 1. It has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. This director Paul Lynch, the man who also made Promo Night. Now the movie. <br /> <br /> This is about a girl named Robin (played by Olivia D'Abo), which was severely damaged by a car accident, which also cost the life of his father. So that an accident does not allow it to compete in gymnastics tournaments, she is often teased during her studies and eventually she meets a wild child named Tommy (played by Keanu.) Robin, if not in training, working part-time, along with his mother and half-sister, in a laundry owned by her abusive stepfather. In the end, she chose to compete. <br /> <br /> In general, alone Keanu and some catchy melodies 80th is something that prevents me from giving it 1 star, and it is also not one of the worst movies ever, but still far from good . DVD itself does not receive any medals, or as it is, seems to be derived from an old VHS and until the end, the sound goes out of sync, and when the end credits is almost over, it gets dark, even if the sound can still be heard. So it's likely to be transmitted as bootlegs. DVD work or does not make sense, as it has what appears to be the latest photos Keanu and Olivia and background has nothing to do with the film, as it is also in the film, so the cover is obviously Photoshop. In any case, avoid at all costs if you do not fanatic Keanu. I probably will not hang onto it longer. I'm probably going to give him a movie snob, a great critic YT way. Hey, if anyone of you have some bad movies that they no longer want in their field of view, do not hesitate to sacrifice him to keep him running the show.
