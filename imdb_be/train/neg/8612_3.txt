It was watchable movie, but the plot was a bit weak, and most of the jokes from some of the earliest films Rodney. With that said, it's worth the time to look. I gave it 5 out of 10. So, basically, it's one of those movies that you do not go out of your way to see, but if you find it on the tube, take a chance.
