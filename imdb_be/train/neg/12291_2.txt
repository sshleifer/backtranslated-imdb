Hamm, Italian film starred David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I was not expecting much, to be honest, in fact, I took much less than I expected. It does not mean this is the worst movie I've seen, because I watched worse things than this, but the plot was much of the time confusing and boring, and some good scenes Gore only save it. Besides the fact that you're going to love some of the special effects are really bad and bad. Now I just want to see Â«Troll 3" by the same director, that he will not be worse than this.
