This is really a new low in the field of entertainment. Despite the fact that there are many worse movies. <br /> <br /> The Gangster / Drug genre scenes difficult to have a compelling story line (this is not a movie, I mean Sebastians motives, for example, may not be more far-fetched and worn cliche.) Then you will also need to establish relationships of characters that believable (this film does not do.) <br /> <br /> Sure Tristan distracted from his family, but why do it again? what's the matter with his father again, he has to ask for permission to go to his age? interesting picture, although there was no need to ask, and the rebellious behavior of children in the upper-class family. But this film does not go in this direction. Despite the fact that there is a potential, judging by the occasional reverse overshoot flames. Was he not already down, and why he does it again? <br /> <br /> So, there are some interesting questions that are grown here solid social drama critic (but then again, this film is simply not the case, due to focus on the "cool" production methods and special effects preventing reflection characters and most of all making history along the way, where they want it to be and not to pay attention to the breath of the story and develop naturally.) <br /> <br /> he wants to be a drama did not honor and substance abuse violence (it would be politically incorrect these days, is not it?), but on the other hand, there nicho and cheaper militants (as there is so much out there) with an average set of actors and Vinnie Jones, who manages not to completely destroy what was left of his reputation, doing what he always does. <br /> <br /> So all in all .. I just ... can not recommend it. <, Br /> <br /> Winnie and 1 2 for editing.
