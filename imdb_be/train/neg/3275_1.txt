Do not watch this movie if you love classics such as Tom Uopat, John Schneider, Catherine BACH, Sorrell Buka, James Best, Denver Pyle, Shonen Schreuer, and Ben Jones! This film DISSAPPOINT YOU DO NOT! First of all, this film begins with Bo and Luke running moonshine for Jesse. After all, Luke would not do anything to the real series! This film reflects the unimaginable characters do things that would never have happened in the series. In the series, Jesse's uncle was an honest and law-abiding. In this film, he is a criminal who makes moonshine and marijuana smoking with Georgia Governor. In addition, there was an extension, adding to the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion! and the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have one question: How could Uncle JESSE make moonshine IF he died before Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood film? And the boss HOGG ALIVE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE REUNION MOVIE In 1997! FILM AND ROSCO RAN Hazzard? It seems that MAGICAL these signs come to life when they are DEAD FOR 11 and 8 years old? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good film, they had to return, James Best, John Schneider, Tom Uopat, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach, as they did in 1997 and 2000, and made for a family film with live original characters that have made It shows that it was and still compares with this disgusting, disgraced movie! If you want to see good movies dukes, or to buy the original series, or go to walmart.com and buy 2 DVD set that includes Reunion, and the Duke of Hazzard in Hollywood films! They both star the original cast, as well as for a family holiday! Do not waste your time on a movie that is not worth it written on the CD!
