I go to UCSB and take some classes with executive producer Allison Anders. She's a great teacher and director, so anything she put her name, I thought it must be very good. This film, as an option at the festival in Santa Barbara, the film seemed a good choice. <br /> <br /> While the film contains some interesting shots and cinematography, the lack of history and consistency really took away from it all so he's trying to achieve. My main problem was that it was someone's first movie, and you could obviously tell. Bad effects and even worse, the script stopped the film to get off the ground. The soundtrack has some nice music, which gave a sense of the main characters struggle to cope with the grief that would lead to his care, and now returns to the place where he grew up. I must say that, despite some of the best craft of the film is the lack of history and performance really prevent him from being any good.
