This is a story about three women is a very sensitive study about: Muriel (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans), which is about 37 and Martha (Frieda Pittors) is the oldest, who is the mother of Muriel. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations of life. Vital Laura wants a child. Muriel comes from the village, and wants to change his life in Brussels. March is dreaming of her youth, when she was a little girl. In fact, nothing happens in this film, so you wait for something - except in case of an accident - that could dramatize the story. Just go on, you will find that the director Doroth√©e Van Den Berg just wants to develop a psychological portrait of three women, and nothing else. This film is disappointing, because you are waiting for women to learn from experience, which is not the case, so one is left with a feeling of emptiness.
