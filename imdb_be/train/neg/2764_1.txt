Firstly, I have no idea how this film made it onto the big screen. He was not even a low budget SCI-Fi Channel movie, it's just awful. Me and my friend, who loves Adventure, Independence Day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. We went to see this movie, which expects this film I transformers with dragons, mindless entertainment. All we got was a meaningless one and a half hours. CG was not as bad as I expected, but the plot is so bad along with the current, he had done for her. His legs mostly Chinese dragons are returning every 500 years ... Sounds like a good remake of the rain of fire? No, the story is trying to be deeper than it should not be left only to the opening of the plot, but with the help of magic, and a very small actual war between the dragons (large sum of snakes) it just gets ridiculous. The director tried to add a bit of humor in the film, which is fail. My friend and I laughed through the whole thing (with all 5 the audience), and cant believe that we spent the money. Short trailer on TV is a big part of the action, while the rest is crap. I've seen a lot of movies, as B reptilian, The Cave, Spider, and others, but I have to say that if you do not want to stop laughing for an hour to watch it <br /> <br /> The history :. 1/10 CG: 5/10 Acting: 3/10 <br /> <br /> I do not drink ... but it would have helped, before watching this film
