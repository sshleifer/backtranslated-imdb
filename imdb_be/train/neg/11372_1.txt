I use IMDb for many years, and I never wanted to get involved in the film comments ?? until now. This documentary has so many problems that I did not know what to say. I am not a Muslim, and I do not study Islamic studies, but I know enough to shed some light on the apparent one-sided point of view, this film professes. <br /> <br /> The problems associated with this film starts with the fact that it is a documentary. Most of the documentaries that I saw the anchor itself around a few of these points and then surround these points with the discussion and interpretation of misinformation. This is certainly the case with Islam: What the West needs to know. Yes, there are fundamentalists in the world, and some of them are Muslims, but to build a documentary about Islam all around the small percentage of people radicalized incredibly misleading. It really is a documentary about the aspects of fundamentalist Islam, and nothing else. <br /> <br /> For those who would like more objectively examine some of the issues raised in this documentary, there are a few things that can help. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about Islam presented in the documentary. <br /> <br /> The documentary focuses on the Middle East, but more Muslims live outside the region. More Muslims live in China, believe it or not, than in Saudi Arabia. About 40% of Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> Translation of the Quran used in the film is a doubtful one. I was watching a documentary while watching another translation differences were incredible. I had been warned about the translation, which was used in the movie, and now I know why. Surrah 98: 6 is a good example. The documentary shows that Surrah says that unbelievers will go to hell. But the translation I read instead:. "Those who deny the truth among the People of the Book and among the polytheists will be in hell," The difference is that those who deny the truth are the people who know about God and the truth of God and decided to abandon it anyway. <br /> <br /> In the film, said that there is no morality inherent in Islam, but it is not. While it is true that much is from the Koran and Hadith, Islam also recognizes the concept called "Urf, or" normative behavior. "Clearly, the normative can be interpreted in different ways, but" Urf is meant to be a "good" behavior, that the average person will be considered right or wrong. <br /> <br /> The documentary is Shar'ia (Islamic law) as one single body of knowledge that all Muslims follow. This is simply not true. There are many schools of Islamic law, and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret the law. <br /> <br /> Hadith traditions alike. There are thousands of hadiths, and each school receives some rights and not accept others. Using the Hadith without serious science to determine which ones are accurate, realistic and applicable without distinction, choosing quotes from history that match what you want to say ?? which is what made the documentary. <br /> <br /> What I hope people understand that fundamentalism is a problem, not Islam or any other religion. Christian fundamentalists who shoot abortion doctors in the clinics and so on. I know that this is not the same as suicide, just understand that the righteousness of fundamentalism, might have a problem. If you feel you have the answer, everything else must be wrong. But if you feel you have the answer, you can work together with other people's thoughts about politics, religion, God, or whatever.
