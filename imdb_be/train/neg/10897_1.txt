It was probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my life !! It was stupid, had no plot and special affects were funny !! And I have never seen such bad acting in my life! The only good part of the movie was all hot guys (especially Drew Fuller). I do not know what these people are thinking when they made this movie !! I do not even want to finish it all because you get to this point in the movie where all the guys in bed touching herself. I mean, it was like some sick and twisted kiddie porn! I would advise anyone who has heard about this movie and was interested in the fact that it's easy to forget about it and find another movie to watch! I was very disappointed !! The whole movie was a waste of time in my opinion.
