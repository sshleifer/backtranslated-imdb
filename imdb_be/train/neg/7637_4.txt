This could be a very good film, if I was able to watch. Handheld camera was very cheerful. With the opening credits, I was worried. Some of us watching it was very dreary to the end. But we do not stay until the end because it was such a charming and interesting film, which gives a glimpse of the young pop culture in South Africa. Black-and-white film did improve insidious sense of this. Actions seemed very genuine. Some of the dialogue was a bit difficult to understand, but the theater did a full-South Africans seemed to find most of them are funny. If you are swayed at all, though, you may want to seriously consider skipping this film. It's bizarre, but not worth the nausea.
