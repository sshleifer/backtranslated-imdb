Jungle Fever too stylized, stereotypical and comes essentially dishonest. Wesley Snipes was wrong to lead, and there was no chemistry between them and Annabella Sciorra. Despite the fact that there is a lot of talent in this film, it's mostly wasted because of the reduced to little more than decorative cameos. In addition, instead of just showing racism by ugly and stupid things, it is, Spike Lee wants to wave it around like a flag in the most nagging and irritable manner. I made it through most of the film, but I could not finish it, and that to me is rarely.
