I first saw this film when I was about 10 years old. My mom bought it at a local Kmart, because it was on sale for $ 5 on VHS. She thought it would be a good Christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch. This film, however, frightened the hell out of me. You may ask yourself, how would a film about Santa Claus to scare someone? The film revolves around Satan's sending one of his henchmen, Pitch, on the ground in an attempt to kill Santa and ruin Christmas. That's right, Satan sent a demon from hell to kill Santa Claus. Pitch creeps Sant for Christmas Eve in an effort to lure him into a trap on the ground when the sun rises on Christmas Day, because if Santa does not make it back to his home in space, it turns into a powder. Do not get me wrong, the film is funny and pretty interesting, however, is the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell (which occurs at the beginning of the film) only very terrible.
