I first saw it when he was selected as a proposal from my TiVo system. I like Danny Elfman and thought it might be interesting. Besides, I'm a fan of the work of Max Fleischer, and it began with the appearance and its 30th animated film of the year. In both of them, I thought it would keep my interest. I was wrong. Just a few minutes, and I was a fast-forward button down. I ran through it for about 15 minutes, and I thought it was. <br /> <br /> After that I read some of the other reviews here and thought that I did not give it enough chances. I wrote it down again and watched it till the end. There's 75 minutes of my life I do not get back. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that no more bad reviews. Personally, I think it's because it's hard to get to comment a minimum of 10 lines. How many ways are there to say that it is a waste of time? <br /> <br /> In the film it comes across as if it was done a few junior high kids ready for indignation in the world and think that they can with the breast, profanity and sick jokes. flat characters. Parody «Swinging alphabet" lame, in fact, pavers tunes, getting through the A - E, hitting an explicit profanity «F», and then, not having the slightest idea where to go. A trip through the intestines before the expected landing does not work the first time, not to mention the following. <br /> <br /> Across the board, the entire movie would be expected from someone trying to "from South Park" Stone and Parker, unable to determine that is not funny. It might be fun if you're high. Otherwise, it is not.
