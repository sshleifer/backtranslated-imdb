There's just not enough here. There are a few fun spots, but not quite enough. I was very disappointed, because I like stupid movies. I expected that this hidden gem. It was not. It was hidden turd. <br /> <br /> All this time I watched it, I thought, "Damn, I could do better than this, and I'm a moron." Do not believe some good reviews. I was deceived by them. In no sense did I laugh loudly. Maybe it was funny, or cutting edge in 1987, but the person he fell today. This film had promise, it just does not deliver on it. Maybe if they rewrote it several times. I can not blame the actor. They were not the best, but they just did not have much with which to work. This film is not a success because of the shabby letter. Bitter disappointment.
