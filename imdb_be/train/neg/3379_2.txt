I recently bought a DVD, having forgotten how much I hated the film adaptation of «A Chorus Line». Every change made to the director Attenborough history failed. <br /> <br /> Doing relations director cashier so visible, the entire ensemble music-premise sails out the window. <br /> <br /> Some of the musical numbers, accelerated and rolled. You display the song gets the whole point is destroyed, if it is given to the character. <br /> <br /> Cassie general formulation is very shy. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give it a 2, this is because some of the large numbers, are still able to enjoy, in spite of the film sample to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it.
