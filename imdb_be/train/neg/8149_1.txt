What an absolute pile of pants. After reading a book by Chris Brookmyre religiously since I stumbled upon the "ugly ..." I was glad to know that this drama has been ordered. <br /> <br /> I was obviously too much faith. <br /> <br /> Nesbitt is probably the best thing in the show - and even he does not quite fit. How anyone can read a book, and then adapt it to this part of the scale for me. <br /> <br /> As long as the characters are changed, the situation is discarded, and to see the dramatic break-in Parlablane declined to make a quick Nesbitt chin up and sliding bay window open ... it brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> One shudders to think what will happen to the "Land of the Blind", if this is a test ... <br /> <br /> Please, just avoid ...
