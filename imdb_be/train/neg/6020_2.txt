I like the end-of-days movie. I like B-movies. I had hoped that I would like this film. <br /> <br /> I could ignore the bad effects, often brutal music induces a crawl line. I could ignore the inexplicable events, as well as the fact that the film is constantly relies on Deus Ex Machina is forgivable, given the subject. I could ignore the fact that people who struggle with hunger and try to achieve peace in the world are the bad guys. None of these things do not kill the movie. What kills this film is that it is purely and simply boring. Nothing really happens; almost all the scenes in the film is designed to push the moral creators of the movie the audience at the cost of actually having a complete history, or some unknown. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an entertaining B-movie, look elsewhere. This film is just boring.
