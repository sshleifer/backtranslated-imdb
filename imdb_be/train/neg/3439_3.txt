***** probably minor spoilers ****** <br /> <br /> I can not say I loved it, but I can not say that I did not ... it is very strange. He has bad things in it, like a shark that came out of nowhere with the worst CGI you can imagine, if I were a director, I have to cut this part probably gave me the desire to stop seeing the rest of the film. .. for some people it will be boring because there is not enough action, feels improvised sometimes ... take, for example, a scene that one of his friends died, and the next thing they do that? The NOP, do not cry ... their eloquent horror stories to each other .. * sighs * (only after crying HPP lost) <br /> <br /> Another stupid thing, when they said they were in the boat as "hundreds "candles in the table in front of them ... the boat is surrounded by some kind of cloth curtains (old rags on the windows) and sofas / couches ... I thought it was stupid, using candles, but do not think about the environment, in addition that only in the open sea ... <br /> <br /> well, some scary scenes are well done, I liked some. Sometimes the horror works best when it is hidden when its for something from Amesti of the show, so this movie is doing so well, perhaps because of his low budget, I do not know, but it works great for me! You will feel the tension, if you forget some hole like the ones I mentioned above . <br /> <br /> Do not expect a lot! but if you like to watch this movie anykind, be patient, trying to enjoy .. lol <br /> <br /> (sorry about my English cheese) =) < br /> <br /> Privetstviyaha
