Many people see it as a classic, but I obviously must have missed something. Life in Anarene, Texas, in the early 50-ies rather boring - it means that a film about life in Anarene, Texas, in the early 50s is pretty boring too! What is it that so many people see it? After the last picture show in Anarene closes there really is not anything to do in the city. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes this point at the end of the film. But even before the close there is not much to do, so basically everything revolves around sex. High school students that plan on how to lose your virginity - sometimes with each other, and sometimes even with some of the same sad adults in the city. You see, there is not much for them to do anything - except for sex (sometimes together and sometimes drilled with teenagers), or whine about the local high school football team. Three times something happened that I thought was going to add a spark of drama in the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) suddenly dies, but nothing happens because, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) to escape, but nothing happens because Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) not kidnaps a little girl, but nothing is actually happening because of this. The only thing added nothing dramatic value to the film came at the end with the death of Billy (Sam Nizami), which actually refers to the emptiness of life in this miserable little town, people are standing around, looking at the body to discuss where to go for breakfast . <br /> <br /> Peter Bogdanovich filmed it in black and white, which is, I believe, to show how this gray city, but the only thing I found interesting was an early look at the actors, as the Bottoms, Shepherd, and Bridges Randy Quaid. (By the way it was frightening to see how many Quaid - in 1971 -. Actually looks like his character Cousin Eddie in the film to relax National Lampoon) Classic? I do not think so! 3/10
