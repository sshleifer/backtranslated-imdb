This is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sitting around drinking beer, eating pizza and laughing. Unfortunately for me, I found that playing this one. My friends and I rented a large block of films and never bother to see it. He had to go back, and I realized that it was a waste to watch it entirely. So I did, and I was struck by how completely awful this film. <br /> <br /> At the moment, I like bad movies quite a bit, and I probably would have liked it as a "hero" was not so utterly disgusting. The whole movie I was hoping that he would put that stupid sword down and let someone kill him! He does very little heroic things in the movie. He's a tough, disgusting, stupid. It has less to buy quality than the villains do. And what was with all the naked chicks I mean, I love naked chick as much as the next guy, but this film went a little overboard in this department. <br /> <br /> Well, in any case, if you like bad movies and can be disgusting, "Hero", then I am sure you will like this movie schlock.
