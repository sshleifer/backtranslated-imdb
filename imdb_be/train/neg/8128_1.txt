Well, do not let my summary fool you. This movie sucks hard. But the worst movie ever? This movie was terrible the way people do not have to rack their brains to describe. But this is in no way worse than Manos: the hands of fate, hobgobblins, the horrors of the spider of the island, or a small handful of films. The review draws the film, it's terrible. He does not see it with the MST, or may be a health problem. But there are worse movies.
