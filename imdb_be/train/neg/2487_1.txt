Take the "Rambo" mix in some «Miami Vice» Cut the budget about 80%, and you have something that some ten-year-old boys could come up with, if they have a sufficiently large rear yard and too much access to the "Penthouse". Cops and ex-commando McBain (Busey, and with a name like McBain, do you know that he, as rough as they come) is hired to get an American supertank, which was stolen and hidden in Mexico. Captured with the tank was hardbitten Sgt. Major O'Rourke (Jones) and former love McBain in Devon (Fluegel), an officer in the team and now meat for depraved terrorists / spyware / drug peddlers who do not have any sense of decency, blah, blah, blah. For militants with depraved sex, there is a lack of action and not a lot of sex. Joke that McBain gets shot and survives constantly, keeping a bullet as a souvenir. Apparently, the authors have not seen "The Magnificent Seven" ( "People for us is the one who gave him that face"), and did not think to give McBain even the pretense of intelligence. Even for budget action movie, the production values ​​are poor, with long-range shots during a dialogue and very little movement. The main support, tank, stupid enough to manufacture Ed Wood. Fluegel, who could blond Julia Roberts (she was much more active role in "The History of Crime" than Julia!) I have to go from simpering to scared to try, pushing back and forth to the notice for a moment. Jones, who was in a strange variety of films, a lot of the bottom of hits here. he and Busey, probably only for easy money and a couple of laughs. Look for a talented, being an actor character Danny Trejo ( «Heat», «Once in Mexico") in stereotypically menacing bit part . Too bored even for schadenfreude, "bulletproof" is still quite noisy to play when you leave your home, but you want people to think there's someone at home.
