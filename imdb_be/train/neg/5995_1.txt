It really is a terrible film. What they have done is taken a TV show that has never been directed at young children and gave him treatment for George Lucas (ie destroyed his kiddifying its appeal to a younger audience). <br /> <br /> Ok so Thunderbirds TV show was not exactly the most cerebral show, in fact, it was pretty formulaic, but it was always nice to look at (especially if the model exploded), and the voice cast is not too bad. <br /> <br /> It suffers from poor casting and bad acting (with the notable exceptions Sophia Myles Lady Penelope and Ron Cook as Parker, who seem to be the only actor to have a clue about how their characters should be played) & after this travesty, I would not let Frakes direct traffic. <br /> <br /> just Thunderbirds sense that it was about the whole Tracy family and how they work as a team, disaster prevention or to help those who are involved in disasters. <br /> <br /> To avoid this waste, like the plague. <br /> <br /> I just give it a 1 out of 10, because a zero rating not supported.
