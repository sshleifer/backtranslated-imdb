This Anglo-Spanish co-production is one of the many films made in Spain as a result of unexpected phenomenal success enjoyed by the Italian "spaghetti" westerns, and, as is typical for such genre effort, features an eclectic range of existing and new international stars: Robert show Savalas, Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Fernando Rey, Michael Craig, Al Lettieri, Dudley Sutton, Antonio Maya, etc. Strangely enough, however, this incoherent mess of a film is a shining example of why that most American genre films have become a dying breed in the 1970s and is now almost (or that official?) disappeared. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, not only because the West is one of my favorite types of movies, but also because he had all the qualities, including an intriguing, to be a good one - not to mention the fact that my father bought a paperback edition of a town called novelization bastard after its initial relative ease! As it is, the only merit of the film (of course, if it can even be called that) is its apparent eccentricity: for example, Stevens, plays the widow of revenge on the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband sleeps in a coffin carried in a wheelchair (!) its stupid footman () Sutton; Savalas, as a bloodthirsty renegade, which at first glance it seems that the main villain of the film, was unceremoniously sent his own protege Lettieri very early in the picture; villain part, then, is Landau, who, in the very first scene of the film, apparently robbing alongside our legendary hero, who became a priest Show!; Fernando Rey plays a blind man, the only one who can identify the rebel Shaw, who, in the end, it turns out, was just a cover for ... well, figs! As you can see, the plot is very confusing, and it gets stranger from there! The production team is responsible for this film and other western fare about the same period of time as Custer of the West (1967), BAD MAN'S RIVER (1971), captain of the APACHE (1971) and Pancho Villa (1972).
