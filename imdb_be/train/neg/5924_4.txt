Maldur appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. No one on board did not notice - perhaps it was the hair. No matter, this time it is not a repository of God (see previous episode), but a very famous lady with magical powers that allow it to communicate and see Medusan without going crazy (standard human response). Unfortunately, the people who are most in love with her a few cards short with a full deck, and he's trying to kill the ambassador Medusan (which, oddly enough, lives in a small box - it's a lousy way to get around). And, unfortunately, Muldayr not hurt all that well themselves. What happens next, like a mute and by the time the episode was the first time I saw him, I was very relieved. Watching all the people on board are going ga-ga over Muldaur was a pretty silly action and Spock, when he briefly lost his mind was quite old-fashioned. Do yourself a favor - if you have not seen the show, choose a different episode.
