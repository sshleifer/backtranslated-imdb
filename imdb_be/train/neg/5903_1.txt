I live in Salt Lake City, and I'm not Mormon, so why should I rent this movie? Well, because I live in Utah, and I thought it would be nice to see the places I know, in the movie. I knew exactly what was going on in there that I was not going to get the inside joke, so I was not surprised when I sat with a deer in the headlights look. What I was surprised was an ant, a non-Mormon actions that have been placed in this film. <br /> <br /> I know that this is a film of Mormon, served members of the LDS Church, but I found it offensive because of the typical stereotype of people who are not of their faith. Each Sun Mormon, which was not much, drank, smoked and had a wonderful selfish attitude, why? <br /> <br /> It really tick me about this film, they did Mormon so clean, everything else I think of Utah, filled with punk crazies just because they do not go to the writings of the Mormon church. <br /> <br /> I understand that they have areas revolve around all the members of the LDS, but you think the Salt Lake City Mormon was 100%, which is not even close to be true. And, as I said, are not Mormons in the movie portrayed as drunken jerks, please! <br /> <br /> I guess I just do not understand, because I do not belong to their faith, and I never think that I will.
