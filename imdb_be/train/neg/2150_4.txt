You will immediately know the story. The daughter of a divorced couple trying to get mom and dad back together. Yes, it was the theme of The Parent Trap in the 60s, 80s and 90s. But that's a terrible thing. Although Durbin were younger than 21 year old Hayley Mills, playing the role of a doting daughter (s), Durbin look much older as adults. And so that all its so-called brothers and sisters. <br /> <br /> And this confusion between an adult and a child goes throughout the film. Girls dressed in cute little sailor dress, but look silly in them as the director seems to take every effort to show their wide tops and tushies throughout the film. Thus, you are constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women. If the Ray Milland and others start "hitting on" them, you get the feeling as if they are pedophiles, and you can be one, and to ignore those tushies and the top director has revealed. Teens or seductress, little girls or little fox, you are never quite sure what you should think of them as. <br /> <br /> The parents, too, seems to be very old and the whole film seems very dated. <br /> <br /> This rusty version of The Parent Trap, and you need to avoid, or at least make sure your tetanus shots in the course, if you do not believe me.
