This seems to be the only film directed by John Saxon, and that he had the good sense to stop and then remain in front of the camera. This film is a dog, from the beginning to the end, and it's sad and wood from nothing special going for it. Vietnam war hero takes a job working for a mafia boss, getting a little too friendly with his wife, then the wife of the murdered mafia boss and a war hero himself frame and put in prison, on death row in particular. Now, this particular prison experimented on prisoners and testing some formula that will turn people end up killing machine (zombies). Of course, everything goes wrong, and then there are all of these infected people locked up in prison, some of which turned into a zombie, and the others, who all of a sudden just do not want to be there anymore. It just goes on and on and on with nothing particularly much to show or say to myself, and I stopped him until the end, which seemed like it came a few times, but not, apparently, just getting set to take off on a different and just a dull way. If one looked at the end, they may well become zombies themselves, so do not risk it. 2 of 10.
