"Memoirs of a Geisha" is a visually stunning melodrama that is more like a camp, a transvestite satire than anything to do with real people. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film, defensively insists that geishas are no prostitutes or concubines, they are the epitome of traditional Japanese beauty. But except for one spectacular dance the rest of the film degenerates into «Pretty Baby» in the territory of Storyville, or, at least, Vashti and Esther in the story of Purim, as the efforts of all the women in art and artificiality about entertaining, much older, drunken boorish men. Maybe it's the Japanese culture, which is now a prostitute, not only to the American louts after World War II. <br /> <br /> maybe this voltage to speak English, but Zhang Ziyi shows a little bit of a big outbreak, she demonstrated in "House of Flying Daggers (Shi Mian May Fu)" and "Hero (Ying Xiong)." Michelle Yeoh sometimes gets a glimpse of her project the guaranteed performance in "Crouching tiger, Hidden dragon (Wo Hu Cang long time)." Only Gong Li shows the real life. Otherwise, I continued to reflect the Charles Ludlam in different roles, or even Cillian Murphy, as in the Kabuki theater, in particular, as the plot slow cat fight after a cat fight. <br /> <br /> The imaginary love story has zero chemistry, mainly because of the age difference, and I'm mainly sorry for Ken Watanabe, and expressed hope for its Hollywood pay check compensation for his loss of dignity as a mysterious "Chairman". I remember more emotion in "Portrait of Jenny", a young girl who seeks to grow in favor of Jennifer Jones, Joseph Cotton. <br /> <br /> We see short glimpses of reality when geisha posing with regular women as photographic attractions, as well as Fab Ziyi Zhang lives in the war in a very picturesque operations kimono dying. The finale has little sense of normality. <br /> <br /> evaluation includes many chopped traditional tunes, with the cello by Yo Yo Ma and Perlman violin Yitzhack instead of traditional instruments that are beautiful to listen to the accompaniment excellent cinematography, by the time one completely ignores plot and tough action. <br /> <br /> how my mind wandered, I wondered how long the Japanese samurai films directors would have to deal with this story, which probably would have been more formal, but it is much more emotional.
