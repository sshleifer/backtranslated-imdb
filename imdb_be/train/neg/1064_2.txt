warning: this film tells a lot of stories about love without any consistency <br /> <br /> The only purpose of this film seems to show love in different ways <br /> <br /> Each story has only a few .. minutes, so there is no character development and almost no plot. Just a schematic idea of ​​the plot. The writer tried to build in the crucial moments, which are aimed to surprise the viewer. However, it simply does not work because you do not get to know the characters before or the "joke" was just stupid. <br /> <br /> This is a film about love, which does not reach your heart, a dozen times. Or even more, I do not know and I do not care.
