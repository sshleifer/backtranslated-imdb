I will say this much - the director of all RAW images ... things that most of us are not ready to confront head-on. Image of sex, suicide, murder, and the people, "relieving himself" continually bombed the viewer, which makes me wonder when the director tries to convey the concept of relief or exemption. Although I do not think I could see this film again, I will say that the director does have a good eye. There were some really good shots and "picture moments' in the film (fans, fish wire hair), but the story has left me needing larger (strictly so that we were to ask ourselves:" What the devil noticed just see ") <br /> <br /> Note :. If you have a tendency to Gag or vomit easily nya ... watch this movie.
