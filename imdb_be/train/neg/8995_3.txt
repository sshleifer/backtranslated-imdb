I missed the beginning, but I've seen most of them. A friend got it on DVD in a cheap room at FYE. <br /> <br /> The parodies are all very short, and yet most of them are still too long. Most of them, they seem to have forgotten something funny! Quite a lot of racist / sexist / "homophobic" humor in it, skits based on stereotypes or scenes that use racist terms for people. <br /> <br /> I try to remember everything that I thought it was funny in it and I'm having trouble .... logo for network Tunnel Vision, is lipsticked mouth with an eyeball in it. opens his mouth and closes above the eye as ever. Kind of awful. <br /> <br /> what a disappointment. most of the actors went on to better things, and it was lucky the bomb did not hold them back.
