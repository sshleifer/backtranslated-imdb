I usually check the MTV Movie Awards look witty, entertaining show, which provides a unique awards show (Chewbacca gain time achievement award life as an example). So this year is no different. Although I am not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott always funny albiet silly-me. I laughed Stiffler in both films American Pie and even enjoyed it Dude Where's My Car?. But MTV movie awards were just awful. Nothing was coherrent, humorous or entertaining. Justin Timberlake must adhere to singing and dancing; He sure as hell can not act. <br /> <br /> I wonder who the writers were at this show. performance in the past year, Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar, was extremely funny (The Lord of the Rings parody, one should watch the entire show), but this year was different complement. Does anyone understand the comments regarding Timberlake Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ( "They stared in a movie together, but have never met! Here they are ...") Where was the joke? Kate and Luke just came into their lame dialogue, never making reference to the "joke" by Timberlake. And Seann was staffed as a wasted talent, even makes me smile, but laugh alone. And that point is Harrison Ford's one-liners? Have they no sense to anyone? Perhaps, MTV authors understood that younger viewers will know only the aging Ford as Han Solo, Indiania Jones, or the president of Air Force One. I'm confused. And someone tell me the deal with Adrien Brody? How old is this guy and how old he thinks he is? The guy looks 30, is trying to act 19 times .... give it, show some class (as in your actor Oscar speech) and act your age! <br /> <br /> I give this show 1 star out of 4, simply because of the performances Gollam for better visual performance. It was a very creative, very well done, and called the only real laugh all evening.
