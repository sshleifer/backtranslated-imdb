Carnosaurs 3: Original form (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terri J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why even bother to review this film? Another stupid dinosaur film in which secret military guys find these mortals (and very fake looking) prehistoric monsters running around killing people in bloody ways. The original was bad enough, the sequel was even worse. It is somewhere between the two, although it is not related to any of the previous films carnosaurs. Rating: 2 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and gore, profanity, and monstrous forms.
