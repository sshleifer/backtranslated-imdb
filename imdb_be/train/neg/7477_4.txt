Basically, a tight road movie with some wonderful comic represented by John Cleese (though he did send his work in Fawlty Towers). It seems over the top to turn the farce into a slushy sentimentality of the blue, and the worst part of the film is that Martin and Hawn are to "find himself", who are they, etc. Watch it at your own risk.
