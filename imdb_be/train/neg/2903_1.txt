Dear. This film could have been subtitled "If the writers go on strike!" What a bitch. I was really high hopes for this, mainly after reading the reviews IMDb, which makes me wonder about the whole IMDb rating system, but it's a separate issue. I loved Steve Carell in Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, Office, etc., so I was expecting a lot. To say I was disappointed is an understatement of the year. There are so many things wrong with this film, but I will confine (a) unbelievably any family behaves, how these people make (mass aerobics exercise? What planet is that real life then?), Embarrassing script (the killer of love? Please ), as well as the fact that the character of Dan is so unpleasant, you find yourself wondering what she saw in him, to make her fall in love with him? The film was full clunky dialogue, creaking direction, funny set of scenes, and it was slow, slow, slow. We would leave in half an hour, if you were not my parents, who do not get much, and do not like to spend money. Unlike the creators of this film, which would be better to throw all the money spent doing this film in a fire - that would be more interesting. If you love movies, you avoid it like the plague.
