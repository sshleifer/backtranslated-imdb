One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it starts to become a satire, is that it will be more believable. I think the antimatter bomb will do more harm than what it was intended. But I'll leave that for the physicists who could see Sunny crisis. <br /> <br /> This is a crisis facing the earth, because the solar flares are completely out of hand. They get close to the Earth, so it was extremely hot, as if the whole earth was Death Valley. The answer is the antimatter bomb, the spacecraft will have to take in the sun and blow it up there. This will detract from the flash, for example, the direction of Mercury says the condition that he is not in a straight line with the Earth. <br /> <br /> Who is to deliver it, but Captain Tim Matheson and his team. That is, if he can keep his mind on the business at hand, not on the runaway son, Corin Nemec. Taking care of the personal side of family problems, Admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson's father, and grandfather. <br /> <br /> There are Germans in the villain here, Peter Boyle, who is the CEO of a multinational corporation, which in this crisis is trying to control the world's supply of food for the victims. The idea, he can not survive, it is not part of his thinking. He does everything possible to sabotage <br /> <br Matheson mission. /> Sunny crisis seems a bad mix in 2001, A Space Odyssey and Voyage to the bottom of the sea. Boyle seems to take its cue from the Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman, apparently, he is the only in plaster, who understands that he is in Turkey and overacts respectively. <br /> <br /> Other actors are tall, and the true blue dim. Except, perhaps, desert rat, Jack Palance, who finds Nemec and caring for him. <br /> <br /> The key here is that the film director, who noted Hollywood film distributor flop, Allen Smith. The film received a full four stars for the actors involved, and it was during the carving of gratitude.
