"Guy Thing" is trying to capture the feeling of "There's Something About Mary" and "Meet the Parents", but comes off more like it was edited with the carving up of the room rejects these two films. Fortunately, I take it on rent in a 5-day, because I can not sit back and watch more than 20 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> The room is decent and I liked the scene where the other guys are automatically covered for oversight Paul (saber at Save-the window was large), but the script, the writing is absolutely horrible. Dialogue provides a flat most of the time, and just when you think that everything is finally going to get in the way of some superfluous observation gag was stuck in for no reason. In addition, as many toilet jokes makes one film really need? <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, slapstick humor is great, if it's smartly done, as in other films that I mentioned, but this film just misses. Too bad, I love Julia Stiles (Ten Things I Hate About You was great), but even this can not help me to sit through this terrible movie. Save your dollars and go rent "There's Something About Mary," one more time.
