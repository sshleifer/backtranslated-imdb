I remember watching this film several times, as a very young man, and had his part (a lot actually) that I do not understand. I think I saw him once, as an adult, and then I realized these parts. The only problem with viewing it as an adult was that it was not interesting to me at all. So what kind of movie is this? Is this "kids movies"? Nha unlikely. It contains language and subject matter not suitable for children. Is this hyperbole that every parent feels like they go through with their children? Maybe, but then why not focus more on the character of John Ritter instead of younger? If the film has a 7-year-old as the main character, in order to do well with his audience, he must be a movie for seven and under crowd, otherwise people older who are not able to relate (even 8-year-old children do not want to see a film about childhood, which is a year younger than them). I am sure that this film is not very well at the box office, and must be a reason, because they could not find a niche in the market.
