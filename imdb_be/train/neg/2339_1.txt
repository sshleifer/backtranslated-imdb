This circling the film looks like a combination of music-clips on MTV, than as a real movie. There's no real story, and as the film goes on, you ask yourself, "What will happen"; but nothing happens. History around Eric Cloeck, which did not take place of the writer, this is the only good thing. Other persons do not seem to have anything in common, then why put them together in a movie. With music you can make the worst film watchable. When I open the faucet and water comes from the music of Bach, the majority of people would like to look at it, but it's not a movie. The director must learn how to write a script for a film of 100 minutes or more before starting to direct the film.
