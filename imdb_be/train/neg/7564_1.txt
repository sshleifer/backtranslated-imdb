The Wicker Man. I am so angry that I can not write the correct comments about this movie. <br /> <br /> The story was funny, subtly linked, and generally just lame. Nicolas Cage ... shame! I assumed that since you were in it, it would be at least decent. It was not. <br /> <br /> I felt like a huge part of the film were left on the floor of the room, and even if it is the full film was just ridiculous and stupid. <br /> <br /> at the end you are left open-mouthed, intoxicated mind and offended good taste. I've never heard so many people leave the theater on the opening day with such hatred. People complain about it in small groups, at the mall, four floors down from the theater entrance. It's so bad <br /> <br /> I've heard it compared to :. Shine, An American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My boyfriend was so mad that he will not even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
