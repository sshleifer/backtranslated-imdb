"The Cat's Meow" contains several scenes that can boast of intellectual dialogue, and some excellent performances, some of which surprised me. Izzard is more effective than I expected as Chaplin (partly thanks to the excellent hair and make-up work on some talented designer); Joanna Lumley is compelling as novelist Elinor clays; and Kirsten Dunst wins as Marion Davies (though why the film never use her real life stuttering is hard to explain). But these elements do not add up to a successful whole. The writer seems to have worked very hard on some of the scenes - meeting between Davis and Charlie Chaplin is particularly well handled - but not so much on the big picture. Several minor characters should not be there, and do not behave consistently. The main plot of the complete illogic (eg why Thomas Ince thinks it's a good idea to say Hearst that he really does not want to hear?), And party scenes are repeated and tedious. I would like to think, a trip on a yacht Hearst was more fun than the movie shows. Davis described as a standard bubble types of firecrackers, which is not very accurate, and screenwriter ideas about Chaplin and love implausible. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Bogdanovic, who seemed to be so associated with thirty in «Paper Moon», does not have the same affinity for the twentieth. He maintained excellent use costume designer only black and cream that gives party guests a very artificial look, and play only the stereotyped period songs (such as "Yes, we have no banana"). If Hurst insists of "Charleston, Charleston!" it looks as though the actors had a ten-minute dance lesson right before the scene was shot. <br /> <br /> silent movie stars in life can make interesting films, I'm sure, but not this time.
