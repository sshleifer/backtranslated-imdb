I am surprised that reviewers gave this @ IMDb TV movie as a high ranking, as they did. It is harmless, sweet, simple clich√© "a film that had two big names from the past in it (both of which did a decent job), but this film reeks of work in the low-budget, we can see any day of the week for smaller cable channels. I like a good novel, like any other, but both my wife and I watched it - and before we saw the rating we said, "There are people who are going to appreciate this film too much simply because there is nothing in it to challenge their brains, their faith, their comfort level or cultural preferences. it is possible to make a good film like that (and from the example), but it was amateur hour. there are some very good movies rated significantly lower than this. Indeed, even in a long line of inappropriate selling of films. Watch The Family Stone. It's miles ahead of this schlock.
