Koen Waters is a Flemish singer and presenter. In the early nineties, he tried his hand at a movie as well. But it is incredible piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all. He also graduated from the acting career of the Dutch actress Nada van Nie, who went on to be a football wife, TV presenter and program maker. I actually saw it in the (almost empty) theater, because I used to be a fan of the band Koen Waters Clouseau. I'm so sorry to spend money on it. It looks cheap, it's a terrible story, and it performed poorly in every way. Some people think it's so bad it was funny. I'm not one of them. I just found this incredible waste of time and money.
