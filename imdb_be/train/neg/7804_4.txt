Tempo (1993) did a lot of theater business, but straight to video plagiarism you do not want in any case! Helen Bradford (Mel Harris) is a new woman in the Millennium Investments, high scale of the brokerage firm, which is starting to get good advice from wide-open eyes Deidre Secretary (Sheila Kelley). Deirdre is an ambitious girl daddy, who will stop at nothing to move up the career ladder, including the top broker screwing it can not stand there and kill anyone who gets on her bad side. She digs up skeletons in the closet, Ellen, trying to cause problems with her husband (Bostwick), kills, making it look like she is responsible, kidnaps her daughter and tries to get her to embezzle money from the company. <br /> <br /> Harris and Kelly provide competent performances, the supporting cast in order, and it is well put-together, but did not fully compensate for a script that moves down the beaten path and offers few surprises.
