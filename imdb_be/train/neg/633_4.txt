Good Earth is worth the life of a slave and a poor farmer in China. The film is based on a novel by Pearl S. Buck. The history of a great, but I hated that they had decided to quit the Anglo-Saxons in the lead roles. Walter Connolly ridiculously like a farmer father. He has such a heavy American accent, like most of the leading actors that I could not listen to him talk. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that Hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast an Asian in the lead roles. To the Anglo-Saxons, and make them look like Chinese Anglos seem to put shoe polish on their faces, to play an African-American.
