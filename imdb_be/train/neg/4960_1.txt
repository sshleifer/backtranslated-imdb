I'm a big fan of the Batman comics, and I was disappointed when I could no longer find the Batman: The Animated Series on TV more. I was thrilled to find out that there was to be a new Batman cartoon on TV. I watched the first episode in the opening day, and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all, the animation is very bad. It looks like a cheap, shoddy Japanese anime. Again, almost every modern cartoon like this. <br /> <br /> The design of the characters is even worse. Batman looks like Birdman, Catwoman is more like Chihuahuawoman, Bane looks like a red version of Halki, the penguin is a master of kung fu, Mr. Freeze some undead thing with an iceberg on its head, and the Riddler is the Gothic Marilyn Manson lookalike (which is funny, because I do not expect that people who are obsessed with riddles and puzzles to be Gothic). <br /> <br /> worst character design is that the Joker. They turned it into a monkey / dementia Bob Marley / Kung-Fu Fighter! Joker has to be the mortal enemy of Batman, but in this show, he is unlikely to pose a threat, because his offense is so stupid and meaningless. In one episode, his plan was to put his Joker venom in the dog food! Oh, how evil! Batman fascinating and complex character, as he is haunted by the death of his parents, and that is why he fights crime. This version of Batman, it seems, is haunted by the death of his parents and not interesting at all. It is also not a detective, just a fighter. If there is an enemy, he can not win, he will not learn of the enemy, to find out their weaknesses as a detective would, he just build a giant combat robot to defeat them. Many times, this show does not even feel like Batman show, just another mindless anime that there is nothing but senseless fighting. <br /> <br /> What I hate most of the show, what they did with the villains. They took away everything that makes them attractive and Relatable and turned them into the stereotypical evil bad guy. Man-bat is the biggest example. In the comics, he is a tragic scientist who studies bats to find a cure for his deafness. Experimenting on himself, he accidentally turns himself into a giant bat creature. In this show, he is a mad scientist who wants to deliberately turn yourself into a giant bat creature without any reason. Almost all the villains, like this; none of them, except one or two, do not have the actual motive of the crime. <br /> <br /> worst characterization is that of Mr. Freeze. In the comics, Freese was a mad scientist as a brilliant writer Paul Dini wrote the episode of TTP "Heart of IceÂ», which gave a new freeze origin, which made it more tragic, three-dimensional, and likable villain. This episode was so popular that fans have taken it as their actual origin and even used in the comics, as well as its origin. Even the crappy movie Batman and Robin used it as its origin. In this show, he is a fine gem thief before he became Mr. Freeze. After becoming Mr. Freeze, guess what? He was still a fine gem thief! Large origin. Not surprisingly, they have used it over the one created by Dini. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Batman, I do not like this show only because he does not look like a comic book, because I, too, loved the TPA, Batman cartoons that came after him, Batman films of Tim Burton, and, obviously wonderful films of Christopher Nolan's Batman. None of them was not 100% loyal to the comics, but they were still very good. The problem with this show is not something that is not quite so comic or BTAS, is that it lacks any depth, making other means Batman media is so popular. <br /> <br /> I made this show so many chances, but the more I look, the more I believe that disappoints me. I miss the good old days back when Batman cartoons were something that everyone can enjoy.
