Holy God freaking freaking all-powerful. This movie was so bad I thought I was on drugs. In a bad way ... The current character is the poorest thing I've seen in awhile. This film was more akin to The Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO (it's a real film). Much of the film seems to be done on the horrible green screen. My favorite part was when they are in a wheelchair, and you can tell that there is a horse. They run from alien monsters, and occurs at approximately the same speed as fast jog. Then he switched to long-range shot from the ridiculous CG horses. And the CG as a whole appears to be a subpar 1992 Beyond intellectual sight. I mean, well, actually. It was like a terrible episode of Hercules, Kevin Sorbo not only there to save the day. Worse. Movie. Ever.
