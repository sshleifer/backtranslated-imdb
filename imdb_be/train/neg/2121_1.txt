Frankly, it seemed like seven o'clock boredom as well. What is it? What is Will Smith, I just can not anymore? I believe that it just seems too hellbent on time to get serious and get the Oscar. I understand how this bias, but if it does not undergo some new acting lessons, I can never see him winning. He is a great name, and therefore tend to be confused with being a talented and diverse actor. He just is not so. I give him credit for trying so hard, and to be able to cry for no reason. That's about it. <br /> <br /> Seven Pounds was a kind eyeroller for me from the beginning. Suicide 911 call does not intrigue me. I did not want to know why he was calling to his suicide. There has been absolutely no surprises. The best thing I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson were some decent chemistry on screen. Also, I do not know her name, but Hispanic women did an excellent job with her role as a frightened and shaken up his wife. Woody Harrelson had very limited screen time, but I would say that he stole the show when it was on. <br /> <br /> In general, a very mediocre unoriginal plot. I could not help asking myself all the way through, why do I care about any of these people. I never once regretted "Tim / bin". He killed himself jellyfish? He was the only survivor of the accident 8 people? Geewiz..didn't see any of this approaching ... <br /> <br /> 5/10 rather generously.
