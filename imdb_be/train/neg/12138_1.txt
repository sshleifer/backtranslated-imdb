Serious HOME ALONE / Karate KID knock off a enough bad character stereotypes to writer filed a lawsuit, and then shot. You could see the use of blatant human dwarf almost every scene. Oh, and the action sucks too. Although I must say that the line: "I'm sorry, man, I need to take a big dump big time" he made me laugh my ass off.
