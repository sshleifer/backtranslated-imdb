British "The legacy of the film" industry out of control. There's nothing wrong with shooting classic novels, but why should they be removed talentless nonentities? The film breaks the bowel of hard Orwell, turning it into a harmless, fluffy romantic comedy. "Aspidistra" may not be the best work of Orwell, but no one is reading, who can forget his poverty excellent image. Orwell emphasizes not only the cold and hunger, but the humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a grim, gray, cold, soulless city, and Comstock praying for something to be eroded away squadron of bombers. But this film irons from anything that might be in any way alarming, and instead creates a fun nostalgic journey into the magical 1930, in London, where all the lighting with shafts of golden sunlight, and even the slums of Lambeth colorful and filled freshly urchins and prostitutes happy. Comstock verses comes to sudden winds sweeping across the garbage-strewn streets seem completely irrelevant in this sugary world. Worst of all is inexorably friendliness script, ancient jokes and dialogue clunking. It's very frustrating, because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock and the film is packed with great actors. But it's all in vain. This film made me so angry! British literary history is something to be proud of their wealth, power, and complexity. And what do we do with him? We use mild jerk to turn it into soft in the center, PAP painkiller for people who want to feel that they "get some culture" while they drink their Horlicks and sleep.
