Class is a series of comedy that reflects a bunch of 27-year-old former comrades class. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​the show. That's why it saddens me that the class is not funny, even if it has obvious potential. It is not enough cork, just dull. (Ha ha). This is due to the lack of slowish tempo and really funny punch line. Moreover, some actors have difficulty with timing. <br /> <br /> Most ingeniously written symbols twins Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh), but even they seem to be just a little too square for a good show. On the other hand, the characters, I find most uninteresting are the main character Ethan i used to B pair Duncan and Nicole. <br /> <br /> What bothers me with the series is that the only Latino character Aaron being teased by his accent (albeit on a non-respectable character, but in any case).
