"Transylvania 6-5000" is insignificant, but sometimes funny and charming in the mid-80s horror parody with very familiar names in the cast, and a handful of real opportunities to giggle in the script. Two layman journalist of the gossip tabloid sent, very much against their will, to Transylvania to make a story about the alleged return of the mind of the scientist Frankenstein. There are some magic tricks and detail to identify the left and right in a film like little guillotine for hard-boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes, which are used to put in the cream and sugar for breakfast. Beneficial film, however, was not as successful as it could and should have been, with jokes and parodies of situations that are too long. Roger Corman production "Transylvania Twist", released four years after that, much funnier and much more recommended. The film is particularly parodying classical universal milestone in the early 30s, so you better make sure that you have seen them, if you want to cover all of the little jokes and references. There's quite an original twist that shows the character of Frankenstein behave just like a mad-crazy evil scientist, if he is in his lab. He also revealed that he is actually more of a father Damien kind of messiah, who cares only when the exiles monsters. Michael Richards, quirky guy who played Kramer in the Seinfeld, stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments. I'm sure John Turturro character in «Mr. Deeds »was inspired by the role of Richards here.
