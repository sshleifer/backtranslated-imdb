It is a well-made film in the spirit of informative PBS Frontline. The problem is, of Frontline has made this piece and was able to bring Paul Bremer, to tell his side of the story. More worrying is the fact that the film's director, Charles Ferguson - formerly crammed brain, was the military occupation of the fans to not go to the south. What does he think, what will happen? <br /> <br /> The invasion of Poland was very good as well, until he was messed up by those pesky Nazis.And is that this film feels like - an apology for the occupation, not the act of deconstruction of the war, <br / > <br /> Ferguson seems to believe that the war could work better - as if any war could be better.
