There is absolutely nothing in this film that shows even the slightest shred of talent. No it did not try acting before, even the extras in the cafe looks as if they were glued in place. Nothing looks rehearsed.The quality horror film. Most of the "action" takes place in the narrow corridors or apartments with a television cameraman in the crowded mechanically waving some cheapo camera back and forth between the "actors" as they deliver their lines. Lot tripod and there is no proper or microphone, the sound quality is awful. Even tariffs «Manos» better than that, at least, they had the proper equipment. What plot there is simply lost in the manufacturing mash. <br /> <br /> Stick to home video, mainly made some 5 years old child tries with video features of the new phone Daddy's camera. You will be in for a long search to find the film more ridiculous than that.
