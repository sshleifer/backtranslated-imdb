It was a terrible movie! I gave him 2 points, one for Angelina Jolie and the second for the perfect Porsche in the beginning ... Other than the story just sucked and racing cars across the city was not new in 1970. Happyend was probably what annoyed me the most, rarely seen anything so constructed!
