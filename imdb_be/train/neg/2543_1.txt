talk about your spending money .. im just wondering why Michael will be shot in Turkey in such movie..Michael is a great actor, especially in the film, where he plays a man dying of cancer .. it was great. as he tapes his son to see him as soon as he gets older .. Michael is such a talented actor .. so what made him do it alone ??? I watched it and thought it was really stupid .. I think, at one time in their career they are bad movies .. especially the "Squeeze" I did not understand that one at all, and I feel that his best work It was Â«Pacific Heights", his character really creeped me .. and I really enjoyed the "Multiplicity". .that one was so much fun !!! and it is just perfect for the role of "Batman" .. and I kind of liked " Night Shift "and I love" Johnny Dangerously "too .. just too bad some of them end up making lousy movies .. like this one was ...
