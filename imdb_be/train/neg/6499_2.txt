That tangled mess. I saw this one a while ago, and we both consider ourselves to be open to the many wonders of the movie, but it sure is not one of them. <br /> <br /> While it may very well be a good idea / concept is, of course, some good performances (as appropriate), all buried under random nonsense. Sir Anthony draws too much from the same gene pool as the Congenital Killer, U Turn, and such films as editing is concerned, or maybe he was watching himself in the Nixon for inspiration. Say what you want about David Lynch, but at least he often has no method to the madness. <br /> <br /> His quote that he made the film jokingly says it all. It is not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
