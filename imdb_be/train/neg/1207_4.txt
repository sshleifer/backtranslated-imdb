Star Kim Basinger as Della, a desperate housewife with several abusive husband who gets in trouble until it at your local mall doing some last minute Christmas shopping. After placing the hastily scrawled hateful note on a piece of paper and said, sticking the paper in the windshield of the car, who served two parking spaces, she learns that the car owners are Rainbow Coilition villains, which consist of a white guy, Mexican, Chinese and a black guy. They confront her about the note, the cover of the helpless guard and chase on. In the course of the film Della go on hunting the hunter as she unleashes her inner Bronson. <br /> <br /> I found it to be a little more tense thriller. The acting was good enough (except for a few scenes, but "Why God, why?" Bit was crawling worthy of its harmfulness, though) He comes to cancel a bit due to the fact that thieves Della chases with / after a mind numbingly stupid when they did not have any intelligence of the «Home Alone» villain, perhaps their ultimate defeat would be something to savor instead Furs reaction it causes. Factor unbelievability I am willing to miss and as a director and one of the producers were involved in bringing «Shoot Em Up» on the screen (the film that while throwing the confidence in the window was a lot of fun). This movie will never reach the heights of this film was good in its own right <br /> <br /> My rating :. C- <br /> <br /> Anchor Bay DVD Extras: Commentary with Writer / director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy; 25 and a half minutes' Nesting c "; trailer and two TV commercials for the film; and trailer Lower Learning
