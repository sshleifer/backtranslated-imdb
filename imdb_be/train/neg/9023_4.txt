I watched the anime, but I'm not a die hard fan; and I do not read manga. I say this because many of the reviewers who waxing lyrical about this film, it seems that background. I saw "Deerslayer" and although it is not a masterpiece any stretch, it made me take «Shinobi," especially since everyone seems to love it. <br /> <br /> Well, I watched it in the second half of the day and fought very hard to continue to look Yes, it's very nice -. the slow movement of water scene, autumn leaves on trees, even CGI eyes flicker -. majestic I liked the hawk, costumes, even some of the fight scenes, but overall it was boring, dirt <br /> <br /> it was as if someone had taken a "Romeo and Juliet." - translation even mentions that they are unhappy lovers - and threw in some «X-Men» for good measure two of the characters split the forces of Wolverine -. man dressed in a bear costume had its claws and a gray-haired man had his own ability to heal itself then you have a girl who has a poisonous kiss -. here Poison Ivy (Batman). Why do they give these women so stupid powers? Poisoning girl shows her leg kiss you to death. Man, that is some greater force for you. And the other girl, can create errors of yellow dust, she rubs her hands. Another woman, one of the unfortunate lovers, has the power of hypnotic gaze. Wow. <br /> <br /> I kinda made it to the end of the film, fast forward, and I saw a little more of the tragedy than I expected. Some people compare it to "House of Flying Daggers" and "Hero." Do not make this mistake. They may share similar endings, but this is where the similarity ends. «Shinobi» made an amateur - other films made by an experienced film director <br /> <br /> I would say avoid this movie if you are not 12 to 18 years old ..
