Stephen J. Cannell, apparently, decided several years ago that he expand his horizons and dabble in horror. As a result, "Dead Above Ground," the bottomless piece of junk. Now, if I noticed his name in connection with this particular film, I would put it back, but no, I did not have my glasses, so I missed it, damn it, I really need to bring those with me at the time as a video store. The first question will be, who the hell is the target audience for this? It's almost like "scary" children's film, but then again there are topless babes and some gore and some say bad words here and there. The main characters are so cute that you want to see someone, anyone, to follow them to the farm of some sort. It seems that the guy opens a bed and breakfast that has a checkered past, a child-killing witch who lived there collects baby teeth. It is possible that some real estate agent is not mentioned. Of course, now there is a modern little girls around the ghost, to prevent real live little girl who lives there is something bad happens. He does, and there are also two Bubbas, who were squatting on this property, when the new owner took over, so that they are out for revenge, too. This whole thing has the feeling of a cable made of junk that for children for Halloween, with the exception, of course, things that are not suitable for young children, so it is not only commonplace, it's confusion, too. Big B and hiss at Anchor Bay for putting this too, given their usual track record with excellent releases a new minimum. UK receives phantom Box Set, we get the "Tooth Fairy". Hardly seems fair. 1 out of 10, absolute rubbish.
