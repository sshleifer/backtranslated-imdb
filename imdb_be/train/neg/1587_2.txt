Maybe television is hard one day. Maybe ?? Big Brother` was only the first step in the direction of Steven ?? Richard Bachmann` King described the endpoint. But enough about that. If I spend too many words talking about serious background theme of the film, I do what the producers hoped choosing this material. It's the same with ?? 6th Day`. No matter how primitive the film, it provokes a discussion about his subject, which serves as the advertising producers. Let us not be taken in this. Social criticism that is offered by this short story is only an alibi to make it possible to obtain speculative, violent film, more for video sales than the movie. <br /> <br /> I have not read the book. I have no right to criticize Stephen King, entirely read it, but when I saw the film, I thought, that they could not make such a scary movie with a good book: Typically, complete with 1980s 1980s music and some minor actors Arnold Schwarzenegger appears as a cop killer escapes from the brutal television shows. The audience applause. <br /> <br /> Along with ?? Predator`, it is certainly the most stupid movie Schwarzenegger. 2 stars out of 10.
