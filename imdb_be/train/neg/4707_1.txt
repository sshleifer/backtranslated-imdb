OMG it was the most painful experience of my life, watching it. I could even finish what happens to Nick. They are the best thing on the teen Nick Drake and Josh and is about to leave the air. a kind of annoying kids songs and kids are so. My little sister wanted to see the show because she loves everything that comes to Disney or nick, as a rule, but after you finish watching the show, she said, "one of the worst shows I have ever seen so sad." My younger brother actually fell asleep, I envy him. In short, if your 3yrs old in the absence of brain activity you will enjoy this show otherwise change the channel now.
