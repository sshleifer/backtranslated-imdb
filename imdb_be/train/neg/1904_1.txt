=== minor spoilers === <br /> <br /> I, like many others, a big fan of Jerry Bruckheimer. So when I saw that all the beautiful posters hanging in the front, and the trailer is before MI: 2, expectations are growing. Jerry Bruckheimer production. Big Cars. Nic Cage and fresh from an Oscar Angelina Jolie. What could possibly go wrong? Lot. <br /> <br /> The script is neither funny (which is trying really hard to be) and not interesting. You put in a black man who is constantly making racist jokes about themselves and Wooh-haa !! you get a comedy? I do not think so. Excitement is completely out of the picture. First of all (and this is probably said it many times) NO cute characters, so who cares, who kills? If you can stomach the premise that a psycho is going to kill his brother Nic, if he does not steal 50 cars in 4 days, the next thing you know that Kip (brother) again with Nic was in the streets. Whether it's the excitement? Do not think. Then comes the best bit romance between Nic and Angelina. It actually looks boring to say all these stupid lines to Nic. 'You have a girlfriend?' "Do you see anyone?" "What went wrong and etc. <br /> <br /> Then there is only one spark of hope left:. Car chases They disappointing to say the least, because the trailer made it look as it was full of them, and there is only one very long one, caught in a maddeningly restless camera movement I really had trouble following the action <br /> <br /> So it's a romantic comedy thriller thriller -...??? no the need to address, just avoid this terrible mess. I'll give 3 out of 10 stars, and I feel like I'm being generous.
