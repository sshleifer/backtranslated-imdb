There's something exciting about watching a movie like "murder NumersÂ», because somewhere inside that the Hollywood formula of a good film is trying to jump. However, by the time the credits roll, then no saving it. All this is largely blown "police side" of the story, where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin detective character kills confuse through awkward sexual affair, which becomes more and more trivial, the longer the film goes. Although Bullka strong in their roles, it is not enough to keep the dull script and lazy to walk. Ben Chaplin talents wasted in forgettable roles (he did much better at the beginning of the year at undervalued "Birthday Girl") and Chris Penn, who has a role so thankless a little regret talent like him. Anyway, the story does not even factor in this movie at all. Two teenage killer, played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reason to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry work very well and they play off each other well enough. It's too bad they were not much better, all around the film. Barbet Schroeder walks too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker. Result: it is worth a rental if you are a genre fan, but everyone else will live a full life, without seeing it, except maybe on TV network with convenient commercial breaks.
