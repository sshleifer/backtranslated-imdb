I was very happy to see that they made a movie with my favorite books ever. I did not understand that this is Disney, before it is too late. I was shocked by many omissions of important parts of the story. It was as if someone made a movie out of the book of the report of the 4th graders on the novel. Meg did well in school, and neither she nor her father wore glasses. Ms. Murray (Meg's mother) did not draw as much a scientist at all; they came out of his laboratory kitchen and replace it on the Internet. And this is only the beginning. Halfway through the movie, I found that yelling at the screen, much to the annoyance of others who watched the movie who have not read the book. I wish I had more fingers, so that I could give four thumbs down for this. The only good thing I can say is that for a person who has not read the book, this film is a kind of good.
