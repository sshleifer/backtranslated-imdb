I can not believe that I was so angry when he saw this, I'm going to write my first review on the IMDb. <br /> <br /> This documentary Disney is not nothing but a light to warm the Earth. Now I knew that descended into it, that it was advertised as "from the people that brought you Earth," but I had no idea that they were going to explicitly use the same reduction as a mini-series of innovative documentary. I just paid $ 8.75 to see what I already have on DVD. Shame on Disney for the Sun warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here (save James Earl Jones voice-overs, and 90 seconds of sailing, I do not believe that was the planet Earth). <br /> <br /> But the greatest crime of all, is that while the planet Earth uses the tragic history of the polar bear as a proof that we are killing the planet and catalyst of environmental change, Disney took this history and turned it into a family tripe. After the death of the male polar bear, they show it the cubs have grown considerably year later and throw up some garbage about how they will be ready to carry on his memory, and that the earth is really wonderful place after all. No mention of who grew up a Cubs impending death due to the same plight of their father suffered, not without warning of trouble for the future generations, when we do not get our act together, nothing. Just assembling material that we have seen throughout the film (and many times more if you are one of a billion people who have seen the planet Earth). <br /> <br /> I never left the theater feeling so embarrassed and cheated in my life.
