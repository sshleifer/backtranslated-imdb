Words can not describe how bad this film. I can not explain it, writing only. You also see it for yourself to get in the grip of how awful a movie can actually be. Not that I recommend you to do it. There are so many clichés, mistakes (and all the other negative things that you can imagine), which is simply to make you cry. To start with the first technical, there are many misconceptions about the aircraft. I will not list them here, but will mention only the coloring of the plane. They have not even been able to show in a fictional airline airliner colors, but instead use 747 painted in the original Boeing livery. Too bad. The plot is silly and has been made many times before, only much, much better. There are so many funny moments here that I lost track of it very early. In addition, I was on the side of the bad guys in the movies all the time, because the good guys are so stupid. "Ordered" should without doubt be you choice about it, even -movies «Turbulence" is better. In fact, any other film in the world better than this.
