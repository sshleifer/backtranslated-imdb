I am basing this on my observations of the episode I saw last night (9/27/06). I do not think I'll look again. Action was completely wooden, the plot is predictable, the ending is absolutely unreal - I mean, who would believe the opinion of 30 million dollars for the death of a recovering addict with terminal cancer? Lead actor (Victor Garber), seemed so uncomfortable, almost awkward in his role - perhaps he realized how bad the handwriting was !! I fully understand that the drama offered this season is quite poor, but they certainly can find the best writers. Maybe they outsource writing in India or China !! I bet we will not see this one in the next season!
