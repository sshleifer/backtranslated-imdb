This is not a horror film, but a boring sex movie. Very bad film to avoid any serious horror fan. No story, disastrous actions and annoying music. If you only watch the trailer, you will know enough ... It's a shame that such a thing is available on VHS or video while there are so many good films there. If you like a vampire to try Hammer Productions or Italian Gothic by Mario Bova and Margherita instead. They are masterpieces, if you compare it with this waste. Rating = even "1" is too much! And believe me, I'm not the only one with this opinion.
