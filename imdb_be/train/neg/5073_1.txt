Teaser for the palm tree trying to pass it as a kind of allegory of fairy tales with the actual value, then immediately begin to rave about the animation. I had to know what it means. <br /> <br /> The main character, Palma, is a good example of the problems of the whole film. One minute, Palme humble hero in search of themselves, following hard psychopath with an unhealthy fixation on the girl he had once taken care of. <br /> <br /> Like all the characters in the film, Palma poorly defined. You do not communicate with the characters at all, although the Shatt bought a pair of fan-girls. It seems that the writer was more interested in cramming all the drama and complexity he could in this movie than actually studying the motivation and personality of his characters. <br /> <br /> The new, useless storylines were introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the film. Writer seriously need to streamline its history. Maybe he's trying to be an epic, but it was just too much information for a two-hour movie. However, I can not help but wonder if the story with so many sizes and characters would be better suited for a TV series or graphic novel. <br /> <br /> In the last five minutes of the film, I just could not bear the distinct lack of quality, more and began to laugh as flimsy characters, relationships, and the whole story was. I touched my companion, and he also began to crack up as a young man sitting behind us. We tried so hard to control myself, but we just could not take the terrible quality of the film. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, the animation is incredible and the audience will feel admiring beautiful backgrounds and character designs magic. Animation almost takes you; if you do not care about the characters, it tells you how to feel.
