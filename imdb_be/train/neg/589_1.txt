To be honest, I went to see the movie, but not because of the actors, but not because of the story, but because it was rated 17 here in Luxembourg and the film must be very rigid or pornographic to be put in this category. Believe me, the future film freak, I've seen quite a lot of hard films in my life (Ichi the killer, irreversible, Hellraiser), but this film was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is just stupid, directing terrible, the acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of the so-called "horror soundtracks." There is not one aspect of intellectual film, and some scenes are really hard to stand. (Especially the scene where you see the embryos with glasses and hearing a child crying - badly). I can not understand why the film was rated 16 in Germany, where usually the criteria for a real hard (eg, kill-bill (brutal, but he made fun of himself and had great hints of Asian cinema and also the wonderful directing), even a movie as a state of grace is estimated 18). No one can call it a horror film, because in fact it was more about showing gore than about scaring the public (showing face «Creep», located in the middle of the film was very bad decision); for me (pardon the expression) is the only one mad filmmaker living out their fantasies disturbing. In some scenes you see the violence that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot and did not explain anything. The plot has holes and flaws, the dialogue is boring, to be honest, I can not name a single positive aspect of the film for the British and Scottish accent, but. <br /> <br /> If I say something, I would ban the movie theaters, I fully understand why none of the major manufacturing companies did not invest their money in this shit. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to get some feedback on my topic, and I would be happy to discuss one or another subject. <br /> <br /> «Livin 'the dream of a child, Livin' the dream 'David Aames
