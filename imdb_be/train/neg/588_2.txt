I am compelled to write a review of this IMAX feature as a means of warning others to save money. Almost every episode, Desmond Morris, The Human Animal "or David Suzuki" nature of things "could have defeated the material presented. Not only that the director does not use IMAX incredible 65 to 70 mm film and a giant presentation screen, everything on the screen is very impressive, considering the availability of programs mentioned earlier. Viewers are introduced to Sly pregnant woman, her husband, Buster, and their niece and nephew. we're going after them for endless more than forty minutes, how they eat, then, listen to music, etc. Although we got access to scenes inside stravav lnaga tract of humans and learn about the natural diving infant reflexes, do we really know anything more than the majority of graduates of primary school? Should we even remotely entertained transatlantic Heather? we take care? Avoid this film at all costs. If you want to see a feature IMAX I offer beautifully photographed "India: Kingdom of the Tiger" or technically exciting «Space Station 3D». Trust me.
