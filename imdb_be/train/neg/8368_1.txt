When watching the little guy, you will spend his time trying to find it a lot of plot holes. And that's not a good sign, because this movie must be a comedy! Your have to laugh at him !! But will it? Probably not. <br /> <br /> The main problem is its small person and the concept is too ridiculous to take (even cartoonish comedy), so when a loud, labored and died over the top jokes, they do all the thing seems to be in ten times sillier than it already is. <br /> <br /> "But his comedy," some of you may scream. That is true, but he can not be an excuse for such a stupid plot.I means stop thinking about it, if you saw a child with adult MANS Lyceum, were not you a little suspicious? And if Calvin wanted to hide the diamond is so bad, why did not he put it in a nearby shelf, instead of casual woman hand bag? And as a skilled physician does not recognize that Calvin adult? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> Â«This is not about the story, about his laughter," you may cry. Well Heres the thing to see there is almost no laughs at the little man, and just do a dumb ass story more and more highlighted. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see brother Wayans comedy faith story hanging, stick to white chicks, because at least there were a few decent laughs.What if you stay away from the little man.
