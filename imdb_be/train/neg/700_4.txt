I'm not looking for quality; I'm just trying to get through the 74 known video nasty things that have been banned in the UK. This one originally was banned and re-released in 2001, a total of 10 seconds to cut. <br /> <br /> Some college kids spend their Christmas holidays are preparing to upgrade the hostel. There are some terrible characters lurking about, along with their four children. Which of these is the slasher? The actual murder is not very bloody, so this video nastie not so disgusting. There is a need flashing boobies, but it has nothing to do with college kids. <br /> <br /> I was a suspect very quickly, and I was right. Maybe I've seen too many of them. End turn was smart; I have to give credit to the writers of this little originality.
