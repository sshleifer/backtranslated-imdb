A "friend", apparently with no taste, no class, invited me to take a look at the work of Ron Atkins. If this is representative of his work, I never want to see anything else from him. This is an amateur, self-indulgent, criminally bad and self-indulgent rubbish. "The Whore ManglerÂ» in the title is the anger of a low-budget film maker who kills a bunch of whores. There is little nudity and some erection, but none of the elements could not save it from the hangman's loop. The lighting is appalling, windy dialog and basically screamed and direction ignorant. I saw DOCO on American filmmakers operation during the recent Fangoria convention. Atkins was one of those signs. He said that there was something important about my work, but after watching this, I do not see any imports at all. There's no style, either, and the terrible effects of video (solarization) only reinforce dilettantism. Even not so bad, it's fun. Avoid.
