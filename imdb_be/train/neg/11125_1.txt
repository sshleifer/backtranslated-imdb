Hey, look, deal with it, there are much better portraits adversity black America than it is. Although I think that this story is weak, my criticism is focused on the poor performance of the story, which I mentioned, strikes. <br /> <br /> This was done in the mid-80s, and it's horrible music / evaluation department. It's funny to see how the latter-day Oprah crack whore type. <br /> <br /> The scene where Elizabeth McGovern Bigger food in the oven. Pure cinema classics. Firstly, I do not care how you are drunk, you will react to 1200F degrees flame (no matter how bad your actions). But they are really milking this scene ... it was funny. I'll tell you what, though, I had great pleasure in Elizabeth McGovern burn in a simulated death; it annoys me.
