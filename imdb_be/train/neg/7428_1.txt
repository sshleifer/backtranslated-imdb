As usual, on the IMDb, walking majority instead of the "weighted average" is much more significant entertainment value of the film. In this case, the majority gives him a "one". They are right! To start my review, I am the first to admit that I'm clueless why this movie is called «Alien Intruder». It does involve space and even "foreign" (I guess), but there is no rhyme or reason (at all) for anything in the long run, at least, no actual plot basis or authorization, I can do anywhere. <, Br /> <br /> There are a lot of scenes that are so brutal (for both lines, deadlines, and as they say), far exceeding the strange feeling that you get, if you look like really bad movies. I do not have any idea about that part near the beginning when the electronic Bugs Bunny, it seems to be talking about something. <br /> <br /> «plot» only includes a region of space known as the G-Spot, I'm sorry, do G-Sector ... and virtual reality program is infected with some strange (?) virus. I think this is strange, since the image of otherwise normal Ariel looks like a photographic negative. <br /> <br /> For most of the film, we see people getting shot with space weapons, drop out of the attic, and the seemingly endless, pointless close shots, "Where is Ariel?" "I can not find Ariel" (meaningless because most of the other staff including interaction with Ariel, anyway - no matter) on a computer monitor. Skyler commander (Billy Dee), sitting and watching every fantasy VR program convicts in hopes of finding the virus is an alien and to become one with it ... ??? Or, maybe I missed something ... <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams took several courses on "how to act in desperation," to shoot this. We know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers down his face and looking sad. <br /> <br /> Joining scene with nose one ship, which went to the rear of the other was half-oars in the least, and provided for a laugh, in the annex to the early scenes where we see several shots of the ship, as it simply rotates in a circle, looking much like Lego experiment gone awry. <br /> <br /> it seems everyone dies in this movie, so why bother? Even women VR kill, as if it should mean anything (especially since everyone else die anyway) ... defiantly. <br /> <br /> Because of the money I save on groceries, I will not RANT about the desire to return the money that I paid for this DVD. Dollar that I saved on the bag of vanilla wafers paid time this reviewer. <br /> <br /> I just add that the story itself, at least as a novel, and added more detail, can probably be very interesting to the right of the author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
