If you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3K, Attack of the giant leeches, or Pinata Island Survival, this film may be for you. <br /> <br /> I live in Nashville, and I do not even know the existence of this film until the day before its release, if an advertising campaign panicked and nitric Music Row with dozens of flyers and billboards. He barely lasted two weeks in theaters anyway. <br /> <br /> bad play, bad writing and bad production only begin to describe the uneasiness of the film. Firstly, the names a little more: After Price, Angel, and Dixie? Eesh. <br /> <br /> inconveniently slow delivery Toby lines makes one wonder that the production assistant stayed holding cribs from the camera. Angel character quickly jumps out of her cities, raincoats ways to cowherd, slipping in southern slang in two days at the ranch. Her wardrobe is from the chic women's version of Toby's - in fact, in the final scene, their clothes are identical, which makes one wonder when the assistant cabinet called sick <br /> <br /> Audio contradictory. - perhaps the most notable example, if Toby decides to go for a swim, and his voice suddenly it seems that he shouts at the gym. <br /> <br /> There is never enough explanation or character development miss what is happening on the screen. Replays, anger, moodiness and grimaces best describes the interpretation and direction of a terrible script. <br /> <br /> This film is best enjoyed after drinking a couple of alcoholic drinks and the company of their friends witty actors. But this is not saying much.
