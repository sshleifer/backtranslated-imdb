Well first, this film seemed pretty good, even if it's moving pretty quickly, and even if they only had a budget of $ 60,000 that was good, but if you find your sister dead in the lake and find out who could have killed her, why would you I chase it around and pull a gun on him only one bullet and spend it, and end up running all the backward and get yourself killed him? Plus, after you have found his sister dead in the lake and found the key and found out who did it, why do not you tell you that the key to the police, I think you did it? And at the end of the film when it is acting as her sister, who was a waitress, and she was talking to the bad guy, it must MET it somewhere and wrote it down, saying that she had died, and that was for her "proof". I do not know that I was not happy with the ending. This film could have been a much better if it lasted longer, and the effect was better, and if the ending is entirely suck so bad! Do not waste your money on this film, because if you write a review here, too, and will not be happy.
