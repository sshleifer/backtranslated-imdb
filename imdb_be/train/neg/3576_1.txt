Even when I saw this film as a teenager, I wondered how ironic it is that Pia Zadora starred in a film about the artist, who slept her way to the top. How beautiful and sexy as Ms. Zadora, even she could not keep this sorry ass excuse for a movie from the tanks. Not even her photo shoot for the Penthouse, where "The Lonely Lady" has been appointed "back in the day," could keep this movie from the tanks. The only thing that could save this movie? It is a different scenario. Give this a miss.
