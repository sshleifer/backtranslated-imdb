I really do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw him in the camp, and we are not raving about it, we were laughing at him. Of course, some of the contact, but the acting is terrible, the consequences are terrible, and all the general idea of ​​the film terrible (I know now that it was based on a book I have not read, but I hope that this book was better than this because that, to be honest, I thought that this film was a very bad and boring). As I said, I went to him with a bunch of people from the camp, and we were glad to be there, plus I got caffeinated beverage, but, nevertheless, I was struggling not to sleep. The only thing that kept me (except my fear of being embarrassed when I woke up) were shots that were absolutely meaningless as well. I just really do not like.
