Filmfour going to have to do better than this little snot of the film, when they are going to get the right kind of reputation for himself. <br /> <br /> This film is set in Glasgow (although only a few minor characters have anything approaching a Scottish accent). The room, the people who never lives to nowhere, all of which are found in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning, as they have night jobs, could make for a really fun, insightful, Shifty, sectarian film. Instead, we have a group of self-obsessed saddos and a plot that was so done in pieces, I'm surprised that it was not forbidden. X and Y are friends. X sleeping with Z. Y sleeping with Z, as well. Oh, you figure it out. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time. Painful dialogue - it sounded like something that a group of 16-year-olds would have written for GCSE drama project. Female character was quite superfluous - just wrote as women markers in the hope that women will be persuaded to see it <br /> <br /> If you like thicko guy who laughs at beer commercials and can. can usually be found wandering around in packs screaming on Saturdays nondescript urban centers, then you will love this film and find it "right LaffÂ». All the rest, run, do not walk away from this sad little mismatch. <br /> <br /> And one more question, when the group left the "boring" seaside town (Saltcoats by the way, even though they changed their name to the film), to return to Glasgow, why they do it with the help of road services Forton Lancaster located in England?
