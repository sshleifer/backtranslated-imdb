This is one of those movies that make you think: will the Hulk "Real American" Hogan did the same thing? Frankly, I do not think so, and he was right. I'm Italian, I can not be proud of his country, for many reasons, but I would not rowing another team (French, for example), just because I'm in love with Juliette Binoche. In addition, the protagonist does not fall in love with the desire of the British girl at the end of the film, but with a countrywoman, why rowing against Yale. As for the action, then, well, all the players are very bad. And then, you know, I hate that "Dead Poets Society" atmosphere. In fact, this is one film that I hate.
