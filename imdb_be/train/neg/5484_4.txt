This film is about a family trying to get used to the mother / wife's death, he moved to Genoa, Italy. <br /> <br /> The plot «Genova» sounds promising, but unfortunately, it is empty and without focus. The film consists of a collection of scenes depicting the everyday life of the family, such as swimming, taking piano lessons or cooking eggs. Most of these scenes are redundant and tedious, it is not able to attract the audience emotionally. The ending is very frustrating, because it is not a spectacular, moving and emotional. I can confidently say that I am disappointed and sad «Genova» only good thing about the film is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genova. «Genova» can serve as an extended advertising tourism for the city, but did not like the film, which will have.
