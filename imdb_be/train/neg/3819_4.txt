T.Z. Fasting, a college professor, receives a false letter in which he had inherited $ 750,000 from the funds now, he removes all his savings in the amount of $ 4000, and decides to finally go out and live. After his luggage is sent on a train to Chicago, he meets a traveling vaudeville troupe, and decides whether or not good enough for him to put on a show on Broadway. Night show, poor Professor Post has to hide from his creditors, to resolve the relationship between disaster and friend Panza & Babenko diva Eleanor, and continues to make sure that the show must go on. After viewing many dumb stones Keaton is a pain to sit through, but I felt it could have been much worse. Supporting cast Durante, Todd, and Selwyn come off quite annoying at times, but still cute. Previous Toler Charlie Chan is good but the show was the director. 90% of the script is poorly written as MGM trying to pass this off as a poor man Marx Bros. film, where many of the gags fall flat from the beginning. Assembled with alcohol problems Keaton at the time, this film is just a sad moment in the life of Buster. 3 Reyting-.
