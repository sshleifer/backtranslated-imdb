The move was on TV last night. I think it is just a filler, as it is sucked bad! The film is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way. (Not bad tits and ass, though). But the story is too ridiculous for words. "Wolf," if this is what you can call it hardly shows to fully preserve their teeth. If it is fully in sight, you can clearly see that they had some intern working at CGI, because the wolf is running, how it works in a treadmill, and CGI fur looks like it was wax all the shiny :) <br /> <br /> film full of gore and blood, and you can easily identify who is going to kill / slashed / eaten there. Even if you like this sort of splatter movies you'll be disappointed, they are not doing a good job of that. <br /> <br /> Nha even get me started on the actors ... It is banal lines and the girls scream at all about every 5 seconds. But then again, if someone asked me to do bad acts just give me a few dollars, hey, where do I sign? <br /> <br /> In general, sad and funny horror.
