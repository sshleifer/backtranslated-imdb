Â«Sundown: The Vampire in retreat" is rubbish.The terrible action, the atmosphere does not exist, and uninteresting.The characters only scary thing about this part of the scale is that most people gave him 10 IMDb is really horrifying. no blood, entirely unknown, no violence, nothing.Bruce Campbell ( "the Evil Dead", "Intruder") is completely wasted, the supporting cast is also terrible.Yes, some people may like this picture, especially mainstream society, but malicious supporters horror or Gore-hounds will not like this piece crap.Personally I hate comedy horror, I prefer looking serious horror movies like "Cannibal Holocaust" or "The Last House on the Left" .In my opinion, the real horror film to be scary, too bloody and unsettling, without the silly humor, which usually kills the entire concept.This one is not terrible, not the mountains, it's not even funny, like comedy, so do not waste your precious time.
