This film is, without correction, this thing, this abomination from the scorching bottomless pit of hell was killed before he even left the head writer. I could not think of enough adjectives to describe this film. But let's try anyway. Awful, bad, sick, tasteless, shit, vomit inducing, gut wrenching bad, nasty, nasty, putrid, there just are not enough words in the English language! "Land" includes a serial murderer who becomes a snowman. Do not ask how, it does not matter. Snowman killer running around killing people. How, you may ask, can a snowman to kill someone? The tasteless way that makes you want to remove your eyes, if only you do not have to endure that foam snowman more. Ways that make you want to fill your ears with hot wax, so you no longer have to endure his snow puns. Do not watch this movie! Destroy it on sight! For the sake of your soul not to look!
