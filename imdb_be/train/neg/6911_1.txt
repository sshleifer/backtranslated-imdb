What a huge pile of manure. Shot on video (trash camcorder, digital) pile of garbage. This is without a doubt the most stupid thing ever done. The fact that this shit was actually released a fully asanine. Everyone who sees it will become dumber for having watched it. Seriously. I felt that he had killed a few brain cells after I watched this garbage. Positive reviews of this shit $$ obviously made "film director" (and I use that term very little) himself and / or his family and friend, because there is no normal human protein intelligence will be honest, as this waste of life. Trust me, stay away from that video. You'll thank me for it. Avoid it like herpes.
