I'm not quite sure how to even begin to describe how bad this film. I like bad movies, because they are often the most entertaining. I love the bad special effects, bad acting, bad music, and inept direction. Except for the music (which was better than I expected), this film has all these qualities. <br /> <br /> The special effects were surprisingly bad. The worst thing I have seen since my Nintendo 64. Some of the scenes to watch for include Thunderchild, woman, being crushed by a mechanical foot, Big Ben scene, a train wreck ... Wow, there are so many bad effects! On the positive side, though, some of the scenes of alien walkers well done. <br /> <br /> The action was about as bad as it could be, being based directly on the book H.G. Wells. For being such a good raw material, it is almost as if the actors were trying to be so on top, how to make it funny. And then there's mustache ... only the most distracting part of the hair on the face, that I have seen in a long time. Of course, only half of the film contains a valid. The rest of the characters walk aimlessly and poorly rendered effects shots. <br /> <br /> To say that Timothy Hines is unsuitable director will be unfair to inept director. With the use of different color filters between shots for no particular reason, the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside the scene, poor green screening, it is strange to me how this man ever got approval to direct the film. I had no idea that it was possible to turn a brilliant book in this bad movie. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Bravo. <br /> <br /> My advice for those who plan to see the movie to do something that I: have a few friends who love bad films more drinking, playing poker, watching it, keep drinking and, maybe you'll make it all the way through. This makes for a great bad movie, so much fun and laugh yourself silly with this scourge.
