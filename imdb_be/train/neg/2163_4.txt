Shame really - I very rarely watch a movie, and I left feeling frustrated at the end. I've seen quite a lot of devices Ira Levin - "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Stepford Wives" - and enjoyed both of them, but it just does not appeal to me <br /> <br /> When I read. plot outline - awards playwright (Michael Caine) decides to kill one of his former students (Christopher Reeve) and became his screenplay for his own success - I was thrilled. I love thrillers, Michael Caine is a good actor, a good director Sidney Lumet and Ira Levin's work is usually good. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil it for those who have not seen it yet, but I Â«D said, there are plenty of twists and turns. Therefore, many of its kind of hard to explain the storyline of the film in detail, not letting him. I enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes before turning began to occur, and at that moment my interest and pleasure began to fade. Although I have to give credit for Lumet very fun final, which made me laugh out loud <br /> <br /> Basic plaster. - Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - were all brilliant in their roles, although obviously a fake Russian accent Worth got on my nerves a little (nothing personal Irene, I think that fake accent any actor would irritate me). Not sure if Cannon character was supposed to be annoyingly funny, but Diane was able to annoy and amuse. - at the same time <br /> <br /> Anyone reading this - I do not want you to watch this postponement because of my views - give it a chance, you might like it, you can not. It's all about opinion.
