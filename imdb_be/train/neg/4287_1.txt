I gave Timecop perfect 10, I gave it 1 <br /> <br /> This story is very sad, and he has only little to do with the original TimeCop. Much of TimeCop been written off, and they put in a new stupid things instead. This story takes place in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason is now more dangerous timetraveling: confused: <br /> <br /> And the scene there is nothing to be happy, and most of them are not only the first one ... great ... and there is not a lot of scenes at all, and they are all pretty short <br /> <br /> at some point in the story, the main character travels in time about 5 times within a few minutes ... do not wait, do not do that twice ... <br /> <br /> In short, do not waste your time watching this movie, it's not worth it
