OK, this movie was terrible premise. Be serious for a movie they had just gone through an apocalyptic war as long as they have the money to buy a huge robot and pit them against each other. Each country decides instead to invest in the reconstruction of their country, they would prefer to fight with robots, no one could afford. The best idea, can count on our most inopportune resource jockeys to fight our battles. <br /> <br /> All told, about the director than of him. He makes a good movie, he makes a bad movie. There's no reason to give the movie some credit just because of the director, maybe he slept? I thoroughly enjoyed this film, because it was so cheesy and ridiculous, I had to laugh. I actually had a good time watching it, good for cowboy teacher who is the killer, except for (believe me, no one will see this guy as a murderer, so it's a surprise, but lame) What training exercises Jungle Jim in any case. I was sad to see MST3K did not do it. I give the rating of two stars, however, because nothing can be as bad as «Manos the hands of fate.» <br /> <br /> The budget does not matter, either, I saw a lot of smart films that had nothing to budgets as a cube. The storyline was not even true, and I've seen better acting in school plays. Surly they could afford any of the eleven secondary school games. <br /> <br /> In any case, pick it up, it's fun to watch a movie.
