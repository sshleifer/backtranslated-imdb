I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot has reminded me of the Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives / stories that come together at the end, but Magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie, and I was lost. I was almost expelled him right then and there, but I felt that I should not hang in there until the end, little did I know that it would be more torturous 1 1/2 hours. Thank God, I rented, instead of seeing it in the theater. I almost cried out in despair after 2 hours. The biggest hit in the pants was the ending scene of the frog. My DVD-player still has not forgiven me, and I do not blame him one bit. It was a unique movie, but a bad, boring, and pointless film.
