Another option, and improvisation on the well-known and beloved children's tale, La Bete (1975) aka The Beast is trying to present (very graphic, and that may be offensive and disturbing, but it is actually quite silly and funny way) what actually happened between beauty and the beast? I'm surprised a lot of reviews and comments that seem to look too deeply into this film. I would not go so far as saying that this is a serious and dark study of issues such as sexual frustration, longing, performance or satirical criticism of the Catholic religion. I would not even call it a horror-erotic film. Rather, it is a parody of all genres it touches or remembers, even if he has some shocking moments in all departments that are sure to remain in your memories. <br /> <br /> For a long (too long) scenes between an aristocratic young woman and supposedly monstrous, but the most ridiculous I have ever seen in a movie being with exactly impressive ... well, anatomy, installed on the clavichord music by Scarlatti and hysterical. My husband and I both laughed out loud in the exaggeration of the meeting details. The moral of the scene - beauty can and defeat the monster. Question - who is the target audience for the film? For an erotic image that's too wordy; for a feature film - it has received too many amazing scenes degree, and I would say that the abrupt ending. The IMO, the film maker does not mean that this is a serious drama. As a parody of art house / horror / erotica, it's funny, and of course the original. Have a good laugh and try not to look for some deeper meaning. This story is interesting Beauty and the lustful animals, of course, is not recommended for co-viewing with their children. Scene discovery that may shock the unprepared viewer much more than the infamous scene of zoophilia can be successfully used on the Discovery Channel in the program as "In the animal world - marital habits and rituals of horses."
