Quite the most boring nonsense I've seen in a long time. The plot was full of unnecessary, and the action was the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> To make it worse, angles, which made me feel sick were used, incidental music was awful and drowned dialogue (perhaps not a bad thing at that time), and shots from San Francisco, looked as if they were stolen directly from a commercial city tourist board. <br /> <br /> Yes, and the obligatory sex scene was not even half well done. Better lighting in the next time, please.
