I could not help thinking behind the mask: the growth of Leslie Vernon (massively more strange film) while watching it because of a realistic feel to it, as well as more innovative ideas. it can be a great film. acting ... by some of the actors well. on the other ... it's absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> That aside the idea of ​​big and large format. story is pretty good as well, although it is often affected by large shocks logical mind. <br /> <br /> Nevermind, that although is not it? It is a horror film in the end. <br /> <br /> I really want to see this remade ... I really want to be a fantastic film that he wants to be. <br /> <br /> However, (and you can not blame the minds behind the film to do so), then, obviously, it is built on a shoe string budget. and FX really hurt the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> great film. ... if you had to exchange for some better action and a little better FX. <br /> <br /> the one who wrote it to keep going, though, here's a great idea.
