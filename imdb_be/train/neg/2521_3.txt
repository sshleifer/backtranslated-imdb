There are a number of problems associated with this film, but the fact that he was trying to do too much too little. The basic story is pretty good, but the money just was not there to do the story justice. A non-existent budget actually killed the movie. Stuart Gordon (author / director) are already writing credit for "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," which was a box office hit. However, this film had a serious cash support from Disney. Frankly, this is a good example of how not to make a film. If he had waited a few years, the technology would be made cheaper to make many of the effects. (Not to mention he could find a company with the money.)
