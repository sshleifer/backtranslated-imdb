Well, I do not think the picture is just as bad as most of the reviews make it out to be. ,, But there is no doubt that he has a problem. <br /> <br /> In general, the problems in the script. There's a story - but not so much history, and certainly not one that someone might call a plausible; he draws any number of strange shyly and / or stereotypical characters, lines, points, what u you, to the end, he just has not yet been added to many in the department. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I could not care less about all that "social evil" Farnsworth may be trying to solve; will always be a sector of the population is ready to do anything to cut their brains, even if it requires running around trying to steal the corn fields, ammonia, or what are those idiots doing. So, like a movie, you will not find me calling "Iowa", "important". But, to the stylistic level, the picture is more than interesting, and some of the options Farnsworth in showing the wig-out state A MET-Head beautiful, funny, disturbing and - yes, I mean, it's -. Inspired <br /> <br /> in the current uneven, but it just may be the victim of the above praised stylistic going. Look, Ryazanov Arquette thin actress - "What happened?", But it is not very good here, because fastidious viewer really have to ask, it is strange that Diana Foster manages the simplicity and elegance that so few other actors can come anywhere near. For example, I might seriously consider what Farnsworth explanation can provide a top-turn, Michael T. Weiss as a probation officer, but I doubt that I ever buy it; It just does not work. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is the most lively and at that moment, when I saw John Savage is in years. So figure <br /> <br /> It's a job that hurts but does not promise - and that's fine. nor Farnsworth, nor anyone else is not required to make films. Thus, whether or not there Farnsworth another film it remains to be seen, but if it does, it seems quite likely that it will not be bland smear. In an era when people plan their lives around the last batch of «American Idol», perhaps we could afford, and do not despise, Farnsworth legitimate and undoubtedly flawed film. <br /> <br /> Moreover, perhaps we could welcome, do not scold, his energetic and sometimes blissfully special representation.
