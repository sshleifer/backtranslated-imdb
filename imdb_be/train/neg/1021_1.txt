The film started off strong, LL Cool J (Deed) as a secret police officer, partner Sgt. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott from practice, perhaps as a miscast bad guy?) Commits a robbery and murder. The case refuses to kill a drug dealer who establishes conflict dirty cop with a conscience. Other big names (Freeman, Spacey, etc.) are well cast, and the film shows promise. <br /> <br /> The film starts to fall short once introduced Justin Timberlake (Pollack). Given a chance to make a good movie that people may see a few times, or one that teenage girls will go and see once because Timberlake, I would choose the former. Even talented actors have to work hard on his craft; Timberlake NOT talented, and no amount of hard work could not save him. I would have thought that he would put on the best show, given the fact that he is acting talent for many years. All that he did in the movie was not convincing. <br /> <br /> Just because the singer has sold millions of records and sells stadiums, it does not automatically translate that they can operate successfully in feature films. Even hard-core supporters of N'Sync can not ignore the obvious lack of acting talent. <br /> <br /> This side has several holes scene, such as a sudden ability sniper Pollack and operation lethal warehouse equipment. This movie was so promising. Very disappointing.
