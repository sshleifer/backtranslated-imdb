I wanted to like this movie. How could I not love him? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; all icons in their own way. However, the train wreck that was Suzy Parker ruined the whole experience for me. Its effect was so horrible that I sat there with my jaw hanging open, not believing his eyes or ears. I could barely make it through a single view, this is disgusting it is in this. <br /> <br /> Cary? Gorgeous and beautiful dramatic form. Jane? Beautiful, endearing, and obviously with the ball. The supporting cast does well, and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its stunning, retro elegance. <br /> <br /> Then you see Suzy Parker tries to talk her line with a wooden, lifeless, dark, that simply defies belief. Who said this creature, it can act ?? Oy VEY, people.
