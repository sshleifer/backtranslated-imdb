I can not help but laugh at the people who praise this show is touching and tear-jerking. On the one hand, it is absolutely impossible that these people will have a great life after their new homes. <br /> <br /> How do these families can afford to support this new Meg-house? And what about their poor neighbors? Property tax should certainly increase after this happens. In addition, the noise will annoy me. <br /> <br /> Secondly, as excessive can make a reality show will be? It's practically the same repetitive stuff week after week. We were introduced to the long-suffering family, they repaired the house to surprise family and all flash Kleenex box. <br /> <br /> Not to mention how sad repair part. The only interesting part of the show, to see what the house looks, but even this segment is destroyed by false confessional and constant tears <br /> <br /> «Extreme Makeover: Home Edition». This show pretending to be cordial, but it falls flat. Skip this one. If you like the reality show «Survivor» is much higher and moving.
