I missed the first 10 or so minutes of the movie, but do not think to watch it from the beginning would be made no difference. I found the film very boring and was disappointed by the action. I remember Patrick Swayze and some other actors (Roy Marsden, for example) in the beautiful role, but they are all frustrated here because of a very weak script. "Kind of Solomon's Mines" ... a very short part of the film within the "min" was as exciting as watching paint dry, and I doubt that even preschool child will already mean a cover, watching the fight, "Warriors." The entire film was reminiscent of cheaper production of the American television series. Give me the Indiana Jones any day!
