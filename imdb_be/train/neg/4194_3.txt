The film was a very promising with a story about the director who loses it out of sight and the blind, who must help him. However, somewhere in the middle, it seemed like the writers did not know where to go from there. <br /> <br /> One incredible event to the next (Russia should be very small, because they collide with each other all the time), the motivation of the female protagonist understandable (for some reason it still follow him after the as they come out of the ship? why it is not trying to take a mobile phone on the boat, anyone?), side stories were completely ridiculous (it was the story of the mother and the other to be funny? and what was the story with her younger sister around?). Nevertheless, in spite of this apparent arbitrariness of the plot, the film has turned out quite predictable. <br /> <br /> the most boring that there are many opportunities. As I said, the idea of ​​the film was good, visual and accounts were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were good, too. So this could be a really good movie ... but it was not.
