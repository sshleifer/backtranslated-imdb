This film should be fun. Young Lea Thompson, a young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry OKuin. In space. But it did, it was unsightly and the characters were not the target audience. <br /> <br /> Some of the children go to space camp and accidentally launched into space one robot in them (called, respectively, doctors). Space scene, the long, repetitive (the same accident occurs twice) and either cheese or scary, depending on your point of view. Adults will be bored and cheesed with children can be scary, as a way of filmed it really leaves an eerie feeling about it <br /> <br /> There is a budding romance, but unlike the shuttle. - it never takes off, why he is in the first place is unclear, except, perhaps, to add additional tension between the characters - but it could not, if it was the idea <br /> <br /> The young Leo Thompson should be quirky and attractive, right.? I mean, "Back to the Future" is great. But no, it is annoying and kind of average. Not someone you'd like to date, have as a friend or even be regarded as a role model. Joaquin Phoenix? He's really lucky that he ever appeared in a movie this performance again. Maybe he can act as Mickey in life Cereal commercials, but he does not seem to know how to be a normal boy. He does not fit into the screen, and I do not think that we can identify with him at home. I actually would have been happier if he had never come back to Earth. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
