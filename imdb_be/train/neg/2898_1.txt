Wowwwwww, about an hour ago, I finally finished watching this horrible movie !!! I would like to turn it off during the first 10 minutes, but I decided to give him a chance, because it's just hadddd better. Or at least some of the quality to buy, as I understand it, at least, it would make you think, like a movie, or really smart, or very good shot or something ... Needless to say, it is not and I wasted about an hour and a half of my life. They were not even going to get into why it is scary because it a waste of my time to explain that this "may contain spoilersÂ» ... IMDb, you need to calm down on spoilers things and pay more attention to the fact that people who evaluate movies and comments are not paid to write good reviews or participate somehow in the movies or anything else like that. I thought it would be humorous after that terrible movie to come see hoe bad rating will be, and I was very shocked to see a fairly high ratings ... all ratings from 7-10 stars should definitely be on some completely different movie ... I'm still a big fan of IMDb, but seriously reconsider the rating process, because this movie should not be rated no higher than 3 maaaybbbeee like.
