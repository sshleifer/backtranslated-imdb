Definitely, definitely the worst film I've ever seen, no questions asked! Contradictors this opinion could be argued that this name should not be judged by the same criteria as the other, as an independent low-budget film, but c'mon already ?? amateurism and poor innovation terrible. <br /> <br /> While agreeing with everything that has been said about this film, for example, the mind numbingly weak action (if it is so bad, you take the other to go to the shooting scene, damn it), what I found most offensive it was the complete lack of common sense in the script, judging such a thing existed in the production process. It was a clear lack of respect for dialogue with the audience, the girls switched parties several times, and they seemed to be entirely show absolutely no singing any rationality or even the brain - five relatively fit girl against another small female psychopath ?? go for it, why not? <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be seen as a kind of conquest for this title is the camera is not going out of the van at any time, so that the viewer sees everything inside it. - that, like the rest of the film is a good idea, made exponentially terribly <br /> <br /> ?? and, by the way, this film is not that other, as The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other name removed from the hand-held camera ?? this is the effect, not the devil! Used wisely it can be an exciting, but in this case it is a reason for inadequate cinema.
