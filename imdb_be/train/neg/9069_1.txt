(David H. Steinberg) 's script, it seemed, initially having some real smart moments that could have made a good romantic comedy, BUT, BUT, BUT, my God! What ever happens in a way ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I'll tell you what happened. Initially it (Animal House - 1978) and (Spanking's - 1982). Despite what has been a long time, but those pioneers, the cross of the new genre: crude teen comedy. Then in the 1990s came from. After the important cases that have become a hit (repels of them I add), such as (Problem Child - 1990), (Dumb and Dumber - 1994) (The Nutty Professor - 1996), and (there Coy About Mary - one thousand nine hundred ninety-eight), which I think loafers influence, was the peak of the era of the prophet and the next era, the one and only: (American Pie - 1999), which, of course, and the incomparable icon of the genre. After that I think every comedy of this kind must be very dirty, disgusting with honors, you can admire the young people otherwise it may be out of fashion! <br /> <br /> I believe that (Slackers) was a clever plot as the first scenario, its creators got to add some real large sum of: rudeness, dirt, odd unscrupulous sex to be done - in those days, - as easy as pie! They had to fill every scene with loose elements such as masturbation, oral sex, urination, etc .. just to see whether that regime. " They are completely unnecessary elements in the story, but, of course, so they needed to make a profit, and catch the latest fashion in the creation of teen comedies. The problem is, how it has replaced any possible comedy in it. <br /> <br /> Some of its highlights species literally awful, and that, as you can see, this is the point. That's all (Jason Schwartzman) 's appearance and performance; memorably disgusting to the limit. Thus, the purpose was transformed from the fact that in the romantic comedy to do what was not done before the pure image of skins. In order to be more like horror, when you ask the time; that the reverse would happen? (Vomiting farting, .. etc.); It is the easiest combination to create a comedy in our time. <br /> <br /> However, even if you hate it, you have to love something (mainly due to the fact that the bold), for me it was a scene only in cameo Gina Gershon. Anyway, they have developed it as a whole to achieve the outrage-for-shocking, like a mischievous teenager's dream. Although most of it was next to someone else's nightmare. <br /> <br /> What made me sad that this is one of its core was a real potential for the work, not the other cheap, others silly comedy, as it finally managed to be aware as a detailed examination of theft (first 2 minutes ), so the main plot of the film (a pervert trying to reach the girl by blackmailing cool guy) on the model (the boy likes a girl, and the girl likes another boy), because other than that, there's nothing but frank schlock. She worked with the sticky material by a bunch of dirty college boys who have nothing to do but make the sweet sharpness of anything will do. The upshot, as I am sorry to say it, smiling sh * t! <br /> <br /> In his end, he said something (you can imagine!) about how it is the time and place and for the fraudster or slack to win, just like myself this comedy. It sounds good ending even for a very different best film; that could convince a review for this one as smart one .. Once! I do not need a lot to do, to understand what the creators of the film were real bums! Maybe a stupid way to be reasonable in Hollywood, but even if .. The end result was not here, at least witty every sense of the word. <br /> <br /> PS: His writer (David H. Steinberg), who wrote the story (American Pie 2), and has a home page on the IMDb, where you will find in the "More Information" section of his usual "earth keywords "that: Sex / vulgarity / crude Humor / ... They just forgot to write Urineing while showering or Baring 70 years old women!
