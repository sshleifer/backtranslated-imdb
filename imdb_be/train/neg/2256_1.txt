I admit that I saw, maybe five minutes, "Jerry Springer." I do not consider myself to be a snob, but I really think I'm above, observing that on his show. You should try to elevate themselves above that, too. <br /> <br /> I saw this film as part of the social events of the research I conducted. I was told that this movie really had little to do with himself Springer, more focused on the lives of those who will be on «Springer». Handled better, the movie could actually was a fascinating look at how miserable life of these people really are. I admit, I felt a twinge of pity for the horses (Hagan). It's all that she has in life. What a pity that she feels that she has to go on the show Jerry in order to solve this problem. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry Hagan appear in it. Have you noticed that after this film, she was mainly attributed to the «B» roles on television? I say it's about Kagan. She is very beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no doubt that it is very serious in her actions, and she is trying to play its role with great sympathy. The problem is that Kagan could not bear the scene on her own. It's just not something you need to do the lead role. Her best work will always be an angel on "Herman's Head" (a show that was not great, but his heart was in the right place), and when she was staying at "the Seinfeld", as the sister of Robert.
