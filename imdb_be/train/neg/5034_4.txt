I am very surprised to see such a high rating for this film, and the few reviews that should be positive. I saw the movie and was very disappointed. I did not find it very pleasant at all. It was slow, and does not have the entertainment value. Even the murder scene is dim, with real close-up shots generic scabies, that do not look good at all. And assumes a great twist ending really is not much, I saw it coming, and then the ending just seemed like a cliche. This movie may not get a lot of references, but not enough, it's got it's overstated. I would not recommend this movie.
