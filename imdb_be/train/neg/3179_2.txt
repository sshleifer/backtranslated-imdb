I saw this movie at the cinema by chance yesterday. I had some hopes for the film because I really like Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and the book it's based on. The film begins in the order, as it at first seems to be a good thriller. Quickly, though the film becomes a disorder with uninteresting storyline, characters that have never been specified, and no one in the audience did not take care of (as Marjoke) and a terrible editing. Dimming the movie bits are just too long, we messed up the chronology, which jumps back and forth, and a lot of scenes that simply do not add anything to the story and could easily fall out. After suffering through the story you will be treated to one of the worst endings I've seen in a very long time. It should also be noted that in the film there is a lot of sexually explicit scenes that you are likely to use when you're watching a lot of Dutch films. It is difficult to name some good things about this movie. About a third of the audience has left the theater halfway into the movie, and I have not heard a good word, after the film was completed. Avoid this movie at all costs. he really destroyed any faith I had left in the Dutch film industry.
