It sounded like a very interesting movie of the annotations. The Nazis, occult, government conspiracies. I was expecting a low budget version of Nazi DaVinci Code or a boy from Brazil or even shock waves. Instead, you get something entirely different, more psychological, more something like that from David Lynch. It was actually a plus. But, as the story is told just awful. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the casting. Andrienne Barbie character starts moving from being somewhat timid and afraid. It just does not do it well, even at her age, although she certainly tried. Actor for the role of the son, apparently, thought it was a comedy. Most of the other actors, too, seemed to think that it is old-fashioned film, or at least acted like this, and not just be quirky. The only thing that I thought I did very well was a daughter, Siri Baruc. <br /> <br /> Another big part of the Shagan. It starts very slowly. So slowly you might be tempted to turn it off. But then it becomes compelling for a while, when you get to the suicide of his daughter and after. But soon after that, it all gets messy mixture. Some of this purpose, but a lot of it was just too complicated, monotonous and poorly focused. <br /> <br /> The real problem, it's just not enjoyable film to watch. This is slow, dull, none of the characters are not likeable. Overspending images and sets. Some of the movies that you can see the characters get tortured. In this case, it is the viewer who does. He has a few terrible moments, especially the terrible Nazi paintings and loans, but the rest of the film is basically just tiring.
