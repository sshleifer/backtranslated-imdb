It is strange to see how Nikhil Advani manages to attract people to the theater until the day of release. I mean ..... look at the actors here, promoting a great enough good songs and trailers well. This makes the total volume of the house on the first day, but it is only when people go and see a movie they understand that there is no way their money back. The house is full the first day, the film comes out next week. <br /> <br /> This film, inspired by the «Love Actually» is what they say, we could not process the entire cast is good. They tried to put in a big star, but ended up not even possible to find even an average performance of all. Stories are hollow and cheese, so that the audience can not connect with any of them. This is a great disappointment for all those who love the big stars, or for that matter Nikhil Advani after the great success of "Kal Ho Naa Ho".
