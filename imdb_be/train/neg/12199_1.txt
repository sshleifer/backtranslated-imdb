-me and my sister to watch this movie right now. we laugh deaf. can imagine, on the lids have a nomination for an Oscar ?? --first, music mix has about 4-5 different styles of music ... and the music is not synchronized with the frame and the character moves ... <br /> <br /> --- protagonist Sylvester entirely fit in there. it looks like a Mexican Tarzan <br /> <br /> ---- all Russian soldiers, but not Russian face :-) ----- OK, highlights :. 1. Aircraft referred to in the charter is painted black ... <br /> <br /> 2. that idea when Rambo to go to jump from the plane, but he was stuck? Rope mixture 3. Girl? best scene, when she dies. It means a lot to him. he knows it for centuries? he shouts to her ... My God Samurai 4. How many shots did he get? his arrow bag is always full of arrows? I did not see the scene where he is collecting them - but I saw the scene where the needle stays in the solder head in Vietnam - which is very important 5. How many missiles helicopter can hold ??? (Real) I saw 4 but Rambos beat about 20 of them. <br /> <br /> 6. main part. that the Russian army special helicopters in Vietnam do ????????? after the war? 7. The first scene, when he come into the camp in Vietnam ... his first idea was to make the shelter standing on a tree in an open space, "Wow, what a concept, than again: 1. with a knife and can cut iron wire? It can only be done in Vietnam? 2. Mortar - Use to hit a running one? Oh my god, U Americans really need to know about guns! to know how much it is needed to calibrate a mortar (I think that the writer was watching a movie in a much since the Second World War)
