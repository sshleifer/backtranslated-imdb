I do not understand this. The film obviously has a pretty good budget. It has a very good cinema. He has a pleasant walks, good editing and a pretty good director, too. Then why is he Why did not they hire someone to do the final rewrite of the script, so that there would not be so damn cheese and why it is why they hire such a lousy actor, who can not act their way out of a paper bag? This movie might be good. In most cases, it looks good and feels good, but in the end, you realize that the movie was not good. <br /> <br /> So I would say that it is a good product, but a bad movie. Too bad really. <br /> <br /> And the eel? Come one, actually!
