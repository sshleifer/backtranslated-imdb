I would probably give 6 or 7 in the propaganda film, because it shows, when and how propaganda film becomes successful. If there are people who are watching this piece and think "well, then the Jews have to do something to be treated the way they were treated in WW2", the film is very tricky to hide "why it" as is just as a mixture of correct and false observation of how people live. What more propaganda film can aspire? The part where the American film of the Rothschild family includes re-used very shrewdly here, for example. The question of why a Jew keeps his wealth away from the officer never asked. no one mentions the system of datkaabkladannya in a particular social strategic. <br /> <br /> In addition, the level of excitement (or disgust level) to increase the film slowly and the solution, as the end of the film suits the purpose and conduct propaganda wort. The audience will go in joy and blessings to the times that are coming up ... well done. <br /> <br /> The film is a kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perception of the audience. The film kind of history today, so do not bother much about it at Indeed. However, in this simple word ethnic degradation, cautious observer may find relevant to today's culture of hatred, violence, decivilization, and integration issues. In general, small debris.
