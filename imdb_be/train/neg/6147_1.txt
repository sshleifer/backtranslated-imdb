I really do not understand all the flattery that got this film. It even mawkish, manipulative and attempt to dodge many of the big problems - that is, the case of Nash and his commitment to have sex with men in public places. This, I believe, in the context of a commercial Hollywood film just about bearable, but what of all the praise for the performance of Russell Crowe? Man just seems to shuffle about, clutching his briefcase and wearing a hat and rough that seems to qualify as fine acting? Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems, will realize that Crowe's performance is almost a caricature. It is also very offensive. And, dare I say, only on the right side to be truly scary
