Back in the 1970s, ran WPIX "Adventures of Superman" every weekday afternoon several years. Every once in a while, we would have enjoyed if they displace the adjacent air show "Superman and the Mole man." I always look forward to these days. Watching this recently, I was surprised at how bad it really was. <br /> <br /> It was not bad because of the special effects, or lack thereof. However, Superman costume George Reeves was pretty bad, foam padding edge is used to make it look more convincing to be clearly visible. Indeed, costumes Molln Men were even worse. What should have been a fluffy coating does not make a fool of ten years, as lightning, sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric poorly adapted baggy suits were painfully obvious. But it was forgivable flaws. <br /> <br /> No, what made it bad was contrived plot device. Again and again, Superman is unable to do anything to keep the situation from worsening. Lynch mob looking creatures? Instead surround hysterical crowd or look for the creature himself, he should explain the dangers of the situation around with Lois and PR expert. Being cornered? Again, it is worth looking around and talk, but do not keep them, until they were shot. Luke Benson city instigator, shoots him? Attempted murder of any healthy person, but Superman frees man again and again to cause more problems. Superman had plenty of opportunities to stop the problem in the bud, but never used it. <br /> <br /> However, as George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters well, seemingly instantly comfortable as if they were given a better script to work.
