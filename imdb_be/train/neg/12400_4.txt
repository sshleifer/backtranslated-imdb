Matt Cordell returned from the dead the third roundabout, although I'm not sure that anybody cared at this point for the rabid fans Manica COP except. Cordell, who died last film, resurrected through the bait, and now hot on the heels of several villains who are involved in the filming of Cordell colleagues are very fond of. I missed part of it in the early '90s low-budget runaway, but it was nice to see Cordell break to rest the body count in a different, horrible ways. The problem is, the overall film is quite static, and Cordell simply not Jason or Freddy. Reduction of interest fairly quickly, even with the GM B-movie, Robert Forster, a doctor who ends up mixed with his brains. Shelf with the first film in a series of funny and scary and exciting all at the same time.
