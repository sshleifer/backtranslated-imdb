I tried to restart the movie twice. I put it in three cars to see what had happened. Change the voice of Steven Seagal in? He died during the filming and the studios have to duplicate the sound of someone who does not even look like him? Or DVD sound is destroyed? After about 10 minutes, you finally hear the real voice actor. Although for most of the movie, it sounds like the sound was recorded in a bathroom. <br /> <br /> I would be ashamed to give a copy of this film to goodwill, if I owned a copy. I take it, but I'll never do it again. I'll check this database before you rent more of his films, all of which were (more or less) good movies. Usually you know what you get when you're watching a movie Steven Seagal. I think no more.
