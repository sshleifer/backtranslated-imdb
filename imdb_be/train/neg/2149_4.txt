Well, the big money machine has done it again! Disney is very cleverly takes advantage of idiots like me who feel we need to have all the videos (good or bad) book with the nickname of Disney. Why do I continue to look forward to the "flow" that make Don Bluth on a bad day looks like Leonardo da Vinci? Cinderella 2 consists of three storylines (already a bad choice!) Not one of the most lovely creatures Disney at least deserve a linear story? Of these three, only the last one comes anywhere close to the quality of animation and storytelling that I would expect. Music disgusting and modern (ie after 2 years he will be on), and does not add anything to the story. Why does everyone have to be updated? You know, the original cartoon is still popular because of the hard times, so why not be respectful and faithful to the original songs that reflect the same style? Gee, I can not wait for the continuation of Sleeping Beauty. Instead of music based on themes by Tchaikovsky, we get inspired by the music of Britney Spears !!! So Disney, when you listen, remember that we are not all random children here. How about throwing a bone or two to the fans who have been around long enough to know the difference between craft and shit?
