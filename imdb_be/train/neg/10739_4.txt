«Iedereen Beroemd» is all that we can expect from the direct to video movie. This is a story about a man who believes that his daughter can be a star. The only thing he needs to get her on the stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters. Simple Plan, for which he must steal and do some blackmail. The problem with the film is not the main story, but how it's done. Everything has to be funny, but it is not. This is a trivial and awkward, the characters are small, and the end of the sequence is completely without climax or emotions. The last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing, but only at how useless the entire plant is.
