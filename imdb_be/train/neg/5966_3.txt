wow! I watched the trailer for this and even "He is not one for me." I watched my husband and our friend's face at the time of the trailer, and he knew that it was a "boy movie." I mean, but! a bunch of chicken barmaid that dance - another strip <br /> <br /> Then, I started to watch it, it did not look all that bad. so I kept looking. I watched it till the end. what a strange film. if anything, this chick flick. These girls have attitude. it does feel good film, and a bit of a love story. really I leave you with a good feeling. <br /> <br /> basically the story of a small town girl is doing great in the city, after passing through the usual big city c ** p. there were a few of them, it is almost a new urban legend. but it also makes you think about your life and what you have achieved. Well, I do not care. I think it is because it works in the bar scenario is very familiar, not only for me, but for many people I know. Do not trust the trailers for this - it is aimed at the fact that the men in.
