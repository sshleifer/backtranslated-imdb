It's the only movie I've seen that done Uwe Boll, I knew that he was probably the worst director ever, who always makes movies based on video games and that "the House of the Dead" is one of the IMDb Bottom 100. but I still wanted to see, because I'm a big fan of the game, and I wanted to see what movie DOE is, what makes it so bad. After watching it, I agree that it is crap, the film did not have a history. In the first 15-20 minutes, there was nothing but half-naked teenage girls with no brains are not running around (at the moment there I was wondering, are the zombie brain dead? Or a girl?) Then at night zombies sun appeared out of nowhere and started attacking people, and later the woman began to shoot at them, I mean it takes you to one place or the other every 5 minutes. Is this supposed to be a comedy? or horror? or both? Before I knew it, I had fallen asleep in the second half and woke up during the end credits, so I did not have time to see it all, it's a good thing! The film is a real insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll, please do not do more movies. Thank you!
