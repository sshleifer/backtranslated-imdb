The premise of the film was explained, and if you got this far I pretend that I'm a film critic. At the same time, as they say my own opinion about the film is quite low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike, but it goes down in his category is not as much work with DOA 2 and 3, as well as some other (much). <br /> <br /> The film seems to get a free pass because it's a movie and Takashi Takashi anything it may be wrong. It highschoolers approach to cinema. For the rest of us, we find an hour or completely annoying baby cries for no real reason (and yes, it is to take away from the film), the film's pace almost reaches rigomortis level, and acting ... well ... hmmm. <br /> <br /> If one fan of Takashi, you'll see it no peak your interest. It lacks any originality (see Endless stories) or any development of the character of the main character in the face of conflict, the other is a very superficial one. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, this is the first film Miike attributed joint letter, but it does not mean as non-current that we hope will be the identity of Miike would flow into the screen. All that we get some of the iconic shots Miike VIS Director of photography. <br /> <br /> The film had the potential to be something great. The room is not difficult with one wild. But it seemed to be run into the ground. <br /> <br /> My suggestion, if you only Miike is to go with some of the standards such as Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then the film in his work as the Blue Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Bird People of China.
