It makes you wonder how this show is still in the air. There was one couple who stayed together, married and has children, but everyone else fell apart. Which makes sense to continue it? The show may be interesting in the beginning. You see, all the girls swooning over one person, that almost all of them love instantly. It's just like in real life! Girls are beginning to take sides, bitches with each other and show their true colors (or so we think). But one person to decide which one to choose, that he thinks he can get married and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> What is real love? How can you fall for someone, if you have to pick them up? This show is incredible. You thought that online dating was bad, but people have to go on television to find love? It's not real. How could a woman be a man when he was going with a few others, which makes them? None of these questions are not answered, and finally, when the show is over, you know, there will not be a happy ending in the future. We all know the scenario all.
