I did not expect that a film as good as "Line of Fire" or an episode of "24", but it looked like this film was made for television, and did a mediocre job at best. (Good) cast can not hide the fact that the plot is too predictable and the actors had to fight (they really try their best, I think), through its line of bad script, giving them a rather flat character of any additional services. When I watched the movie, I got the feeling that I've seen most of it in one (better) movie. In it, you have car chases, big firefight, romance, plot twists, etc. etc .; This film has not. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** Once you see another woman talking in the phone with the Cuban character, you know who is behind all this, and all the hints you gave ( "you are standing too close to the president, see it from my point of view .. ") sounds silly. <br /> <br /> If it were up to me (and maybe it is good that it is not), I would have to rewrite the story so: <br /> <br /> The first lady ordering the murder of her husband, so that she was tired of writing checks to Cuba constantly.
