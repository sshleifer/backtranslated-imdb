Some of the filmmakers involved in this series made some really great movies, but they sure as hell do not show a lot of skill with this series. In particular, the letter. Well, the first season was slightly better, but the new episodes they create just stinks. I'm a big fan of horror and, in my opinion, the vast majority of these episodes total garbage. Nothing new or really interesting. Few of them are visually creative. It's just a typical Hollywood fabricated crap uninteresting, childlike, poorly planned, and in some cases thinning clown. Much like Tales from the Crypt is the only good thing in this series has been offering a large nudity! Other then that this series of blows hard. I have the impression that sometimes they hired a bunch of eighth-writing episodes. Maybe they did.
