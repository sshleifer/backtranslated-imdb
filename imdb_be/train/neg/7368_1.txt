I had the misfortune to spend 10 pounds to buy the SS's new film on DVD: Attack Force. Now I can suspend my belief watch movies like this. A pinch of salt and a few beers on a dark night on the couch, watching Shoot Em Up noisy late at night is ideal for one alpha male like me. I bought this film thinking it would be cool to see martial arts and shoot Em Up. <br /> <br /> And I'm in hell. Segal old and bloated, the plot was ridiculous even by SS standards, in addition to all of Segal's actions (such as it was to begin with) extremely difficult. So pathetic that half of his voice was dubbed over the man, who did not sound anything like him. Or SS can not function no more (a moot point) crew were so terrible in their work that they can not record the audio properly. Voice will be poured back and forth between the Whisper Mr. Segal and the person who does the voiceover for Honda advertising! <br /> <br /> The story wise is not a problem, because most of the action films work on the same premise as this is nothing new. Usually a combination of characters that are going to die terrible, as cannon fodder and stereotypical bad guys waiting to get blown away. <br /> <br /> In order to avoid this film, as you would not walk in front of moving train or H5N1 bird flu doses. <br /> <br /> underworld of garbage. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br /> It was a warning of public health.
