Actress Patty Duke wrote an insightful, funny, uncouth book about his career of the actress, her crazy quilt of love of life and her manic depressive episodes and suicidal attempts which almost divorced forever. At the same time a wealth of material obtained from (and Patti plays himself in the final act), one might think crack TV-director Gilbert Cates can bring it all together on the film, but the Â«Call Me Anna" is a pale shadow of the Duke's autobiography, for those who have not read the book, sketch story (jump forward in time) does not absorb, we never allowed to get our relationship with what is happening, and the production of low budget seems to be stunted. Actors miscast, and the significance of the Duke of themselves, finally, will not pay for itself - a false reality of the film is so thick at this point that Patty could not ensure stability in the script. It seems that the producers were quite sincere (and conscious thinking) with alarm to direct the film to the side of the final diagnosis of the Duke and mental freedom, but they left out many dramatic opportunities in the process.
