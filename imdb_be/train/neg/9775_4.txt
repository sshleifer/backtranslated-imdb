Excellent performance and direction of art is not a good movie make. This film is so dark and depressing, I could not feel absolutely no joy in the "happy" end with the participation of trade union strikes. Attempts humor involving pregnancy Lake quite catastrophic, and any film with his brother Baldwin is already a blow to him. On a positive note, Lang is still one of the great underrated actors of America, it alone almost makes it worth having the VCR. I give it 4.
