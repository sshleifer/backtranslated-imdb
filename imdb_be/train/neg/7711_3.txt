The heart of the film was not in the right place, no matter where his brain. <br /> <br /> «Attack" basically a parody a la "Airplane!" (In the two years before the fact - good to go.) That occurs when the vegetables, or in the case of fruit, the attack <br /> <br /> Through a variety of magic film (stop motion, papier-mache tomato skateboards ,. reverse shot, people smotryut offscreen tomato, people throwing a basketball sized tomatoes actors on the screen), tomatoes really attack anything they have hardwood grip. <br /> <br /> Then it's to Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies, I would not, on the side of any government, to save the day. Of course, there intervenes reporter (Taylor), who is in the worst of times, dancing and singing soldiers of the army, the Japanese scientists from the dubbed-in voices, some guy carries the parachute and the Samurai Sword ... and oh yeah, San Diego Chicken, before he made it big. <br /> <br /> jokes here is not so great. In fact, you could do better themselves after watching these. Some of inutterably bad dialogue ( "Please pass the ketchup." - not to say anything in front of tomatoes), and how "Puberty Love" comes out ... well, I can not blame shriveled tomatoes on hearing this. <br /> <br /> What's good about it? Well, I liked the theme song and the beginning of the loan, and there was a scene with four people on the phone at once, which was pretty well executed. ... that's about it. <br /> <br /> Three stars. Nha comedy «Killer», but he tries. <br /> <br /> Rock on, world.
