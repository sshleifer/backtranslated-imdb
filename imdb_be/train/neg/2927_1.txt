Somewhere there must be a list of all time worst gay films every made. One who have too long shots star camera, sitting and looking thoughtfully into space, or the one where they are concentrated unbearably long at Katz kitten eats spaghetti. This picture motion sickness is the story of a boy and a boy, and they live and love to swim, and get stuck in the caves and one of them has weakened mothers, while others have no mother, and they say, walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then break down and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then come out and have a lot of fast-forward and rewind, and there are long pensive shots of them, staring off into space, or just sit and do nothing. I think it's some kind of a useless film fabrication technique or maybe that's what the movie is so bad that they have to fill it with long, aimless arrows, because otherwise, if they had to rely on the story or stories film It will be about 14 minutes. Do not get me wrong, it's about 30 gay film I "in watching for the last 6 months, and some of them (most of them) were very formulmatic, predictable and boring, but this one is really a terrible waste of time. Best Friend still was «Beautiful Thing» So I watched it and after the very first opening shot, which was delayed and delayed, I thought. "Oh, no, it will be a creative sinny ma" But I gave it a chance and watch it and then when it was over, I threw the DVD in your shopping cart. Unfortunately, I do not like, and if you did, I'm sorry if I offend.
