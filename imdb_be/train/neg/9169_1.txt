It becomes very bad. Only halfway sacrifice the quality of the effects of thousands of bullets, which are used during the film. There are bugs everywhere context. Actions horrible but Kirk. History is full of holes, like the Grail, and the belief that the film is a video game in itself only kills the movie if he was not already dead. So all in all it is a waste of life. I would give it zero was that there was an option on the rating scale.
