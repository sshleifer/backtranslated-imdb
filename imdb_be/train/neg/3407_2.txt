Well, forget all the technical or physical inconsisties prohibited shuttle launch random quirky robot with a heart of gold. Forget disgusting special effects and poorly made one-dimensional characters. Just looking at the background of history. The very reason for the film to exist in the first place, and you will see how much this film has been piecemeal. <br /> <br /> I know that 9-year-olds who look at it is an insult to the intelligence, and just laugh at him. History horrible. Acting funny and telling her attempt to show the inconceivable. And, even worse, that the channels of cable movie SHOWING SAVE THIS! every two or three it on twice a day of days! Why would anyone in their right mind think that people would like to see this painful piece of celluloid several times, much less to see it at all? <br /> <br /> My recommendation would be to not even bother to spend the energy to see this thing. It's just not worth it.
