so all in all I found this film really strange and pointless. I know, that has won awards and stuff, but I personally do not like it too much. There was no humor or drama in it to keep you interested, just a bunch of wierdos and their jobs. some of the people are very different, which is not bad, it just did not leave a good impression on me. I was completely bored this film, no offense to my creative writing teacher. circus theme throughout the film was cool, but I do not understand, and robotics and Lion taming is definitely not my thing. green animal thing was neat, I really liked the garden a lot of beautiful flowers, but these four working connection points? it just does not make sense to me, why would someone make a movie about it. But if you're into things like this, you might enjoy it. Who am I to stand in your way. I'm just warning you about the possibility of suffering.
