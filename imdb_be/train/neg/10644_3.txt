Well, here we have another change of film roles. There were a lot worth seeing, despite the tired turning section of the floor. Nevertheless, this one is not. In previous reviews, I think I made my point about the general decline of fun for Haim movies that come the end of the 80th. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> Â«Just one of the girls' high school of the child (Corey Haim), who is trying to avoid bullies, soaking up as a girl and go to another school. He joins the cheerleading team and make friends with fellow amateur, Marie (Nicole Eggert). Obviously, he can not keep up the charade for too much longer. <br /> <br /> I thought that this movie was full of shit, and it was not even funny. But, judging by most reviews seem to be fans of Alanis Morrisette or teen sex queen, Nicole Eggert, are the only ones who would like to look at it. If you are looking for a good function Haim (or switching roles comedy), look no further than 1989. It is a point that Haim's career in the tank.
