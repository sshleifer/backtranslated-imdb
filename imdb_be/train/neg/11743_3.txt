I really can not say anything bad * and * good about this thing. His characters are cute enough, it is skillful manufacture and designed and professional looking (for this cheese monster suit except). However, he has no originality, no ideas, and you have not seen anything in the Alien, PREDATOR, Armageddon and / or OUTLAND. It's just another formula, cookie-cutter "grubby corporate drones in deep space against unbridled monster" Flicka. Pretty much a waste of time.
