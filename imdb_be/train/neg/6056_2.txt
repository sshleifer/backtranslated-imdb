Honestly, this movie is another in a series of enormous frustration ... many of these so-called "masters of horror" films terrible only from the point of view of their sub-par effects and ridiculous storylines ... aside from Ron Perlman, everyone else in this film can not act to save his life ... the shots sounded like someone playing the Bop-a microphone boom, or something, and looked completely unreal ... in general, this movie is about as bad as the house one ... only good masters Cigarette Burns, Jennifer, and possibly skin ... I do not Jedaiah, these directors can sleep at night knowing that they have destroyed the genre, some of them are used to actually understand ..
