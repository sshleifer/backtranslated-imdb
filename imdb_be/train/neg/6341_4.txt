East Palace, West Palace reminded me some detective with Frank Sinatra in the role of a police officer, and William Windom is a boy. This progressive film for China, I think, but it also perpetuates myths about femininity gay: much of Chinese myths in which men take on women's roles. The film focuses on the effeminate man who desperately wants to be in power and victims of macho. He runs the park without fear - he hopes that will be made in stationhouse officer. And what is really going on. Then he said to the officer all his life story, being subjected to mild torture: forced to squat for a period of time, handcuffed, hit. This is what a gay man wants, and, indirectly, the gay man is challenging their own image of the police as a courageous man. A story about the life of gay men (which include flashbacks) are allowed, but when he starts describing the old Chinese myths and dramas, the film becomes unbearable. This becomes a cry of pity for China's gays who only want to carry out the traditional role in Chinese society. Unfortunately, I can not tie.
