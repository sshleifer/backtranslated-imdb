This film is rewritten in the 1978 Warren Beatty film, «Heaven Can Wait», but written for standing style comedy Mr. Rock. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton (Rock) accepted his lifetime and worked a deal with God's representative, Mr. King to return to the earth as someone else. As in Beatty film; he chooses killed Charles Wellington, a wealthy white man, all because he is Sontee Jenkins (Regina King), who happens to be in the house of Wellington during the murder. The role of Mrs. Wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and ideas to transform aged white multimillionaire in Stand black comedian who is trying to achieve Sontee simply does not work. It intercuts also used to show how the Rock Wellington, and then, like a "white" Wellington, failed miserably. Improvements could be made to the original plot Beatty - which in itself is not elaborately depict the idea of ​​life after death - but of course they were not to be found in the «Down To Earth».
