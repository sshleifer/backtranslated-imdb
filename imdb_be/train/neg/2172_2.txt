The lower part of the trunk, sad, and almost unwatchable remake trips. This film is worth the exact story as a Filipino film Stryker worse today! Harmful actions, dialogue, effects, dubbing, pacing, action sequences ... The list goes on and on. Italy made literally dozens of ways warrior rip-offs in the early '80s, some good, some bad. This is the worst, of course, not a competition. Not only is the film's mood is completely dark and helpless experience sitting through this bore and a half. Was one (1) good chase sequence to the beginning of the film, and a cool shot of a man who holds the hand grenade that explodes. But everything else in this film seriously smells! For the actual post-Nuke fun to go hunt down a copy of the endgame, after the fall of New York, or Escape from the Bronx instead. They are much more enjoyable than this garbage.
