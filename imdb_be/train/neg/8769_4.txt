It was a film I was hoping that I could offer to my American friend. But after 4 attempts to see the movie to the end, I knew that I could not even watch the damn thing to close. You almost convinced that the actual war did not even last that long. Others will try to question my patriotism for his criticism of the film as it is. But flat-out, you can not go from watching Saving Private Ryan LOC. Forget about the difference in the budget of the film or the audience - those not preclude the director from the creation of intellectual cinema. The length of the film is not so bad, and the fact that it is repeated - they continue to attack the same hill, but they give different names. I thought that was a terrible terrain LOC - the hill looked like my backyard. The sequence of character development (retrospective soilders', looking in his last moments, before turning) have been throughout the film, and not just stick to one long memory. Until now, I still watch the final. But it was much better than the movie (not to much) called Border.
