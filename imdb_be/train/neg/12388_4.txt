** WARNING: Possible Spoiler ** <br /> <br /> If you can get a very unpleasant subject, the film does offer a heaping helping of provocative mannerisms melodrama. Oddly enough, this film has been copied and ripped-off several times over the years, despite the fact that it is difficult to understand any director, inspired by this trashy drama. None of the women could act Hemingway here (although Mariel has improved over the years), Anne Bancroft offers just a touch of class as a prosecutor, and Chris Sarandon is by turns pathetic and unintentionally hilarious as the smirking, insinuating bad guy with a piece. <br /> <br /> Veteran director Lamont Johnson can not make a silk purse out of this ear hardened script that is stuffed to overflowing howlingly bad dialogue and strange situations. For example, the final sequence where Margaux grabs her shotgun and chases Sarandon down after his latest shocking act appointed to be interesting, but it causes heart laughs instead. Add notoriously piercing and Spacy scores of Michel Polnareff and you have a guilty pleasure of the moment, despite the fact that you are likely to feel sloppy and the need for a hot shower after seeing it. Do not say you were not warned.
