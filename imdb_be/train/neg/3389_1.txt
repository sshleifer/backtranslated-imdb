I saw the original «Chorus Line» Broadway God knows how many times and felt the passion, despair and joy that come from living experience in the theater. Michael Bennett knew that he would have to re-submit the "Chorus" on the screen, but I could not figure out how to do it. If the person who came up with the show to a dead end - that should answer your question. There are some shows that are just made to see live - with the audience. However, Richard Attenborough fresh musical work "Ghandi" and dancing with the animals in "Doctor Doolittle" eventually direct this film, which bore almost no similarity of the stage show. Horrible songs have been added to (surprise! Surprise!) Great songs were removed or transferred to other characters (which makes no sense). Michael Douglas was incorrectly cast. People who could not dance tried to act and there was a sexual "Landers" a woman who could not sing, dance or act - I think she's just finished being the wife of Gandhi. Dancing Jeffrey Hornaday looks nothing more than a potboiler by «Flashdance» refutes and nothing works. I sat stunned, something like riveting and emotional can be drained to nothing. If you really love this show, and he returned to Broadway in 2006 - to see, but do not think that the long-running musical event, which was a "chorus" is any thing at all to do with this film.
