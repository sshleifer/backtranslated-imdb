Well. Astronaut Steve West sits in a plastic space capsule, noting that "you do not live as long as you see the sun through the rings of Saturn", all the while obviously in the middle of the afternoon sunlight streaming through the window, when he suddenly has a bleeding with the nose. Furthermore, the West returned home to some secret hospital, melting gel-like mass, which is furious and calls chunky nurse to run through fake glass door. It appears that West "becomes stronger when it melts," which makes about as much sense as everything else in this hopeless purile, Adle brained Moovie. Then this languid «Army Brass», which looks kind of like Coleman Francis (director of a lot of bad moovies) is trying to hide information, but sticky man running around killing everyone he sees, because it melts. He attacks the spores old pair, because it melts. He makes a terrible actress screaming and moaning helplessly for 10 minutes, because it melts. It melts, because it melts. FX in the slums of Puerto Rico Baker should be the star here, but they just look fake. Movie bad shot, and everything looks so dark and confusing, it is very difficult to do, that's what - not that it will help anyone. MooCow said, who cut the cheese with this one ?? : = 8P ps - "Did you get any cracker"
