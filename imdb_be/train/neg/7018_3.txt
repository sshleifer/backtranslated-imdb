Completely forgotten. Especially because of weak action. This is the first movie that I saw with Dax Shepard. To my surprise, he's been around since the late 90s. I thought he was a rookie, since its effect was so bland. I could say the same thing about Liv Tyler. Despite the fact that I saw it well in other films, she gave Claire Cooper is an amazing person. Liv is not the actress who gives the character a fiery, emotional person like Diane Keaton would be able to, but it was quite strange to see how she speaks her lines muted. It seemed that in general there's just not a very good chemistry going on between the actors, and I think Diane Keaton felt good. She's a fantastic actress, but it seemed just a little bit over the top in this film. It seemed to me that she just wanted to see this movie again as quickly as possible. I would not blame her.
