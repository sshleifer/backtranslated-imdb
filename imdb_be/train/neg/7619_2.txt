The Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans, I can withstand any moving image that can be imposed on me, but there is absolutely no reason for this. <br /> <br /> Evaluation «Super Action» section Blockbuster Video and given the dreaded "Forbidden View stickers" I believe that these are the only methods, cinematographer (HA!) Robert Napton could use to get at least 4 50 from one unsuspecting person. <br /> <br /> ashamed Robert Napton! Shame on you for the exploitation of these poor Mexican actors who you probably promised the hope of making it big in the American cinema. You are a disgrace! <br /> <br /> There is not one moment in the film, which keeps the least action. Have you used the snot on these people? Oh, look, they rave in the field! As with all 6 of them. And it's not that Asian guy in the background? Why always in the daytime? Why it took 1/2 of the film to show something .. and more importantly, why we watch another 1/2 <br /> <br /> PS: You owe me 4.50.
