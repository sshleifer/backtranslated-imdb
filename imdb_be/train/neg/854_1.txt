Ladies and gentlemen, please do not get fooled by the "Stanley Kubrick" tag.This film is a very bad movie, which, unfortunately, has been regarded as one of the scariest horror films ever made.Horror films need to create such fear that during the night people have to shake their hearts, thinking of this horror film.In Shining, no real horror at all, but what we find instead are simply naive, foolish attempt made to create a chilling horror.Everyone knows how good attempt they are, if they differ from reality.All, what is good in view of the film les zyanoy Valley. In the hotel where most of the actors lodged too.A seems good word about actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lost, lazy soul who never sure exactly what it should do.There not much to say about the bald, color actor who for most busy time for pampering baby actor.No to blame bad weather for tragedy.It can not be avoided, as the film was made, and the poor among the living Kubrick to make any change.
