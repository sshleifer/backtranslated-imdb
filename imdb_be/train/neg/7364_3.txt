In 1692 Salem is insidious about the involvement of child slaves in witchcraft sends the entire community in an uproar. Costume drama starring Claudette Colbert and MacMurray Sun stuffy, although neither is a striking image of contagious hysteria. Worked on three writers (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead, and Bradley King) story elements very interesting (especially if from Hollywood in 1937), but for those who have since read Arthur Miller's "The Crucible", then to hoked- melodrama on display here will not be tolerated for a long time. The biggest problem with the picture may lie in the casting: Colbert and MacMurray is poorly matched pair of lovers burdened by a witch-hunt, MacMurray being too modern presence in this situation. * 1/2 ****
