Black guy gets rich white guy, and a rich white guy seems to embrace the hip-hop culture, and most of the "funniest" moments of the movie play off this. I have a problem in that it does not work and almost never works. <br /> <br /> OK, so no one will have to wait, in Lance, to grab the body, as it suddenly begin to behave like Charles Wellington. It would be too much to ask. I admit that. But at the same time, he goes too far in the other direction. I have to imagine a rich white guy singing rap and completely turning things play as he bastion of hip-hop culture, and people just take it *? What about Sontee, who falls in love with him * as a rich white guy *, despite the fact that she does not care about the money or the power? It's so unbelievable, that's not even funny. <br /> <br /> I just could not suspend disbelief, and I could not finish the film. I added one extra star because it really make me laugh, even hard a couple of times. But I just could not go all "white guy doing hip-hop" thing, which was never done well in any movie I've ever seen that tries it. This was no exception.
