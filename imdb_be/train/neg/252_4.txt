Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in the beautiful but soft adaptation, in which the dialogue seems to be presented, not the heart, and they tied the apparition entirely to drive any sense of awe and magic; Edward Woodward as the Ghost of Christmas Present, swinging around on stilts, and seems to make an impression by Bernard Cribbins. Like Scrooge, George C. Scott is too crooked, and it never seems to really believe in it, which deprives him of the effectiveness of its actions. The scenes in which he revealed his past have so much influence, as if he was half-heartedly flipping his family album. No one seems to put any effort other than Frank Finlay, who is chronically overacts.
