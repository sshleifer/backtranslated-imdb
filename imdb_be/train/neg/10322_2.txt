If you want to be insulted or pleased, or both, you'll probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really not very thoughtful of paraphrasing usual silly cliché. At the end of the second episode, I felt a little embarrassed that I actually sat through a contrived mess. <br /> <br /> In the thinly veiled trick Thats background attracts initial attention to it in the first place is just another lame, harmless and anti-septic attempt commentary and entertainment that the CBC is usually released during production. And once «ZOMG Muslims in rural CANADA ROFLMAO !!» hype wears out its welcome, the show is likely to follow in the ether cancellation, because it is so small, judging from the fact alone. <br /> <br /> If you are not obsessed with Muslim culture in the west and / or easily captured the idiosyncrasies of the finest on the subject, I really do not understand how LMOTP nice for that satisfies the curiosity that resulted from deception. Other shows have been better to solve the issue of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in the Western multiethnic society. LMOTP never place among them in the field of entertainment or enlightenment.
