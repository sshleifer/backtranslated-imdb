... Well, I've read about this film somewhere on the Internet, and many criticized about how bad and suck this film was. And I could not be more agree on that. Then after that, I saw this movie on DVD, I thought twice about it, and then came a promotional video of the film on television. Fortunately, I wished I had the money for it pieces of shit. I had sacrificed my dreams for this film, and it soon became clear that this film can make me satisfied. So I can not be judged on how the film was made, but still ... it still sucks. As for those who liked this movie, I have to apologize for this film and fiery talks about how this movie sucks. I do not know what you think of this film?
