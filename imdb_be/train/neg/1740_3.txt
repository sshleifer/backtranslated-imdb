The film was a huge disappointment. Especially because it was directed Priyadarshan, it was sad to see such a dismal standards. Poor script (almost non-existent) and the song sequence with bad songs every minute and the odd time killed all that humor the movie has to offer. some scenes were funny, but it probably was only 5 minutes for the entire period. Editing was pathetic. Grim! the whole film is a disappointment, as the lack of history was too obvious. In fact, only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the film after the break. <br /> <br /> One will not miss anything at all, if you do not watch the movie. Do not waste valuable money ticket for this film. wait until she appears on TV ...
