These two things good about this movie is two unknown celebrities. <br /> <br /> First, Zuniga, in his first appearance in the film, a young and supple, with looks that still cover her body today, stealing the very beginning, that all that it is, and that is that. She was obviously just beginning, because of its action to improve its next projects. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the cost at the time a famous composer Christopher (Chris) Young is what keeps this bitch from getting one star ... but I know a star is no longer so much, but in the case of this film, it's a lot. <br /> <br /> The rest is just stupid senseless terror for a couple and college students who are trying to clean the hostel to be torn down, getting offed one by one, the unsuspecting killer, blah, blah, blah ... all we know where this is going. <br /> <br /> See the first eighteen minutes with Zuniga, then turn it off.
