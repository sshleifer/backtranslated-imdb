1) I'm not an expert weapons, but even I can see the difference between the US army guns in World War I and World War II. In the film, we see ordinary, armed «M1 Garand» (invented in 1932!), Is not a real "1903 Springfield" (aka "Silent Death"), which do not use the ordinary before the Second World War difference -. M1 can load 1.5 times the ammunition, and 3 times the speed of fire M1 was semi - automatic, Springfield require a reboot after each shot a little difference 2) German military uniforms borrowed from 1940 and especially -.!. German helmets. helmets until the end of the First world war has no significant pike on top, we can not ba cheat even one in the film and if we have a little extra search the archives -.? how true it is "A True Story" I am amazed at how "true" can be directors in the pursuit of cheap spread.
