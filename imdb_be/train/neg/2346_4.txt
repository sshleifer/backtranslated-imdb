I saw this movie for the first time, not too long on the TCM series "basis." Eye of the beholder clich√© has never been more appropriate. This viewer has seen little use in it. I was puzzled by endless attraction Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. Of course, Ms. Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this movie, her character comes off more timid than attractive. I think that people like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would more likely ignore Lucy, you get in an instant infatuation with her. In defense Bacall, this film was made during the last illness of Humphrey Bogart and the weight of ill health may have affected her performance. Of course, part of this mouse was with a party should oppose her slutty Lucy Marylee, played to the hilt and Dorothy Malone. The scene where she takes part in wild sensual dances while her father wearily up the stairs to a fatal heart attack, undoubtedly, the best scene in the movie. Malone performance overshadows everything else, although fatigue Jasper Hadley disappointing behavior of her two children brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. In general, though, I would like to say that I'm just not a big fan of melodrama. Cartoon character's behavior just makes the story too unbelievable for my taste.
