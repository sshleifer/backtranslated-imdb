The King is dead, long live the king! Triad Caddy Shack Two, The Family under the stairs, and military Beverly Hills was tied for the worst film ever so long that they seemed icons in their own right. But there is a new king ..... to ..... all hail the new king .... "Down to Earth". But some things, like Tiny Tim, for example, is so bad that they are good. One day, it may take an incomparable «Rocky Horror Picture Show» as a cult film. So see it .... it's .... well, just take my word for it. Go it. All welcome the new king!
