Acting It was weak, but in the horror film, I can live with that, if the story is good. It was not. The initial event was clumsy and obvious ploy for the love of most people with children. Good, good. Fast forward "in the country", where they will be recovered emotionally. Like the opening of ghosts. Okay, cool - this is a kind of supernatural horror story, partially rotten things in our world, in part ... somewhere. Then the action starts pulling like a three-headed dog in the excitement of the cats and birds - There is an evil force is trying to attack them directly? There is an evil force is trying to attack them indirectly - to make people do terrible things they would not really do? Oh, wait, no, maybe, the whole region is a genus of psychic echo chamber where the ambient dissonance can affect the murder? Well, wait - maybe it really is just one little confused thoughts "Delbert" -style cattle boy who misses his mom and some outdoor party as K-Tel Norman Bates knock off? Ah, yes - extra points off: only black character seems to be the grandson of "Our Gang» sleeping doorman. The actor plays it straight as he gave lousy dialogue, but the fact that its purpose is «Y'all made Betty get ut heah, boss!" At least, they wrote to him smart enough to get out of there GTP. Bit with a little girl being silenced and pushed defined terrible, like a chicken at heart. These were only two of the very few really tasty tidbits in this film. The problem lies in the fact that they are united in a discordant way how to stack bite, bite of chocolate and Gummi bear bite. Everyone is great on its own, but mixed up? Bleah! Such potential. Wasted.
