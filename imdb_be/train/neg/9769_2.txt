I read that Thornton Wilder play last year in eighth grade. I was also forced to sit through this poor translation on your screen. Let me tell you, this is not a terrific game, easily surpassed, but the man deserves a much better shot. Actions really do not have decorations, honestly, it looked like it was designed by a group of cardboard three-year olds. As if it could not get worse, the sound quality is disgusting ... there is this heady "high" when the actor says ... and I could not help noticing that the chemistry between George and Emily, well, non-existent. The actors all seem to be very uncomfortable to be there. There's no music. It is in black and white, that would be good, but he finds it more cheesiness. In any case, I think that if you are going to make a point to see this movie, I do not really recommend, then do not put your hopes to high. The game, as tall as it is probably better.
