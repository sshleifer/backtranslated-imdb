It will be short. First of all, let me say that I am an agnostic and not exactly crazy about xtians, especially Tyana fanatics. However, this film was the tone, like some teenager angry at his mother Xtian, not allowing it to play video games. I just could not take it seriously. Any Manson thought he was the Christ, to illustrate the point that Christianity can be diluted with evil? I do not know that it was just cheap and childish - the opposition to look ignorant. In addition, the narrator simply seemed snobby and pretentious. Supply was completed overkill. I can not take this movie seriously. May apply to the angry teenager piss3d from him Xtian mother, not allowing it to play video games.
