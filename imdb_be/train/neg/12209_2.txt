A few years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my best friend and my brother both had a policy person choosing a movie to pay. And while I would never pay to see some of the crap they took me, I could not resist a free trip to the movies! That's how I came to see shit like second Conan movie and never say never! Now, despite it being a miserable movie, in places of entertainment to look - in the brain dead sort of way. And, technically stunts and camera work well, so that it raises my rating up to 2! So why the movie is so bad? Well, unlike the first film, Rambo, this one has almost no plot, himself Rambo says only 3 words (except grunts and shouts), is a useless and totally inappropriate and inadequate "romance" and the film is a giant (and stupid) special effect . What STUPIFYINGLY terrible effects. While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets shoot Rambo, no one has no effect on him, and almost all of the bullet or an arrow hits Rambo shoots his mark! And, while the bad guys are using AK-47s, helicopters and missiles, some of the scenes were all Rambo bow and arrows that appear as atomic tips !! The scene where one bad guy shoots him as he slowly and quietly runs one of these exploding shot, in particular, made for stupid spectators! It was amazing parodied in the UHF starring Weird Al. Plus, Hot Shots, PART DEUX also makes a funny parody of the genre. - not just this stupid scene <br /> <br /> All-in-all, the movie is so stupid and senseless, it's almost like self-parody!
