When I first heard about the «Down To Earth» I was very excited. I'm quite a big fan of Chris Rock, he was particularly hilarious in dogmas. But this movie was a disappointment. Chris Rock performance was not nearly as good as his past performances, and the film was just very much directed at large. <br /> <br /> First of all, Chris Rock. He plays the whole movie as a comedy routine standing. Obviously, this works great in the scenes where he has to do in a rack, but also in the rest of the film, it is not. Even when he was talking to one other character, he seems to think that he is trying to make people full of laughter room. He has some funny moments, but mostly they come for Standup scenes (it is not surprising that they have decided to make your character a comedian). As for the other actors, they're pretty much there just to give Rock someone to talk to, none of them stand out. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was poorly directed. The film is basically a one-joke story: an old white guy acting as the young black comedian. While I prefer movies with more than a joke, it still might work, and it was pretty funny. The problem was, we have seen too much rock and not enough of the old white guy. It's supposed to be funny, because it is this white guy joked Chris Rock, but most of the time, we just see Chris Rock, so it's not so funny. Several scenes, where they decided to show us the white guy talking like a rock, in fact, gay. If he had been shown a film would have been much funnier. <br /> <br /> In general, a few minutes of laughter can not compensate for the fact that «Down To Earth» acted badly and poorly aimed. This one was a pretty big disappointment <br /> <br /> Evaluation :. 4/10
