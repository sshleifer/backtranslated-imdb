There really was not a lot of history in this film. It was based loosely on the events in the first film, The Lion King. It should be like Timon and Pumbaa met through their loneliness. But not much more than that. <br /> <br /> He mixes some of the scenes from the original, it is ab-LIBS about how this film has changed them a bit. But still, what is it? I was hoping for something a little more. Instead, all you need to show it empty lot with a little explanation. <br /> <br /> I think if you want to see the other Meerkats in the Lion King of the universe, then this is it. But other than that, it does little justice to the animators. Disney really needs to stop these direct to video production. It was really quite boring and could use Jason Statham. "D-"
