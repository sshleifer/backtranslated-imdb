Thing viewers will remember most of all, a bad headache film gave them because of too flashy, shaky camera-work and fast, intricate cutting. I do not mind the kind of stylistic devices, if they are made just like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh proof of most of his films, but in this case it was too much. It looks like jump cuts and flashes of light that accompanied each flight over the city of Mexico and every important scene were there to distract you from the realization that the story is pretty thin, and it was all very predictable. The biggest disappointment is that you can easily understand how all this will end. For a film that claims to be a tough, ruthless and morally corrupt inexcusable that this story has been told so many times, and with much greater depth and character development. This is another disappointing aspect of the film. If I want to look over the top action flick I do not need no excuse, but this film is trying to justify the killing spree character Denzel Washington and badly failed to provide any plausible representation. The first half hour or so not much is happening, except the stupid clich√©s and archetypes drawn and when the car starts rolling action is so fast cut, you do not know what is really going on. So that the film does not work either at the level of believable drama / thriller nor a pure shooter. Of course, the film is not as bad as some often quite messed blockbusters of recent years, but I really can not understand why so many people say this film to be something fresh and so good. For a video clip is too long for a movie is too little substance.
