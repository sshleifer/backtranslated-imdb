I had a lot of hopes on this film, and so watched it with a lot of expectations; mainly because of Kamal Haasan. He's a terrific actor, which marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever. But this movie was one of the worst films I have ever seen. After watching this movie violence in Tenebra and clockwork orange it looks much better. <br /> <br /> protagonist, Raghavan, is a very brave police officer. Who is assigned to investigate the brutal serial murder. Raghavan efficiently find connecting thread in this case close to solve the murder and put the psycho killers, two mentally unbalanced, but brilliant medical students in jail, but they escape and get back into the killing spree. Raghavan finally kills them both after sparing many innocent lives. <br /> <br /> The two psycho-killers are the ones who are going to keep the audience from going to the theater. These killings and sexual harassment and rape are shown very clearly that the film could have survived without. <br /> <br /> In order to even imagine that teenagers and children will watch this movie in the theater, and what he has to draw a picture in their minds, of course, not really. Director Gautham, must understand that it also has some obligations to the society and its audience.Certainly I will never go to the movies, watching Gautham's name on the list of products.
