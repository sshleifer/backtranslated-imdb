Chilly, alienated adaptation of the book by Rebecca West's Army captain returning from duty in World War II with his memory impaired (now there's an original idea!). It seems that he remembers an old flame of Glenda Jackson, but not present wife Julie Christie, which should be enough to highlight some of the emotional spark. It is very well cast soaper brings together leading man Alan Bates from director Alan Bridges and co-stars Jackson, of Christie, Ann-Margret, and Ian Holm, but the vodka, all at a low level. There are a few good scenes (especially if Jackson is on the screen), but steps Bridges is unrelievedly sluggish and dull-colored output of the film is degraded. Long on the shelf, it's "Soldiers" is best left forgotten. * 1/2 ****
