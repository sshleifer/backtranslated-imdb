This horror film is really weak ... I mean, if this is the right movie I comment. Nothing really terrible happens, like the family takes a cute little German Shepard pup. I had a German shepherd, and it's really good dog. I have not got this idea to get one of this film, though, but rather from the comedy "K-9". This is another story, though. This film really does not have much horror in general, as the most horrible scene at the end, and it looks very cheesy. In addition, we can see, the guy almost reached into the mower. That is about it. Father suspects something, though, his family seems to be getting quite strange, where he learns, if you hold a mirror to them while they are sleeping, you can see if they have. Overall, really faint horror even by the standards of television ... television films that do the job out there, as "the house of Demons" is quite good, and there is another haunted house film about a woman, and these strange creatures that also pretty good. This one is really quite boring.
