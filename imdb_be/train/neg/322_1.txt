I saw this film about five years ago, and the memory of it still does not let me live to this day. I am fully aware of how badly he had to go into it, because I only himself to blame. But, like most, I did not believe all the negativity. As an advocate of Sandler, it just seemed inconceivable one of his films can be really bad. I thought that it was only Sandler haters. I could not be more wrong. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a comedy that does not even 1 second is nothing funny. It is actually quite achieve. You would think that in 90 minutes of comedy, they might have stumbled onto something even remotely funny. But no, it's just awful. It is not "so bad it's good", it is simply bad. You can not laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. You wait patiently for a joke that, at least, make you giggle, but they never come. <br /> <br /> You've seen the movie The Ring? Where people are watching video tapes and die in 7 days? If this film was on videotape, people die instantly, by his own hand, and there will be a smile on his face as they realize that their agony is over, and it will be the first smile, because they are pressed games. <, Br /> <br /> You may be tempted to only look to see how bad it is, unable to contain his curiosity. Nia. Please do not. Believe me, I'm doing you a favor. There are 2 types of people in the world are those who think, Going Overboard worst film ever made, and those that have not yet seen.
