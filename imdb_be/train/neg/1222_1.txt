This is one seriously disrupted movie. Although even some of the guys deserve what they got ..... terrible sadistic punishments were "slightly" over the top. The only character who shows some conscience at the beginning of the hunt, was killed before he could offer some help to the sad story. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, it would have looked some promise mediocre things, but this was only a ruse to lull the audience into a false sense of security before the joy of what was going to happen. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could save the film for me was when Jack Nicholson jumped out of the bushes and cried, "and where is the Batman?". Kim Basinger could have cried. <br /> <br /> Currently, that would be cool!
