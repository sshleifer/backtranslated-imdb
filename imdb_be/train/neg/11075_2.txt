Once upon a time there was a science fiction writer named H. Beam Piper, who wrote a classic book called «Little Fuzzy», which was about a man showing dew pretty unreliable humanoid to another planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many modern writers, from looting his grave before his body was cold. This is a book in which they got the idea from the Ewoks. <br /> <br /> distributing such a plagiarist with «Little Fuzzy» I wonder why I am the only one who ever noticed? <br /> <br /> But do not take my word for it. Here is a link to Guntenberg project, where you can download a copy of «Little Fuzzy» FREE: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
