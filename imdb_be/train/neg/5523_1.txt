Georgia Rule to be one of - if not the worst film I've ever seen in my life. The whole movie has a very surreal feeling that made me gasp, "What?". Out loud, at least 7-10 times during his grueling two o'clock course <br /> <br /> Advertised in his trailer as a film about three generations of women - Jane Fonda as a matriarchy, Felicity Huffman as her daughter, and Lindsay Lohan as rebellious, excessive sex, half-naked granddaughter, the viewer thinks that it would be corny, light, chick-flick about growing up and coming together as a family. <br /> <br /> It's about false advertising on this worst. <br /> <br /> After a lot of shots of animals to make "funny" things in the background of the "core" scene, not to mention the whole five minutes focusing on the old woman who comes to the doctor's office every week to her diaper change, or the fact that this film is really about the character Lindsay Lohan sexually abused by his stepfather, Georgia Rule creates its own movie genre: without ground, badly acted, inadequate comedy dealing with very serious problems in the most inconvenient , surreal, strange way. When Garry Marshall wanted this film to be a drama / comedy, he would have watched Royal Tenenbaums. Party. Junebug. And so on. And so on. <br /> <br /> The only way that I feel I can get the reader to understand the monstrous genre that Georgia falls under the rule is to create a hypothetical situation. To say that the film, The 40 Year Old Virgin, was about the main character being a bachelor, because he was sexually molested as a child. But instead of film to take a sharp turn, belly laughter and comedy will take place with all the characters reactions that fake, non-living, people pretending to care. <br /> <br /> Throw in yellow parrots, Dermot Mulroney, like most flat dimensionless character, which could cut completely from this poorly written script, along with a male character who throws all of his religious beliefs and morals, to be with bad, too tanned girl who does not share any of the same interests as he, as well as an unnecessary car chase scene, unrealistic moments characters who try to connect with each other, and you have a Georgia rule. <br /> <br /> I found this film to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling directors, screenwriters, actors, editor, etc..who has much more talent, and do not get. notice <br /> <br /> If you do not see this movie: my rule. <br /> <br /> And if you want to get drunk enough before hand.
