I'm probably one of the few who actually read the book by Stephen King, this film was based on. After reading this excellent work, I could not wait to see the film version of it. After watching the film, I was completely disappointed. The only thing this film has in common with the book title and the names of heroes. In the book, the character Schwarzenegger put on a game show. The main goal is to survive. But he was not in the arena. He was set free in the city and have to run a game show (I guess you would call them) the villain who does not bear absolutely no resemblance to the film and the characters. This room is built a lot of tension and suspension and much ended climax. The film was absolute rubbish. There was no cinematic quality to it. I fully respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he spoiled it.
