Madison is not so bad - ?? if you want a simplified, non-offensive "family" fare and, more importantly, if you know absolutely nothing about the unlimited hydroplane races. If, like me, you grew up with this kind of sport, and your heroes were such names as the monsoon, Muncey, Cantrell, Slovak, etc., prepare for disappointment. <br /> <br /> A professional film critic notes, finally, to the routine nature of the film and its propensity to use all the hackneyed sporting cliché in the book. I need not repeat what they said. What I felt was, unfortunately, it lacked any sense of real excitement unlimited hydro races in the "glory years" (which many say is already in the past in 1971). <br /> <br /> Yes, it was great to see the old classic boats roaring down the course of six in a row, although it was clear that the recovered version (hats off to the volunteers at the Hydroplane and Race Boat Museum) were fed through the scenes with reduced speed. But where was the sound? A large part of the thrill of the old hydroelectric power was intoxicating roar of six or Allison Rolls-Merlin aircraft engines wound up speed never imagined their designer, hitting the starting line in front of you. You did not hear you FELT it. Real hydrogenerator buffs know exactly what I'm talking about. There's nothing like this in Madison. Instead, each racing scene was buried under what should be the "heroic" music. <br /> <br /> And then there are close-up shots of the drivers, riding smoothly and comfortably in cabins, as if they were resting in the latest luxury limousines, in some cases, taking the time to smile angrily as they consider how best everything to prevent poor hometown hero. Or, in one particularly funny shot, taking time to discover Jake Lloyd, which gives the "Rocky" Salute from the pier of the bridge. In fact, some drivers were unlimited antiaircraft jackets to minimize the beating they took in as the boat slammed by rock hard water at speeds over 150 miles per hour. <br /> <br /> As one reviewer so aptly put it, «The sports deserves better than this" <br /> <br /> Finally, since other user raised an anachronism, I will add one says :. shot from Seattle shows the Kingdome and Safeco field. None existed in 1971
