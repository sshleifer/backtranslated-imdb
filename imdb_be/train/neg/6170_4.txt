The film starts very slowly, but when the action finally started, it was a bit to follow. I could not understand why some of the events that took place, and a lot of things have happened before, they explained, which makes them a kind of confusing. The only thing it really is good to eat a huge amount of blood / Gore is, although most of the time there are no special effects. The blood looks like a red Kool-Aid. Skin tearing sounds like someone stepped on a pile of firewood. Again, the story is a kind of an amateur feel to it, as the writer does not take much time to improve it. I feel that this could be a much better film, when the effects were made better and more time was taken by the script. I am truly sorry that I have not watched it, but not because of the gore, but because I feel that I wasted 90 minutes of my life. If you love movies very terrible, this is for you, if not, then stay away.
