I saw this movie the other night, and I must honestly say that this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. But to do justly, but the plot is completely inappropriate. The killer is born because of all the "energy, which is used to make the film," and when the film is burned killer die? How incredible is that? The characters were underdeveloped, to say the least ... for example, people suddenly recalled, "Did you try to finish the film, because your mother could not?" So we have to go along with this? We had no idea it was her daughter until half way through the film. The film does not highlight on anybody, we did about the main people, the survivors, in addition to the nature Ringwald was whiney actress did not know the guy was on the set, when people died and Rafe wanted to be a director, like her mother, not po- this voyage, to know who they are. It seemed that everything was rushed just to get to the murder. The whole plot is entirely too weak for my taste, and I was very disappointed. Any who used this piece of shit, obviously you need to learn a thing or two about the film. I can not believe that anyone would agree to act or even to work on this film. It's not funny, it was not terrible, and it was through the whole movie clich√©. I found that to predict what will happen in front of each scene, who believe you me it was not difficult at all to do. It's a shame, and I deeply regret that I wasted half an hour, watching the mess. 1/10.
