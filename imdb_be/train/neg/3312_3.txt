... but I regret that I saw him. Since IMDb relatively high ratings (and they also have to be relatively high on Netflix), I guess I put it in the queue, because it is advertised as a gentle comedy from the UK, a category that has done a lot of movies I loved very much. «Saving Grace», on the other hand, falls into the category of laughter sitcoms usually less populated Hollywood films produced and directed to mediocre. Blethyn is a capable actress, and I loved her in other films. The concept - a gardener grows marijuana to overcome poverty, she finds herself to confront the death of her husband - not to offend me. Despite the best efforts of the cast to make the humor, the film falls flat on his face (falling flat on his ass, maybe it was funny), how much my wife and I were concerned. Be warned about the venerable reader, not all Unusual British comedy success. This one is hopeless.
