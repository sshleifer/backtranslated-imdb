This movie was so disappointing. With annotations, that made me decide to see Phantom Love (why he called it?), I was expecting something Arty and thoughtful with beautiful images. He made some interesting images, but they often seemed to be random and meaningless. In fact they seemed that they were brought in to fill the time. In the end, the effect has been sluggish. <br /> <br /> I believe that the film had to be atmospheric, but it just was not there. The lack of a coherent plot did not help matters. We can say that it was a mystery, but I think it was simply incoherent without an atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The main character seemed to be disturbed, but the story does not pull me in enough to take care of your situation. Despite the cast list, I would not know, you see the main character as a child. The film has very little context of time, place or character. I'm not a prude, but the sex scenes (there were a few) seemed pointless and further confused me, I found Lulu, but I was not sure if it was the same person, different people, lover, husband, or she was a prostitute. It was only when I saw that the loans I have found hairy back was supposed to belong to her lover. The film turned out to do what should have been a shock (the sequence of sleep involving Lula's mother) seems a bit sad. <br /> <br /> nail filing is actually made more sense, since it would give some insight into the emotional state of Lula. I will not blame the actors, I can not have had a lot of work. <br /> <br /> I do not know where the lack of context or flow in the film was because of the inability or because he was pretentious but the end result was lackluster. <br /> <br /> I can not be bothered to talk about it anymore.
