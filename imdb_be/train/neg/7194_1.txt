In accordance with well-known practice of Disney theft .. I mean .. buying known properties and bastardizing them, this live-action version of the venerable classic cartoon has got to be one of the worst again does a year make bad again. I grew up on the original television series of the cartoon. Every episode of the original animated series will give you more laughs than this entire film. Not present cool computer book Penny. Also, there is a self-deactivation of the gag orders, which always end detonate on the boss. New Gadget is a smooth talking cabriolet (the original cartoon was cool car that can turn into a van or car) and the element of typical Hollywood romance unrealistic. Do not fill the coffers to pay for the head of Disney and even their _ex_executives. - do not watch this movie <br /> <br />
