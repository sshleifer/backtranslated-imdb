I saw this film ran into the wee hours on TCM. Some problems with the film were obvious from what I have seen. First, adults do not grow old, when the children have been doing for 10 years. Some parts of the film were the problem of continuity and for some reason, the actor who played the youngest son looked like a very old, when 10 years have passed. <br /> <br /> I have seen a copy is not enough for about 20 minutes or so, at least, a huge gap with a black screen appeared. That's too bad, because even if the script is poor, Bergman & Russell both did well in their roles in the film. It's a shame, a big piece missing, but what is watchable. <br /> <br /> I just want all this was untouched. The script makes little sense that the character of Bergman sent when the children are small, but then returned to take care of them when they are adults? Some of the timelines does not make sense either. There is a stock market crash, which resembles the 1929, but the children grow up to fight in World War 1. All the acting in this film to support people well. Just wondering what was in the 20-slit film, I could not see how it was.
