I just saw Gretchen Mol in the other two films (a girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and in fact I do not remember her, but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for photographs, because it made people happy. <br /> <br /> She did not think that she does not do so, even if it went out of business, and found her religion again. <br /> <br /> in the photos she did, of course, have been tame by today's standards, and it's funny seeing people with cameras to get all excited, and politicians preaching about the dangers of pornography. Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) plays a part here is super. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and outstanding biopic most famous pinup girl ever.
