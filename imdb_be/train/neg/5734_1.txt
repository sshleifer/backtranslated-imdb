This kind of film, which is so very bad that you can not stop watching it because you keep telling yourself that "it can not continue to have this shit all the way through. It just can not. You know, "worse than Jaws 4'-type bad. <br /> <br /> I honestly think I only saw one movie that was worse than this, and then we say religious crap about how you Â»d in hell for lying or playing football. <br /> <br /> Gore? Indeed, and lots of it. Well done Gore? In any case. <br /> <br /> action does not go bad, and all the lines rotten cliche. The same applies to the storyline, but really made up of sex, blood and violence, as well as many other gore films. <br /> <br /> If you're hoping for a mixture between Ichi the Killer and Underground August ?? keep looking. You will not find it in the air.
