When I heard the story of this film, I just had to see it, I mean the whole city be destroyed by the killer tomatoes! Unfortunately, the name is about as ridiculous as it gets. <br /> <br /> At the head of the detective Dick Mason, and a special military team of scientists (including Greg Colburn, who never takes his scuba outfit on and Lieutenant Finletter who never pictured without his parachute behind) "Attack killer tomatoes "is a parody of B-movies, in particular, the Japanese horror movies of the 1950s. The film begins with the standard-sized tomatoes future found women washed in your kitchen, before we find ourselves in the middle of a crime, like tomatoes, they say, have killed this woman, and let me tell you that it does not get Saner as the film progresses! To be fair there are some funny moments, for example, every time a Japanese scientist Dr. Nokitofa says his voice is dubbed over with an American accent, or if a disguise expert Sam Smith infiltrates tomatoes, "Hey, somebody please pass the ketchup ? ", as the film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 as bad a good concept. Unfortunately for "Attack of the killer tomatoes" falsification of such films as "Airplane" and "Naked Gun" series was released and made this kind of comedy is much better as <br /> <br /> Effective brutal. there is zero continuity editing, and it just feels really slow and lacking in energy. To parody the film to work you need a lot of things going on at once, one gag after excessive. Singing in the film seems pointless and advertising for a furniture store that flash on the screen directly damn weird, even for this film. Ultimately, however, you can understand why this film is a cult; I can not see that many people are not indifferent to it. Unfortunately, it would be scary as I would sum it up.
