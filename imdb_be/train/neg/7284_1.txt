Wow. I read about this movie, and it sounded so awful that I had to see it, and my gosh, I can hear it in St. Louis. Where to start? National lampoons trying to follow the 5 years of success Homes animals, but they completely missed the mark. I'll go in chronological order with these short clicks. <br /> <br /> Short Film # 1 <br /> <br /> Poor Peter Riegert (Boon from Animal House). Apparently, it did not work then, so that the boys in the National lampoons probably called and said, 'Hey, we do a ** PPy film, I want to be in it? "Peter," well, I do not do much in these days, why not? "he was a great character in the side of the house the animals, but he could not bear the poor short-flop for 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> POSSIBLE SPOILER BACKGROUND funny enough, Jason Cooper (Riegert) tells his wife to leave him, she must find herself. This is too weird, that they are actually in a happy marriage. He chases her, there she goes, and Cooper is responsible for the children. This, of course, from the leads to his house burning down, having lost a number of children, and to sleep with an assortment of New York (including the only girl standing so young Diane Lane). Then his wife returned, the child wants, and the film ends with a coin flip, which will decide the fate of children. The idea was actually more intelligent, but the director smelly. The characters all seem as if they fall asleep, they had to be doped up. Unfortunately Boon, your legacy tarnished with this flop. <br /> <br /> Short Film # 2 <br /> <br /> MORE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Enter Dominique Le Corsaire. Beautiful girl recently graduated from college, not knowing what to do with his life. Thus, it becomes a whore, she starts sleeping around with some mega-rich guys take their money when they die, and it will not stop until it has beds for the most powerful man in the world, Fred Willard (Oops, I'm the President referring to the United States). Again, it might be funny, and even though I was pleased that the Corsair (Anne Dasenberri in real life) is not afraid to bare all, its effect was terrible. Which is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Short Film # 3 <br /> <br /> I can not believe that I made it this far. Here is a rookie cop Brent Falcone (Robby Benson) with veteran status Nagurski (Widmark). Falcone young and naive to think that it can really help people, but he becomes cynical after being shot several thousand times. Nagurski, in fact, has just refused care. He looks assaults muggings, you name it, and never interferes. He believes that the world is illegal and it is likely to get sued if he does not do anything. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of run taxi) is on the action, getting the police called on him to the crime, but his lawyer is there to protect him. God Bless America !! <br /> <br /> Once again, it was possible to be funny performances were deliberately mannerisms, but goodness, no energy at all. Henry Zhaglom and Bob Giraldo should be ashamed of their names on this schlock. I think that the letter was not bad, the idea was there but the performance was pulled down, and rescue attempts in the Iranian hostage crisis. If I were a part of this movie, I would like my name removed, it's terrible. On the other hand, that's why I watched it. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this litter, Dr. John made the movie (repeating "Going to the movies," over and over again) the ISN and the film "so much more than half an hour. Show this film in the classroom with the title "What you should never do in the movies." The script had to leave on the shelf, because yes, it is so bad.
