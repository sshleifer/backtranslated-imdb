Originally aired as an ABC Movie of the Week. It includes two innocent young college students who railroaded to a prison camp in a small southern town. They have no right to the phone, and no one knows that they are there. Below rape, torture, beating, degradation and degradation leads to very disturbing conclusions. <br /> <br /> The television version was (for its time) grim. A lot of nudity and beatings were pretty tame, but the overall feeling sleaziness wore one down. Unrated version is even worse - there are rich in poverty, the violence is extreme and, in one particularly disgusting sequence, we see flagrant prisoner forced to undress while lesbian guard "use" it. YUCK! There's nothing wrong in exploitation films, but this one is just beyond the line. You get the feeling that the filmmakers are having these poor women are tortured and degraded - all shoved in your face, you have to enjoy it. Nothing gloomy ending does not help <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 because the acting is good. - but it actually makes the film difficult to watch. The patient, a sleazy movie. Not recommended.
