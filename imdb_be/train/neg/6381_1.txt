This film is about a group of extraterrestrial gay black men are cut women in the world, in order to create a fun universe. <br /> <br /> I watched it with a plan to see how bad it was. However, I was shocked at how bad it was. It was more like a film shot 50 years ago. Action, if any, of the ultra poor. Sets and props so ridiculous fake that make the film look like any college Meg budget. And the special effects ridiculously simple, really jaw dropping as others have commented, but jaw droppingly uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> One should be severely intoxicated or in an altered state of consciousness to rate this movie. If I was from Denmark, I would greatly embarrassed and humiliated that my countrymen are such terribly bad film.
