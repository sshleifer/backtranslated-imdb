I think it's horrible, produced and directed the film. Benicio Del Toro does not have to work in the film industry, he has put the focus on his actions and that is all. Steven Soderbergh has missed the whole point of the idea of ​​the revolution, its ideals, and most importantly, about the life of Che Guevara, and so on. Camera bad as someone with experience 2 days of shooting him, the music ... I do not know..is there is some music in the movie ???? I do not recommend this piece of sh .. anyone. It's just to spend about 4 hours in front of TV or something .... I can not understand how anyone could rate this film more than 3 stars. Catastrophe .... disaster .... catastrophe .... disaster please do not look. Save yourself from this flour "cinema"
