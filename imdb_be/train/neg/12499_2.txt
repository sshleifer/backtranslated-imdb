I went to the cinema, as a preview in Austria. So he had no idea that I was going to see. History is very normal. The film is very long, I think that it could be reduced to 1/2 without causing any problems in history. His type of film that you can see in the sad night that you want to get bored anymore! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is in order. The film talks about the US Coast Guard as they learn their way of life and the problems they face. Since there are not many effects in the film. So if you want to watch it, there is no need to waste time and money going to the movies. It would be more effective to look at his house when he hits on DVD.
