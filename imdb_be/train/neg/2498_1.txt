Forgive me for stating the obvious, but some movies are good, and some bad movies. Of course, there are extremes within these two broad categories. Films such as The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan, and Star Wars slot comfortably into a good category. At the other end of the spectrum there are those films that just do not deserve to be called by name. Occasionally, however, someone produces a really sad movie. The film, which is to be allocated as a demonstration of how awful a movie can be. The film, which is more than bad. Such a film Maiden Voyage. <br /> <br /> In short, Maiden Voyage story of a luxury cruise ship that was captured by a gang of evil criminals demand ransom from the same evil intrigues of the ship owner. Of course, there are all American hero on board, complete with a chiseled jaw and relief breast, that saves the day. <br /> <br /> This is a production that breaks new depth. Everything about it is bad. Actions, direction, and so-called breathing takingly portion are poor. In short, it is an insult to the intellect of any hapless viewer. Even the American audience will irritate its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is so bad. <br /> <br /> I will resist the temptation to make a list of things that disturbed me about this film, but it dumber than dumb output should be a sufficient example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> Imagine in your mind that you are the evil kidnapper and you are standing in an open boat on the calm sea, you are in the company of the hero who keeps ticking bomb. He said the hero throws a bomb to you and dives overboard. What would you do? I do not know about you, but I would throw a bomb, as far as I possibly could into the sea. Not this guy. He watches as our hero sailed, and then he tries to defuse a bomb with unfortunate (for him) results. Enough said. Such a death worthy of a mention in the Darwin Awards website and can also be appropriately subject to the conclusion of life of the production team.
