The shows were great episodes, this is not one of them. It's not a terrible episode, it's just hard to keep track of "The man who was dying." "Everything in the house" and "Dig, the cat, he's real gone." <br /> <br /> This episode is about a couple who had just been married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shelley). During the first five minutes you know that Charles only married Peggy for her money. The two go on their honeymoon, and their car breaks down on a dirt road, and they are forced to seek refuge in an old mansion abandoned. Charles soon learns the secret of the family, Peggy ... <br /> <br /> In my opinion, you have to watch this episode, but just do not expect the same feelings as the rest of the episodes in the first season.
