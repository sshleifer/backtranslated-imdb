Carl Jr. and his father now works in the army on a remote island. They capture a trio of guys who will come across on the island. Who fight back after a while. (A surviving) This one has a continuous blood, blood and the carnage that would have been nice if any of it look remotely real, or if the production does not look like it was done with a week to be accumulated lunch money (I can be overexxagerating there . it was probably only a couple of days worth). Horrible dubbing does not bother me so much, and I suspect that if I was really drunk, some of them may have been a little humor .... maybe. But as it is, in just 78 minutes, the film is still felt too long on .. Oh, I do not know ... 78 minutes. Do not waste your time <br /> <br /> My Rank: F <br /> <br DVD /> Extras: Bonus film: "Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence" ;. and trailers for other Shock-O-Rama released movies
