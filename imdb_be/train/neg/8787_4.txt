I first heard of white noise when I saw the TV ad. Before that, I did not even know about its existence. I watched the trailer online, and decided that I would go and see. Now being a fan of films like The Sixth Sense, I thought that this film will give me everything I wanted. He has Michael Keaton in him, and he rocks. Unfortunately, the film did not deliver. He was trying to be more Sixth Sense or mixed in Echoes, and failed miserably. It has a very promising start, but the middle of a delayed repeats, and ends completely bad turn which any monkey could understand. Unfortunately, like most of the "Scary" movies he currently relies on loud noises and knocks to make the jump to the audience. This film could have been so much more. It's a shame because it was a good idea.
