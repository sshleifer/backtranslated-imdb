Amateur in the extreme. Cinematography particularly shocked - documentary camera operators do not have to revolve around the all time <br /> <br /> scenario really meaningless, and the effect is even worse .. In addition, the history of the disorderly and winding - some gaping holes in logic. At some point lead wants to get thrown in jail, to be driven with the suspected operatives of Al-Quada, and thus get an interview with Osama. I found that the story is very unlikely as a result of the many disadvantages. "Director" / leading role actually reflects rash, idiot frat boys. The only element of interest really, is that the filmmakers did actually film in place. It really is a shame that they wasted their opportunity to do something interesting. <br /> <br /> Who is funding this crap?
