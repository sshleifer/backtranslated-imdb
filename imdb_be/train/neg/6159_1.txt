Why is it that anyone who has seen this film feels like it's their responsibility to tell us whether they are fencers? This point is completely irrelevant to any arguments put forward against the common dog movie <br /> <br /> I think that sports movies are divided into two categories. well-made films about the human spirit and competition, as well as by the sword. " <br /> <br /> To be honest, this film could never decide what he wanted to be, a touching drama is trying to be your best in life, the indictment competitive motivation or martial arts flick. In the end, it does not do any of those, or convincing enough to make me give one ounce of care of any of it. <br /> <br /> For the record I am also an instructor in fencing (and now I am officially as bad as everyone else). But to put the bad barrier in the movie does not make it automatically evil. I mean look at the Star Wars (Episodes 4-6, good films, bad fencing). I like these movies. But if you put a bad sport in a bad movie, for some reason people think that this is only the purists, who believe that the lame efforts. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by comments about the smaller release of fencing, It's just a bad movie. In the end, this film does not have anything for fencing enthusiasts or movie buff or just anyone with a pulse and three brain cells. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie, and I have to think, 'Man, I wish I was watching Mighty Ducks ". I know that it is time to get around the argument with the manager of the theater, to get their money back and see if there is anyone in the lobby, which somehow give my life to me two hours ago.
