Or spent 100 years of horror for News and Ted talked about cinematic werewolves. He said something that his brush with lycanthropy was Howling II of, he joked, "The less said about that the better." In fact, he was right, as this film may well be the worst in all of its catalog on-screen representations. First Howling Joe Dante's werewolf film was innovative with its incredible special effects and its cutesy sense of style and subject matter. It was a film that will be taken seriously. Like other good original films, the makers of the film, for some strange reason believe that we need more for mannerisms, not what worked for the first time (see Chud then CHUD II, to illustrate this point). This film is far away from the first on every front. There is absolutely nothing wrong about it. It looks cheap and pitch through most of the major scenes. He is the only actor in the film worth mentioning (well, I'll let Ferdy Mayne, too). Or looks confused, as he says, silly dialogue and making funny thing (to verify that the termination with him and Stirba). Or looks incredibly tired and knows that dreck that is a little more astute than two wires that leave America to go to Romania. History is not really worth considering here, and you can bet there is very little story worth mentioning is that you should have Stephen Parsons and his band Babel play through most of the film in the beginning and ending this terrible noise. Sybil Danning here and, yes, she undresses once, and then we get the scene over and over again and again shown - one reviewer said 17 times (I counted ten - but could have been so bored out of my mind from this point). I gave the film three stars, but it really deserves a zero - three, I gave him a 1-for Lee and two contributions of Ms. Dunning in. Ugh!
