Absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time! It starts bad and only getting worse. Katherine Heigl is woefully miscast in the role of Lolita and Leo Grillo valiantly struggling with the fact that, in fact, a cardboard cutout character. The only cast member with any enthusiasm, Tom Sizemore, who hams it as a villain, and goes overboard with his role. Scenario terrible, terrible acting and have plot holes big enough to drive a double-decker bus through! It is also the most sexist film I have ever seen! the character of Katherine Heigl is completely unsympathetic. She saw the evil, wanton seductress that entices the poor, innocent married man to cheat on his wife. It is understood throughout the film that it minor, and the message that accompanies this story-thread simply unbelievable! In the end, it may not even be able to redeem himself by shooting a man who obviously (ha!) Become a mad rage and guilt, but the script allows him to kill himself, thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of men around the world . Horrible. Do not waste your time.
