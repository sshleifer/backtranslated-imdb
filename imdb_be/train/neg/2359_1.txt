He was supposed to be the last film Freddy (and it was more than 10 years) - do you think that they would try to get a good movie make. But they were giving us the worst of the series (and that's saying a lot). The plot does not make sense (I seriously can not remember it), all the main characters were idiots (you really wanted them dead), and Freddy acuity was worse than usual. Only remotely good bit of it was short (and funny) cameo Johnny Depp (the first "Nightmare" movie was his first). <br /> <br /> Also, I originally saw it in the theater were the last section (reaccounting childhood Freddy) was in 3-D. Well - 3-D was lousy - faded colors and images going in and out of focus. In addition, three flying skull, which had to be terrible (I think) had the opposite reaction from your audience. EVERY broke out laughing. It looks even worse on television in 2-D. Some nonsense - very dull, too. Skip this and see "Freddy vs. Jason" again.
