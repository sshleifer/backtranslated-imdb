Since its release in 1983, "A Christmas Carol", Joan Shepherd, tells the story of his alter ego, Ralph became an instant classic. "My Summer of history", but still Shepherd as the narrator, but it has absolutely none of the charm, and the characters are not very far from the caliber of the original film. <br /> <br /> «My Summer Story» mainly a mixture of mediocre and just not very interesting stories, which include redneck neighbors and fighting top. Grodin, which I usually like, very unsympathetic in the role of the father (or rather pumped Darren McGavin in the original), and his character never seems to be anything but forced. Kiernan Culkin is a poor substitute Ralogo, and younger brother all but forgotten here. Just think, Mama, to have any value here, and perhaps it was because she beans movie manager with a gravy boat, he pushes his success too far Angry housewife on a "free night meal." <br /> <br /> The history of this largely irrelevant and stretched paper thin. May apply to the very unpretentious, but as a continuation of "A Christmas Carol", it is very poor and not worth most people's time. 2 of 10.
