Live a Little, Love a Little is one of the most amazing Elvis movies. Part farce, part of the fluff of the surreal and the country. Elvis meets the girl is very off-beat with an irritating voice. It is similar to Jennifer Aniston. History does not make much sense, as with most films of Elvis Presley, and there is a lot of odd characters in abundance. Not so much music in it, but that's where I like it, though no one remembered. Surprisingly continuity. Elvis and Michael Carey to go to his house on the beach at night, but after a few minutes the delivery boy to come and a harsh light of day !! What ?? This is the essence of the film. What ?? Oh, two good things about the film: a) Elvis looks great and B) the dog is stealing the show.
