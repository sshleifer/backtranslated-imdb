Cinematography - Why is the camera work in this film so nervous? It's annoying and distracting. Editing - Flash still images were too short. Many other scenes were too short. Just blink. Sound - background music was too loud and the voices were covered. One should not repeat and rewind to catch what was said. Not anyone check these things, and to get them to do it again. Please reduce the volume of the background music in the future. There are regulations regarding the work of sound level editor, Julia Wong? The site had too many loose ends. The storyline has potential. I think the film needs more work. Was he ran? Perhaps they ran out of money. How many films, he began a large, but simply ran out of gas before the end. I really do not understand, you know, there's a storyboard before it goes into production, why not all the loose ends are taken care of in the storyboard. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to be so critical,
