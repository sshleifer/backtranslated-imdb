Billy Crystal was the co-author, co-produced and stars in this very safe and comfortable comedy drama about parents and children, adults irresponsibility, and grow old. Billy plays the heart surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha), which causes it to look for his father (Alan King), a movie-the EXTRA, which is a star. Scenario south Neil Simon nonsense one-liners with wealth, flat, featureless direction of Henry Winkler (stuck in a sitcom mode) and family conflict at the ready. Crystal and King try our best, but the king is too eager and often over-the-top. JoBeth Williams is still one of his thankless role, but managed to bring his innate, unpretentious class proverbial friend character. It's a comedy, I think, but one that blinks away a tear ... a shame. ** from ****
