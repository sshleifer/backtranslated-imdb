My wife and I really had high hopes for this film, but it was a big disappointment. It was the Indian version of Mr. Magoo. Miserable father who is not around, he's trying to, for example, fishing, hunting, obviously he puts his family in their wild fantasies. His "vision" is not only funny, but in the process he's lying his son many times about various obvious things. Words can not express how bad this film. Wife and children are very real, making the film even more sad. I do not understand the humor ... if you do not like to laugh at others, a fool of yourself. I do not understand how this could have come up for awards. Save your money, do not hire.
