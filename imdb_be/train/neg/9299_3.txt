While I was watching this film, I tried to find out why they are taking the time to do it. Although the basic plot of the film is potentially good, have all kinds of unrelated / unnecessary plot. Marketers in Hollywood must have enjoyed a few bad guys, the constant double crosses and the man and woman who get too close, and have sex. It is strange that we see them more sex than we did the president and his mistress. Many sites and podagovory make the film too broad, and none of the characters incorrectly designed - I really do not feel like I knew that any character, except that all the corrupt and evil. The ending is completely incomplete - he left me more than just a wish, it might be, but what it should be. In the end, a lot of really no explanation as to why someone does what they do, except to serve as additional corrupt characters who make a double cross. I am surprised that so many established (and well) the actors agreed to do a hollow film. It seemed a film made by college students who are working on their 2 or 3 projects. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time if you're not in the film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie.
