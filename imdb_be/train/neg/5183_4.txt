This is the first of these "8 Films To Die For" collection, which I have seen, and it certainly does not make me want to see any of the others ... but I've heard at least a few of them are worthy. I do not know it's not terrible, but it's not really a lot to me. Your main eater of a dysfunctional family in a suburb of the kind of thing my mother and father died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?), where they continued to bring home stray food sources if possible. Much of it was terrible Goth sister, who, of course, to invite other through school that nickname Ollie does not leave. In any case, we certainly have a butcher shop in the basement, and so on, and so on. This is a family kind of version of white bread with Sawyer clan, they are ugly and they do bad things, but they do not go shower . I see a lot of feedback from people who loved it, and I guess I do not know what I missed, but I found it to be very mediocre and I would not recommend it to anyone, actually. 4 of 10.
