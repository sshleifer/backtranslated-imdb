I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella and always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn. <br /> <br /> So I was glad to see that Cinderella 2 was on TV, and I would have the opportunity to see it. <br /> <br /> I should have known better. <br /> <br /> This film connects the club sequel that should have just been left alone. It has absolutely none of the charm of the original super! It seems to me, rather rudely, almost rigid, straight from the (not) Sing-A-Long to the characterization. <br /> <br /> While I remember the character telling a story through song, the soundtrack of the film was placed on top, and did not seem to fit. Converting JAQ in the human body is a prime example: Where did he go eating an apple and adding a few little jokes here and there, he was dancing around and singing about how great it was to be high! And in the hall, there is an old barn dance country music type. It is as if the authors have forgotten when and where the story was set. Optimistic Fidel, of course, are not suitable. <br /> <br /> Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 not up to scratch with the original. The work in this film seems to be pretty crude and less detailed. And we can see part of the hoop skirt Cinderella, who is not feeling well. <br /> <br /> The film itself would have its own story, I think it had to be that way. I would not say that I hate, but I think he had a lot of flaws. It seems to diminish significantly from the original favorite Cinderella.
