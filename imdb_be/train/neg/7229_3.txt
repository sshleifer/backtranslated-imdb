This film seems to start in the middle, enters a peripheral player, as if they were significant and presented the main characters without any substance, and paper-thin and / or impermeable back-stories. Almost no one has an exact or a different motivation for their actions in this film. The plot is haunting and ultimately goes nowhere, the dialogue clumsy and banal, and the director has little clue about how to get the best from his actors. It almost feels like it's the first half of this film, but it was never filmed. <br /> <br /> We are told that there was a mysterious pyramid of New York and Central Park inexplicably became arctic deserts. However, all this does not seem to have caused a lot of commotion in the general population, and only a minimal concern for the government. <br /> <br /> We are represented in the "evil corporation" in eugenics, but it's really just a convenient conceit to populate the world with a pair of power-tripping minions. All "eugenics-is-bad" double entender entirely despotic and never actually pans here. We have to take care of the central character, but we will never know enough about them to know why. So much about this world is underdeveloped or completely undeveloped, it comes off as a 1-hour, 40-minute fatalistic rationalization for rape. <br /> <br /> in the "innovative" digitally animated world created here, all I can say is that at about the same time as this film was made by a number of other directors I did the same thing with a more seamless and plausible results. <br /> <br /> After spending the time to see this movie the most pressing question left in my mind was, "What?"
