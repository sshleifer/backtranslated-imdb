I stopped watching the POS as soon as the snake started to "capture" of the aircraft. <br /> <br /> At first I thought that he should get "one" for a comic. But then I realized that I could just watch the three stooges free and laugh more! <br /> <br /> Whatever respect I might have been irretrievably destroyed for Samuel Jackson. And Hollywood has once again as from the reality they actually shows. When I was a kid, we used to catch snakes for fun. The only thing that the snake will do so crammed into the bottom of the cargo compartment. And no amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can not change. <br /> <br /> This film is not worth a trip to Blockbuster. Keep in mind. When you pay for it, only "sacrifice" your dumb ass <br /> <br /> If you want to be really scary, I suggest descent. If you wish, humor, go to a local stand up comedy club. Their worst will be a million times better than this garbage.
