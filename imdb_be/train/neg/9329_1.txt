One of the worst movies I have ever seen. My only thought was: "How can I get my money back from the video of Hollywood." It does not cost four dollars, or any dollars. I think it was an attempt to disrupt Mexican and Vin Diesel movie, but it failed miserably to do so. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, I felt sorry for the actors, they could not find something better to do with their time. The story was funny. We called ahead of a line of actors, it was so predictable. Mexican accent leading lady was obnoxiously overdone, worse than a caricature. <br /> <br /> Let him.
