The famous writer Mark Redfield (as Edgar Allen) tries to win the old attachments and start a new life for himself as a publisher of Baltimore, Maryland. However, a power outage, delirium, and the refusal threatened to disrupt his efforts. He would also like to rekindle romance with an old favorite, significantly incorrect perspective, since all turns out. Mr. Redfield is also directed this dramatization of the mysterious last days of Edgar Allen Poe. Redfield is using a lot of black and white, color and trick photography to create a mood. Kevin G. Shinnik (as Dr. John Moran) performs well, relatively speaking. It's not enough.
