They show it on some off-network. This is good shit. Although it is not as bad as B-movies, they point to the Sci-Fi network on Saturdays, but still a pretty big pile of crap. The acting is passable. The story and writing a pretty sub-standard and Shagan entirely too slow. Every minute of the film feels like a part of the film, where they wrap the thing before the credits - not film the peak isolation. In addition, large areas of the cast looks like the way to old for the age range they are playing. All of this is predictable, boring and not worth to be watched. Save your time. It's not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free.
