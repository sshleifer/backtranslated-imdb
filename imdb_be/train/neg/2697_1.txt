Based on personal experience time director John Singleton from the University of Southern California, higher education comes. . The film focuses on the racial politics that take place in modern day college <br /> <br /> There are three main character, to which the film bases its foundation on its history: Malik Williams, carefree cattle athlete who is African American men. Kristin Conner, protected by a soft white girl, and Remy, inexperienced white man unbound. All three are overcome by sudden reality that college life is not as good as it is advertised as a three pass through disappointment, being unprepared (Malik), being naive (Kristin), and, as an undesirable (Remy). <, Br /> <br /> One good thing about the film is that it shows that modern American colleges simply secondary schools with a capital letter. College is not the place to build character, develop capacity, and improve personal advancement, but institutions are used to collect all kinds of students in a one-size-fits-all atmosphere. It's an experience, as a rule, is based on the failure of most students. It would be good if the film is built its story about this travesty, not racial politics. <br /> <br /> But this is not the case and that there are films apart. The Singleton, it seems, had a rather bad experience in Southern California. With this film, he lets it all hang out. There's no need to beat around the bush here. Singleton allows heroes and villains of this part can be easily seen. <br /> <br /> The black characters in the film pretty much seen as heroes here while all the white in the film are seen as villains, save for by Kristin, who was raped by fellow white student. <br /> <br /> Who can understand the contradictory nature of this film? Black gang members who have come to the aid of a white woman after she pointed to them, who allegedly raped? Ease of that black gang members are in the university while a bunch of skinheads found in a dark little violence hostel planning? <br /> <br /> performance Omar Epps (Malik) and Kristy Swanson (Kristin) disappointing. They seem to have a third choice for the role they played in this film (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore had to play Malik and Christine, but were not available). O'Shea Jackson, aka Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes, and Regina King were all annoying in their roles. And Laurence Fishburne has been frustratingly here as miscast history professor. Only Rappoport has done well in this film, and it is, given that his character, of the three main characters, has changed the most in the film. <br /> <br /> John Singleton wanted to take on the issue of race and irregularities American college life with this film. And he did it pretty bad. It was sort of like flies murder with a gun. Life is much more complicated than it seems, and people look at each other in everything, and he must know it. Higher education is a proof that he did not understand it at all. Having seen the film, then as now, will only confuse, disappoint and enrage the audience he wants to talk. Not to mention it will not entertain them in the least.
