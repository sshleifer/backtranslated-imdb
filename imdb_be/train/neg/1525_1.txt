I watched this weekend afternoon, it was not simply nothing else, it would be more interesting to chew off their feet, and probably less painful. I encourage someone to watch it just to see how turgidly terrible movie can be, of course, it was intentional. I cringed every futile attempt at humor, conducted such children, emergency, poorly designed in such a way that it was impossible to believe. This is a film that makes Spiceworld Goodfellas look like, I think I'm exaggerating? Well, give him air time and think again. Terrible, absolutely terrible. If it was not a joke, the director, and someone else is responsible for it should be removed and quickly fired after being forced to watch this movie again.
