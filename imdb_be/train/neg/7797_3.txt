This is one of the worst films I have ever come across, but I want to say that some of the criticisms I've heard, it was unreasonable .. <br /> <br /> As far as pure film-making equipment is this director is competent. He is constrained by limited budgets and cameras VHS, but the actual editing, camera angles, camera movement and scene setting is quite professional. I've seen a lot of movies where the "direction" was much worse. At least, the scene flow in such a way as to not be confusing and it has a few clever shots here and there. In addition, forest scenes contain a decent atmosphere. There is only so much you can do with a VHS camera, and he does a good job, as far as the formalities are. As far as artistry, no. The scene in which the camera pans down, so that we can see a guy peeing in the woods for 15 seconds sort of embodies the artistic style of the film. This is pure garbage ... All rubbish. <br /> <br /> parched for a decent movie in this budget range. , This is obviously fake, but there is lots of it, and it is very strange .. <br /> <br /> I've seen the American version of a deliberately mannered dubbing. It was a good idea (and this is the only thing that allowed me to make it through the film) ... Unfortunately, this is exaggerated, especially towards the end. <br /> <br /> This is a really scary movie, but I have to recommend it for its camp value. It's really hard to find a movie that's worse than that, and something to put him in a unique category.
