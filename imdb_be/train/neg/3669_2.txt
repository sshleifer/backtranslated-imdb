I really can not think of anything good to say about this movie ... not a single thing. Nightmare scenario .. author blurs the line between chemical and biological features, and does not give up in order to understand the difference. You would think that they would at least get a technical consultant. The performances have been poor most of the cast ... although I do not blame them .. stuff really stinks. Editing was equally bad .. I just stop now .. its all bad 2/10
