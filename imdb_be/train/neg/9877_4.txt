Fantastic Mr. Fox comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book. Wes Anderson directs and respectable takes a little book with the same name on the big screen in a feature film. While I respect what he did Anderson, incredibly talented people, the film seemed to be lost in his own clever spirit. Anderson seems to have left behind the story, knowing that he was a talented man, and when it happened, bad film, it will be his first bad movie. Just like when you go to school and have their first bad day, this is the first bad day Anderson in making the film, so I'm going to let him off lightly. I admit that it really was a genius and his good spirit, and the animation is good, but the film becomes more difficult to get there, leaving behind the story and that has random pictures random things happening. Symbols of good, too. Jason Schwartzman voices Mr. Fox (George Clooney) 's smart ass son, ash, and especially attractive. The film does not quite make it to the level of terrible, but it certainly is getting closer and closer, as he goes forward. I'm sure Wes Anderson will be back on track with another amazing film, where and when he decides to make another film, but now, I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this is your film was a big disappointment.
