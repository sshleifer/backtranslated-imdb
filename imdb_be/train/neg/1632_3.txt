The obvious vanity project Karin Mani (who?) How Hottie Charles Bronson avoiding wiping to "waste", which robbed his father, grandmother or grandfather or something, and impressive young hunks with her karate skills. In a key scene, she will intervene to stop the violence and police moron throws into prison, so that after a couple of cool shower scene and some abortion-dyke prison seduction she has to take the law into their own hands blah-blah-blah. I think there were a lot of movies like this? Scenario dumber than usual, you can believe that. Mani comes off as kind of exactly the type of show business, who will co-produce its own Death Wish major role, and I think that kind of sporadically endearing, but the film is clumsy apparatus. The competent actors will be wasted on the role of the bastard here, and will actively undermine fantastic grinder incompetent DA and the judge, who must be uncles producer.
