Guy to go for no reason ... I'll never get those hours of my life back. The guy continued judging identity and cheated on his pregnant wife. What was I thinking? How is the price to win anywhere? I realized that he loved his father, but in addition, that the film was completely meaningless to me. What was the purpose to walk so much, and going to the funeral of a stranger for no reason. How it enrich your life ??? Why do we have to see the old lady dies on her underwear ???? !!! Why ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I though it would be deep or something more interesting. I do not recommend this film to leave even while sleeping ...
