In the unlikely event that some young directors are reading these comments, I would like to offer some advice (free!), With the spectator's point of view. If you want to make a serious exotic adventure, do it. If you want to make a parody of exotic adventure films, go ahead. DO NOT attempt to do both at the same time, it does not work. For example, given the blunt "comic" character is killed and beheaded, and followed it up with an ape tree shaking and dropping coconuts on the ogre's head just makes you look like you had no idea what kind of movie you want to do. This is one sad, winding, cheap, racist .... you get the picture. A few clever moments, and a few glimpses of nudity by Kathy Shower (too stuffy here) is hardly worth your trouble. There is a reason, everyone forgot about the existence of this film. (* 1/2)
