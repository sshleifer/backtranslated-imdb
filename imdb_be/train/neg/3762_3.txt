I got this movie from Blockbuster in one of these pillars were you can get 5 movies for 20 bucks. I must say that I got my money on it. I waited an awful dialogue, bad monsters and shaky camera. Well, as said roll, two outta three is not bad. <br /> <br /> action is bad, but not as bad as some of the movies I've seen. Or maybe, I watched so many low budget movies lately I've lost perspective. There were some bits of action downright scary, but mostly it is, at least, High School Play level. <br /> <br /> TG for Snow in this film, probably the second worst part. The first thing I thought when I saw it (and I noticed another reviewer agreed with me), the man in the monkey suit would be better. Clumsy animation stop-motion would look better. <br /> <br /> So, you may ask why I call the CG second worst part. This is because the very worst part of the film's sound effects. They are loud, annoying, and adults. I camp, I know I sound like insects in the forest at night, and while they can be loud, they are not deafening, as the cacophony in this film. Usually, when the "background" sounds drown out the dialogue of the film, it's bad, but from what I caught a dialogue of this film, I did not miss much. <br /> <br /> The lawsuit was frequent and sad. The voltage does not exist, as it was any sense of empathy with the characters. Talking about the characters, they were all cookie cutter and bland. Only mildly attractive episode was between ... In fact, I can not think of anything. There was a line or two that made me smile Wan, but that was about it. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was decent, a step or two above what you usually see in a movie like this. Nevertheless, he still had that "home video" quality to it that you get the films made on the pocket change and prayers. <br /> <br /> If you're like me and enjoy the tiny budget movie genre, and you can see it is one dollar bin, think about capturing him. Otherwise, stay away at all costs.
