DEAD HUSBANDS is a bit silly comedy about a bunch of female collusion drench each other husbands`. It`s not dramatically bad as some comedy I could mention, but he never fufils their potential. Imagine how good it would be if we were brothers Farrelly directing Ben Stiller in the role of Carter Elson. <br /> <br /> About Carter is based on Jerry Springer? Just wondering because the catch phrase on Dr Elson`s show "look at each other and go on to say"
