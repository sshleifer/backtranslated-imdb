Stars from "MITCHELL", from the director of "sticks" and "Avenging Angelo" !!! These slogans, which are usually kept me to see this movie. And the worst part is that all of the above statements are true !!! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker is eating every second five minutes into the movie. It's like a bad remake of Â«Bluff Coogan in"
