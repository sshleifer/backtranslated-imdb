I'm sure there are some IMDB cult who likes movies that MST3K mocked. After watching how this "werewolf" and read dozens of comments about how underated they are, I am convinced that there is some conpiricy happening here. Alot of people say that the people who hate him "afraid of blood only," "I do not know, good horror," or things like that. Well, I do not really care about the gore, but I want something that will happen in the movies! Most of them are just the woman sits and looks around! Or walk around the house / garden! The film needs something to give it atmosphoere, you do not get it, just meaningless scenes were someone walking around and looking. Oh, and "makes you think"? Yes, I thought, "MOVE! YOU @ # $% & 0 !!" One of the worst horror movie I've ever scene! <br /> <br /> P.S. For the record, I'm a big fan of the old-style horror, Dracula, Frankenstein, this kind of thing.
