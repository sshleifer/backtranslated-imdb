Something I really like short films of this woman was uncertainty topic -. Especially in "Life with Happiness" This movie has some nice start - unusual location and the potential for an amazing cinematic treatment, but can not succeed with clunky exposition dialogue spotty performance and very telecast <br /> <br /> This is another charming and very TV. conventional cinema. Ideas are so fleshed out that they almost feel pat as in television commercials. But the mood is good, so we can not complain too much. <br /> <br /> I really would like to see the director to do a full length animation and try to work with a producer who does not require much boring clarity.
