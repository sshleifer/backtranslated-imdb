I got this movie, because I worked in the store a movie, so I got a free rental. He came, and the cover made it look good. Hot chick holding a weapon, well, I'll check it out. <br /> <br /> Oh man, a bad move. It was so awful, I spent half the movie to watch in fast-forward to get to nudity, which was minimal. I think three scenes of partial nudity. <br /> <br /> cheesy dialogue, trash violence, poor excuse characters. I feel bad putting this film down, because I know that it was done on a cheap budget, but it was "Clerks," and he became a cult and franchises. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
