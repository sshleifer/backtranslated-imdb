Vijay Krishna Acharya on «Tashan» is stylized over-hyped product. Of course St. one of the most stylish films, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject it. Why? The script of films as an amateur, as a 2-year old child. Scenario King, without a good script even the director of all time can not do anything. Tashan produced the most successful production banner «Yash Raj Films» and mega stars in it. But nothing on earth can save you if you are unleavened script. Thumbs down! <br /> <br /> performance: Anil Kapoor, he is a veteran actor. But how could he normally role like this? Akshay Kumar is a great actor, in fact he is the only saving grace. Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot. It looks amazing and leaves you all rise. Saif Ali Khan is not getting proper here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma wasted. <br /> <br /> «Tashan» is a sad film. The failure of the film at the box office, you should stay away.
