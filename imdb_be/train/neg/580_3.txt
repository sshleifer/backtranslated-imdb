In fact, a bad film, the plot is too simple and predictable and the poor, which acts as a supplement. <br /> <br /> The story of this vampire hunter is the worst that I've seen so far, Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi), Mexico goes in search of some blood suckers! he used some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to Blade), and is part of a hunting Wang Helsig vampire net? well, but he works alone. He was appointed to the persecution of the powerful vampire queen, who in search of some black cross, to perform a ritual that will allow it to be invulnerable to sunlight (it is almost a continuation of the Vampire (1998), directed by John Carpenter and starred James Woods), Derek started his quest in search Queen with some new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, very bad, acting as) a teenager with no experience, Rodrigo's father (Cristian de la Fuente), a Catholic priest, Zoey (Natasha Wagner) specific vampire and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary), another expert hunter vampires. So he is not alone, obviously, in this adventure <br /> <br /> You can start to feel like this film is just to watch him lead actor (Jon Bon Jovi). a huge difference in the current quality compared with James Woods, and then, when you are watching a movie (I do not recommend this piece), you will participate in one of the simpler stories are predictable, with horrible acting performances, really bad special effects and incoherent Events!. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend not to watch this movie!, shoot another movie, watch a different channel, go out with friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 3/10
