Tim (Gary Daniels) desperately wants to break into the major television reports. If the work that he asked goes awry, he is fired. Its beautiful, but empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) said Sayonara is, too. Arriving home, Tim was surprised to find that his house has the intruder (Christopher Lloyd) from the planet Mars! Calling his uncle Martin, Tim soon tries to help his new friend navigate life on Earth. But Martin gets into trouble wherever he goes, with the en-suite laundry and much more. Excellent Lizzie (Daryl Hannah), finally sees an opportunity to make time with Tim, but the course of true love does not operate smoothly in this case, either. Soon all on TV Tim pursues, in the hope of true story of an alien. What should a person do? For those who loves the old TV show of the same name, with Bill Bixby and Remus Walston, this film is not worthy to tie the proverbial boots. It really is certainly awful, no story, and depending on the intended special effects that fall flat, too. Daniels in the order as an Earthman, but Lloyd just awful, as a foreigner, replays storm. The rest of the cast is adequate, as well as costumes, set and production details. Even if your children see the cover and ask for this film, to convince them to choose another movie in the video store. Be sure children and adults will find this film a tremendous hole, so that the choice in favor of the Night at the Museum, or Around the World in 80 days instead.
