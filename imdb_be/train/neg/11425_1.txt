I do not know what it was about this film that made me react the insides against him. Maybe it's the characters that have not been unpleasant compelling enough to take care of. Perhaps it was unorganized plot. Perhaps it was the fact that Rob Lowe wore a long dangly earrings and eyeliner. Perhaps it is because at some point in the film they appeared in the song. Perhaps it was because the 1980s was never that 80 years. Perhaps it was because it was catchy hyperbole. Perhaps it was because the character fist pumps while driving away from the camera during a fade. I do not know what it was that made me hate it so, but if it means trying to see it again, I do not want to find out.
