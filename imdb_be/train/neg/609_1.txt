It was an absolutely awful movie. Nha lured into Christopher Walken and Michael Ironside. Both great actors, but it should be just the worst of their role in history. Even their great acting can not redeem ridiculous plot of the film. This film is an early Nineties US propaganda piece. The most touching scenes were the ones when the Colombian rebels made their case for revolution. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared fake, and its pseudo-love with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional cork in the film, which was devoid of any real meaning. I am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining the good name as an actor Christopher Walken in. I could hardly sit through it.
