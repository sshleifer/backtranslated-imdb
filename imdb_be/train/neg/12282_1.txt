It was one of the saddest "horror" movies I've ever seen. Child College epidemic has nightmares related to roaming spirits in Alcatraz. Trying to put a mixture of "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and the standard vampire fare in the form of a bad 80s music video, this film is stuck full of bad acting and slow-moving story exhaustively. Although being so bad, and often ridiculous movie (dig these mullet and terrible dialogue), this would be a good material for substitution during an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Do not be fooled by the mention of the film being the proud winner of the 1987 Silver Scroll Award Sicence Academy Fiction, Fanatasy and horror, or the Virgin contributes to the soundtrack that if Toni Basil plays a role in the film. This is a huge disaster, albeit one with a small cult following (see other comments IMDb for this film).
