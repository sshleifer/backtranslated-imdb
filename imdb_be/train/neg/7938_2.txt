Family looking for an old roadside attractions to include a coffee table book of his father meets an ancient, decrepit one-eyed freak show runs eccentric. If their family van breaks down when you exit the sideshow, they are forced to stay in an almost abandoned fishing camp, which was the site of a prison break decades before. <br /> <br /> There has been a lot of movies in the "freak" of horror sub-genre, ranging from favorite Tod Browning's "Freaks" (1932), Alex to winter fun, "speckled" (1993). This is a classic (or soon to be "freaked out"). 'Side Sho', but it never will be. And if it ever does reach classic status. ,, Well, this is obviously the key to the sad state of our genre. From the ridiculous bad opening lyrics to the 17-year-old daughter, who is clearly older than her own mother, this film is not so much going for it. Drafting was subpar, but not quite awful. ,, Just boring. The direction was poor, and rare freak effects were pretty awful and unbelievable. The acting was terrible and the cast was even worse. Whoever would have believed the age of these two teen-age camp should not have met the teenager in a long, long time. It was far enough away from the gore and violence to compensate for the absence of any other quality. ,, And when there was little violence, it was not well done at all. And I can not forget to mention the end of the fight scenes, which were, in all honesty, some of the worst I have ever, ever seen in the film. In general, it is easily forgotten and poorly made horror film that deserves to be left alone at the bottom of the bin dollar <br /> <br /> The verdict :. 2.5 / tenth
