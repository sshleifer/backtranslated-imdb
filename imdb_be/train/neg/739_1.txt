Hines and Goforth, the perpetrators of this crime, starting on the wrong foot first step, assuming that Wells wrote gothic horror, and that all of his lines are designed to be taken lightly. This is simply not true. Wells was a heir of the Enlightenment, and his main concern was that the Victorian complacency can leave the British prepared for the world new technology can produce - both good and bad <br /> <br /> Two. terrible consequences follow - the main character is portrayed as a snotty screamer (it reminded me of Fay Wray in the original King Kong), and not a man struggling to live paradoxes incredible disaster; and dialogue smacks «Victorianisms» spoken seriously that Wells is clearly meant to make the language in cheek <br /> <br /> All of this looks suspiciously like Ed Wood with a huge budget to spend on CGI effects -. which by the way is so badly done, Warner Bros. cartoon plant in the 1940s could have been done better. (Lots of blood-spattered looked like red balls, I expect them to float away at any moment.) Think of The Yellow Submarine, as was done under the old EC comics. <br /> <br /> What's worse is the loss of threads that are robbing the film of any reason to exist. Despite the fact that the creators of this film is the story of his return of the Victorian era, they did miss a supernatural way of the history of Wells predicted many of the horrors of the First World War - a fact that is not unnoticed by Wells, who after the war, reworked the theme in the form of things. <br /> <br /> No subject, all we have here a lot of people running around getting blown up in cartoon balloons, if they do not try for the production of a high school student rewriting drunk Macbeth. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is the worst, the most inane piece of bullshit I've been through since then one has persuaded me to see the Eastern European animation "Fantastic Planet" Thirty years ago, this film was so intricately sad, my friend and I and two strangers refused to ridicule him about halfway through, and sat down next to the playing cards screen, using the film as the light by which to see the card - its only usefulness as far as any of us could say. <br /> <br /> But I already have electric lights in my apartment, so I do not need this landing Wells on anything. <br /> <br /> Do not avoid this film - to steal all the copies you can (do not pay a dime), and record each of them. God created us for this purpose only in his wisdom.
