Watching CBS's Â«Surrender, Dorothy", I thought, why Diane Keaton would be in it (not because it is a television film - with a lack of attractive roles slightly older actresses, it is not surprising why the Oscar winning songwriter, such as Keaton's turn to TV - but because he did not give any opportunities for Keaton shine). One mother, mourning the sudden death of her twenty-something daughter, imposes - and gradually become friends with - a group of young people, her daughter was close to the time of her accident. Adapted from the novel, the drama it gives us self-centered group of characters could cross the street to avoid. In addition to being rude and lackluster, these fake people incredibly unconvincing as a neat script and bungalows near the beach, where the children are living (a young man who wears a muscle shirt to tell us that he is gay, hears Diane Keaton says "capitulation Dorothy" really asks, "is from" the Wizard of Oz ", is not it?" ... no, genius, is from "citizen Kane"!). Keaton may have wanted to do this stuff on based on the subject of death confrontation. She's trying to make this clear nasty woman in the shadow of his Vlas yeah character (lots of kooky clothes), but it does not sit well with the audience, as Keaton always warm and friendly and flexible in a flaky mode. There is a mad harpy, who do not learn a lot of lessons on her journey of self-discovery (the film quickly forgets it on a dead young women and becomes an odyssey for nervous moms death, which seems to be overage hippies who never lost anyone close to it). it's a kind of movie promotion on a talk show, with the caveat "this should help a lot of grieving mothers out there." I can not imagine what help anyone, since it is typical depressant, confusing and unclear. This is crazy.
