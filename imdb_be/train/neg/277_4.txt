Lillian Hellman play, adapted from Dashiell Hammett with help from Hellman, becomes interesting projects to come out of the rough Warner Bros. Paul Lucas, reprising his Broadway role and won the best actor Oscar, plays the leader of the anti-fascist underground struggle against the German fascists, dragging his American wife and three children across Europe before finding asylum in the United States (through the Mexican border). They settled in Washington with a rich mother and brother of his wife, although the border residing in the manor immediately suspicious beginners and spends a lot of time down to playing poker at the German Embassy. It seems to take forever for the drama to find its focus, and when we realize that the heart of the material (the wise, honest, direct refugees Sermons ignorant, head-in-sand Americans as the world suddenly changed), it seems a little indulgent - the viewer is literally put in place of relatives who lectures. Lukas has several appearances in the third act, which, of course, earned him an Academy Award, but for most of the picture he seems small, but in and out, in and out. Like his wife, Bette Davis says, like anyone else, and runs her eyes wide good advantage, but the role does not allow her many colors. Their children (all with divergent accent!) Alternately humorous and irritating, and Geraldine Fitzgerald has no role as an offended wife (and irritated it brings texture to a part, seems to be completely wrong). The aim here was tasteful, tactfully show us just because (WWII era) people may be the Germans, that does not make him a Nazi sympathizer. We find that during the first few minutes; the rest of this elegant, tactful film consists of exposure, defensive confrontation and, ultimately, compassion. It must be a heady mixture, but instead it is quite dry eyes and inert. ** from ****
