Murder By Numbers is one of those films that you would expect to made for television, but it is not. Given only an actor of any mention Bullock (although Michael Pitt seems to be moving on to bigger and better things), it is no big surprise that this film is fast disappearing from the memory that will be replaced with more important things. How to ... remember to lock the front door when you leave.

Along with his new partner (the wet look that Ben Chaplin), it is called to investigate the murder of a young woman. Nothing unusual there except that the criminals a couple of teenage students who think that they planned and carried out the murder. As a consequence continues wills fighting arises between the prime suspect Cassie and Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling). <br /> <br /> devastating issue here is that the two wires are bad. Bullock, although it is very nice to look at, is about as plausible as hardened cynical cop Rodney Dangerfield (in fact, it would be better!). Chaplin, for his sins, is complete without a legal entity, and I feel sorry that he has to put this film on his resume in an attempt to break into Hollywood. At least, Gosling and Pete as condoning mocking suspects justify itself adequately. As if brisk lead were not bad enough, a story that will send anyone to sleep and very predictable (but not logical) end of the shoot this film in his head before he has a chance to work. <br /> <br /> "Kill By NumbersÂ» has absolutely nothing going for it, even meaningless nude scene Bullock did not buy it. Well, just a little bit, but still not enough to save it. Forget predictable and excess - this is one film that is not going to move forward the police genre. As Cassie probably talking about its next event, there is nothing to see here people. Pass, move ...
