shit holidays this god awful. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes, and I thought that I was going to poke out the eyes of the estate Oedipus Rex. dear God. this film does not deserve more points than anything done by film buff high school. Please, save your money, this film has nothing to offer. if you do not use sleep and attractions in theaters. You know, h3ll, bring your girlfriend and do interesting things. you'll be the only ones there in any case. F @ ck this slideshow. <br /> <br /> E. Be careful. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend watching it. <br /> <br /> HELLO. <br /> <br /> you? <, Br /> <br /> I'm very well. <br /> <br /> enjoying the day? <br /> <br /> I am. <br /> <br /> This has been one-hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this movie daym. it's sad.
