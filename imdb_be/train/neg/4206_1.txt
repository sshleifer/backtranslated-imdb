I was at the premiere of the film at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997, after the show, when writer / director and some actors were asked to answer the questions, one could not even bother to ask anyone. Rarely a movie so badly aimed (why on earth were the occasional missed frames of some scenes?), Miserable acted (David Arquette, to paraphrase Dorothy Parker, does not work the emotional range from A to B. He parks at point A and bring lunch) and did senseless . Characters behave totally out of character for no reason other than to make the story move in certain directions. In the end, the film comes to a completely random and senseless end, which is supposed to "really make you think." Unfortunately, the fact that it makes you think there is, "Well, my life out there 90 minutes I ever not get back. "
