This is the biggest load of crap I've ever watched. NOT FOR RENT! The creators of this movie should be a group ever make another film. It starts with the fact that some of the plot, then goes out quickly anything. I think I'd like to watch paint dry then the same as looking at the cover. Actors were awful, the story quickly disappeared, filming remains much work to be done. Not one good thing to say about this crap movie. If you rent this movie you will spend your money. I really enjoy the National Lampoon movie, but it was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to act, to learn how to produce and direct the learning. I feel that I should sue this a-hole that made this film for the money wasted on the rental cost and time loss.
