Manufacturers have made a big mistake of pronunciation Mark Lester that he could not act or sing in the main role. In addition it is very bad "action," all singing Lester had to be duplicated girl. I do not know why they threw it at all, because there would be so many boys who could play the role of a much better and did their own singing, as well as . Shani Wallis was too old to play Nancy, which was only supposed to be 16. The current version of West End is much better than the film in all respects. McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time, and it is certainly much better looking than Jack Wild ever had. It was obviously a political reward dit of the old-fashioned music so many Oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968.
