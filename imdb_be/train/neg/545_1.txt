it is just an ordinary Indian debris that gets turned out as a movie, as Indians, we are proud to boast that we have the biggest film industry, but it is also the worst. <br /> <br /> how can other poor countries have movies with real characters that defy the opinion of their societies, and we just keep on pumping debris. look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, to look at the brilliant films that they have, and we get crap like Kisna !! <br /> <br /> get real people, not surprisingly, that the international community as a whole laughs on Indian cinema.
