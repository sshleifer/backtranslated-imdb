At first glance, this documentary / fiction / animation quite interesting and thoughtful. Of course, if something is thought, it can be carefully. The reality is that this film combines metaphysics with insinuations and unfounded conclusions. Link, which is "What do we know ..." would you see between science and spirituality, in fact, is not rooted in science in general. The study Transcendental Meditation is mentioned in the film, says that meditation group can reduce the level of crime in this area, Washington together in this case. In fact, the AFC (murder, rape and Sturm) crime rate was about 30% higher than in 1993. The average crime rate between 1988 ?? 1992. There have been absolutely no reduction in homicide rates during the study. In fact, every claim that metaphysics connects with science can and opened. <br /> <br /> My conclusion from this information is that this film is bad or an attempt to inspire people or a joke. In any case, I believe that you are not wasting your time. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for long winded movie about science, which can provoke thought, you might consider Mindwalk (1990).
