Several films have left me with a feeling of unease, and it's not a compliment. Since I saw it in the theater (How it ended up there I can only guess) I was subjected to 90 million hateful derived debris, the main impression is that a little bit like this other patient, the movie "Do not answer the phone" - but worse . muck all rape and all of this is shown without any distance (in contrast to the strong things like "The Last house on the left") and full of contempt for the (perfect?) Victims and everyone involved, leaving the viewer to be regarded as a sadistic voyeur. In the end, I felt like taking a shower. That there is no credit to director
