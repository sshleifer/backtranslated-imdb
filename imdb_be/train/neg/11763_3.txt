Yes. I admit it. I believed all the hype around this part of the work, about the trials and tribulations 6 people, who lives in Mexico City concerning their sexual life. And yes, I was really looking forward to finally see a Mexican film (aged), which would be popular and fun to watch. Unfortunately, the film was completely disappointing. History gives us two couples, both with a very obvious problem in the marriage. If a third party comes into the life of each pair, their problems reach the center point. Or absolute nonsense. The plot is then converted into battle sexes. The position taken by each group (yes, they are literally a group of girls with girls and boys with boys) defiantly silly and childish (I believe that the humor had to be there). And it all goes from bad to worse. Performances range from good (Miss Zavaleta) to mediocre (z-Bichir), with Serrano does an acceptable job at its opera prima. However, flat circumstances that make up the plot, one-dimensional characters, very bad (if not stupid) perception of what sex is in a mature relationship, etc., to make a film not. Unfavorable. SPyL had a (large) good reception at the box office. Believe cheating at your own risk.
