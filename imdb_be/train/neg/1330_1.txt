There is a reason why he does not recognize Jay Leno this film. He consistently has one of the worst films of all time. Actions are terrible, the script does not have the direction and the director himself, it seems, not sure which way to take this film. "Buddy Film", "action / comedy", "a mystery." It seems halfway through, he gives, and just for the trip. Jay Leno and Pat Morita talented and dedicated artists. It's a shame that they have wasted their time and gifts to make this movie a mess. Jay Leno and Pat Morita before involving yourself with that, he spent several years beat their products on the Hollywood circuit. Mr. Morita was already a star in her own right, acting at all times since the mid-1960s, as the star of the cult TV and movie classics like «Happy Days», and gloomy, but friendly "Mr. T and Tina." and she won the heart of America with its powerful role in the movie "Midway», «The Karate Kid» and many others. Mr. Len could be seen on TV shows since the mid-70s. And there was a top performer in the comedy clubs in America. It can be seen in countless television commercials, and in major films. It's a shame that they have agreed to be treated with this nonsense.
