There are really two parts to this movie. Firstly, it is ridiculously prologue to the film, which is so hysterical and cornball that could almost feel the way that "The Simpsons," Troy McClure should do the narration. <br /> <br /> Then comes the rest of the film (starting with the title song, which does not really fit into the rest of the film), who, while technically OK, killed unclear, inconsistent and unconvincing plot, rather than simply not interested in the characters, but the characters that make no sense. <, Br /> <br /> This is especially true with Spiventa Mickey Rooney, who was reportedly in the area and part of the "organization" is constantly yet, what could have happened if the taxi driver made a seemingly arbitrary decision to take him with me, when the flash? In this case, it would be totally superfluous and unnecessary in nature, that in the end he still is. <br /> <br /> In general, the problem of the film is that it does not want to put any details about who or what is behind this conspiracy. It's as if the filmmakers did not have the courage to keep in mind that a particular section of society will be able to create an organization and instead settled on the hope that no explanation would suffice, and the audience will form their own conclusions. <, Br /> <br /> Simply put, the movie will not work at all levels.
