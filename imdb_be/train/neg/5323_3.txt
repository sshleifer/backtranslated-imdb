I can not believe that in 34 previous comments, nobody said that this film is a blatant rip-born yesterday. The man hired to bring the supposedly dumb blonde gangster to requirements. Hired gun blonde and fall in love and live happily ever after. Gangster is in trouble. But Born Yesterday it was intelligent treatment, whereas it is just so much fluff. Transfer Technicolor on DVD badly. Natalie Kalmus will rollover to her grave. Check newsboy. Recognize him? However, it is historically interesting to see the roots of rock and roll. Also interesting is the introduction of Ewell on CinemaScope, a new format at the time.
