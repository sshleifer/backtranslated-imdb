This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. From the graph, although the shots, "special effects" that acts, and did I mention the story? Every thing in it sucked ass <br /> <br /> This is a good example of that "do more" means, and I'll try to explain: <br /> <br /> I know that the creator of this film is trying to do ; it had to be one of those movies that you can not tell what the hell is going on until the very end. Sitting mesmerized, not knowing who is dead and who is alive and who killed who and why, and just when you think you've got the schedule right, you will know that you are wrong, and the film ends - leaving you with mouth open over the next 5 minutes! Something like ''s Unbreakable "or" work "if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> But Olga Levens, the author of this stuff, yes, Olga ?? Writer, director, producer, writer, author, Custer, production designer, art director, costume designer, as well as a double for one of the characters in some scenes ... it's mostly one woman movie, and when it comes to Olga Levens with "Levens Productions", you can not go wrong :-) <br /> <br /> well, it may come as a shocker, but "this time" Olga over did it a great time jumping from one scene to another, from dream to reality ... but wait! it's all a dream, after all ... or is it ??? Picture fades and did not understand any of this happened, the girl was all alone on the ship ... in fact there was not one ship ... no wait! In the same boat again, guys! They're alive! Thank God! A lot of them called her to join a cruise ship ... but then disappears, so maybe they're dead yet ??? or perhaps they were never alive to begin with ??? <br /> <br /> If you understood what I just said, that you could have this film - otherwise, it's a sad piece of work, and the only reason why I put through all this crap to figure out how the hell they finish the film ... <br /> <br /> do not watch it if you value time ever 90 minutes is waste in this case ...
