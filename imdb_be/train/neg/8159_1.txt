This only applies to the first film by name. The plot has nothing to do with the first and only movie stinks !!! I have no idea what they're thinking, but this film is so bad. Avoid this at all costs, the first film in the series is acceptable as a slasher flick, and so is the fourth, but it is one and the third garbage !!
