After a great action star, who fell to the ground ends up in a small town with a problem with the drug dealers and the corpse of a federal agent. Reunion with some former co-stars for the city cleaning. <br /> <br /> Low-key, often to the point of lethargy, "action" comedy basically just does not work. Part of the problem is the casting of Chris Klien as the former action hero. He is not bad, but it is not really believable as somebody who was taken to be a tough guy. Like I said, he is not bad, it is simply just for being miscast his back story. The real problem here is the combination of the script, which in fact it is not funny, and it seems artificial pores, and the direction that the pedestrian to the stupidity of the port. There is no life in the way everything is set up. Its as if the director had a list of shots and went through the list. This makes it attractive for non-movie. Still, the film sometimes comes back to life, for example, in the final show down, which ends the film. This sequence of works, but because the earlier parts of the film floundered it drains much of its power. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this film. It should be shot, if you're a fan of actors or a big fan of independent cinema in all its forms, but otherwise it's just frustrating.
