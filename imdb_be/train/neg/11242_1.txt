I saw this film last month in the free preview, and I left. It was pretty awful. In the process of trying too hard, they are operated and made an awful movie. I was disappointed as I felt, all the actors have done a respectable choice in the past, so this could not be further from the truth - but I was wrong. I was hoping that they give out a survey at the end of the movie, so I could tell them not to release the film. I was lured by the free preview aspect, but it turned out it was a waste of my time - and, as a rule, I am very fun-loving. He was trying to be innovative and creative with shots, ideas and filming, but because they are thrown together so many ideas at once, failed. I'm not usually picky about the films, and I usually do not feel the need to reflect their opinions about movies, but I have to warn everyone not to look. I checked on the IMDb just say to all of you guys
