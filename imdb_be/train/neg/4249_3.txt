I did not even know that this film existed until shortly after seeing Blade: Trinity, I did not do anything on board the Trinity, when I saw some kind of user is already a series Wes Craven is much better than "shit" that blade, so I made my rapid research: check points and at IMDb RottenTomatoes Dracula: Ascension, and somewhere along the search, I learned that it is a continuation of Dracula 2000. I also noticed that the boards of Wes Craven Dracula was a real strong future for this film, which is a big contradiction scores I have seen. <br /> <br /> Now let's take a quick personal summarized here. I remember, Dracula 2000 and I remember, if you do not love him at all, and then seeing many Dracula: Ascension just lowered my expectations even more, but then again, I'm a person who really needs to watch the movie itself (any movie) so that I can form my own opinion. <br /> <br /> I went to a couple of things to know, when I started to watch this movie, it's a low budget, so due to the fact that I'm going to ignore a lot of the V / FX and easy to understand that this will be offset by history and actions, I too was a little surprised by some of the casting in this film (Jason London, Roy Schieder and Jason Scott Lee) <br /> <br /> Oh Geez ?? This film was CHEESY! But cheese can be interesting, at least I found it pretty fricken ridiculous, bad audio sync from being overwritten dialogue in several scenes, the stupidity of the characters in this film. Of course, they all knew about vampires and some of the basic things Luka even had a book on it, but it does not give them the desire to get deliberately "infected"? No, it's worse, then click Slicer, where the girl should come out of the shower and check the noise she hears nothing more than a towel on. <br /> <br /> I must have blinked, too, at some point, because I do not know how "Dracula" received the clothes on his body, especially because he's a big wild and angry and I think if I was in this situation, I would not have wanted to be one of his bandages. <br /> <br /> Thus, the film ends, as any average film trilogy ?? it is not so, instead of a "Cliff Hanger", where I am now waiting to receive "Heritage" Party 3. On entertainment value cheesy movies.
