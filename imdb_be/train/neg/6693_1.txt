Run away from this film. Even by the standards of this B-movie horror film. Also insidious is the theme. The main theme is that the people who reject the society and have no respect for what is cool and not get involved. People belonging to others with respect and who lost. Guncrazy is a film that speaks for itself powerless much better than the movie, to see instead. <br /> <br /> No normal child would do something that makes Trent. State Troopers do not work as they do in this movie, etc. Seeing this film makes you understand why the authors use a prostitute-with-heart of gold cliche. Mija entirely unsympathetic prostitute who so was a terrible life. Nevertheless, it is such a horrible person audience can not identify with it. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, there is one thing, the film can be recommended for, in this case. It's such a funny movie he insults a person who is trying to identify with the protagonists. Actions adequate standards of a B-movie and the direction is nothing new or interesting.
