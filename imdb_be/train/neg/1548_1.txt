Lorne Michaels once again proves that he has absolutely no business, film production. <br /> <br /> You might think that after such a dismal clicks «Superstar», «Night at the Roxbury" and «Coneheads", he began to get the idea that maybe he does not know what he was doing, when it comes to movies (and many would argue that he does not know what he's doing when it comes to television, as well). Trying to make feature films with sketches that wore out their welcome for the third time were made on SNL does not make sense. <br /> <br /> I personally like Tim Meadows, and I think he will be great in the right film, It's a shame to see a talented guy, unused in the film, which shows unfunny after unfunny situation, and caps it all a monstrously bad song and dance scene. Either there will be laughter, because the film is so bad, not because it's funny. <br /> <br /> Well, at least we can be thankful that there are many other tired SNL characters who will never be movies made about them, it's just too bad that this is one of it on the big screen.
