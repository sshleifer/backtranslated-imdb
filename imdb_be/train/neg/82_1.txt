This movie sucks. It's really a waste of life. The action was brutal, the story is completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people are "terrorized" in this "mad killer", but it is not able to resist in any way. And this after they take a raft in the campaign, without equipment, and show at the campsite, which is already assembled and is fully equipped with food and clothing, and the daughters of headphones. Moreover, after their boat disappeared, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then her daughter's boyfriend just shows, and they apparently do not believe that they could just walk out of the forest, as he did to reach them. As I said, this movie sucks. Complete joke. Do not let your girlfriend tell you to look at.
