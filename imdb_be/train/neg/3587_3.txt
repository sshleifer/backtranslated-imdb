As they can with Joe Don Baker (as Bufford Pusser in the first sequel) to the fact Swenson (as Bufford Pusser in the second sequel) .Why did they do that for.Just Since Svenon It looks more like a Bufford Pusser they still have to " nt changed it because it was the first sequel to Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and one of the things I'd like to see in the second sequel. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie 7 out of 10 and I would give it 1 out of 10 when the story did'nt have anything to do with Bufford Pusser life, but it was and why I gave this film 3 to 10. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend that anyone who intends to watch the cheese, I propose not to look, and the first sequel instead.
