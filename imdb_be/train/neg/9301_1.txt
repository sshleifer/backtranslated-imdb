Spoilers ahead if you want to call them that ... <br /> <br /> I almost recommend this movie just so people can really see 1/10. Where to start, we'll start from the top ... <br /> <br /> the story: Do not believe the room - the film has nothing to do with abandoned cars, and people finially understanding that mysterious incident there. It draub, basic, go to the movies with a cabin entirely intensity or "effortÂ» <br /> <br /> screenplay :. I usually give credit indie writers, it is hard work when you start ... but it is crap. History of the flat - it leaves you numb the whole movie. Dialogue is extremely weak and predictable boasting a line, "Wow, you totally freaked me out" and "I was wondering if you could uh ... if you want to..uh, you come to the salon with me? ". It makes me want to tear my hair, one strand at a time and feed yourself <br /> <br /> The characters :. Holy shit !!!! Some of these symbols are described as flat, I want to go one step further and say that they actually have a reversed arch .. In fact, they start working on a parallel universe, and almost begin to act in the opposite direction ... <br /> <br /> actor: worse than the actors characters. They take the poor already written symbols and add them to a terrible high school drama activities. "Wow, you totally freaked me out," it was said in such monotonous and slow - as it has been dumbed down. I could complain about for a few hours only actors <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL :. LIGHTING: eight years would have been disappointed with the lighting in this film. Too dark in areas as bleach in the other. The director must not use light as an emotion, as he does not know how to light the main scene properly. Baby Steps! SOUND: What sound guys does it take to make really Shotty sounding movie? 9. Given that many sound guys it must sound strange, but quite the opposite happened. There is one scene in particular that really sticks out, these guys are driving in the car and the car sound varies with each view .... WEAK! . Camera: Learn how to use it <br /> <br /> In any case, I ran to complain about the place ..... RENTAL - I have the right ... Rent, and learn from him ... give him 1 rating..it It deserves. <br /> <br /> Conclusion on ... Amanda Christmas
