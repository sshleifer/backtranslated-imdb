Question for all you girls out there: If he does not meet you `accidentally called you on the objectives and continued to do so in the most indiscreet moments you will be intrigued by it so volnovalis` d call the police? That`s Yes, I thought, so I can not swallow the idea of ​​Marti Gerard tolerate unwarrented attention Connor Hill <br /> <br /> ***** Mild SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> This is a very silly story. Connor Hill`s wife killed, and the plot revolves around the question of calling Marty Connor so that he can have an alibi? But there `massive gap in the logic here, not imagined Connor used the killer? the charge seems to be ignored. And there wasn`t any forensic examination of the crime scene? So why all the judicial vacation Connor calling Marti at the time of the murder? Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. And it`s as predictable as it is brainless. <br /> <br /> My abiding memory of this film is that for someone who has done the Winter Olympics Marti Gerrard is really shit skiers
