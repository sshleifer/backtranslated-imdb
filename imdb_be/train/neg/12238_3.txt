The concept with the potential, and it was fun to see these two icons holiday together, but ... <br /> <br /> glowing nose of Rudolph does not require "explanation" offered in this film - just like The Force in the film star wars does not need an explanation Â«medichlorians in blood." But mostly, the film left me cold because of the complicated plot Winterbolt, to kill Santa. He has the power to put the proposal in the minds of men, so why he does things in a roundabout way? Violation of the nose magic Rudolf framing of Rudolph, threatening to set fire to the freezing of the family ... The comedically exaggerated parts of Pinky and the Brain and "Phineas and Ferb in the" Dr. Doofenshmirtz (which are made in this way on purpose and played for laughs) seem simple and understandable in compared with Winterbolt, which we expect to take more seriously. <br /> <br /> There is a particular (and funny) strange moment when a character throws her two guns on the bad guy, like a boomerang, I understand if they do not want to have a gun shot in the family film, but then why have a weapon in first?
