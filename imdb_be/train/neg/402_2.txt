To describe this film as garbage unfair. At least rummage debris can be an absorbing hobby. This film was neither absorbing nor entertaining. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon can act gave great chance, so there is no doubt that had the value IRS to settle, when he agreed to this difficult scenario. Mad scientist story «Hollow Man» was said earlier, it was better to say, it was said, without resorting to so many ridiculously expensive special effects. <br /> <br /> Most of the special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls men, women and dogs could be purchased in the early seventies. In the UK they were marketed as "Transparent Man (/ woman / Dog)", which can be where they got the name for this film. <br /> <br /> Smart special effects, February scenario, there is no plot. <br /> <br />
