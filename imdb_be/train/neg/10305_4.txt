As an engineer, I have to say, the first season of the show started very promising. Most of applied mathematics was more believable, and the relationship between the brothers portrayed Eppes and his parents gave the show an interesting edge. <br /> <br /> But after the first season, the show began derogatory, it is difficult. Most math and technology used in tackling crime is now complete nonsense and very funny for all people involved in science and technology for real. <br /> <br /> The participation of actors still feels good, and I can imagine a fair amount of money still goes into the production of each episode, but in the end, it is degraded to a very unpleasant tasting dish that It is a mixture of thriller and class C shares of CSI-style police show. <br /> <br /> If you are going to watch, to go just the first season, and possibly part of a second. After that, I would not waste my time. I myself gave a concert halfway through season 3. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 8 Stars Season 2 - Season 3 5 stars - 3 stars <br /> <br /> To sum it up to 4 stars, As Charlie is really no longer knows his math, I'm not going to worry about the correctness of my too.
