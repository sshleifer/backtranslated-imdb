This is a film by Peter Falk. . Period <br /> <br /> I was 10 years old when this movie came out; I was already Maven film at the time. Of course, neither my parents nor I had seen this movie when it came out, but I was in love with a suit of their ads, and the aura that it was an important film. Well, 34 years later, I finally saw the movie - they'd never seen a Cassavetes-directed film earlier. He's a hack, as a whole. Zero sense of time editing. Genes performance reminds me too much of your stay Dustin Hoffman in "Rain Man": technically on the same level, but it is on one note. He stole Tom Cruise, "The Rain People" Falk takes the cake for this movie <br /> <br /> I was annoyed with the performance of genes, in fact all over -., Seemed better suited to the "awakening» (blecch!). It's not her fault: she basket case from the first scene to the last. We will never know why ?? But Falk's character seems real and performed excellent in Falk as a seriously flawed man. <br /> <br /> shave off at least an hour (need an editor!), and it would be arresting portrait of a woman is not under the influence, but a simple, Cro-Magnon man, who comes to grips with his wife, who does not work and so now can not cope with her three children and her husband works long hours. <br /> <br /> I d, and remember Cassavetes for «The Dirty Dozen» and "Rosemary's Baby." He would have been better if he cut off his own director tendency excess. - as he demonstrates this movie <br /> <br /> Bob
