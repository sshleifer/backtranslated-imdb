This film, although ostensibly a comedy, deadly serious. His Imperialism topic (with a capital I): as the United Kingdom, is foolish, embarrassing, trying to convince himself that it was still greater force after the Second World War. Empire house is run by idiots gentle, benevolent Tories who brought in so that they can not distinguish between close relatives; Government offices are composed of long-forgotten archives (dig at Orwell paranoia?) inhabited by rats loafers and staircases, where interior boring synacures, reading popular novels. <br /> <br /> Abroad, UK clings to the old pump; but the pump is out of context looks worn and stupid, especially if it is embodied in an awkward tweets. Carlton-Browne is a sentimental picture of decline, with none of tearfulness rot that marred the alleged anti-imperialist jewel in the crown. <br /> <br /> The film is also about the Cold War, boldly admit that this is a dangerous farce, whose members deserve the ridicule and contempt, not fear and respect. It is about how colonialism, characterized by neglect than tyranny, he destroys the colony desert, depriving them of the convenience, power, and, most importantly, self-esteem, making them vulnerable to the machinations of the dangerous cowboys. <br /> <br /> This is a serious, it is known that kills him. This does not mean that the tangible items can not be processed in a comedy - Miracle of Morgan's Creek, Dr. Streynzhlav and The Life Of Brian all proven. Indeed, one would assume that a serious topic should only be considered a comedy. - it allows more expressive eye view <br /> <br /> Problems with Carlton-Browne is that each situation should be relevant not only to the comic, so that it becomes labored and unfunny. In the three films mentioned above, most of the comedy arises from the reaction of the character in an emergency situation, not the emergency situation. Here, the script is too poor to support the rich comic characterization, and some of the greatest comedy talent ever assembled - Peter Sellers, Terry Thomas, Raymond Huntley and John Le Meserera. - criminally wasted <br /> <br /> Terry -Thomas, exalted so often shows that he could not cope with lead parts, and that he needs to play a mocking, proud, nya-limiters brainless Toffs. Music is made to bear most of the comedy, but its heavy irony, draws attention only to the lack of fun on the screen. (To be fair, unlike most British comedies of the time, which was unnatural and underproduced, then Boultings often tries to make their points through the film itself, the installation and composition) Huntley only manages to take a real laugh, and it's essaying. character, he could play in his sleep <br /> <br /> None of farces in Boultings' not from well - they never thought through enough. Although Carlton-Browne revels decline of the empire, he also seems to be anti-democratic and militarist. I'm sure it was not intended, but these mistakes will inevitably happen if you let the worthy intention to take precedence over intelligence and comic film form.
