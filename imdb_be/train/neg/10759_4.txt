In spite of the great future of touch design, clever space Azimov cool and reliable performance of Will Smith, this film did not meet expectations. Clich√©s come thick and fast; (Waking up from a recurring nightmare, a maverick cop has his badge withdrawn hardass lieutenant list will still indulge - you can see the end of a mile). This film also stagebound - you never feel like you've traveled anywhere; that there should be a global catastrophe never leaves the obvious CGI Chicago. Sami robots are good at close range, but the "crowd" scene look like a bad Disney -The CGI again and again overdone. And if you can destroy the robots, smashing them why they should inject "nanites"? You know that this film Duff, if stupid questions like this starts to bother you to the climax. This could be great, but it is less than the sum of its parts, mainly due to a predictable plot that could have come from any action movie of the last forty years.
