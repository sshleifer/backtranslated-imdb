I had high hopes for this film, as it has a Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But these hopes were dashed to the ground in the first 20 minutes or so. Palance was funny. Even without acting or beauty Heston Annabel Schofield (or short nude scene) can save this film. Some spatial effects were very good, but others were cheese. The plot was ridiculous. Even sci-fi fans should miss it. class F
