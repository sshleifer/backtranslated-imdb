The fact that I do not like the music very personal opinion, there is no historical innacuracies. I understand that this is opera, not a documentary, but some important aspects are missing, especiallly when other people comment is false because of him. <br /> <br /> Abbu Abbas was the mastermind of the operation, which was performed and was reorganized in connection with the opening on the board shiph, to release the 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons, one of which was Samir Kuntar, a vile terrorist whose history you can find by searching for "Klinghoffer Samir Kuntar" on Google. Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, even if he had never set foot on Achile Laura. Bin Laden had never set foot on the planes that hit the World Trade Center, is not it? <br /> <br /> *** possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The film is almost excuses the actions and reactions of terrorists because of the horrors they could live, always emphasize and exaggerate how many Israelis have done, to harm them. However, they never depict the pain that the Palestinians never plotted an Israeli. Good movie (quite the opposite !!!) images from Sabra and Shatila horror, and nothing is said, understating the common belief that it was Israel that was responsible, without mentioning that it was the Syrian-or-the Lebanese army, which carried out the massacre. <br /> <br /> The action was generally very bad, but I guess that is what you would expect from opera singers? <br /> <br /> On another note, I was shocked how people can justify terrorist murder of a hostage because the hostage tried to stir up the 400 innocent hostages against armed terrorists, and added that people should not be viewed sympathetically, because he 'I am a supporter of Zionism. Imagine how bad his wife, spitting on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea. I hope that nobody in the world is not as hard as it is (wink wink)
