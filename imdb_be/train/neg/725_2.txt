It was a terrible movie! Not for the subject, but also to deliver. I went with my girlfriend at the time (when the film came out), waiting to see the film about the joy of the human spirit over oppression. What we saw was hard 2:00 police oppression, without lifting at the end. The previews and ads said nothing about it! In addition, for all that they played to Whoopi Goldberg, I remember that she was arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the previews do not say anything about it! (Not what one would expect, but this is more of a problem). If I knew how depressing this film would be, I'd never seen it. Or at least I would have been ready for it. It was an advertising campaign bait and switch, and I will never see this film again!
