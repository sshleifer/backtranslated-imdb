I must admit that I did not finish this film, because it was so weird stupid and not worth watching. I watched it with the room, which is full of children who also do not laugh at stupid and rude humor. Directed by Bob Dolman, it seems to be so obsessed with sphincter and genitals, which are replaced by a true story that I grew up with. This is not good films for children! In addition, the content is so crude that the film is just stupidity has poor flow and has no intelligence behind it. Which is a waste of a perfectly good story. If you read the book, when you were younger and loved it, then do not waste your time to watch the film, which is so much spoil it, it makes you angry. Buy your kids a book instead.
