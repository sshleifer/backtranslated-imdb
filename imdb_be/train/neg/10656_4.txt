What can I say. The film Kamal Haasan be terrible. He works very well, but it's a terrible story, along with the terrible direction. In-kind look, director Gautam Menon should give up directing. There are many tragedies throughout the film. In addition, you can simply not believe how accurate were these horrible crimes. There has not been practical in the film. Gautham is simply not enough stories. But Kamal Haasan and zhyotika operate very well. Villains look too ugly, even though their performance was not bad. I do not think that this Sunday afternoon film as Padayappa, which you can see with your family. You do not get enough sleep to see this movie !! However, Harris Zheyarazh did a great job again, and that is why I gave this movie 4 out of 10. His song "Parta Modail NallaeÂ» soulful and soothing. In addition, a large cinema. Overall, this is just a bad, bad movie. Kamal Haasan, I think, should be dropped this film.
