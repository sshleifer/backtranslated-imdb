This film reminds me of some very bad sci-fi movies from the 50's and 60's.It not terribly interesting, but it's boring, cheese and stupid.Special effects funny, funny all the actors and ending just awful.Don't to spend money, rent or buy something better.I give it a 3.5 out of 10 (I found this pretty funny turkey because of their own stupidity).
