Interesting change from the first. there was more mystery to this film, the first. Even when you are ending your asking yourself what happened, who was a murderer. There are some good parts through the movie, the first half started slowly and then at half the pace picks up. All up a nice film. The history of 22 years after the events of the first film, Norman Bates from the psychiatric hospital and back to the Bates Motel, but when a woman turns up claims that his real mother, things start to go wrong. Perkins playing age Norman again good, and the scene at the end was beautiful, he waved that shovel terribly difficult.
