I do not think any movie Van Damme will beat the universal soldier, but never knows. This film was good, but not as good as the 1st. VD returns and Luke must fight again. He is trying 2 be funny here, but it might be worth a smile giggle. VD have a child at this time by Ally W., is well demonstrated Peak of them 2. Goldberg was cool, he makes his famous step-forgot what it is called, because I do not watch wrestling sucks. VD & Goldberg had some good fights. That was the end, as the 1st, but not that good. VD making it the best step in his career, as always, helicopter KICK. Although the final end should have been longer. Anyway, it's worth a look, but he will never lead the original.
