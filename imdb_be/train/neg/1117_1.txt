I do not know what the film is about, actually. It's like an art school student project. They never say, why the world is dark, but it's always dark in a matter of seconds in a day, with the exception of. There are long, interrupting shooting insects of all kinds without cause. What little dialogue there is in the film, as a senseless and meaningless, as the pictures. Black woman enters the apartment of the protagonist. Somehow she becomes pregnant during the night, then he gets shot in the head. The protagonist takes care of the body, until it becomes a cocoon, then white naked woman coming out. I've never been so shocked at how bad and pointless film can be. Honestly, I would like someone to see this so that they can tell me what they think about it. But I would not want this level of hell for someone else.
