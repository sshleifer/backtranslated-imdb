Payback game played in this drama and plot revenge destroyed absurd storyline that sets the stage for the fireworks that come later. Why do people participate with the trophy wife of a ruthless mob boss in his own house with suspicious gangster henchmen all around? Why unhappy wife encourage courtship completely unknown and waits for him to carry it with you and leave behind a husband and longing to live happily with her new love? Of course, the hero is Kevin Costner, have to wait for a reaction from the cuckolded husband who gives the film an excuse to indulge in senseless gore and violence. Anthony Quinn, a great actor, he definitely deserves the best, and Madeleine Stowe tragic figure who is severely affected, as it latches on her prince. Stowe is OK, but it does not work a Spanish accent. The cameos of smaller players are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland is interesting as a fading rock star.
