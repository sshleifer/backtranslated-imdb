If HEY ARNOLD! First aired in 1996, I watched it. It was one of my favorite shows. At the same time the episodes began to get shown again and again, so I'm tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching. I was kind of surprised when I heard about the HEY ARNOLD! Cinema, as it does not seem to be as popular as some of the Nickelodeon cartoon others, like SpongeBob SquarePants. However, not having anything better, I went to see the movie anyway. Going to the theater, I was not expecting much. I just expected it to be a dull film version of the cartoon provides children as the extraction film was. I believe I got what I expected. It was a silent movie for children, and nothing else. There were some good parts here and there, but for the most part, the film was a stinker. Just for kids.
