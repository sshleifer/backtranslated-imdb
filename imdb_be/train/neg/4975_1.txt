After they saw the Canadian / Icelandic / 2004 British production of "Beowulf & Grendel," which I thought was brilliant and stunning, I came to this - first of 3 new Beowulf movie of this year - with excitement. As soon as I heard the "Viking" and saw horned helmets, I groaned. It was the era of migration Swedes and Danes, Vikings and not (they came later). Even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (horn makes it easy for the enemy to bring down your sends, then you brain). Then there Hrolfgar palace, which looks like a set for a film about Greece or Rome, not the 6th century Denmark. Swords and armor look like props left over from previous films set in different historical periods. I noticed that the weapons could be used by the Crusaders in the "Kingdom of Heaven" and one character was even wielding Windlass Steelcrafts movie playback sword from "Beowulf and Grendel"! In addition to the main plot of the original poem, the writing was dull and acting entirely of wood and unconvincing. The largest UK was the secret weapon crossbow, complete with sighting frame and exploding shells that looked like something bought at the Iraqi insurgents. Special effects monster and his mother were on steroids so that Beowulf would have never been able to cut off his hands, as he did in his poem. Thank the gods for bazooka crossbows! I could go on, but I will not.
