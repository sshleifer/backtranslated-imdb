The first time I looked, Cold Case was after working for a year on Danish television. At that time, he came to the TV, he almost drowned in a 4 or 5 other US criminal show aired around the same time. <br /> <br /> I saw it and I was bored to death. The low-quality actors with samoopravdatsya persons and moral were pain in the ass. The entire premise that so much money was given a team of researchers to solve the murder dated 10-20-30 or even 60 years, it seems so unlikely. <br /> <br /> Time is also a factor, since they have only 50 -60 minutes to tell a story, which means that they get a break only in the nick of time to solve the case and bring justice surviving members family, if they are still alive. In conjunction with the "personal" problems and investigators relationship that there should be time for a show full of leaves dull. <br /> <br /> I give it a rating of 2 stars because the music I end which is really the only reason to view it .... you then, of course, will not do something that is too inaccurate the reason to watch this crap.
