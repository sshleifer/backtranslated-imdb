Admit to having fantasies about Brad Pitt is pretty hard to make the entrance to heterosexual. But what can I tell you? Maybe that extra-known fact that everyone is talking about and makes stars stars. It crosses this barrier. He pulls you into the unknown territory of the sensual and emotional. Brando was his spades, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean, of course, and in more recent times, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. Women fall in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and very very recently, Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt, alone, redefined the concept. He is the only reason to go out, get in the car, find a parking spot, buy a ticket, popcorn, and get into the theater to see "Troy" If you like epic in the style of "Jupiter Darling", you can enjoy this. But if not, it's like we want to Brad Pitt in the business.
