102 Dalmatians [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan of the previous games and this attempt has all the weaknesses of the first, silly laid plot, scared of acting Glenn Close, who hams each scene as if it is playing its own game, and incredibly Borring and uninteresting lead actors. Once again, the dog is the only "actors" who seem to be "real" and those stretches. Another wasted effort here. GRADE: D
