I could not believe some of the awful dialogue that comes out of the mouths of people, and the end of the coil is attached to the body mistakes the film was a real horn. And we get TITTY boom Angelico Pettizhon (sort of) and Loren Crabtree to download. <br /> <br /> teleportation is activated mental Angelico Pettizhona brings alien Container underground laboratory in the desert. According to director Fred Olen Ray, they were left out of the movie sets of Klaus Kinski, the ANDROID, gives the film a higher value is how cheap it looks. <br /> <br /> Inside the alien dwarf container (played by Ray's son), who begins to scratch a man to death. It was pretty fun to watch this little "creature" in a black suit reptile that looks like a large beetle shell, attached to it, which runs in the dark. We even get to see a little piece seal and tear on the poster the ET, which I thought was fun. <br /> <br /> And then something that looks like a snake, which is also released from the container, which kills in the death of William Fair, after the mini-creature chews Frank McDonald in the neck in the kitchen. Low-budget take on the alien, I guess ... <br /> <br /> All of this ends abruptly, looking like they ran out of film before the end of the drum lyapom come with subtitles. We are the lack of funding ... <br /> <br /> Fred Olen Ray also mentions in comments directed that they were not sure if Aldo Ray through to shooting and to remember his lines. He almost did. <br /> <br /> Low budget sneezing cheese. It's fun to watch, I will do it Ya. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
