Many days after watching thinking Hell, I still fear that any group of people will spend a lot of time to make such a disgusting film. <br /> <br /> No one should see this film in the hope that a result of learning about Ada Lovelock, her colleagues, or the product of its activity. <br /> <br /> In addition, no one should see this film in the hopes entertained. <br /> <br /> in the sci-fi movie, it would certainly be a terrible failure. Either way, the protagonist manages to bring the past to life and interact with it on your PC - with advice and encouraging words of Timothy Leary. I doubt that anyone could suspend their disbelief enough to keep it off, it seems absolutely absurd. <br /> <br /> In a dramatic film, it would certainly be a terrible failure. Either way, the writer / director has managed to fill the eighty-five minutes with constant, unnecessary, annoying and trivial drama of almost nothing. I doubt that anyone could feel that the whole drama in the film is just as annoying distractions. <br /> <br /> I believe that it is difficult to fully express the degree of contempt for thinking Hell. The circumstances in which I saw it do not let me leave the theater, but there is no doubt that I would have otherwise. I'm still angry that I wasted the time it took to see him. Only the fact that I could be more effective to criticize this film, I wish I was more clearly.
