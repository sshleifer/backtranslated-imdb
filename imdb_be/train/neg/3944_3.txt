The film My name is modesty based on the episode, which takes about one page on the 10th modesty Blaise novel called Night of Morningstar. He describes a case in which a young Modesty (17 in the book, in the mid-twenties in the film) maintains its leadership in the war over the casino. As it is established before the actual Blaise adventures of her trusted sidekick Willie Garvin is not in the film. This is one of the major problems, as the relationship between Blaise and Garvin, of course, always one of the most exciting aspects of the novels and comic books long. Another problem is that the film is quite simply an incredibly sad, because in fact it is only one small episode blown up in screenplay. The casting is OK, but Alexander herd is not very convincing as a character and really too old to play the role of a young modesty. I have the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution is to not lose the rights to the franchise Blaise.
