I watched this movie for the project of love. Please tell Nicolas Cage, to see what it would feel like to be his character, and then he says to re-read the line. My life can not go on ... I accidentally cut off his own hand ... my brother was there. Obviously his fault. And so, if there is a happy ending included a nice guy who cares about his mother bored and lonely. A lot of closure, bad script, and does not have a sufficient expansion of minor characters. Save yourself if your plan is for a good laugh. The costumes were made properly, and further made a fabulous job. I'm sure it would be a fun movie to do, but keep it more specific genre, I can not recommend this film to everyone I know, because it's not an intellectual film. This is not a chick flick. This is not strictly romantic. And I can not show the children for sex and questions to follow. Overall, just not a good film.
