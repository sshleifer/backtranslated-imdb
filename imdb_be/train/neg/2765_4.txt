As this film was made with a budget of 70 million dollars allegedly, and without being completely remodeled me. The storyline and dialogue for amateurish. Characters say things, not a real person never speaks, and almost never react to what was said earlier. It seems that no one should be grounded in the real world. Operate with a supply of cool, considering that writing such a hopeless ... but a few actors in supporting roles really drag down production. Hair hero, probably should have got their own credit, it was so strange attention- capturing ... not to mention the fact that he gave one of the best performances in the village. Finally, for a film about L.A. exasperates the giant reptiles, this film is surprisingly boring. What a shame! If you see this, your mind is constantly racing, coming up with ways that you could take SFX scene and built a much better film around them. Unfortunately, it did not take to much.
