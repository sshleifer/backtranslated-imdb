Hysterical thing about this film is that, according to the director, he has difficulty finding a distributor in the United States, because most of them, who saw her, she could not reconcile the seemingly contradictory messages of Christianity and American longing. The thought of someone seeing it as a religious film in any case it is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> As the Minister on a mission to pray with the homeless or wants someone "of Godspeed" which makes it "Christian" movie? Could be interpreted that it is actually mocking religion "affluent countries" with all its material abundance, better organized mission can be done manually with a bowl of soup and a bible verse. Many are bored or crushed, can be? Many useless homeless mission? How about a lot of psycho-Vietnam vets? Both tablets fish mad survivor agent "pink" we have to think America is the "land of plenty" paranoid patriots? Maybe we have a lot of the mentally ill? Of course, we do not have a lot of people concerned about the policy of Palestine on the basis of the main characters of a telephone conversation in the film. Of course, if you worked in a German orphanage for homeless unfortunate it would be much more concerned about the world in a distant country than their own personal survival, as the world knows, as Europe is the "Continent of Abundance", when it comes to perfection. <, Br /> <br /> In fact, I agree with the title in the end, as the United States, "land of plenty" and in this case it refers to the wealth of the poor script, amateur acting indifferently directed films. Life is too short, and one even American has "a lot" of time to spend watching this piece.
