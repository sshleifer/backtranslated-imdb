I saw this film with the intention of do not like. I'm sure that did not. This is one of those films that seem to have been made solely for the Oscars: music throughout the film in almost every scene, almost a profanation, established at the time is long gone, sepia toned imagery, pretentious title, NO SEX, and genius, who explains what he thinks, and concludes SFX / CGI, so we (the audience stupid) to get it. The only thing that has pleased me, though the fact that they were written at a price NOBEL mistakes! Instead, they call the Nobel Price (named after an actual person called Alfred Nobel) "noble-price" .. Jesus! How can I make such a mistake in such a big production, supposedly based on a true story. That deception! What do you and the other thinking RON?
