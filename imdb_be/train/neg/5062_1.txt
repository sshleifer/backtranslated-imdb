This movie is strange. Better put, it is «Freakin 'weird'. I could give you a short story, or some hoity toity analysis, but I think it's a waste of time. All anyone needs to know about this movie two young sisters, one of incestuous relations, murder, postmortem mutilation, and one very disturbing lovers. At the end of the film you feel like you have to go take a shower to wash the dirt away, but not in a good way as after the "Pulp Fiction" and "Fight Club." It's like you're a teenager (or a high schooler that I did as a teenager) and had just done something you wish you did not, and B: hope the good God of Heaven and Earth, that your parents will never know about. And no one likes. My advice is that instead of defiling his mind and watching a piece of meaningless cinematic mud, just go to spend their time on something a little less terrible and watch «Kazaam» (yes, I like to watch "Kazaam», than the " Maids killer ", read into it what you want).
