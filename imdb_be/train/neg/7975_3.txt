When I sat in front of the TV watching this film, I thought, "Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock, or even Brian DePalma, could do with that," Most likely, you will too!. It starts intrigueing. British park ranger lives in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) marries a beautiful, modest brunette woman (Lisa Zane), whom he met in the park just a short time ago. Then one day she dissappears. The police are unable to find any documentation that it had ever existed, and Firth holds its own search. So far, so good. Just as he is about to give up, he turns to his womanizing best friend (Billy Zane), and they stumble upon their former lives in a dirty underground of Los Angeles of drugs, nightclubs and ametuer film, and then to her history of mental instability, in Firth this moment life is in danger, and the film falls apart. None of the characters from the past Lisa Zane entirely remotely interesting. The film moves slowly, and there is very little action. There is a relative lack of money podagovor drugs, but this is just idle. Chase or cliffhanging sequences and no suspense. Just some stupid beatings and chat a lot on the boring characters. One thing worth noting, Lisa Zane Billy Zane's brother and sister, but they never appear on stage together. By the end of the movie, you are torn between wondering what could have been trying to get to sleep.
