I only lasted 15 minutes of self-preservation pulled me out of empty eyes saliva stupor that this film is easily induced and self-propelled me screaming back to the video store armed for bear. <br /> <br /> To say that the movie was bad would be a missed opportunity to use the words mixed up with characters from the upper keys on the keyboard (just to keep the comments clean). <br /> <br /> One should be avoided. <br /> <br />
