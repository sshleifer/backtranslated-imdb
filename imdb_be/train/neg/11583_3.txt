This film is quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first half hour or so. None of them does not generate any interest or positive response. I waited for scheming to start, hoping things will get better, and ultimately did not stick around to the very end, but there was no reward for it. <br /> <br /> If you want a synopsis, look elsewhere. For me, the action should not be told. Not that this story was that bad, I guess you could say, I had some problems with the script - ie. I thought it was smelly. A look at the credit will show you that there is a fairly strong cast here is used to no avail. Most of the old pros in the film does a good job; of the actors I have not seen a lot before I was particularly fond of Deborah Kara Unger. That's all that I can find good things to say about this picture.
