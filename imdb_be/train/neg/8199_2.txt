I'm about soooo glad I did not spend the money to go to the movies on it :-). This is nothing more than a compilation of elements from several other classic games like The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss, etc. Decorated in a rather dull and meaningless script. I really can not understand what was the purpose of making this film - it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline, which additionally is also meaningless. Also there is nothing to look at - look like FX'es were taken from the other hand store, you all have seen all of them in other films. But this is definitely a good lullaby.
