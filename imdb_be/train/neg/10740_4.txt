The film begins with a certain amount of promise; but, in my opinion, it is starting to lose it when the protagonist steals the Good Samaritan, who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. The fact that it is well meaning stranger starts to fix his car, while it is far from enough to make a phone call implausible, but it is one of the few in the country that can help him to put the life of his family on the go is the type of match budding authors warn against the use of in their history. <br /> <br /> I have found that the average film at best. Art Direction could be much better, as could be the cinematography. The action was good and so was Eva van der Gucht in singing.
