Another very bad, the lowest they can go here alone. Otherwise it would be easy to get scratch. Truly one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact, it was the name of Peckenpah never for things I never would have guessed that he did it. In fact, one of the people in San Francisco, I know I was on the set a lot and almost from dawn on, he said that Sam was just snockered. This is reflected in spades. Laugh a little at the beginning of the film is the only thing in this whole mess is worth a second look. Gig Young did not even watchable. This is a real test of masochism. If I was forced to the limits of the theater to see it, I would have jumped up with a cry. And now I really feel guilty watching it all from the borders of a very comfortable sofa, which was just too good to leave. What a mess, it seemed smaller than a written composition, as they went along. It's not just a bomb, but bmob spelled backwards. A guy !!!!!
