This film tried too many things all at once: caustic political satire, a Hollywood blockbuster, juicy romantic comedy, family values ​​promo ... the list goes on and on. She failed miserably at all of them, but there is enough interest, so I do not end up turning it off. <br /> <br /> While I appreciate the spirit of the WAR, INC., It depresses me to see such a clumsy effort, especially if it will make its aim to reflect the absence of the existence of serious criticism, not just bad writing shape, direction and production of this particular film. <br /> <br /> there is a criticism to be on the corporatization of the war. But making fun of him, so that reduces the real cruelty is happening. It reminds me a bit of the Three Kings, who also trivializes the true cause for concern.
