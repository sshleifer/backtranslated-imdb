I chose "The dead creatures," because I thought it was a zombie movie the same way as "28 days" or so ... but not quite. It's not even a horror film. Nothing happens for a group of women who seem to have been infected by a strange virus that makes her eat human flesh to survive, but. <br /> <br /> That story creates a series of disgusting scenes of cannibalism ... <br /> <br /> It is a very bad movie <br /> <br /> * May rate :. 2/10 <br /> <br /> ------------------ <br /> <br /> ------------- - ---
