This movie is terrible. The script is bad, it's mediocre script, and even the sex scenes are not worth anything. The excitement and intrigue of the original film are completely absent. This movie was filmed in a dark, dark and monochromatic style (a la "War of the Worlds"), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. brooding character Greg Morrisey reflects one facial expression throughout the film. Twists and turns of the plot of the original are lacking here; the few that there are simply disappointing. The only highlight is the performance of Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell, exactly went on in this sequel, but this is not enough to make up for other shortcomings. The only circumstance under which must be taken "Basic Instinct 3" if Michael Douglas agreed to join the cast.
