"This show is" Malcolm "on FOX channel really does murder ... we can not make our own version?" I think, and to paraphrase, of course, but in our hearts, we all know that this is true, and that the only thing that NBC added to the metric of "Malcolm" had sex. And boy, they add sex ... <br /> <br /> Thirteen-year-old Tucker gets the slip and covered him with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally trips on his aunt in the shower, and she accuses him watching her and beat. He spies on the cute girl next door from the bedroom window, and she knows that he wants to see her topless, but she teases him, smiling and closing the window. And all this is in the pilot. <br /> <br /> Take it from an adult Man-puberty boys as sex-crazed and eggs drive is impossible to make it funny for a wide audience. Only time anyone ever been close to a movie, and you can count those on one side. So there is nothing surprising in the fact that «Tucker» is the warmth and appeal of a strip club bathroom. Or network really think that we would like to see children struggle with puberty? It is not that the things people go to jail? If in doubt, consider this debauchery show 13 episodes were filmed, but NBC canceled after only 4 episodes on the air; They then took the unprecedented step of "burning out" the remaining episodes airing their AT MIDNIGHT so the children could not see them. It is irrelevant, since the children were initially target audience. <br /> <br /> In addition to its general scuzziness Tucker has worked voiceover of the main character to flesh out the bad writing. Even in 2000, he was badly dated, with its ska music randomly and super-sarcastic. I did not like any of enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes do not really done a mile a minute ... Shame on NBC for this dirty plagiarism characters ... they're better than. <br /> <br /> Class: C-
