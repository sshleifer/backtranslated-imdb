A former private security guard's eyes turning security ditches his last Droning work and immediately offered a chance to return to his old profession. Its purpose: to tail a mysterious French woman newly arrived in California ... and, perhaps, sought a suit and tie racketeers. Unsuccessful attempt to update the noir genre, without enough bite or wit (or associated with the dynamics of the plot) in the script. Director and co-screenwriter Paul Magvud (who later claimed that the picture was edited without his participation) do not produce the impression of appreciating the '40s his films "Chandler" was borne from; his nostalgia for the corresponding folded, but a bitter tone and a little indifferent. Processing wondering commendable low key, and Warren Oates is well cast as the "variant of 70th years on the" archetype of the private dick, "but the film is not binding. Nice to see, Leslie Caron and Gloria Graham in a cast - though none has a lot to do, and hot and cold running character Caron is annoying everywhere. Bright Cinematography Alana Stinsvolda good shooting position, but he can not come to any kind of boiling. * 1/2 ****
