Have you ever cool image in your mind what you thought it would be good to be in the movie: As you can see the detective looks through the cracks of a broken fence of the abandoned house? Or seeing a woman walking down the street, looking cold and intense and very alert? Yes. Imagine stretching the image on the entire film, you pretty much have an idea that defective, although there are no detectives in this movie, I'll just use it as a good example. However, intense-looking woman here, and it is filled with pretty much 99% of the time on the screen. I got nothing to complain about that woman, she is the perfect choice for the role. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a very open people, who can enjoy the pleasure of all types of artistic expression, and I can truly enjoy some really naughty stuff. It would be great if I can formulate one of the scenes from the film and hang it on the wall. Let's be honest here, wonderful acting. Some of expressions on the actors face that keep me watching. <br /> <br /> Currently, the problem of this film. For the mood, there's not a lot of everything else here. Director mainly took obsession and ran far beyond the limits of what it is worth. I do not think it will be a spoiler, when I say that the obsession with the "mirror." Let's face it, this special idea increasingly bloody place and that all directors should work. Of course, there are a few twist and turn here and there. If you pay attention, nothing will surprise you in the end, the obvious plot holes in the side. <br /> <br /> At the moment, I'm not picking up the bones with this style of art, as I used it most of the time, I still think that we should be judged on artistic environment database it uses to express that the artists wanted to express. The film is not a part of the music, or painting, or painting, or even a poem, and, of course, is not only a cool image in your mind. That's all that plus a good story and character development. I think that the style of the film Lynch fraud solutions. It is irresponsible and is cheap and environmental waste. We gave the film 2:00 running time of the film for a good reason. Thus, we must judge differently than judge one frame of images, such as photographs or pictures. <br /> <br /> This film is not completely Lynch style, thank God. It has a linear development, and finally came to a conclusion. It does not have much story or character development. It was a pretty serious with the characters, which consist of ordinary people, thus distance itself from other fantasy things, at least on the surface. He did not offer any explanation for the fantasy element as well as not always trying to build a holistic world around him. Strangeness came out of nowhere and seems to be pretty isolated and accidental. Maybe coherence remains in the director's head, but from what I can see, he did not put a lot of effort to implement it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Where he put his efforts into something? It seems that he spent a lot of effort in creating a mood and improve his music. Music is often built tension, which eventually turn into teasing. . Only in the last part of the movie Panic and tension materialize <br /> <br /> In the end, I felt like: OK, I know what you're trying to say here, but in that moment, you're trying to do, spending two o'clock construction of all these stresses? Rather, it is does not matter who the characters and what kind of life they have. And give us very little about who the characters. All we have is the fact located just took. Disappointing, but I believe that the director does not have much material to work with, and it shows.
