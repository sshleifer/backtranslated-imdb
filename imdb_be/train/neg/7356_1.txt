There is in this movie, just as it was the beginning, in the afternoon, when I was at home with a touch of the flu - otherwise I would have missed. . It probably would be better <br /> <br /> I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas - both very good singers - and thought it might be worth a look. She was in some degree, but only because it is one of those stories, so it's terribly fascinating. <br /> <br /> Zoe McLellan little to recommend her talents for her Jayne Mansfield- or Loni Anderson once bosom. Unfortunately, her acting skills - at least here. - makes Mansfield and Anderson seems Garbo or Davis compared <br /> <br /> white rat young crazy, in a cat owner, a young crazy with the owner evicted and restrained in his own home, and a lot of doophus (including young nut case) running around the object of biological hazards, and absurd conclusions. I kept waiting for at least some element of a scene or site contains at least a modicum of realism, credibility or be able to cause some empathy / compassion - but it was in vain.
