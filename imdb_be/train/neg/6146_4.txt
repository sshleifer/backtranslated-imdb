As this film escaped the wrath of MST3K I'll never know. "Gimkat" ridiculous action film filled with (or is it empty?) With paper thin sections, mute characters and ridiculous situations. But believe me, if you love to watch the poor, but blunt, movies, you'll enjoy "Gimkatom" a lot. <br /> <br /> The action centers around a gymnast who is chosen by government agents (at least, I think that they were government agents) to become a spy. you see that his father was still a quasi-government agent who went missing competing in this game, called eloquent, «The game». So gymnast (played softly Kurt Thomas) Train to compete in this game, and find out what happened to his lost Dad. <br /> <br /> Sounds promising, does not it? Well, so it is not but until now, that the bare bones plot sypnopsis sun begins to describe the joy of this film. They can be found in the amazing details of the film. As a mysterious Asian girlfriend gymnast who does not speak for the first half hour of the film, then suddenly begins to speak, and did not shut up for the rest of the time! is hard shirts bad boy really, who loves making and breaking "game" nonexistent rules "s every time when he so pleases. And, of course, there is a lovely fuss of our hero through the "Village Crazies" (Obviously, this is the real name of the place!). A good place to visit, but I would not want to live there. <br /> <br /> But where this film really shines action scenes. After all, our hero gymnast, director considered prudent to stick to the gymnastic equipment in the alleys and town squares of Middle Eastern cities, so our master Gimkata make better use of their gymnasts' skills to combat this scourge of evil on the parallel bars and pummel horse. He must see to believe. <br /> <br /> One thing interesting notes. A lot, I would say that about half of the cast, dies from being shot with an arrow. Interestingly, because the boom is only plausible effects or actions throughout the film. If it were really effects my one of the main notes of a compliment, who came up with this very realistic arrow wounds. Most likely, it was a way of not paying movie extras. Nevertheless, "Gimkat" deserves a look if you can see it without pay and are looking for something stupid, which is an easy target for the reefs. <br /> <br />
