Although it has been 2 years, I still remember the waste, which includes the entire plot of the film. Unfortunately, I came across this movie after my friends and I chose it while watching new releases at Blockbuster. We decided to choose a film because he was the only one we have not seen everything, and it sounded like it might be a pleasant one. Although it has been a long time since I watched the movie, I still remember the lack of plot (seriously, there is no true story), and a waste of time that was spent watching a movie. If you're in a video store, and this film is striking to go and find the best film. If you eventually see this movie, I understand your pain :)
