It started with an interesting location. I always wanted the civil war stuff and ancient secret societies. The more the film progressed, the more I realized that it was a B movie at best. In the second half, it quickly became the C film, then D, then F, then "I would like to see it was not a rental, so that I could put it in the microwave!" I can not say that the current in all cases it was awful, just the majority. Drawing up, but ... I have never read the book. Maybe this book is well written. The screenplay was written by 10-year-old. It was funny shallow, gray and uninteresting dialogue, the characters are as interesting as the 5 pound bag of fertilizer. I really hated this film, as well as my wife. I am a Christian, and I have no problem with movies that promote or support Christianity. This film made a great harm to the cause. Awful, awful, worthless. If you like, I highly recommend Superman 4.
