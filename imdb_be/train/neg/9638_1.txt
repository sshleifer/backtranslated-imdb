"Boom" gathered in front of something reputation. With heavyweights Taylor Burton, Noel Coward, Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey, one might be tempted to think, how bad can it be? Well, it's much worse than you could imagine. <br /> <br /> The sad and alarming «Boom» is that it seems to signal the decline and fall of the aforementioned heavyweights. Only the director Joseph Losey, who slumped in depth with a "Modesty Blaise" and "Boom" (some may wish to add «Secret Ceremony»), was able to recover and create their best work in 1970, a great «Go-Between ". <br /> <br /> Saddest of all is the work of Tennesee Williams. Since the mid-forties until the early sixties, Williams wrote a series of plays that gained classic status, remaining in the theater repertoire all over the world, many are highly praised films. If Muse William left him, probably because of his notorious substance abuse, she left him forever. Williams at his best is a dream actor providing many memorable performances. (There were Ava Gardner and Deborah Kerr ever better than the "Night of the Iguana"?) Taylor, in particular, shone as "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and "Suddenly Last Summer". There is an anecdote in which, supposedly, Taylor asks John Gielgud, whether he would teach her how to play Shakespeare, to which he replied: "If you teach me how to play by Tennessee Williams." If Gielgud saw «Boom», he would have kept my mouth shut. Taylor just never been worse, turning into a pervert inducing performance. Although her face photographed well, it strongly plump. In addition to physical decline, from now on it will be basically losing credibility as a serious actress with a series of completely overlooked (and worse) role in her honor. <br /> <br /> the same can be said of Burton. After his short-lived theatrical fame, he gained fame and fortune in Hollywood. But the body of his work with this moment (1968) would be nothing not typical, to say the least. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward has long ceased to be a force in the theater, where his comedy image numbers have been replaced by similar Williams and British "angry young men". He seems to be enjoying himself his campaign, but barely manages to entertain, that of a man who claimed that such a talent. <br /> <br /> The only member of the cast supports its dignity of young Shimkus, who in a few years will be to abandon promising screen career to become Mrs. Sidney Poitier <br /> <br /> «Boom» smacks himself indulgence . it's just out of control. Pretty boring career pointer to go wrong, and not fun festival camp as some.
