This film has a lot of potential. Anyone who has followed the story of Jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this film, it's ridiculous. Too much time and effort have been spent in the film on homosexuality Dahmer and his alcohol consumption. Where character development? The origins of any villain always interesting and Dahmer was no exception. Where the film is the address of his boyhood, when he began to kill and maim small animals? Instead, we give stunning flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer, but did not solve the basic point in the development of Dahmer. In addition, the reason why the country has become so intrigued by this story was a part - as he kept the body in his apartment, and the length and measure, he went to in order to achieve this goal; his cannibalism and desire of the flesh, etc. I could go on, but to sum up, too much backward point in the film, centered on their sexuality and not enough gore - good stuff you would expect to see if the name of the movie "Dahmer".
