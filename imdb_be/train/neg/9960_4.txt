MY BROTHER TOM ratio <br /> <br /> Format: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Dolby Digital <br /> <br /> After the episode of sexual violence at the hands of a trusted neighbor, a young Jessica (Jenna Harrison) forms a bond with an amazing boy (Ben Whishaw) she meets in the woods. Unfortunately, Whishaw my secrets of his own, no less anxious and more dangerous ... <br /> <br /> Dour drama caused daring performances Harrison and Whishaw, in which two kindred spirits immerse themselves in mutual love of nature after traumatized by his experiences in the "real world." Unfortunately, their friendship unravels as harsh reality begins to intrude, which leads to an inevitable tragedy. House Rotheroe directed and photographed in the digital video format, the film looks ragged in places (too many uncomfortable closeup and inaccurate manual camera movements) and takes some time to find his feet, but who gives a dramatic peace award
