I give this movie props is that it is very well done and very well acted. But I could not get past the implausibility of the whole. <br /> <br /> First of all, the game is built around the concept of "Russian Roulette", which should fill in an hour. the biggest problem is that if you do a "live" show, you run the likelihood that your first party will be one quite unsuccessfully, to make a "real" bullet. Then what do you do? You have 50 minutes to complete the show and nothing to show. The consequence is that OK, you get to the end, and the first five contestants to survive, which means the number six has a bullet and can not get the win. He's not going to shoot himself at the time, so it is a kind of anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> The second problem, almost as big. Human nature. People are going to shake, panic, soil underwear and do things that would otherwise not do a very good television. Too much chance. That is why the "real" reality TV really closely the script and even more tightly edited. <br /> <br /> (just a random thing, "Efficiency of the artist" to talk about the victims of women who were actually rare historically. Even it was predictable, as she went through with the shooting itself no effect.) <br / > <br /> We were led to believe the show ratings will increase, but this is at 1 am in the morning (unlikely) with token Asian girl announces a boost in the rankings. <br /> <br /> point on race and gender. Film big surprise two minority (one gay) and two female candidates are the ones that survive. Thus, we are left with two white men, and, of course, a little less nice of them is the one who buys it. The purpose of this show would have been a coincidence, but the guy you like least is the guy who dies. <br /> <br /> The culmination of that after two hours of struggle for the televised suicide, the character Eva Mendes (Mendez production and played a major role in this matter, so that she has no one to blame but myself) actually grows conscience, when somebody dies. What does she think was going to happen? She quickly shot a passerby angry about all this (reasons not explained) and the show went on to be a big hit. Really? <br /> <br /> problems with media satire is that it must either have some basis in reality, or it must be so on top to be inappropriate (such as Network). It is neither.
