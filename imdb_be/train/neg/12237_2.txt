Original Claymation Rudolph: Very good. The original Frosty cartoon: Needs a little work, but it could be worse. But Frosty and Rudolph with the Fourth of July? Come on! Give me a break !!! It was a film that was not supposed to be made. It was bad. It does not really go on any holiday, in particular, with the exception of the 4th of July, which made it particularly bad because of Rudolph and Frosty, usually associated with the Christmas season. And any film can be destroyed too much singing. Part of the song from the movie, it seems much longer than it really was. The film tried to mix the two Chirstmastime familiar characters from the American traditional holiday (which almost seems to be the "border" it in America), too much senseless songs, and lousy plot. The result? Bad film, which can not really be observed at any time of the year. I would suggest you give up this movie, even if you like Frosty and Rudolph.
