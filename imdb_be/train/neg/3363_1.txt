The original film (19 ??) did not show the "monster", it is simply recommended terrible "things" ,. <br /> <br /> This version, however, shows every aspect of the "sick minded ghost", including the unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> «secret», as presented in the original film, was the scariest part: one simply does not know what causes the strange things that have happened. Showing the face of the "old", this gentleman has completely disappeared. Worse, the special effects (wooden children crying people) funny. This silly remake, too obvious, spectacular even close to as bad as the original
