One of the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. I wanted to vomit after viewing. I saw this film in my US History class and the goal was to see the prompts them to farmer's life in the West during the late 1800s. What we saw were the pigs were shot and then killed a human birth, branding. So in the end was a live birth of a calf, and let me tell you that the birth itself was not too bad, but a lot of fluids that have come out have forced most of the people in my class to the bathroom. The story itself was fine. The premise of the story of the widow and her daughter, and they moved to the west to be the custodian of the house of the cowboy. They live a hard life, and it's fun fairly accurate picture of life in the West in the late 1800s. But if you have a choice, do not watch this movie.
