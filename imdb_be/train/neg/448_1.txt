What I hate about this show is how poorly written. These women have no self-respect and dignity. The whole story of their rush to the boys. Talent Amanda Bynes completely wasted. She was brilliant at «All That» and her own show. Why would they have written it, and Jennie Garth as a sad, stupid, desperate, chasing men, "old maid" imitators of me. <br /> <br /> Their stories and the dialogue reminds me of «Simpons», Homer says every time his character Poochie sun cartoon on the screen, "Everyone should ask where Poochie?». All conversations center on whining about some guy, and then whine some guy. Sometimes they change it, and the guy was crying instead. Then they come back with a break or at the end. These 2 women or small, stupid, or sex addicts. The only word I can think of "sucks".
