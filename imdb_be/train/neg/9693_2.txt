Superheated section «Bonjour Tristesse» taken from the juvenile first novel by Francoise Sagan, became a bestseller, though God knows why. For teens who want to get rid of a potential step-father might have a certain appeal. Do not be taken in the fact that David Niven plays a playboy father and stepmother, Deborah Kerr in the long term. Unfortunately, too many lies on the fragile shoulders of Jean Seberg. She's beautiful and easy to perform the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that it can strike poses, but she can not act. Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in Preminger in Jeanne - the first film in SEBERG - knows that she is not capable of 19 carrying a film. This film, as Preminger, performs "promise" in the first place. It was her second film; she is now 20. Preminzher think? It Niven Kerr and can compensate for the lack SEBERG in existing facilities? Not a chance? SEBERG character is at the center of history and quite, although it is convincing, although it can be physically, as a 17-year-old, it can not meet the emotional needs of the role. I do not know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life, because it does not affect my consciousness in her later paintings. But anyone who thinks that this film is better than the mediocre taste needs to be tested. Despite Niven and Kerr, it is a juvenile history is made in a juvenile fashion of a beautiful young girl who really need acting lessons.
