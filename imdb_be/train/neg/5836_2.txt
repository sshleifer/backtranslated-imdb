From the pen of Richard Condon (The Manchurian Candidate 1962), comes the complicated story of political intrigue and murder. The story told in comic book fashion almost hard to swallow. All star cast is believed this poor effort is not entirely the fault of the cast and crew: the novel is replete with the same omissions. It seems that sometimes the story is actually mocking a sincere effort put forward in "The Manchurian Candidate." The disappointment on all counts.
