I think it would be much better if the film Cajuns was depicted in a believable world. My family is from the south-eastern region of Louisiana, and I live in the south-east Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I have never heard people I grew up around the conversation as these people did. In Cajuns depicted in reverse cattle. Most Cajuns I know, well-educated, proud people, and does not sound uneducated at all when they say these people were doing. Overall it was a good film, with great decor and music. I understand that the authors were from Lake Charles and have knowledge of the area, but for the love of all things the Cajun, please actors learn the language, live among the people you show and get all-around understanding of how they ' they are before you go try to act like them. In my opinion, when the actors make you believe that they are a person, it is much more enjoyable movie!
