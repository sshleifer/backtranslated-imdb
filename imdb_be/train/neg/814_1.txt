This movie was just plain bad. Almost every cop movie cliches is present and accounted for. Bad guy runs away? check. Partner? check. Unusual personality clash with your partner? check. Rookie with something to prove? check. Rookie shows up gray veteran. check. On Uniform he did not touch was an idiot to shoot yourself in the foot and retirony, but I believe that they are saving these old chestnuts in the next outing Dooley. Add to the Battle of the sexes Girl Power with tired old gegami overdone and trite material as prize car blew get smashed all the time and you have a recipe for a really bad movie. Avoid this one at any price.
