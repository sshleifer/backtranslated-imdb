I can not understand why the filmmakers remade this film. <br /> <br /> In 1972, a film with McQueen and McGraw almost classic. Steve McQueen was a brilliant actor and an actor Baldwin only inadequate. He has no passion in his play.Also action «Getaway» original was fantastic. But the remake does not have any action! It's almost sad, despite the fact that the film industry was more difficult in 1972 than in 1994. <br /> <br /> I do not understand so that Baldwin jailed in Mexico. I think this is a mistake in history. <br /> <br /> So I think that there was no need to alter it, or if they decide to remake the classic, they should choose a great actor for the first role, as Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
