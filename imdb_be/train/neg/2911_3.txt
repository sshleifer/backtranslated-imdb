This film is a bloated, predictable, pretentious and hollow to its core. These settings are correct era, but very-conscious in their increase with prolonged exposure. Lingering over the artifacts cease to have effect and cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue. Tom Hanks seems to be sleepwalking much as Bruce Willis in Hart's War. Meanwhile, you can not give the depth of the character, making a face blank! The content is not guaranteed theatrical acting on Paul Newman. It's a hopeless case wrapped in an atomic bomb.
