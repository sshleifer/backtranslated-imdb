Although Frank Lesser songs are among the best that Broadway has to offer, they are perverted by a lethargic performances Mankiewicz "and uninspired presentation - if it feels a little above it, as you watched a musical. Mankiewicz does not seem to know how to present complex but melodic tunes Lesser for maximum effect: for example, one of the best rooms, showstopping `Western Adelaide", comes to the conclusion, having in Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) belt finals sitting on a chaise longue; Kaye and Stabia in the pseudo-spiritual `sit down, you Rockin 'The BoatÂ» was his support of the choir sitting in folding chairs, he just stands there. Mankiewicz zaps all the fun of the whole, allowing static scenes last too long, and his dialogue (adapted with AB Burroughs book stage) has none of the wit, that his films like 'All About Eve' is. Part of the blame should go to the conclusion, almost all of which are miscast: Marlon Brando looks puzzled why he was in a musical, Frank Sinatra plays a very nice guy and does not have any edges that makes it so important (lyrics not suited to his style) and Gene Simmons bit registers at how Shirley Jones. Only Blaine, like love Adelaide dancer commands attention as a Broadway needs. Colorful artistic direction is by Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol created a sham sets.
