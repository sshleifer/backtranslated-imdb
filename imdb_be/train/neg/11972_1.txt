The first ten minutes, "Just Looking" is actually dictates the direction of the majority of the film takes. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14-year-old boy, who lives in New York in the 50s. He has a burning desire to see two people having sex. Who are the best people he has in mind? Well, his own mother and stepfather, of course! How nice. Unfortunately for Lenny, he is caught before he sees nothing, and sent for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle's wife. <br /> <br /> Next Lenny plan should see that his uncle and his wife have sex. However, the wife totally pregnant, and they currently do not sleep together. Then Lenny makes a new friend. He and his friend spend most of their free time to hang around a few girls. They have a small club, where all they do is sit around and talk about sex. The problem is ... it is not done in an innocent, charming 1950 like way. I'm not a prude by any means, but I found it quite disturbing to hear these children talking about masturbation, oral and anal sex. This kind of moisture may work in a film like "Children" (1995), but it just seems perverse in the film. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol will be completely devastated here, as Hedy, a former model bra that becomes a 'the object of bodily desires Lenny. Jason Alexander should stay as far away from the director's chair as possible. "For better or worse" (1996) it was awful, and now this. What a waste. 1/10
