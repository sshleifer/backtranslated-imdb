WWF Survivor Series 2001 <br /> <br /> It was one of the worst events in 2001 Perhaps the biggest drawback was that he did not do the same in most of the previous Survivor Series'. There was only one survivor series match. And that Survivor Series match lasted for 45 minutes. Moreover, any person with a working brain would know that this is over Rock vs. Austin and The Rock for his preferred team. And do not get me started on the preview before the event. No matter who won it was obvious that no one is going to die F *** ING. There was no need for all this senseless deception. Whatever the story, it was just a fight event <br /> <br /> As for the other games :. The first match, Christian defended his European title against Al Snow. It was a good fast paced match, and it's good to see the heel to win the match fairly. William Rega against Tadiri was boring, and we saw him 2 or 3 times. Edge against the test was good, but nothing special. Title Tag steel cage match was the best match of the evening. Battle Royal was continued for 10 minutes, and no one cared, who would win in the first place. Women's title match was not great. No, not in the least degree. The main event was the most hypocritical match in history. Alliance lost, but I think that after 5 months of each alliance superstar returned. The match itself was poor. Rock eliminated 3 of them and Jericho eliminated 2. Rock was too caught up with his action to be there when the invasion began. Jericho was the one that endangers the entire match. If I wanted any 2 should be eliminated in the early going it will be them. Everyone knew that Kane, Big Show, and the undertaker would just fall guys. 7 games is not enough for the Survivor Series. If ever in Survivor Series as bad as that again I will
