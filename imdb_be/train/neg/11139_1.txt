There is not much to say about this movie, it's horrible. <br /> <br /> action and dialogue in a way far removed from even decent, the story of a hybrid werewolf is not well explained, and all this has plot holes here and there. <br /> <br /> CGI is that you do not want to see. It is so amateurish that it makes me puke. <br /> <br /> The only good thing on the DVD was in Extras. Gag reels. Everything else is just a waste of time and money. I hope that no one will buy it, it's not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from this.
