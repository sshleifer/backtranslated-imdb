Enough ... sometimes they just need to stop making films based on the concept that died long ago. The first film was a big tremors. The second was ridiculous. The third was nauseating. The series was depressingly awful. And this movie is driving share deeper. <br /> <br /> In principle, another reason for the cheap computer effects and puppetry, and now we have a series set in the Wild West in the 1800s, and they are fighting graboids. As a retelling of the first, they have to learn how to beat them all again. Moderately entertaining I suppose. Otherwise, it's just a video release, as well as Tremors 2 and 3, will simply be too far away. Oh, and I'm still wondering how there is never one of those events that occur ... they just forgot to write this unprecedented event? I think something like this will be history-making, so our friends in the first film will not be so unprepared. <br /> <br /> Movies like this that ruin the original just drives me crazy. Avoid this rubbish.
