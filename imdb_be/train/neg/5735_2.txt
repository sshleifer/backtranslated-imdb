First of all, this low-budget film, so my expectations were incredibly low going into it. I believe that most people are looking for information for this film just wanted bloodfest, and in fact this is all there is. <br /> <br /> Plot? There's really not. It is basically a saw, but in China, and as a whole hell of a lot worse. Cast? There are no, period. Special effects? Absolutely horrible, in my opinion ... There were small blood often quite incredible because of the amount of spray, color, texture, etc. <br /> <br /> I believe that the purpose of the film was supposed to be a tough, shock film. Now he had some great potential on a bigger budget, but bad scripts, bad dialogue, terrible actions, what seemed like a video camcorder shots and incredible "blood" made this film really badly. <br /> <br /> There are movies, should take a chance against some of the reviews, even the "b-rate" films deserve some opportunities (traces of blood, for example, were the last I saw against the proceedings, cost), but it was just awful. I hope that people who consider this film to read my comment and decide against it. <br /> <br /> I am in favor of violence and shock, but generally unrealistic and really terrible actions make a terrible experience. Save your time / money and the chance to do something else, you will not be disappointed.
