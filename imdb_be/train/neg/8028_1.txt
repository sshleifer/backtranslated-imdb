Please! Do not waste your money on this film. It really is nothing more than a sad German Blair Witch robbery to make some high school. I could not watch it, and, as a rule, I like to watch all kinds of B-movies. How on earth could they find a distributor for it? !!! Ironically, however: Check Wikipedia "dark area". The guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of your mind. Maybe he's got a lot of money from the manufacturers. Money that should have been spent on the actors, camera and editing. Even this would not help, because there is absolutely not interested in the idea of ​​this film. Unfortunately, the "dark area" has already received too much attention. Please, director, producer and writer of the film, he stopped making films like ... you're not doing yourself a favor. The world would be better off without this movie.
