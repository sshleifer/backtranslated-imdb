I believe that the reason the film did so well at the box office, of course, Eddie Murphy. I think it was his first film as the "Beverly Hills", because while it was hot. Given that one of the more than two hundred million, and this was the R, and this is one of the approximately 80 million m was possible to say that it was not all that popular. I've never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy, so that's probably another reason why I did not care for it at all. This one is Eddie, like some kind of finder of lost children. He must find the golden child or the world is in terrible danger. The plot is very bad, but as bad as it can not be compared with the special effects. I've seen better stuff, made in the 70s, than some of the things this one offers the best material Harryhausen made. Nevertheless, the main reason why you see the movie as it is because of Eddie, unfortunately, it is not very funny in this at all, and it just seems silly to put it in "Raiders of the Lost Ark" scene type. I believe they are hoping to fish out of water effect, but it's just not working for me.
