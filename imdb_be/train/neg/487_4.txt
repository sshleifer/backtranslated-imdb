That the director thinks? All who have read the biography of wormwood leaves an impression of their giblets before the court of public rape in the Renaissance, and even subjected to torture in order to show that Tassi blame. This fact shows the real independence and liberation - her worst hour she stands her man. Why are movies that show the Renaissance should be as clinically beautiful and romantic, we are afraid to see the gritty side of life and won a Hollywood happy-happy mood? While I have always defended the director the freedom to create their own reality, to the movies, I can not make sense to turn history Artimisia life on its head. Very disappointing choice of the creators of this film.
