In the film, I feel that it should be more than just art. I think it should be more than that, a way to tell the story on the screen. This is a summary of David Lynch tells a story, but not much of one. I felt that it was interesting, but too weird to be a comedy. This is a good film-making, but there really is not anything else to it. As I said before, I'm a big fan of David Lynch, but I'm disappointed with some of his work, because I do not see a need for it at all. This is by far my least favorite, that he has done so far, but I know that he still has a ton of talent, and I'm glad to see that he has in store for us in the future. If you want to Lynch, check it out, but do not be surprised if you do not like very much.
