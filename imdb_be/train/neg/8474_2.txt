Opening scenes move like liquid frozen Velveeta. Trying to dramatic dialogue just makes me wish I better control fast-forward control. Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and smart, or mangy hideous creatures. This vampire is trying to lure their prey by mimicking a lost puppy. I used to tally the body count, so that was a cat (which is not considered) homeless girl who fell off with the ball in her sky (no matter that it was about) and then plot. Foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm, but the sound of biting into an apple using a vampire bites a victim is simply nonsense. I liked the Warlock, but this film just stunk so bad that we have eliminated it, and it was so forgettable, we took him only a year to turn it on again.
