I love often misnomered Â«Masters of Horror" series. supporters horror live in constant lack of food. Projects such as this (and similar "by Project Greenlight" to give us the "Feast" - like it or lump it) is a breeding ground for outstanding thought bubbles in the minds of directors with bent horrors to develop and bring to maturation for food we love dine on terror. <br /> <br /> This one started with a nucleus really-Kool-idea and ran ... straight from the edge, "where in the world am I going with this? !!! ". <br /> <br /> I do not know how to spoil spoiled but "SPOILER AHEAD" suddenly ... no, it was not that light drifting in the night sky before ... we have long fluorescent gray aliens (up to .. . eh?) drilling brain man and ... yes, I understand, but ... well ... the worst curse of speaking. - incitement and promising to create without remuneration isolation <br /> <br /> ki ... storytellers for your build should have a prize in excess build up. Not vice versa. Narration math 101. <br /> <br /> End of Spoilers - Big Oops!
