It is incredible that he managed to be scary on many levels. The script, which acts, direction and choice of actors all terrible. Costumes, sets, and pseudo-medieval language is also quite horrible. In a strange way, I really enjoyed this film after I accepted that it would not be any good. It seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort to produce something so bad, when in fact they could have done something pretty decent from the room (though not very believable!), But instead we were treated to a rather sickening and cheesy tale of dragons and knights, that lacks any charm can be found in other similar science fiction movie. Hopefully, the Lord of the Rings a little better! Oh, haircut and David Thewlis, making it look like He-Man. It does!
