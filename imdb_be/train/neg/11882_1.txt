I passed this on the shelf several times, looking at a myriad of huge positive quotes (with tiny names) on the front panel, and wondering if I'm missing something. Another night she was on one of the movie channels, and I'm determined. I did not miss anything. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I only watched the first 30 minutes. Perhaps, the film becomes a comedy gold then. Given the slow, plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30, I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> The main character begins the film in the classic "I do not know how to start your movie" style, with a long, tedious monologue that he does not want to get sued. This is not funny. It's not even not remotely funny Others have commented a little "San Franclisco»;.. ok, a little laugh the first time, when he says he then grinds it into the ground, smiling into the camera as it is the most ridiculous thing ever written over yourself on the.. fact, I think it was a bit camera reason why I just do not like the movie. Do not think that your acquaintance with . Vdytoryyay Friendly is _earned_, as well as respect for <br /> <br /> All you basically have a thick smarmy guy talking very feminine way about his boring life as the pace I did not realize that he was a Jew..; this discrediting of Jewish comedians call it "Jewish humor". this simply unfunny humor. just because you are a Jew does not mean you have a talent for comedy. Wasp, Spalding Gray, does a better job of independent analytical humor than this guy, so that it is obvious that this is not about ethnicity. <br /> <br /> If one of the bits I saw worked, I would have stayed around, but some schlub occur about how much he loves the names of women with whom he is working, and then list them for five long minutes, do not make a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is a clear attempt to capitalize on the popularity of "Office Space." Do not let yourself become a victim of targeted marketing. Just say NO "Haiku Tunnel».
