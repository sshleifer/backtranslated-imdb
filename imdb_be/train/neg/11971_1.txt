Although the film with Bruce Willis always worth watching, it's best to skip this one. I watched this on TV, so I did not throw the money for it. I was lucky. <br /> <br /> The plot develops slowly, very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes or so is quite plausible, it is becoming more and more unbelievable to the end. It is doubtful if an experienced soldier like Lieutenant Waters to obey direct orders. And even if he had, if the rest of his platoon would be. They know that it puts them in immediate danger, and they know that they are certainly going to die if they follow him, but what the hell, he's our lieutenant, so let's do what he says (although direct orders, remember). <br /> <br /> However, there are some good scenes in this film. They are somewhat save the village, where the total population is now destroyed by the rebels. Well, they save a dozen or so villagers, the rest is killed. The amazing part of this, that they take the trucks, which left behind the rebels. They would rather go on foot. Maybe, because the roads are dangerous, but there was no explanation for this. Anyway. I think it was the fact that the film earned one point, which I gave him. <br /> <br /> What made this film an insult to the brain, and thus is very unlikely that a group of 7 soldiers may kill as many insurgents without being injured or killed themselves. Only towards the end they lose a few friends. And it is only because they have to fight in the army almost 500 or more. Can you believe that? <br /> <br /> They are fighting the army so much, kill hundreds of them, and only lose some of yourself. And they have rounds and rounds of ammunition. Never run out of it. Grenades and mines Claymore, M60 machine gun, and even RPG. Where do they get this stuff. Carrying it around or something? They even got a laptop that shows their active enemy combatants. And this laptop has a battery that runs for several days. Really? Who came up with this shit. <br /> <br /> I think that if you turn off your brain completely and recognize that the rebels a bunch of idiots, you give this movie a high rating. If not, skip this. This saves you time.
