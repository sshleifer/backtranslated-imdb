I love Billy Crystal, and I thought it would be interesting to see this movie, because I know that he was fond of Alan King, and they would be funny together. I thought I had seen all the films of Billy, but could not remember it, and now I know why. It is so full of clich√©s and false emotions; you can smell every scene coming (and out!). Billy did not even get to be funny often. He was too busy trying to cry fake tears or show their sadness at how much his father had let him down. Alan King himself pretty cute, as the plot of an extra in a movie. But what a coincidence that Billy was just going to visit his father in the same way as a serious health crisis occurs, etc. etc. Or that two busy doctors may simply close their practices to the Moon around in Los Angeles. And when the end comes, the boy, she comes quickly! Almost as if the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to make a scene of death. In general disappointment with a few glimpses of good humor.
