Directed by Spike Lee certainly make films showing racism. In many films, such «Do The Right Thing», the majority of white people are racists tight. In this film, interracial marriage is the subject of racism once again be the entire problem. <br /> <br /> What makes Lee, however, once again demonstrate their fanaticism against Christianity. It is surprising that the double standards that exist in the world of cinema. If Lee or anyone else has ever done this kind of prejudice against other groups, but it will vilify Christians? Hey, it's "open season" on them. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, respected in the film, shooting at his son, and then puts a smoldering gun on top of your Bible. They increased by the fact that even close-up just in case you missed it. Hey guys, here's another reader of the Bible and see what it's like! Does this kind of thing in almost every film he makes. <br /> <br /> He shows the same hatred, when dealing with race relations. Who can argue with drawing racism as thin? Nevertheless, Lee perpetuates it in this film, as he is in his other films. His obvious irritation towards white people does not help the situation. This only adds fuel to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hey, Spike: start "doing the right thing" and leave their prejudices in the closet. And even better, "get over it.» <br /> <br /> That's too bad, because the subject could make for a provocative film thought, when it was done with objectivity and intelligence.
