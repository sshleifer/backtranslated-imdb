I actually see this film, as I write this. ,, When the following comments "prove my lack of development as a genuine, artistic filmmaker," then so be it.,. <br /> <br /> However,. ,, I thought (I still think, as I am now read), this film. ,, put it mildly, very, very overpriced. Again, it is. <br /> <br /> it seems like a really, really bad student film made with the help of someone with the boundaries of very limited resources. ,, and who did not pay that much attention to detail. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go further and further in respect of all the different ways that I think this movie is not enough But ,, well ,, I just do not understand (rememeber, I fully admit that, maybe it's that I'm an idiot here - not the director - for not getting this "piece of imaginative genius")... ,, I rented it on a whim, because the reviews were very, very prominent.,. <br /> <br /> Sheesh. ,,
