This film makes few mistakes. few American actors in Spain and Spanish actors speak in English. With English "Spanish is OK, but the mode of action is carried out makes it all very annoying dialogue through the whole scenario is very weak;. This may have been the Spanish scenario, but mistranslated, who knows and who cares I can only assume that. these well-known spanish actors forced into the English language, they can be good, but not the flop. you will find the film for the first 5 minutes, then how pathetic it is. then everything else is just bad. a lot of waste of time, a lot of the United Nations the necessary areas . About I mentioned one of the Baldwins.
