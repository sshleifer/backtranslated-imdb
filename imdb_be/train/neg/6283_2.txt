What an incredible fall for Sean Alice. <br /> <br /> Do you collect a bunch of his friends at home, everything is inflated to further work Sean Ellis. Do you have a vague idea about the plot, Sun spoilers that could kill the fun, very high expectations. <br /> <br /> It is not too late at night, ideal atmosphere for a film of this type. <br /> <br /> 15 minutes goes by and you start talking to himself, he is obliged to take, in 25 minutes you start to wonder if you should just go to sleep and save it for another time when you can fully evaluate not expected subtle touches that exist. During the half-hour mark you realize half of your audience to your bloated already asleep and call it a day. <br /> <br /> A few days later, when you have exhausted all other materials to see how you come back to this, in the middle of the day, this time, in the hope of your moods will keep you awake at this time. After 10 minutes you will be fastforwarding unimaginable gift and long transitions and the intermediate images. Any other material that I would have refused, but there are Cashback his legacy. But this heritage can only carry you so long, this is a new level of movie-making sad, imagine going on a short story to the novel with a description of all, that's what it is. <br /> <br /> A decent cast in vain, NO cinema that leaves you in awe as CashBack anything. There are films that annoy you, there are movies that lack certain aspects, or just cheese, unfortunately, it's just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The final words, stay away.
