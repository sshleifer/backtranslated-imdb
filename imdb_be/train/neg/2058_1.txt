I can find very little that's good to say about this film. I am sure that the idea of ​​the script and looked good on paper, but the filmography and effective, I am afraid, not the standards I would expect from some very talented people. I doubt that this is a feature highly in their CV's filmography. Michael Caine appeared sometimes wooden in his role as a doctor, and never once did I really believe in his character. The plot was incredible, especially with regard to the victims of his son. Some of the scenes were very similar to other films that I sometimes wondered, when he was actually a parody thriller. Lighting time it was dark, and it added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big name stars, wondering why I bothered to watch it at all.
