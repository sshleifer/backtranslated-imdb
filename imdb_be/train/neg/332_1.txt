Let me start this by saying I could not go all the way through it. I picked it up for a rainy day from WalMart, like other reviewers on this site. I realized that there was no way I would regret my purchase. I was wrong there? Seriously now, who approved this project? They should be forced to watch this movie over and over again until the end of eternity. This is the only fitting punishment I can think of something to produce this bad. Shooting reminds me of the films that I used to do for class projects on a big old VHS-camera. The current did much better. I think the only difference is that there are several interesting and cameos. Yay, who cares ... Shecky Moskowitz are unfunny and ships comedian even bigger loser. This is about the same story, as I understand it. <br /> <br /> In general, this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I have it on DVD and gave it to many colleagues watching. Each back and laughs and says, "Wow, I do not think I ever said that I turn in the movie, Adam Sandler, 15 minutes ....» <br /> <br /> My answer is always, "Well now you can »<br /> <br />
