"Phantom of Dragstrip Hollow» appears to take place in a flawless pit, in the era long gone by, where the biggest sin a child might do in defying the law and get a traffic ticket. It opens with a young woman of car fanatic to get business from its main competitor, who pressure her into racing. That's about it for drag racing - is the B-Flick mainly related to rock and roll, man! People in the US International clearly like decent, square teenager who liked to party and have not objected to an adult chaperone. There are a few amusing ambiguity and fruit exchanges (thinning Kid: "We thought that we came out into the fresh air ..." Dad: "Where do you think you would have found it, her throat?"), But the ghost of a little late coming . A short 65-minute mark, the film cheats us with the highest motor racing, what is actually happening outside the screen and preliminary "Scooby-Doo» -styled autopsy, which makes no sense. However, for fans of nostalgia, some mindless fun. ** from ****
