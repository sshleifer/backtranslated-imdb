I tried to leave the film three times, but this god awful. Case in point: Mom and daughter drive up to the bed and breakfast, my mother stopped at a gas filling station crazy eccentrics angry at her husband, whose run B & B trying to rape her. She runs away, head to the B & B and instead hubby to go ballistic, and she wants to call the police, the story just keeps lukewarm behavior on both of their parts. Wow. <br /> <br /> Other logical operations deficits abound. Acting as heat, but a warning the next door neighbor comes in a very corny, poorly acted moment. <br /> <br /> The moments of intense baked blood / death irregularly intertwined with lingering scenes time filler interactions between characters. <, Br /> <br /> Less emphasis on gore, more attention to the mood and history would have been appreciated.
