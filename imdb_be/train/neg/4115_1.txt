«Power Play» begins interesting, but it is going down hill fast. The only good actor Tobin Bell, and it has a very small part. For Bell, «Power Play» does not possess saving power or interest. «Power Play» has more earthquakes for a few days than California during the year. Earthquake scene in a shopping center so far-fetched and highly unlikely. And all the action scenes look like a bunch of third-graders put on a play. It's awful, just awful. <br /> <br /> As a result, when «Power Play» was made in the 60's or 70's and it is always the poor «B» class film. The fact that the «Power Play» was made in 2001, really boring. Is there such a thing as «D» class movie? If so, «Power Play» throws shape.
