It is without a shadow of a doubt, the absolute worst movie Steven Seagal never did. And that says a lot. Nha fooled rankings it is too good. This abomination is not even worth 0/10 rating, if there is such a thing. <br /> <br /> - absolutely no plot <br /> <br /> - The worst scene ever, and there are not too many of them or <br /> <br /> - Segal does not wow, including military action, to speak (a lot of dubbing), and so on. As always. <br /> <br /> - Segal fat, lazy and could not care less about this film. Something that is quite obvious, all the way <br /> <br /> Take all other waste DTV films Seagal has made, multiply them together, multiply that with thousands of billions, and all the bad things you get what won "t even describe the 1% this absolute crapfest.
