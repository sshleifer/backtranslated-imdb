Interesting film about a real event that occurred during the civil war in Vermont. He kept his attention to the end, and I do not regret watching it. I never read the raid on the incident because I was curious to see if the rebels pulled it out. I like historical films from this era. <br /> <br /> My main complaint with the federal form. They look too good !!! The action was a little tough at times. I, as an old man eating mashed potatoes, because he did not have any teeth. Wounded games bring hound were a little strange. Overall, it was a descent movie.
