Well, the movie is good, but I give it a 1, because the idea of ​​a computer virus becomes clear organic virus tale. This kind of shit just adds to the paranoid delirium, uncomputer savvy MORON, that a computer virus is just like an organic virus. First of all the lines of code and tens of 1s and 0s to add to a computer virus. Organic virus is much more complex, despite the fact that this is the way smaller. Although it is considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, organic virus to attach and burrow into the cells attach to RNA and then to change its RNA code. Explain to me how something like that can be processed by the monitor? Maybe the radiation has a certain effect on the user's cornea, which makes your eyeballs in these viruses? I could see that, but obviously, the author has not thought about it.
