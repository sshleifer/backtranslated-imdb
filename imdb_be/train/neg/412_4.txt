In the realm of science fiction, two specific themes are constantly arouse interest, were initially investigated in the literature in advance cinematic era, and since then again periodically filmmakers and writers, but with varying degrees of success. The first theme, that time on the road, had an unwavering passion for film lovers, as well as the written word, most recently on the screen with another version of the classic H.G. Wells, `The Time Machine". The second theme, which also manages to keep the audience excited that invisibility that ignites the imagination with its seemingly endless and countless opportunities. And this theme is also once again become the basis for the film, adapted from another Wells classic, `The Invisible Man" the implementation of which, here, `Hollow Man» directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Shue. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Caine (Bacon) and for some time colleagues conducted experiments for the US government, are exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility that they have finally achieved in a number of primates, where they tested their method . They are, in fact, moved to what is certified by the implementation of invisibility; their only problem now brings the subject back to the original "visual condition. This is a problem, however, that Caine, after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab, has solved-- or so he thinks. And if the application of his theories on the subject of living well, he decides to submit the results to the Board of Directors, in an attempt thereby to maintain the necessary funding to continue the project. <br /> <br /> at the last minute, however, objection expresses Caine, fearing that the control of the project will be taken out of it before they can go to the next level-- ter Tavani human subject. And he takes it upon himself to be the subject, securing the help of his research group, telling them that they have consented to the board to do so. But something goes wrong, and Kane gets trapped in his invisibility cloak, and how he and his team are trying to find a solution to their considerable dilemma before it's too late, it all begins to take out mean Kane. and suddenly, his fear of losing funding and control becomes unimportant, as it manifests itself before imminent danger of losing much more than that. . Now there is a very real chance that it could lose everything-- including myself <br /> <br /> Verhoeven handled that initially exciting, even thoughtful film; it sets a good pace and uses the F / X at its disposal a great effect, although it usually allow striking visual effects to suppress the development of character. Anyone who is familiar with the 'Invisible Man ", in fact someone who can logically follow the progression of history will know that early Caine Sun for happier times. However, Verhoeven has a narrative style, which certainly will attract attention and engage their audiences. But he seems bent on rushing to a climax, and on the way he waives any and all the nuances that made the film so far successful that decided to enter into the final sequence, which is nothing more than mindless blood-and-baked Festival that changes your audience and all that he had worked earlier in the film. Rather than look for a reasonable solution to Kane's suffering, and to use some ingenuity and imagination to take the film is an inevitable conclusion Verhoeven takes the low road, and although he can succeed on a purely visceral level, he has to be learned from history is dissolved, like so many ashes in the wind, and with anything that would make this a memorable film. And that's a shame, because Verhoeven has it at a higher level than a lot of what is being proposed in this genre, and it allows it to sink too much lower one. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon makes a good job of creating a character that is plausible, if only on the surface, that would seem to serve Verhoeven goals perfectly. There's little depth to the image of Bacon, but it has more to do with the agenda of its director than his own acting skills. Verhoeven just Bacon does not allow time for the development of Kane in any degree; character, mainly ship, around which Verhoeven can build their own history, and in this direction, it works. The film would have been better served, however, was the supreme and Bacon more closely at the development of the relationship between Cain and the audience, which would prompt some emotional involvement on the viewer side, that would draw them a little, and not to leave them at the gate, as it was, as simple observers with / X-laden extravaganzas. <br /> <br /> F Elisabeth Shue himself agrees well as Linda McKay ready partner in the ill-fated Kane experiment, but it's mostly a thankless part, which offers a bit of a challenge, especially for an actor Shue caliber. The same can be said of Kim Dickens (so great in the 2001 film, `thing of the sun"). Her character, Sarah Kennedy, does little more than support the action and F / X. Both actors are capable of much more, and they deserve better than what they are allowed to work with here. <br /> <br /> supporting cast includes Josh Brolin (Matthew), Greg Grunberg (Carter), Joey Slotnick (Frank), Mary Randle (Janice) and Devane (Dr. Kramer). Fascinating to the point, even with success in a certain (low) level, `Hollow Man» is one of those films that leaves you seeing what it could be. to the annual fireworks display, it will give you some brief thrill, but after some time it will start to merge with the rest of you have seen, without anything to set it apart. And this is too bad, because, given the talent and the ability of those involved here, it could be so much more. I rate this 4/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
