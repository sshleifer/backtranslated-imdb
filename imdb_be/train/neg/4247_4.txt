Prolonged painful, tearful and probabilistic drama, my twenty-fifth film Sidney Lumet, Garbo Talks, gets lodged vertically in the low end of the quality of my searches. <br /> <br /> The film documents the devastated young working man named Gilbert (Ron Silver), who is the son of Estelle roll (Anne Bancroft), eccentric, daring and, above all, an obsessive fan of Greta Garbo. If Estelle becomes affected by a brain tumor, her son decides to go on the obsessive quest of his own: to track down the Greta Garbo, and bring it to her mother <br /> <br /> Anne Bancroft in full on ,. chew-on-scenery Auntie Mame-mode here, something bold ole 'gal that loves the movie, where she mouths off to the people and in favor of its ideals, and ends up in prison all the time. It stands out as an obvious film an artificial construct, and every scene with her Yuk-Yuk lame; every note struck lie. The other characters are equally one-dimensional, but it is extremely less interesting. Ron Silver as flat as can be, and his attempt to love triangle, as a wired, like everything else in the film: It is found growing rich Lisa Rolf (Carrie Fisher), but gets killed by an eccentric co-worker Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks), and I called each stage three stages, before they happen. <br /> <br /> This is another problem. One-dimensional characters can survive if they are put in an intriguing and fascinating stories, but there's just nothing here. the pace of the film glaciers, glittering extraneous material, which does not increase absolutely nothing, and if the film really starts to follow a linear relationship, it's like a lot of thinking and uninteresting. There are a lot of guest stars, so to speak, including Harvey Fierstein as a gay man in New York (imagine that) in yet another very insignificant scene. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, he is trying to make a decent halfway- statement of the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives, but by that time, none of the characters do not exist as real people, and the film is already tired of me submission, so it functions as a case of far too little, far too late. The film is my twenty-fifth Lumet directed the film, which makes it easily the most viewed my director, but beyond a pair of glaring misses (a stranger among us, who?) It is not stretching painfully uninteresting depths Garbo talks. <br /> <br /> {Rating: 4.5 / 10 (C / C) / # 21 (24) 1984 / # 23 of 25 Lumet films}
