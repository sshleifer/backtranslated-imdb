There are some redeeming qualities in this show. Firstly, the theme tune does have a decent tune. The show has a nice room. Furthermore, I'm probably in the minority, but I love Wanda. I like the fact that she cares, and a mother figure Temi. However, despite all this, I do not like this show, Sun excrement, but I find it very annoying. <br /> <br /> I would not say that this is the best animated show on the planet Earth. When I use this term for the animated TV show, I think Peter Pan and the Pirates, I think Darkwing Duck, I think of Scooby-Doo, and I think Miracles on bends. And I hope I'm not the only one who really loves Wild Thornberrys and outraged by the fact that gets teased. And I do not think it's pretty Odd Parents worst animated show on the planet Earth. I accept this is annoying, and in some respects is overpriced, but it's not the worst show on Nickolodean. That is, Chalk Zone, god that show unwatchable. But the worst animated show I've ever seen this Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get a Clue, which is crudely animated, by a serious and open disgrace <br /> <br /> One thing I do not like about this show. animation. Symbols, forgive me if I offend, very strange facial features, and a lot of background boring and devoid of color that make Spongebob Squarepants and the Wild Thornberrys so nice to look at. Symbols, except for Wanda I find very annoying. I can not believe that such a talented voice actress as Tara Strong (aka. Charendoff) expressed Temi. Timy I do not find very nice as the lead character in general, it is annoying and sometimes condescending, and it is a bad decision maker, as well. And his voice on my nerves. I actually like the Strong, but not in this show. Another annoying character Cosmo, supposedly funny character. Instead, his joke as unfunny as they could be. They are either a) far-fetched, or b) on a friend. Parents Timh horrible characters who do not give a toss about her son, and their faces are well thin. <br /> <br /> storylines very unoriginal for the most part, and I keep thinking, where have I seen this before. Episodes after the child's arrival, I thought, were unwatchable. Even worse scripts with serious, children, brainless and suffer from a complete lack of energy. <br /> <br /> In general, not the worst show ever, but quite poor for a fan of animation, and pretty uncomfortable to sit. 3 / 10- has a redemptive quality, and I, if people it is completely understandable.
