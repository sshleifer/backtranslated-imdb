A man discovers that his parents were part of the nuclear experiment in the 50s, and that he now has the right to ... burst into the fire! <br /> <br /> I was really focused on this film, what with director Toby Hooper large and staring joker Dourif. Unfortunately, he did not rise higher than the average individual with-violent-degree film. Auto-ignition has an interesting premise behind it, unfortunately, it never seems to live up to their potential and prolongs its plot too much. The special effects are not bad, though, and help to transfer the film to the final. <br /> <br /> Cast not bad, Dourif does steal the show. <br /> <br /> All around, the sun classic, but it's not the worst of its kind, too. <br /> <br /> ** to ****
