First thing first. In this genre, the movie the first thing you need is good music, and where Mr. Shankar and his party fails. <br /> <br /> music is completely pale and ineffective. On the other hand, there is Ajay Devgan, who shot LETTER "A" with his writing, did a good job, but not a bad cast films like this. <br /> <br /> ASIN like a doll, which is used to entertain the public, despite the fact that it is good to watch, but its role in dance, in fact, she dances a member of a rock band, and I I do not think that any rock band is there as a dancer in the group. <br /> <br /> In a nut shell, this film is a piece of shit piece of *** t. watch it, if you want to get fooled.
