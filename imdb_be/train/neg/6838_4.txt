Plot Synopsis: Hong Kong, 1966 Paul Wagner, the man who built Victoria tunnel, was killed along with his wife, his colleagues. His twin sons, Chad and Alex, which are separated from each other. After 25 years, Chad, karate instructor in Los Angeles, and Alex, the smuggler lives in Hong Kong, to join forces to avenge the murder of his parents, and rightly claim to be a tunnel. <br /> <br /> This is the second time that Jean-Claude Van Damme and Lettich worked together previously made "The Brave." It is also the first of three films to show Van Damme plays a dual role ( "Maximum Risk" and "replicants" are the others). The plot is very simplistic take on the story of revenge, only softening of the film is the performance of Van Damme in two very different people ?? prim rich kid and rough - & - tumble, cigar chomping tough guy. As it goes, Van Damme does not do a very good job in any role, although his take on Alex mildly amusing. It's embarrassing to be mistaken brothers one by one, with their wear different clothes and have different hairstyles. Bolo Yeung makes a very worthy protege for villains.
