I will try to use words to describe it on .... <br /> <br /> I have seen the original, which was nice in its own way, but then I was afraid of continuing. <br /> <br /> And I'm "afraid" when I chose this, but now, when I saw him, I must say that it's even worse than I thought. Why are these films still get money still makes my mind spin. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the actors, they are not all that good, but it must be said, some do turn around, being just awful. But what can make an actor with a script like this. He's trying to be a copy of the original but this time the place has changed, any form of the story is gone, and any attempt to actually come up with something that was not done before, fails miserably. In a vain attempt to get it clarified, they try to make it interesting by making use of all the "big brother" of the topic, but it was worn out a long time ago and does not offer anything other than filler between the beginning and the end. An attempt was made to try to save the movie, making a bunch of links to the original 83, but only to end up being simple funny and sometimes a little sad. In conclusion, if you have nothing, and I mean nothing to do ... go to watch or play Frisbee with ... DVD .... yourself. It offers you the same amount of fun .. I promise
