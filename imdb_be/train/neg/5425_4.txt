I got mirror mainly because Yvonne De Carlo was there (I thought she was great in the American Gothic), but unfortunately, it did not have a very big role in this film. It starts OK and the pace moves along nicely ... but in the end it starts to get a bit tedious and boring. This does not mean that it is a sad movie, but it's just very average and nothing special. I do not like the "" side of his possessions and had no decent Gore scenes. Plus, the "main" story was very confusing, and the ending does not make much sense. I did however, as the history of the surrounding Gothic girl and how she got revenge on her tormentors <br /> <br /> I do not particularly recommend the mirror horror fans. - it did not wet myself again.
