First of all, how long a student of the Titanic disaster, and a member of several clubs Titanic, I feel entitled to comment on the film. I really do not care how many awards and won a movie, but I still absolutely awful movie. Cameron had the resources to do the "right" half-documentary film about the crash, but, unfortunately, decided to turn it into a turgid romantic mush. The fact that so many people around the world have fallen on it only shows, in my opinion, in a sad state of taste and common sense that the critics and the audience these days. Who said that all films should be the hero and heroine fall in love? In fact, most real events is not romantic and the Titanic disaster, of course, was not alone. I feel that we need the best script and director of the semi-documentary approach, and how little artistic license as possible. I almost pulled out at the last sequence, where "dead" lovers meet among others the lost passengers and crew members who break out into applause. This intelligent film? Ask yourself.
