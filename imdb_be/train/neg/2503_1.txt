What a poor excuse for a new Zealnd film making. I am ashamed to call himself a New Zealander, when the film exists and is currently playing in New Zealand, satellite TV (August 2006). The cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars. The ship, in real life, this is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands, and even has a logo (the dolphin) is still in the entire set, including funnel vessel. The vessel should be a cruise ship / ferry between the US and Mexico. It has obvious signs of rust and old everywhere else is supposed to be a luxury of the ship on its maiden voyage. One of the scenes shows the snowy peaks of the South Island of New Zealand in the background to God! It must have been very cold weather in the United States / Mexico area! History of weak acting weaker and New Zealand / American accent just does not work. I expect that the taxpayer of New Zealand contributed to the cost of production of this film and it's a waste of money better spent on actual production. I know that children from high school in New Zealand that could do better movies with their cell phones. Goof: There is a truck in the hold of the designated to him, and they were stuck Taco company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it's American. But some of the sign on top of the tag - you'd think they would have noticed that the props department before weaning. I would like to continue, but it's just not worth it anyway.
