Quite Stupid weapon. I think the guys dancing in the beginning of one of the films of Steven Seagal was intented to scoff Jeff makes his form of dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie. The plot is predictable, the fights were fair and Jeff works about as well as a sofa, he fights with any weapon in one scene.
