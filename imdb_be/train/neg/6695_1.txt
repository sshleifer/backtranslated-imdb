I had a thing for that Kari chick for some time, and, as far as it looks in the film, with no complaints. But after catching his last night in high definition, I am sure it is the only thing in the film, which is not of poor quality. a horrible scenario, acting terrible, horrible area. I saw other signs of someone commented on how great the sex scenes ... what? Not at all. If the movie is bad, you can also just turn it into a porno erotica, but instead I get to see some pasty white guy blocking me from seeing the body and scenes that do not offer me nothing but tease Wührer in. They should have just Cinemax, so that the film was not a waste of time, but no. With the script is terrible they are capitalized looks Wührer, as this lone of the film. 2/10, only because she looked so hot.
