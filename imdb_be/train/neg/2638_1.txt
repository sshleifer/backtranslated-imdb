There is a good. There is bad. And then their is the Guardians, the lower barrel political "thriller", which is among the worst films I have ever seen. The plot is a mole in the Secret Service is good, but does not have a film with such great potential was so completely butchered. Directed with ham hands "nervousness" Clark Johnson, every actor in this film seems to work on autopilot. Even great Michael Douglas looks bored here. I can honestly say that I have never, in my entire life, as seen another film with so many glaring plot holes. Twist is predictable from the ground, and the motives of the character so completely inappropriate that they inspired the audience laugh. Avoid this at all costs. This movie is a disaster, without the sacrificial value.
