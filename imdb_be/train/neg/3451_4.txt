Frank Sinatra was far from the ideal actor for the Westerns. He was a great actor, From Here to Eternity and The Man with the Golden Arm is proof that, but he did not build the Western hero, you have identified it as a city boy. But he was trying to do a good job in Johnny Concho, the fact that the film was a flop at the box office was not his fault. I blame it on two factors: a) the story was very unusual, especially that Sinatra behaves more like a villain than a hero throughout the film. In a genre where people kind of like a certain pattern is expected to break away from his film should be very good. b) history is not conclusive, it is difficult to believe that the whole city will allow Sinatra to do whatever he wants just because they are afraid of his brother. In addition, if a person shows him a special holster, which will be open to the side, so it does not draw the gun you wonder if it will make him invincible, why Gunfighters did not take it? I think this film should not be removed, because any film with Sinatra's worth a look, and, despite its shortcomings, it is still enjoyable
