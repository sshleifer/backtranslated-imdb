I lay on the bed, with a very bad cold or flu or whatever. I think that maybe I would kill some time watching some horror, my mother bought for me some time ago. I wish I had not chosen this film! After I watched it, I felt even more sick, and I wanted to quit. Epilogue (when I got better, of course), I did some research on Dennis L.Rader, and I noticed that Dennis in the film was nothing like the real one. I hope nobody's watching this film, but if they ever do not have, or you'll feel the way I felt when I first saw it. I think you would be better time watching Santa Claus 3. At the very least, the film had the best reviews on this site.
