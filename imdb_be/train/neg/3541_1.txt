What we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money and revenge can hurt your soul ... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, director known for his remake of the gangster genre, bites off more than he can chew with this. <br /> <br /> His use of modern noir address the human subject, setting yourself free from swallowing pride, being nice to his enemy, and to give all your money falls flat on his face. If the character Jason Statham is no longer afraid of Ray Liotta, he apparently does not drive Liotta enough mind to blow his head in the final scene. Why? In general, you can not configure the mafia as a symbol Liotta, who allegedly got to his station in life, showing the kind of ruthless behavior evident throughout the film, only to be driven to suicide Unfortunately nothing smile on the face of the character in Statham. <br /> <br /> Before anyone starts talking, I'm missing the point ... I do not. I get it right? Selects from the wealth of search and you will find true happiness and inner peace. Be nice to your enemy, and it troubled him to self-destruction. This seems to be the essence of the film and of itself is not a bad premise for a story, though hardly original. The problem lies in the fact that Richie simply do not have the skills, as the film-makers to carry it. At a time when even the Guy Ritchie gets it, he seems bored with the story and starts to put red herring: the scene where Statham gets knocked on the car - Why? Filming of some scenes as the Marvel comics animation ... Again, why? <br /> <br /> There are so many loose threads and unresolved issues remaining at the end of the movie that you could get all of 2001-ish about it and try to find them, or just accept that there are no answers and every viewer will interpret things in their own way. Myself? I was so sad to the arrogant tone of the film, which I just did not care. Open ending can not come too early, so I did not have to sit through more than this pretentious psychobabble. <br /> <br /> spending two o'clock my life.
