Well, I do not know where to start. Obviously, this was done for television movie, so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by the overall supervision of the second, but nothing before or after, it would seem, paint numbers kind of cinema. <br /> <br /> And talk about bad chemistry between towing Lovebird detectives. .. <br /> <br /> I would be more in depth, but this film does not deserve. Rating: D + (rating IMDB 3/10)
