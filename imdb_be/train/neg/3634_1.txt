Boring children's imagination, which gives Joan Plowright star billing, but few do. Juicy children to pursue their dreams. Frankie wants to be a ballerina and a baseball player (ugh), and best friend-Hazel running for mayor --- it 13! Completely pedestrian in every way, plus additional disadvantage syrupy performances of girls and boys baseball. Of course, the less force for Showtime --- without restrictions?
