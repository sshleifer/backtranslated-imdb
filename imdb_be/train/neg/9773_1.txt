When he was released, I thought it was one of the most secular films ever made. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese and several other directors like him, there were movies trunk worse, language-wise, than it is .... but it's pretty brutal assault on the ears. Hey, I can take a lot of it, but it's funny to me. During the first six minutes, but I could hear half a dozen use the Lord's name in vain, plus countless F-word. I wonder how many people came out of the theater, watching this in 1990? I could not be just one. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that some of the artistic cast included Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. With this film, Stephen Lang, seems to improve their image, at least, to play in a pious, "the Stonewall" Jackson's "Gods and Generals". Lang's role here is just the opposite:., Probably the worst trashy people in the film and the character who falls in love with a transvestite until the end of the film <br /> <br /> Disappointing, dark, semi-pornographic, off: these are just some of the adjectives used by people - even some liberal critics - in the description of this story, which is painted worse in the novel. Of course, some of the most prominent critics, all extreme Libs, praised the film. Nevertheless, they were the only ones. Most critics disgusted, and almost all of the public payer. It's unbelievable that someone can praise dirt and debris, as <br /> <br /> Trust me on this :. No good, charming characters in the film as a whole. It's a mean, sick film, one of the worst "of the modern era." That is, if you do not like to see child abuse, drug addiction, teenage prostitutes, and then - two straight hours of nothing but cruelty and simply evil people. No, thank you.
