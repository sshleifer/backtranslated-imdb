There is not a speck of entertainment throughout the film. There's not a scary, funny or interesting scene in the movie. He advertises itself as horror, and then proceeds to call itself a comedy. He did not even try humor. It also does not try to be scary. <br /> <br /> In order not to miss this film, you must be one of the most easily entertained people on earth. If you like this film even slightly, than you there is no standard for what you are looking at all. I have a very hard time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to achieve with it. It's not funny, scary, shocking, or intriguing. So was it must be a drama? Because it actually was not dramatic either. <br /> <br /> Please, just do yourself a favor i did not look this film. Life is too precious to spend 90 minutes to watch it.
