I doubt that a puzzle was hip even while the whole topic LSD married a murder mystery being clearly apparent attempt to capture the younger audience era, not least, accurately shows any understanding of the sixties counterculture. Dated aspect aside, Jigsaw suffers from many problems, including actions excited, silly and unnatural dialogue, the LSD flashbacks that go on indefinitely, even after the item has been killed in a home for the first 60 seconds, the inability to create any real suspense, even if the actual site, on paper, a big car to do it, and an ending that is so banal and predictable (not to mention reminds a lot of bad TV shows) that the climax is actually an anti-climax. If it was the best movie we could suspend disbelief for a few things where it would help to enjoy, but the shortcomings are so angry they serve only to highlight the improbability viewers might otherwise miss. I saw puzzle on television, and it is certainly late in the evening television tariff is designed to fill the air space and take some time to kill someone's insomnia, and not something anyone should actively seek. In the best case, three out of 10.
