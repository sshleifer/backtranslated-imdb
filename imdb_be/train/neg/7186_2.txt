I'm sorry to all the fans, but it's a useless film. It acts badly, even wooden, it is more or cheats the fright-factor at an early stage, and just does not work. I think that there had to be a twist at the end, but it just ended up being annoyingly confusing. What the hell? Dude, that kills all was one of the hunted? Try again. <br /> <br /> It is hardly original, and that's not even particularly well as a direct slasher. And it says something. <br /> <br /> I think that the one who did the casting, who wrote the screenplay, and the one who thought of the concept must be ruthlessly dismissed and deported. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. If someone puts it on at a party, throw the disc out of the window and put on a good horror movie, like Silence of the Lambs or shine.
