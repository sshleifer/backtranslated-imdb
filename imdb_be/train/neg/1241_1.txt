This is the worst movie I've seen in many years! It starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way. I thnik, if something happens in this movie ,,,, and acting worse. The ending is picks it up a bit and keeps the film from total flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. Unfortunately Tim Burton Batman was good, but this one sucks.
