This is one of those movies that you think that the producers would have refused to release it, because it's so scary. It is obvious that they think children are stupid and is perfect for absorbing the endless ads and will think that they have fun, because it's funny farce. What's wrong with speaking the car with buttons that say Wendy's, McDonalds, M & M'S and Skittles? There was no talk in a cartoon car. (Dr) Claw be maliciously, not handsome and charming. Why Rupert Everett "Claw" anyway? Writers were on drugs when they wrote these scenes? It seems that they were (bad) lampooning Robo Cop, with the rotation of the person in the fight against crime android things. I tried to get my money back, but there was a policy, where, when I look at more than 30 minutes of the film, you will not receive compensation. I regret that I watched more than 30 minutes, this heap of shit. After I was told no-return policy, I decided to watch the disgusting garbage called Inspector Gadget.
