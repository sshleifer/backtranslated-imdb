As a Dane, I am proud of a handful of good Danish films that have been made in recent years. It is a terrible shame, however, that the quality of the jump led the majority of the Danish Film Critics lose the sense of criticism. In fact, it got so bad that I do not trust any reviews of Danish films, and eventually I stopped to watch them in the cinema. <br /> <br /> I know it's wrong to keep this unfortunate development against any one film, so let me emphasize that «Villa Paranoia" is a terrible film under any circumstances. The fact that he was swollen by critics only added to my disappointment the fire in the Danish film. In addition, waiting until he was released on DVD there was very little help against the inexorable sense of spending time and money. <br /> <br /> Erik Clausen is an experienced director with a knack for social realism in Copenhagen settings. I especially liked the "De Frigjorte" (1993). As an actor, he is usually funny, even though he usually plays the same role in all his films, namely, that of the working class slob who are down on their luck, and partly because he is careless, but mainly because of society, and who redeems himself by doing something good for their community. <br /> <br /> This is the number one problem in the "Villa Paranoia", Clausen throws himself as a chicken farmer who is such a break from the norm, he never succeeds in making it a reliable <br. /> <br /> much worse, however, that the film has to make turns and break all the rules, how to tell a story, to make the audience understand what is going on. For example, the film begins with a very sad attempt at visualizing the near-death experience of the protagonist with the low-budget effects and bad camera work. After that, a character says it best th one, she suddenly felt a desire to jump off a bridge It is a symptom of the film, and there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters, and Klauzno refers to the lowest form of communication, regardless of motivation is:. telling instead of showing Thus, at one point. that is, a character to speak out on the ostensibly devoid of consciousness a person how he feels, because the script does not allow him to act in their feelings, and later, voice suddenly introduced, it is possible, in hindsight, to convey feelings that would otherwise have remained unknown to the audience because of the incompetence of the director. Fortunately, at this moment you are about an hour by worrying about any of the characters, not to mention the so-called history. <br /> <br /> action, which is often a problem in Clausen films, can be summed up in one sad statement :. Søren Bentsen Westerberg, whose only other claim to fame was as a contestant on Big Brother, no worse than some of the actors in the cast foreshadowed <br /> <br /> I give it 2-of-10 rating.
