I think, probably, 200 films a year in theaters and at home, and I can confidently say that this film is much worse, I've seen this year (if not always, but I actually have not seen "The Vow knights Delta "yet). This film is just a bad joke after bad joke aimed at the age of 13, because if he had the displeasure of watching it on the bus ride, I could not leave. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and skip this one on loan passage. Four dollars could be better spent on any movie numbers Jerry Bruckheimer production.
