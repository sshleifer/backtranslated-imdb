Seriously, the only good thing about this competition were the winners. <br /> <br /> Although the ceremony itself was quite short, it still was a little boring. I think it is time to seriously look for a new director and producer for the show, which can come up with something really new. It's pretty obvious that they were trying to make the show more "hip" and appealing to a younger audience this year, allowing Beyonce to perform and letting P. Diddy and Prince represent the category. In addition, giving Chris Rock to be leading an attempt to re-new the ceremony and make it more attractive. None of this is really not possible. <br /> <br /> Of course, Chris Rock is a funny guy, but he was not really a good leader. I really just see him as a guy who just said something and between different categories. His presence was not really as "big" as for. <br /> <br /> copy of Billy Crystal In addition, distribution of awards was pretty dumb at times. Without giving all to come to the scene, but also to distribute some of the awards in the middle of the theater it was simply amazing. <br /> <br /> However, I can not remember being happier with the awardees. None of the films did not dare awards as has always been so for the last couple of years. So does this mean that it was a good year for movies with lots of competitive rivals? I do not think so. I think that most of the films will be largely forgotten in 20 years, with the exception of «Million Dollar Baby» and «The Passion of the Christ" may be. Of course, I do not agree with each award, which was presented this year, for example, Caleb Deschanel should win for Best Cinematography, not that I do not like the work of Robert Richardson, he's really done some amazing work for the majority of Oliver Stone's work, but I really feel that Deschanel has earned the award a lot more. Also, I would love to see Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win for best editing and John Debney for the best music. But oh well, there's no way the Academy Award land, of course, I understand that. There will always be people who complain about the winners. <br /> <br /> In addition, it was fun to see that most of the recipients bearer were much more nervous than the nominees and winners. Perhaps immediately once the prince said to any of the nominees name? And it was this sense of humor Sean Penn? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope that they missed" irons were the best leading night. <br /> <br /> In general, a very forgettable show, but with good winners. <br /> <br /> 4/10
