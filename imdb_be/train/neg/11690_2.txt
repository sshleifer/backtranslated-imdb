This condition is given such great actors in such a weak and boring movie. In addition, all the unanswered questions are available in other comments, that is so difficult to capture the robbers? Just eliminate the employee of the bank, to find out who was in the bank, with all the footage the camera angle to the entry of robbers and you have an extra four remaining robbers among the hostages. Where the unknown every body is talking about? It was so obvious that the time of the hostages asked to change into the same shape, they are all going to come to the front door ... seen it many times. At the very least, Mr. Spike Lee could have filled the film with some good scores and artistic photography. The film is not worth it. Pronto!
