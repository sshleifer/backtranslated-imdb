Lynne Ramsay makes arrest figures and Samantha Morton can cause a sense of gesture. So the burden, to discover their talents spent on this campy, artsy lark. <br /> <br /> Ramsey could not bring to life Callar. Her attempts too arty and oblique. Repeatedly the camera lingers on her long silent shots of the actress in agony as if single-handedly destroyed Morton's opinion may put the character. We are in an empty Warholian hell pampering: for a film that has moments to save on bedbugs crawling on the floor, you might think that he could get around to fill his hero. But how to do it if it rarely speaks? Without interior monologue novel, Morvern Callar celluloid no one. Not surprisingly, Ramsey Morton often undress. <br /> <br /> However, the first ten minutes were so impressively acted, shot and edited that my hopes are rising. Give the movie that much: he knows how to make a promise, if not, how to save anyone.
