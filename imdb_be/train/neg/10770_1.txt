May contain possible spoilers (not that anything in this film it is new or even slightly surprised you on this issue) <br /> <br /> Why Disney feel the need to recycle everything they have ever done in non-existence? Of course, it is cheaper for them, but after a while, do not you think the overall quality and the way people think about them will fall. House Of Villains is despicable cartoons crossovers, which have absolutely no sense at all. Some common signs of ignoring the previous films of this: the voice is not even remotely match and his evil again (? C when) I know that these films directly to children, but there was a time when everyone could enjoy the Disney movies. Even the music of the film number (which was a special Disney for many years) smelly. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even very young. All I can do that if more of these films are of the same caliber are released, it is only a matter of time before some small animation studio Disney is superior overall quality.
