I was totally disappointed with this film. I read some other reviews here and had much higher expectations. I expected the drama to the development of more intensive character. But it never happens in the film. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe. I taught, he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the film. I would rate his performance 6 of 10. <br /> <br /> actor: 6 out of 10 Direction 5 out of 10. The author of the scenario is the worst 2 of 10. <br /> <br /> I have removed the film with my DVR for 70 minutes. in the movie. Much better movies out there than this ...
