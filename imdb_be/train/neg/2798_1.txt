This film is bad. If you are thinking about watching it, there is only one decent scene in the movie, and it takes about 5 seconds (topless scene Amanda Carraway in). The rest of the movie is terrible. I think high school plays, probably better effect. The plot makes no sense. The set was pretty lame, and it was not good to make fun of. It was just boring, and very, very bad! I watched it on Starz, so I thought that it had to be at least decent. Mini description sounds like it would be good. Girlfriend kills himself apparently for no reason at the beginning of the movie, since you have to look for some awful music video. Transitions between scenes are very sharp and, like someone just put a ton of clips in the movie, without even thinking about how their transition. Simply cuts from one scene to another, NO smoothness. Kind of like my chance to switch from talking about how bad the movie to explain why the story of sludge. The sound is low in some places, where you can only hear it, it gets loud from gay "cry of horror" was thrown at random points in the film. It's the same sound every time. It is now officially the worst movie I have ever seen <br /> <br /> actor: 0/10 effects of 1/10 Storyline: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Lame meters : 1000000/10
