Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze terrible movie. Poor script, acted on, and just stupid. That being said ... it's actually a nice movie on some level. This film asks observed in the group with a sufficient stock of cheap beer. This is one of those films, like "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians" and "Yor, the hunter from the future" ... so bad it's almost good. If you have the right group of people, this movie is a blast to watch. It's old-fashioned. It interesting. It has a theme of Sousa. If you are looking for a good movie, though, look elsewhere. 3/10. <br /> <br /> by the way, I've heard rumors, some studios are exploring the possibility of alteration ...
