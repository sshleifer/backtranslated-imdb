At least, seats in the theater were comfortable, and I did eat popcorn as loud as possible to drown out the dialogue humbly. This is absolutely not a girl movie. All the guys who love him, those of us lady can be sure to stay away from. Goofy plot, dialogue and mediocre overall cheap that looks like a movie. I have seen many, many films, but the new winner in the category of poor. If you still see it, one thing you look forward, it is the end. So you can finally run out of the theater as quickly as you can.
