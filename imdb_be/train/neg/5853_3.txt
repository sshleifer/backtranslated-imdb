IMMORTALIZER was, well, interesting. This, of course, do not kill me during the hour and a half duration, but did not impress me too much. A group of children are kidnapped in the alley on musclehead mutants (in the scene with no less compelling theater head shattering sound effect) and delivered in a fancy house in the suburbs. Here Dr. Divine and his team carried out brain transplant for his wealthy older patients, so they can have a young body again. Hey, it was quietly redesigned with a larger budget a few years later as FREEJACK! Who knew that if you transplant the brain of an old man in another body, that of a new voice will sound just like their old voice? With all this talk of the pineal gland and the use of glowing green serum, you can almost see visions of RE-animator and dancing in the minds of producers. But the production just is not enough courage to pull it out. I never understood why, when someone makes a low budget horror movie, they do not pack it to the edge of the frame with blood. Actions uniformly terrible, with only one good performance coming from Clark Liendl as an assistant to Dr. Price. It has a nice evil laugh. The only thing to note about IMMORTALIZER is that it has a lot of old people doing their own stunts. Seriously, most of the cast takes a serious blow to the elderly.
