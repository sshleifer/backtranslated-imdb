It takes two, because I liked it as a kid, but he became so excessive that I started to hate ... I can not give this narrative review, because it will be reaffirming one after the other, I probably Wouldn Â«t say something that has not yet been told. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this show is that it's pretty nasty, with a child with boiling in this twisted nanny to the stupidity that goes around about it. I have a cousin who loves the show, and he is the most strange and stupid person I have met. This show is to be extracted from the air. It's always the same thing over and over again ... They should put the best show on Nick. I'm getting really tired of things like that.
