** HERE BE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The government continues to develop UniversalSoldier program, now called UNISOL. Soldiers are now stronger and able to take more damage than before. However, government downsizing, the project is under threat and a supercomputer, which is located in the center of all feel threatened, so it is taking steps to ensure their own safety. It activates and operates UniSols and start working pogrom. The only one who can stop them in the brother-in-law (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This film is about one. Set battle. The history of bad, and soon drowned in all the battles. Whatever happens, and wherever they go, they are struggling. Unfortunately, for this film, it's not fun to watch a fight where you know one part of it is not indestructible. Usually you are very confident that the hero will win, but you still want to feel that the battle between the two is a few fighters. Not where one is indestructible and can not lose. Then the fights simply become a tool to stretch time. You'll have to wait until the last fight, when brother-in-law miraculously finds a way to beat him unbeatable foe. To further reduce their opinion, desperate and a sure sign of a bad movie as poorly dressed woman there. Well, not too much, because the characters the majority of men (there is at least one woman UNISOL, though), but almost every woman at shows, at least only a bra once. The female is somehow not with this, but we also go through a strip club (to use a computer at least) with a much more naked women. These moments do not give anything in history, and only there, to try to please teenager thinking male audience. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, a boring fight. No more, no less. Well, maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
