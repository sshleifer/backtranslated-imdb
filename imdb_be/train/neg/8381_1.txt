There are some very talented black director Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Dukes' C, Denzel and many others who deserved credit bring the film industry. Then there is the Wayans brothers, who at one time (15 years ago) were very funny television show'In Living Color Â», which began its career of Jim Carrey among others. Now we have the stupidity, which replaces the humor and gross with gags (toilet humor) as a standard operating procedure. People are not as stupid as portrayed in the "little man", they might not be. A child with a full set of teeth and tattoos are accepted once a month? The child comes from five o'clock shadow that he shaves. He hinted that the child is having sex with his foster mother for her husband, Darryl, .oh back, this is ridiculous. As the chief of the criminal "little man" is silly on planet Earth. He hides the stolen stone, which is huge in the woman's purse, and then continue it. Co-star Palminteri why Chaz offers the best line: "I'm surrounded by morons." On the basis, without credit to Chuck Jones cartoon, Baby Buggy Bunny. It's too silly to even remotely funny. The key is how bad this movie Damon Wayans appeared on Jay Leno the other night, a BAT awards, and he did not even mention this scary movie. If Hollywood stop green lighting dirty Wayans Brothers. If they get over their white mans fault, probably.
