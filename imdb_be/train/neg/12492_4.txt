This is one of these films, which has an amazing video window, but wired Camra work and unknown actors speaking with bad dialogue.Its so dark when the murder case, you can hardly see it, plus the film difficult understand.The only star in this WCW `s Vanessa Sanchez (Tygres in the WCW, before he folded), and she is a good actress. I like a low budget film Especialy those that have bugs because they are fun to watch, but the severed unfourtunatly ISN `one of them.This film good to see if you like fishing pole and severed heads, but it's not a blockbuster, but if you We need something new to watch the rent cut.
