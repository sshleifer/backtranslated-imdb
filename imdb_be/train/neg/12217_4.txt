As a low budget indies to go, you will usually find that you get what you pay for, and let me say that I did not pay much for «Frightworld» ... <br /> <br /> Author / Director: David P . Williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park deposited vengeful spirit of a serial killer killed. Good room, but done with a flock of low budget error. The camera work is trying to be too cleaver to his audience, constantly using unstable rapid crop to cover the fact that they actually have nothing gory or scary to show us. This becomes apparent as soon as we get to know a potential killer, and soon realize that (action) is the most terrible thing is happening ... After painfully long title sequence we brought back to our time, while the actor remains the same. «Frightworld» does generate quite unique cinematography when displaying the scenery in a fun house, but with a very long, it can not save the film from it below the average indie hell. <br /> <br /> There are some mediocre poverty, but not so much for the gore, which, as a rule, the saving grace for these types of films. <br /> <br /> The proponents really bad B-movies can find something interesting here, otherwise, the sun to spend a lot of money.
