I really had to catch another movie from the other commentators on this site, because viewers have killed at Dialoge, that (I'm not even kidding) half came when showing the movie last night. Shot as if the director thought he was approaching a little daring new territory, representing gay coming-of-age story, the film uses the David Lynch inspired visual with Fassbinder inspired to act. Performance in this film is so boring and sad that I knew one of the actors were going to go the way they seem uninspired script. What's worse is that it is painted as Miami episode. I do not know who the director thinks it is; maybe he has a claim as a surreal Bu√±uel, Jordowsky etc. But the problem is that all of the above Directors reflects the level of erudite sensibility that is sorely lacking here. I could understand the richness of this movie about ten years ago, but if we have such masterpieces as Bad Education, Mysterious Skin and show me love what this cinematic turd? There's nothing new to see here.
