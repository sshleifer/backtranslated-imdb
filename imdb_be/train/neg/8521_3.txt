This is to give part of the story, by the way. A Charlie Brown Christmas is one of those timeless classics that will teach you the meaning of Christmas, and just enjoy the holiday. This, however, does not. He tries to capture the emotions of A Charlie Brown Christmas, there even is another Christmas game, but fails to dim and light jokes. Sun Charlie Brown is no longer wondering about the spirit of Christmas but instead wants to buy a gift for Peggy Jean ($ 25 gloves ... what?). His sister Sally the most annoying character in the film. Here is one of her jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa, but does not know how to spell Charlie (for some reason, he should be in his letter) so instead decided to call him Sam, because she knows how to spell Sam. In addition, Sally plays an angel in the game with one word per day: «! Hark» Instead, she says stick (har har). If Sally chu saying 12 times (all strange sound just) does not kill you, nothing will. Peppermint Patty and Mars big focus, but is unlikely to make it better. Marcy fun with their answers to Patty, Patty, but that's another story. It sounds like a boy (which does not dispel the rumors) and angry, when it should be the sheep in the game (and all the terrible Baas). Apparently, it is a sheep every year, and is worried she will not forget her lines (lines it does not). She was so excited, she mentions it twice, one after the other, and get the same answer. I believe that it must have a short-term memory loss or something. Lucy and Linus more than welcome (although Linus is still annoying Council), but is unlikely to make a lot of airtime. I am sure that Schroeder's not the point. In general, he is trying to be a parasite to the original, but compromised on the message a few quick laughs.
