. Razhnikant becomes born again after receiving a magic power, which he can use seven times <br /> <br /> There are several problems with this film, which will be apparent to the casual audience: 50ish Razhnikant still at home with their parents; neighbor father thinks he is compelling, "the boy» ( «vaseekaramaana paiyan»); Razhnikant suddenly interrupts the film with his sermons, the worst is that the women received their last exercise through housework - yet we believe that it is not a theist; despite the fact that he was well-read, he spends six of seven degrees on silly snakes; I could go on, but you get the picture. <br /> <br /> There is a God-man, there are gods, and have Razhnikant. Razhnikanta catalog has difficulty fitting into one of these categories. Initially Razhnikant Razhnikant just do what Tamils ​​heroes do - to become a villain and, despite the fact that the old, getting cared for the most beautiful girl in the movie. Razhnikant does it well, and some of Razhnikanta trademark styles are really good - "Count Baba" is a novelty. What makes the film unbearable that those first few minutes just a preface to the book, the worst that will ever be written. Even the fact that the preface interspersed with some comedy to make and obviously <br /> <br /> The director explains the goal of the hero. we see that the hero faces a number of obstacles (from the politicians, as usual), but we can not really root for the hero, because we know that the ultimate goal of the hero is. In the end, when everyone wants it to be a leader, a hero gives one of his sermons and leaves to become a hermit. The director did not offer any solution to the problem in the climactic scene. <br /> <br /> A. R. Rahman cost is really interesting. Or it shows the brightness spots, or he did not put himself completely in this film - who can blame him. There is one scene where Razhnikant steps into the car of one of the thieves, and then throws a knife and begins its countdown Baba. Music is very prone to this point, and acts as a catalyst by adding additional tension. All songs are mediocre, no one would bother with the songs from the film after several years. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, one is not the lowest rank can be assigned to IMDb. This film has all the elements that justify their rightful place in the ranking of the dungeons in IMDb.
