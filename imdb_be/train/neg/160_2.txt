I really wanted to love this western, being a fan of the genre and a fan of "Buffalo Bill", "Wild Bill Hickok" and "Calamity Jane '', all of which are in this story! Add to the mix Gary Cooper as the lead actor, and it sounded great. <br /> <br /> The problem was ..... it was not. I found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes of this, being bored to death. the character of Jean Arthur was a bit annoying and James Ellison just do not like nor act as "Buffalo Bill." Cooper was not in his power, or sound too wooden. It was several years before he hit his prime as an actor. <br /> <br /> In general, its western arrows blank. Go up the passage and watch another oater, because most of them were much better than this.
