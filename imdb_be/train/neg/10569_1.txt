I tried to watch the movie in a military camp during foreign missions, and let me tell you, you will see something in these conditions. Not this piece of shit, though. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes set the tone weak porn film quality of the acting strangely out-of-the-blue plot twists and improbable situations and behavior. It gets worse after that. This film does not have a single saving grace, and yet it is not a bad thing, because that would make it look funny. It's just awful. I've seen a lot of movies in my life, and I'm not one of those snobby know-all criticism, I mean, I'm going to enjoy most of the films, to some extent, even if they are bad. This is one ... person. <br /> <br /> Steer _well_ away from that, my friend.
