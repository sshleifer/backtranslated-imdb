My neighbor rented this movie the other night, so we watched it together. <br /> <br /> The first impression is actually a positive, because the whole film is shot in this beautiful, grainy, post-MTV texture. Rapid succession, cold corners, sweeping camera movements - at this point you feel like you're going to see another «Snatch», at the moment .... <br /> <br /> If the story actually begins the deployment, a person begins I feel as if one of the dosed amphetamine. things just does not make sense anymore. I would not want to spoil the pleasure of watching him, giving out certain scenes, but then again, the movie is so bad that you're actually better not to watch. <br /> <br /> At first you think it's a crime story is told in a conversation between Keira Knightley and Lyusyami Liu. Wrong. This conversation does not give coherent narrative at all. Rather, lesbian Domino let the character of Lucy Liu in the second part of the movie just throws the viewer into further confusion. <br /> <br /> Then I thought that maybe this is a movie about a girl from a wealthy but dysfunctional background, who grew up to be a tough bounty hunter. In any case, this message is transmitted to the opening scenes. But after that the question of the nature of the Domino completely lost to the criminal plot. In short, no, it's not a film about the nature of Domino. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it was probably the story of the robbery. Pretty bloody robbery. 10 million missing, bounty hunters chasing around the suspected robbers, mafia children punished, removed his hands, trying to break the Domino why this time they do not get a bounty of certificates, etc. But soon this impression is scattered with another turn of the plot. <br /> <br /> This time we are faced with the sad story of obese African-American women who fake driver's license at the local Ministry of Internal Affairs and at the age of 28 years happens to be a young grandmother. Lateesha star on the Jerry Springer show, trying to promote some new stupid racial theory, and at the same time struggling to find the money for his sick granddaughter. <br /> <br /> What does this have to do with the main plot? Urgh, well, no one knows. In addition, the director had to explain to the audience, where there will be bounty hunters set their fee collectors 300000 <br /> <br /> Then at some point you start to think: ". Oh, it's about our society and the media distorts the way things are. " There is a reality TV people driving around with headhunters and do some violent scene. Headhunters are also stuck with a bunch of Hollywood actors, who just whine constantly about their noses broken and pulled themselves around too many crime scenes. But no, this is not a film about the media, they are simply sporadically throughout the film <br /> <br /> In addition, there are many other sub-areas :. Crazy guy bent Afghanistan to liberate Afghanistan, a love story between Domino and Chocco, mescaline episode FBI surveillance operation ... <br /> <br /> Maybe all the things mentioned above are packed 2 hour movie? Judge for yourself, but my conclusion is clear - it is a real mess!
