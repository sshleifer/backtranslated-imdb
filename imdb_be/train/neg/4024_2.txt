This film is simply awful. Poor John Savage had to bend it low in order to be in another movie. He stars as a rare type of vampire, which should help a lady who looks like a washed out and thrown on the street prostitute who is a dancer at a local strip club. She acidently taste a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires as they are passionate about making out on the floor of the toilet. Savage then appointed to lead this rare breed of vampire that looks like a cross between 80's punk rock and one of the Olsen twins with purple hair. This film just gets all crazy Savage rapping and dancing with a dwarf spider tattooed on his head, is also one of the rare. He cites the Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante, and I just had to laugh. It just gets rediculas. And then the crudest special effects that they could figure out how to Corri tossing the bodies and pull them out of her mouth. And you can say that it's all fake. Her son did not know what to do with their mothers a new identity and becomes more harmful than the object of serenity. I like a good vampire movie, believe me, but I just hated this one. Even the picture stinks, and blurs in with the camera switching, consequently, it is trying to make it look like a vampire to go fast for the camera to keep up, and then the camera turns on all the bright stage in Savage chasing his son with Corri around until he dazzles themselves. Avoid this one !!
