Quick ENCOUNTER is a terrible and pointless remake of the 1945 David Lean classic, which was based on Noel Coward's play "Still Life". The doctor removes the women's eyes sand particles at the railway station, it is in a helpless relationship, she is happily married social worker of Italian origin. They meet by chance in a different time, to form the instant appeal and to arrange a meeting with each other every Wednesday. Pair falling in love, but after spending a few afternoon together, they realize that they have no real chance of happiness and agree to leave. the original one-act play Rabbit comes to two ordinary people who fall in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, the two super stars and veterans of Hollywood epics, is the idea of ​​a draw with "ordinary people." Loren, in particular, is miscast - Sophia Loren in full make-up, like a million dollars, working part-time voluntary social work at the Citizen Advice Bureau just does not ring true. Burton, looking haggard, with dyed hair, too much make-up and wear shoes on the platform, Sun comes as the average general practitioner. However, you can not blame them for that matter after what their spouses. Burton is married to a literary critic who spends his evenings corral poisonous comments and who treats her husband with utter contempt. Lauren's husband, Jack Hedley, potters around the house all day and terminally sad: the most exciting thing he has ever done deal almost six years earlier. Their final scene together will cause nausea, ( "You have been long away," etc.). This is a great British actor brokerage, John Lemesurier has a three minute cameo of Burton and seems a little drunk, saying, his lines in a barely audible voice. it's boring and forgettable performance in the dark, horrible, a retelling of the classic movie. Avoid at all costs.
