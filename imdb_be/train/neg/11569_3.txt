Even if you subscribe to a reflex against the free trade policies of the film, it's still the same tired notes, played again and again and again. Clink clink clink. Even if you can take a preacher with peroxide hair, projecting a return to first principles, the Reverend Billy is quite difficult to watch as a serious figure. Silly Reverence is its native, who wakes up every morning with the desire not more essential than to see his face on television, before he climbs back into bed that night. He has a beautiful wife, I have to admit, but it would take a ton more than that to keep this mess mourning film. Endless bus trip the worst part - the progress shown - you can guess - the color line, moves across the map. Oh, you guessed it. Well, he has the merit to be short. This is the only favorable thing that I can say? Hmmm. Yes, I'm afraid so.
