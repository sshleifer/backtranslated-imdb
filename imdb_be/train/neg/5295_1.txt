The teenager, who seems to have it all commit suicide. He leaves his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) ask a lot of questions ... and blame themselves. <br /> <br /> A good idea badly handled. For a start it was made before 1988 - mainly in television movies and After School Specials. In addition to a battle and dialogue (hence the rating of PG-13), it does not add anything new. The result is predictable and Reeve attempts at actions were really painful to watch. He's good now, but not in 1988. In addition, his character was dressed like a slob and always looked so dirty it was hard to have to create sympathy. <br /> <br /> This is the side of the film boring. I saw every scene comes every "surprise" telegraph. I basically could not wait for this thing to get more. <br /> <br /> I have a vague recollection of seeing it in the theater in 1988 and hated it (it bombed badly). He still looks lousy in nearly 20 years. Subject worth of treatments, but it was done better (with best actor) in countless other films. "Ordinary people" comes to mind. You can skip this.
