... I said a couple coming out of the theater just as I entered to look at it. Hmm, not a good sign, but who knows? Different strokes for different folks, after all. Well, no. They were good. Godard has produced work that is hot (Contempt), entertainment (Outsiders Orchestra), sometimes both (Maya Life to Live). It's just boring intellectualism that cuts the nerves pretty quickly. During my show, just half of the audience has already reached the end of the film. If I had been so wise.
