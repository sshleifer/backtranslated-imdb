I was interested in the title and description of the Big Rig while attending the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas. Nevertheless, I was ready to get the heck with seats as soon as Big Rig ended. Big Rig consists of several "big rig" drivers who went on the delivery of goods controlled by the United States. The characters are all wonderful people, but the filmmakers never dug deeply into the complexity of them as people. Instead, the story is twisted as much as the card in a film designed to guide, but never does. At best, we're lost. We - the audience - ultimately nowhere and, as the direction of the story, in the end somewhere, but without direction, location or area. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? Narration carelessly and intention directors on "humanization" of the group of people who believe they "forget" and "invisible" comes across unconsciously and annoyingly condescending. The problem here is here instead of truck drivers in the future directors. Leaders bring their own naive assumptions about the trucker in advance, and then simply edit the film to confirm these assumptions. In general, history has no voltage, the film is entirely too long (should have been 15 minutes a sketch), the big question is "So" never responded, and the entire film is one piece of transparent propaganda, which does nothing further "enlighten" (as claimed by director) outside world about the big assemblers.
