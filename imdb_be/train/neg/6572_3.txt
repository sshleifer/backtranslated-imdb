In my opinion, the title of this movie should be changed to "Only the brave" to «All About Lane». I went to the screening of the film a few months ago and was very disappointed with the result. While I understand that the director has made a film about men - 442 of the subject matter, which has long deserved the decision in the film industry - operating in some parts of the movie was pretty stale. Performances Mark Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita, and Jason Scott Lee were great. Nevertheless, the director should never place himself as the protagonist in the film. Unfortunately Lane, you're just not a film actor. Stick to what you're good at - the theater of action. Gina Hiraysoy performance in this film is also terrible. She should never have been given to the role and says her appearance was not suitable to play the role of Queen Miss Nissa. There were other young actresses in the film, which were naturally beautiful and whose performances were excellent ... Why do not they have been thrown on this role? Another major problem with this film was his action sequences. The Japanese-American soldiers do not look like they were fighting German soldiers ... not to mention to anyone. Of course it was a low budget feature, but since it was a war on the basis of the film, it's not important to show some really fighting? This film was a worthy attempt, but certainly not worth the main distribution.
