This is a disgusting film. Two crazy young women to tempt and torture middle-aged man. There is not much to pay in respect of the land or "spoiler". I would only comment that the ending is almost the most ridiculous part of the film. Much of the film involves Locke and Camp clucking insulting, constantly grinning psychotic at the camera. Add to that a soundtrack which is repeated again and again, including vaudeville song about "dear old dad", which suggests an incestuous audience never sees. Music annoying at first, then eventually exposing the viewer to torture worse than that shown on the screen. The theme here amok youth, an understandable reaction to the 60s, but done with a little imagination and style. Avoid this!
