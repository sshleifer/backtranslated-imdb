I actually will not comment, but then I realized I had something to say. I've seen this movie two days ago, and although I think it is not a waste of time (this may be money, though, for manufacturers), it is obvious that it has serious problems. It was a really good film and (a little, but nice music). Much has been said about Ana Cristina Oliveira, but let's be honest, over what? It is not really an actress she is constantly balancing between oversupply and inappropriate action by the action. Her performance is held for the benefit of, because there has never been anyone like Odete in any other movie: crazy? sad? childish? impostor? Nobody knows, guys. . Thus, it is a kind of grades dictating rules here <br /> <br /> I thought that this movie was also a good example of the problems of the majority of the Portuguese suffer films soundtrack. There is not constantly overwritten and the result is usually the mass of noise that comes out of the blue. People in other countries may think Portugal is a noisy place. What delighted me, though, was that some of the dialogue was called, but it does not necessarily solve the syndrome. Bad dubbing, too, I must say. It is amazing to watch a film in which the first thing that strikes my mind in the first stage, when the first character says this: it is duplicated. And all this is to say that the film is a technical problem. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a script problem. He strives to be a classic from the first to the last scene. It was a desperate fear of leaving things suspended and show. The author is clearly trying to get everything at once, and it does, but ... it shows !! All the dialogue is too descriptive and there is no part of the conversation, which sounds like a line from a movie. It's all a bit raw and a bit unpleasant. <br /> <br /> It's not that the film is a complete mess, I must emphasize. I just think the good part is so obvious that I prefer to focus on the bad. <br /> <br /> The direction is of little weak script. All shots are classic and non-innovative, but they are beautiful. Great job with Rui Po√ßas, by the way <br /> <br /> So, I think that was the problem, the one that keeps people from believing in the story and laugh throughout the film, but do not take it seriously :. The guy who plays the guy who dies, apparently, not an actor. In fact, it's quite an important role, and I can not understand why non-actors are cast for such items. This guy is neither an actor nor a nice man. That is, the whole film rolls from the mountain, so we never think for one second that this gorgeous woman obsessed with him, even if he is gone, and that his hunky lover who survives really having a bad time to get out -this loss, when all we can see, this character is apathy. Too bad. The world is full of wonderful people who even happens beautiful alluring lovers. The world is full of good actors, who are also cute boys and can cause intrusive on people after they are not. The world is full of great movies, and that is not big films. C'est La Vie!
