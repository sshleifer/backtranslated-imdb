I watched this film really late last night and, as a rule, if it's late, I am quite lenient cinema. Although I tried, I just could not stand the movie at all, it became worse and worse as the film went on. Although I know this is suppose to be a comedy, but I did not find it very funny. In addition, it was especially unrealistic and exhausted way of rural life. If this is what any of you think that the life of the country, as this is definitely not the case. I have to agree that some of the actors of guys were nice, but the French guy was actually a fake. I have to agree that he was trying to get a good history lesson, but in general, my recommendation is that no more than 8 do not watch it too annoying.
