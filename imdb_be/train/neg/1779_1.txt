Lead characters (Charles Brady played Brian Krause and his mother, Mary, played by Alice Krige) were done superficially, there was no depth of personality and were hardly pretty or drawing. Not even MÃ¤dchen Amick (played Tanya Robertson) 's character fits into this description. <br /> <br /> However, as I have said many times before, if you adapt a novel by Stephen King for television, you just have to take into account the fact that his books are not written for television, and his scenario talent, unfortunately, lacks the fire and it shows the depth, as a novelist. <br /> <br /> This is another unsuccessful attempt to take the magic of Stephen King's writing, whether his novels or original script. In order to simply cut and paste it to work on the small screen. His novels get a totally distorted in the process, and all you end up creating a good film; not less, but certainly nothing more. His screenplay surprised and miss.
