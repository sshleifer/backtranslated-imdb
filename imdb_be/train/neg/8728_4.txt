This is one bad. The unfortunate and sad film crime that has nothing out of the ordinary there. A number of crimes, the killer that you see throughout the film, classical studies. As well as the classic story of a policeman who finds out what's going on, and did not trust anyone, so he has to fight himself to reveal the truth. Is it too much of this. Vote: 4 of 10.
