Personally, I think this show looks very cheaply made. Some actors are terrible. They more than make it seem fake. I can always tell how it will end within the first 10 minutes or less to watch, because they do it so transparently clear. It's not very well written anything. I love to watch it to laugh at him. You know the expression, "It's so bad it's good?" Well, that adage applies to this show. I would also look to see if I'm right when I think how it will all end. Until now I was right every time. It's like a little game that I play. This is good if you're bored and you feel like laughing at something.
