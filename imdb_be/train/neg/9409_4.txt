I loved this show! I think that there was anything wrong with it! Just Spider Sun punching anyone, but only that the show does not suck! Some people only think this show is bad because of it. The story was great and it was fun when the other characters appear as X-Men, Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! To bad Sandman it never is, but I kind of like it! Spidey Best show ever !! My favorite episodes: 1. The turning point 2. Spider Wars 3. 4. house alien costume 5. Mutant Agenda <br /> <br /> But there are some episodes that were really bad as: Rocket Racer and slick, which was embarrassing to watch. And I do not like Morbius and hydroma. Firstly Morbius sucking plasma instead of blood, and I do not like vampires. And it annoys me that he was almost the main villain in season 2. Of course, I said hydroma! It was terrible! I prefer to see Sandman! His last appearance was so scared. And I do not like Spidey Spider-Man! <br /> <br /> But I think all it was bad!
