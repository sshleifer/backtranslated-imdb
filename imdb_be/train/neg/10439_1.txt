I would like to think of myself as a fairly open mind guy and it takes a lot (!) For me, not like a movie, but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest, crappiest movie I've ever seen! <, Br /> <br /> I have no idea what happened to the people who gave him such a good grade here (IMDB is not, as a rule, pretty reliable when it comes to pricing) the only ... I can imagine that people must vote for one or more conditions: <br /> <br /> 1. Being shitfaced / buzz from their minds 2. They received cash for votes 3. at gunpoint <br /> <br /> I can not believe I wasted a good 1 hour 45 minutes of my life is a pathetic excuse for a movie.
