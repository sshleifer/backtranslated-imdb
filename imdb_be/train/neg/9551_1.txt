This is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. I would like to go back in time and do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Find out where the "cinema", "War games- Dead Code" was filmed 2) Watch the original WAR GAMES with my current computer knowledge and an eye one thousand nine hundred eighty-three preteen. 3) The gap in the Pentagon computer in the 80s with the knowledge and perspectives learned and memorized. 4) Reprogramming skyscraper in Nuke accommodation Dead Code minutes before the first day of shooting 5) Go back to the present, have a beer and get Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in "flash" my mind empty of the whole event, especially my initial viewing of «The Dead Code» 6 ) There is also a beer and watch WARS GAME 7) Be happy until the next bad remake a good film 80s. <br /> <br /> 8) Or do I have to forget Jerash killed. I'm not sure if I have to travel to the future to do so. Maybe I need access to the wormhole.
