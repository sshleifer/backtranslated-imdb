Imitating his long title of the film is finding ways to get closer to the mark of 90 '. Beautiful sets here with everything that made the production values ​​Hamer trademark, but Paris was drowned in the fog is a sign of lazy contempt. History is evident and can be expressed in a dozen words, so it comes to no surprise and nothing is worth more than 5% of your attention are not expected. <br /> <br /> directing heavy as the direct transfer to the stage of the game, the actors, mostly rigid, like wax figures (ki this feature Hamer, only sometimes better signs around the package). My conclusion: this film is garbage, not worth the time I spend on the same evening. Eternal life is a boring question, and I hope the guys in charge of programming at the Cinematheque would know better.
