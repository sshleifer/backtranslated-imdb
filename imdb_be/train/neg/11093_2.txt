If this film was about a fictional character, the film can stand on its own and to judge objectively. Unfortunately, for the viewer, the film is based on the "facts" that are shaded by very unfair to Ruben Carter. Many small facts were ignored (Carter's number one at the time of the murder, there is no evidence, in all that he had saved a friend from child molesters in his youth), but some of the major facts, such as, apparently robbed of solutions to Zhiardello for "racist" judges is inexcusable for those of us who saw the fight on tape, and very disrespectful to Giardello. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of a man, who, at best, was in trouble, and the problems around a lot more than any normal person should (several times for beating women was arrested) strange to me. Ruben Carter never was, considering its actions in the 60s, and even now, when he refuses to talk to his son, the man that people can look up to. Everyone knows that Zhuison may direct, and Washington may act, but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me. Is Hollywood so much in need of black hero, they need to distort the truth in all its bio pictures to make them believable? (Heres proposal What about Denzel plays a movie about yourself? Now it inspires) on the basis of inaccuracies in the film, I would suggest passing on this.
