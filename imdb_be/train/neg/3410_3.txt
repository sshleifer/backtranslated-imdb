Yes, this movie have children who go to space camp, and started well enough as you have kids meet each other and learning the ropes. Then they introduce Jinx, a robot that could not exist in 1986 because they did not have anything of this kind of artificial intelligence at the moment. The child becomes a friend of the robot and the robot extinguishes the small kindness, shooting him and a group of other children in the camp in the space with a very limited supply of oxygen and radios that do not have a signal to reach into space. This camp is also very interesting as these children are real learning and teachers are all over them for a mission or not doing the right thing. Give it a rest, they are there for pleasure and not to become astronauts just yet, just give them a space flight experience is not a military man, as a camp. However, you can see Joaquin Phoenix in the role of a fairly early. So in the end, a film that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinks and other factors that may have had as children battle space aliens on top of everything else that is going on in the film, as it would have made the film a little more pleasant, at least for me. Probably in a few others as well, who else would like to see Capshaw face torn some strange alien super.
