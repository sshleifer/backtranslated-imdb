This is probably one of the worst films I have ever seen. Jessica Simpson is not only lacks any acting, but the script is incredibly shallow and lame. You actually hear a serious dialogue that goes, "I love you more." "No, I love you more." I stopped to watch a movie online () after the first hour, I can not anymore. Its "southern girl charm" simply does not work and it is really very annoying; her attempts to slapstick humor fall flat, and it delivers the line as she reads the script directly on the page. <br /> <br /> Poor Luke Wilson. Did not he read the script before agreeing to do it, or he will love Papa Joe's (Jessica's father, as well as the producer of the film), the promise of more revenue? I hope that now he knows better than to sign on another film like this. Luke Wilson is really good actor - I hate to see the pained look on his face when he suffers through bad dialogue <br /> <br /> Also, I think the previous commentator gives the film 8 out of 10, I guess. or participation in the film as something, or hired by Papa Joe, to give the film the best rating. No one in their right mind would actually find this film interesting. <br /> <br /> Jessica has a lot of money, is not it? Maybe buy some acting lessons?
