Craven, coward film. Director Boorman shows Cahill burglarizing wealthy homes, but the male resident shows infidelity with the nanny, that's all right then. Medical examiner investigations Cahill blown up in his car, but he's a rat faced curmudgeon, and does not look like a good person, so that's all right too. In Beits, owner Russborrough house, made their money through the use of "negros" dig out diamonds, so it's okay to rob a priceless art from them and hide it in a bunker in the mountains of Wicklow. Garda kill your ferret and have to do with his murder. Moral equivalencing sick, Boorman looking for a hit, but do not have the courage to confront the criminal gangs generals, who terrorized the neighborhood, and unleashed a new wave of thugs, Dublin. He even got in touch with his son Generals, doing this. Disgusting. Shame on him for his cowardice.
