horror film ?? really ???? I can not believe how bad this movie was, what's the point of this movie ??? the film almost 1 hours and 30 minutes, and the first 70 minutes of this, just go to Lena with this stupid look on her face after she had an accident .... not so much to say, in general, not even so much action at all. . I have to say tho last 20 minuets he got a little tiny operation .. and still stupid ....... and the end of my God, I do not know where to start, but eventually this stupid look on his face county lol .. do not get me wrong, I love Headey, I think she's a great actress, but I do not know her, to make floor movie .. do not waste your time and watch it, because this movie has no history, has no acting ..and does not make sense ... not to mention how slow is this movie, and it feels like you have seen it all.
