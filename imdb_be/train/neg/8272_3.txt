. At the end of «Dragon Heat," all I could think about was why I worked sat through it all <br /> <br /> premise of the film is interesting and that - just like Maggie Q - is what attracted I have the movie in the first place. But if I was ever disappointed. Writer-director Daniel Lee can not hold a candle like John Woo, Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen. <br /> <br /> This has to be one of the most razdrazhnyalna- directed films I've ever seen it wrapped up in his visual style -. and I use that phrase loosely incredibly - he fills the film with quite unnecessary black-and-white shots, freeze frames, slow motion, fast motion and other visual nonsense. I believe that he did everything to make up for the lack of a good story or a dialogue. <br /> <br /> The action scenes and nothing special play some music video jumped up more than all the rest There is little to worry about any of the characters -. including the two alleged professional snipers, who could not hit the broad side of a barn from the inside! - who is loaded with some of the Cheesiest dialogue I've seen in one of those actioners Hong Kong <br /> <br /> The story is devoid of any twists and turns. - from the initial settings, all unfolding in a predictable fashion - and Lee feel the need to remind us of the back stories of the characters, if we did not get it the first few times. It's awful amateurish writing and film-making and waste talents Hung Summit, Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. Although, frankly, I'm hard-pressed to remember Bien, being in any good film, which was not directed by James Cameron. <br /> <br /> If you really are in the mood for a great Hong Kong action movie, you are much better to stick to some of the main products - John in «The Killer" (1989) and «Hard Boiled" (1992), Ringo Lam "City on fire" (1987) - which Quentin Tarantino stole for "Reservoir dogs" (1992) - or ". Point Blank" (1967), a remake of "Full Contact" (1992), or even check Yuen in «So Close» ( 2002), a highly fascinating but irrelevant, popcorn movie. And there is always a terrific thriller French police, "Nest" (2002). <br /> <br /> However, most, if not all, a little over-the-top, but they were movies that CJSIC are exciting, thrilling, and even suspenseful. They have characters that we care about, and mind-blowing action sequences. <br /> <br /> «Dragon Heat» on the other hand, it's just awful mediocre. The trouble is that Lee did not do a bad action movie, it made a dull one.
