third own film Guy Ritchie (not counting the God-awful "Gone" is a complex thriller associated with gambling, gangsters and chess. Supporters of the previous Richie effort probably hate Revolver as much as I did, with his twists and turns. Richie stalwart Jason Statham plays Jake , recently released ex-Con, to avenge the ridiculously named Dorothy Urine (magnificently OTT Ray Liotta), but instead gets involved with a couple of other minuses, (one of whom is Andre 3000 from Outkast rap outfit), which cast him our audience, with the number of red Lyadtsy throughout the film, each of which becomes extremely tedious. The culmination of this mess of a film is a little restaurant, where the dialogue gets turned down in favor of the great shot, slow-mo shoot-out set of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. In general, Revolver is a flawed the work is not really terrible, but far from Richie better. this will still be Lock, Stock. If this film was homework school would be classified as "must try!"
