I do not know what the rest of you guys watch Steven Seagal movies, but I look at them, because, as silly as they are, they are, at least, always good for a laugh. Why would you rate this movie 1 of 10 on the basis of dubbing, if such a thing is exactly what makes the film as a cult favorite that you can laugh at the stupidity? <br /> <br /> Attack Force is not a great movie, but I felt that it was as worthy of Steven Seagal car, like many of his films; in fact I do not think it was one of his worst by a long shot. It was, most of the time, halfway coherent story line, and it was most of the time, a fundamentally interesting. The ending really sucked, but even then, there were a few nice bad elements. In the end, the story itself does not deliver what it promised, but I actually thought that the action characteristics (if I may use such a great word) and the rest of the production values, delivered exactly what a true fan of Steven Seagal would expect . Sam Segal, in particular, it was stone-faced man with no frills person that we have come to expect, and the rest of the cast supported him pretty good, never satisfied him up. These are the people, this is what makes the film of Steven Seagal. Deal with it. Or better yet, laugh at him <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 ..
