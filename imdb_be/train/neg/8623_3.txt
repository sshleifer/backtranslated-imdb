This film is about the cop (Ching Wan Lau), trying to catch a super-smart thief (Ekin Cheng), who blackmails the insurance company headed by Kelly Lin. In principle, any plans for a police officer trying to thief somehow knows in advance. This film is covered with beautiful actors lead a beautiful main role and a good camera Hong Kong shooting the scene, in fact, has no substance at all. It's all flash and flash quickly becomes boring too. I lost all interest third of the way to the movies, and there is no sacrifice of quality after for Cinematography, which looks good, except. Just remember seeing this movie, if you can do it for free. Also, consider stopping the movie 20 minutes into the movie, because it's still up to the end: BORING. 6/10
