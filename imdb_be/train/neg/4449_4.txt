"Sleeping with the Enemy" predictable "been there before" a thriller that never gives up, find inspiration, no matter how desperately cast and crew attempt. I can not believe that a bunch of my friends persuaded me to see it in a movie about sixteen years ago. <br /> <br /> complete lack of originality on the scenario Ronald Bass (based on the novel by Nancy Price) does not help, and not stale direction of Joseph Ruben, or a very average performance of Julia Roberts. The supporting cast, including Patrick Bergin Kevin Anderson did little to help. <br /> <br /> There's really not much to say. Just give it a miss <br /> <br /> Sunday, April 14, 1991 -.
