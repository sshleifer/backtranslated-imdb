I picked up the film in the hope that it will be like a merry «The Gamers» Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is highly recommended by the way). Boy, what a disappointment! The film was made in this fake documentary style glorified in the office, but he was not able to deliver. This is partly a tough action, but mainly writing and directing. However, it can be fun to use every singe cliché is, the role-playing games, but here it is done in such a way that it becomes very predictable. At the beginning of each scene, you know that the "joke" is on. But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is drawn on top of the path. There's no subtlety in this film, if the signature "LAUGH NOW" or cheap 80th style fake laugh track is not a big deal. With some scenes you can not help thinking: "Yes, I understand why they thought it would be funny," but it takes the whole momentum executed with the possible jokes.
