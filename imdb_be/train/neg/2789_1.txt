Savage Island (2003) is a lame movie. It's more like a home video, shot with very minimal lighting and terrible action. Not only is the story and the script was an accident. I do not know why this film was made. I've seen a lot of movies at one time and the ones I really hate movies that make me angry. This is one of my blood boil. The situation was meaningless at best. If I had done a movie like this would be a short one. Indeed, since the backwood «idjits» would not be in the picture. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover on D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of bad movies. But this movie is almost unwatchable. I do not mind the film was shot on DV but if you are going to do is make the movie enjoyable, not some tired new tires superior horror movies (without Wrong Turn). <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this waste disk. If you come up with this one in the store rental pass. <br /> <br /> Movies that make your really angers receive an automatic 1.
