Nothing to say but Wow! Has anyone actually had someone sneak up on them in the open field? Well, this is about 25 times in this film (apparently the director's favorite scare tactic). In one of the opening scenes of a smooth conversation / hot shot producer to ride in the back seat, so that the camera people can sit in the front film. Soon after he arrived on the 5 contestants show, and although this is clearly not later than 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set at any moment. After about 30 minutes boobless garbage we are honored with retrospective clown stories in which we can see some of his previous victims. If you watch this movie to test a woman's breasts .. its edges go all the way to her neck, she was flat out disgusting. Most horror films the action takes place at night, but without the night vision camera chaos forced to occur during the day. Several night shots, which made it to the movies look like they were stolen from Witch Project Blair or random shots from the garden of Directors. The film is somewhat redeemed himself in the end, when I was a matrix of how to shoot with an eccentric that we wound up and watched over and over again to laugh hysterically. <br /> <br /> Definitely RENT the movie if you were ever crept in open space. <br /> <br /> signed response
