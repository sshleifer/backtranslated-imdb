As soon as I began to see posters and hear talk about this film, I was immediately excited. Matrix was unbelievable here and I could not wait to see the second, especially after starting to see the trailers of other films for him. However, when I saw it, I left the theater very disappointed, like many moviegoers in the theater with me. Although the scenes in the film were strange, as always, it was simply too small. In the first film, there was a constant struggle going on it seemed, but the second did so much more (and much boring) instructive point of view. To sum up the story, it was not much to it that is not expected. The machines were Zion excavation with the intention of destroying it (this is not a spoiler, all seen in the advertisement). The dialogue of the film was absolutely horrible. If you do not psychology major, you will most likely not the majority of what is said in the film to understand, and because of the fact that just do not care. It became a born romantic film showing the events taking place in the lives and relationships of Neo and Trinity. Agent Smith, for how badass he was in the first film seemed to get all religious and instructive. Personally, I do not need to hear about that either pay money to listen to. The film was a major waste of my time, and I do not think I can watch the first more. Dialogue and constant melancholy and dry monologues from basically every character made me lose interest in the film rapidly, and a small amount of good fight scenes pushed me closer to the edge, and the end of the movie pushed me once. What movie ends Â«To Be A prisoner?" Like the original people. Interestingly, when the Wachowski brothers were burn the midnight oil to come up with that one. In conclusion, we note that the film was bad, and that's the end.
