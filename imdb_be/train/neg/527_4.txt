Cast Ready, to die in the movie, which is significantly less. Vanessa Redgrave dies, but before she goes, she begins to tell her daughter the story of her life and her secret love ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that has the appearance and the expectation of being great film, simply because they have so many wonderful actors and actresses in this way seems to be about something other than the trash, it really is. Not bad, per se, but with Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Claire Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all giving excellent performances) you wait for more than a sentimental story that's a little bit more than a harlequin romance. <br /> <br /> Wait for the cable.
