The only reason I saw «Shakedown» was the fact that he has Eleniak in it. She is sexy, as always, but it plays a secondary role leading man Wolf Larson. It is a pity, because it has more possibilities of action than it is allowed to show here. The film basically consists of endless fights, which are rapidly becoming monotonous - especially if most of the time you see the bad guys armed with machine guns, constantly missing Larson and his armed only with a revolver (which never runs out of bullets), taking them all quite easily. The consequences of the earthquake are decent, but there are also a lot of motion blur and bad CGI explosion. How psychotic "spiritual leader", Ron Perlman tries, but pseudo-fetish he has to spout simply boring. Eleniak, Perlman and Larson (provided that it is) Completists might want to give it a look, for others it is barely worth a rental. (* 1/2)
