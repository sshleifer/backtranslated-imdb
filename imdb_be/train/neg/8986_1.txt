This film LAME, LAME, LAME !!!!! It takes a lot to bring me to an excessive exaggeration of the film, but this film stinky my house !! I have not even finished the film yet and I had to stop to comment on how bad this film. I never did !! As a consumer, do not spend money on this film. Wait until it comes out on cable channel or something. It is hardly worthy of the TV. I hate trashing the film, but this film is garbage! Just above porn. And should have a rating of X! A good story, some exposure (if it floats your boat), but awfully high school level action. I do not know how this film has been extended. (There must be a contractual matter.) In fact, if you really enjoy watching good movies, do not waste your time with this. From one film to another lover. YOU WILL BE MAD FOR IT! Let me say that this is the case, when you've been through something like this, perhaps you can relate, and it will have some meaning for you. In this case, I say look, you can take something from it, if not just to see something that has happened to you is played by somebody else (has therapeutic value).
