I was very pleased to find this movie at the local video library - Cary Grant comedy set in worship, director Stanley Donen, so far, they do not like? This kind of film that I wonder two things - when all participants (including some famous names) realize that they have a turkey on their hands, and that's the worst of it among a number of competing issues? However, talking about the first, but my vote in the past is in the meandering storyline ahead of lengthy script sometimes pretentious, uncertain tone, the lack of a consistent and well-developed specifications and the lack of mutual understanding between the characters. You must add a very rough, which acts on the criticism, but it is clear that the actors have struggled with this material and, moreover, it seems, under rehearsed. Quite often, they are unlikely to get their line quickly enough. Cary Grant is trying to portray his usual magic and polite person, but sometimes it seems tough and staccato in his delivery. I must, however, say that I was glad when the initial proposals of his character will be paired with an indescribably vulgar Jayne Mansfield leave with the advent of Suzy Parker. What do you like in the movie? - to me first of all beauty Parker, who also acts coolly and Grace Kelly as dignity. Generally speaking, the film is a pleasure to watch. Naval characters are very smart in his uniform - but you need to be really interesting, in terrible black tunics Fu Manchu they put in his luxurious hotel suite. Grant could not even look elegant in her. Back to the credit side, Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character, and has been of interest to me to hear the hero when Hogan-Werner Klemperer speak without fictional German accent!
