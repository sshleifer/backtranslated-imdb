What a bad image of professional police officers are shown on television in seeing this alleged reality show. One can only hope that the actual reasonable suspicion that leads to a probable cause that leads to the totality of the circumstances related to making a "stop", then «Pat Down» on the outside of their clothes, and then to be able to explain why officer went into someone's pocket and took out the contraband, was cut from the scene, because if he was not arrested in most places are going to be thrown, they should even get passed the supervisor. to warrant a report on the radio is not the actual existence of the warrant, if the person does not have the original scheduling order in hand. If the manager is reading from a computer printout, it is good enough for an arrest, but that does not necessarily mean that the order remains in force. Since I have not seen Dis-claimant from CBS (I may have missed it), CBS could be in trouble.
