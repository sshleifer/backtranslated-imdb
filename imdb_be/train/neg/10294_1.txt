Nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Then the characters that have not developed the face. <br /> <br /> Then the end will never come, because there is no beginning, no middle. <br /> <br /> there are beautiful shots that are made are not beautiful because they can not even be, because this movie is not even there. There's no "no" in this film, because there is no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbols, or a discussion or dialogue, or a point. There's nothing! <br /> <br /> There is a good point: it has a good soundtrack. But the sound editing and the film itself is such that not even watch it worth your time, so if you're really interested, I would suggest to go out and buy the soundtrack or something. You get everything you can out of this film are all tirelessly, headache, and impatience. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
