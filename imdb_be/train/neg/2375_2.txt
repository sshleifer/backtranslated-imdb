Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, the sixth installment of Nightmare on Elm Street series and again another bad sequel. I think this is due to the latest extension of the child's dreams. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street series DVD box set for my birthday, so I got to see all the sequels. Can I say that I'm just getting more and more frustrated, even with these extensions, at least the last two, it just seems that Freddie has lost the edge. It's almost like the authors have tried to give Freddie the soul, and they just destroy it, instead of reinventing the story. It was a continuation of that there was no need to pity Robert Englund, but it was very much lower than is Freddy Krueger. <br /> <br /> Freddie came back, but he has something we do not know, daughter. Maggie, she does not know that he is her father, but she soon finds out that his dark secrets, and he wants to help her. She must do everything possible to resist his power, but it's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father. Ironic, is not it? But Freddie did not give up, entirely by manipulating it in its relations <br /> <br /> Freddie's Dead :. The Final Nightmare also presented in 3-D, radical, right? Note the sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels, it is associated with the fifth sequel to A Nightmare on Elm Street series, I would prefer to watch the second Nightmare On Elm Street, to be honest. It was just a bad game, it's silly editing, and a little more than just a good idea for a story. I do not like the concept of it, and it just ruined the whole idea of ​​who Freddy Krueger in fact, the master of nightmares of death and not the father knows best. <br /> <br /> 2/10
