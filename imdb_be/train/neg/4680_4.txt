If you ask how I would define the word "Shallow" I would say "Watch Jerry Bruckheimer production". If you ask how I would define the phrase "Wasted potential" I would say "Watch Jerry Bruckheimer production". Bruckheimer production is almost always sure fire hits at the box office, but almost always receive critical pannings from critics. Off the top of my head, I can think of only an officer and a gentleman, and Black Hawk to get a lot of critics. <br /> <br /> Crimson Tide also received some critical acclaim grouchy, it`s certainly one of the best films Bruckheimer`s unfortunately ISN` says. The problem that I had a script that sets the story: Russian war with the Chechens and the conflict spreads throughout Russia, leading to ultra-nationalist Russian seize nuclear missile base and threaten the West, if they interfere. Perhaps the end of the Cold War, it was all to do with him, but I found this set very unconvincing. It`s entirely helped some errors in geography, the French carrier Foch, which is in the Med (wouldn `Foch better place in the Black Sea?) Or that the exposition consists of newsreel footage featuring the familiar conflicts with the Balkans, the first Gulf War and even Vietnam. Once again, the adjective "very convincing" crept into my mind. The story is really little to improve when the actual story - the battle of wills regarding orders between the commander of the nuclear submarine and his number two - is being implemented. Directed by Tony Scott makes it better, how to make a shot, but the problem still lies in the unconvincing scenarios. The worst thing is that if it were done in the mid-1980s, when WW3 was a real possibility - the probability of Nai - this film would have terrified me, but after the Cold War ended because there was a danger of a nuclear war, and that therefore, Crimson Tide have little impact.
