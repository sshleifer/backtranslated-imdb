This fictitious journey never comes close to matching wit and madness wonderful adventure that the children took in the first film. This contribution tries to deviate from its prequel to grab some fresh blood from a joke, but it takes a wrong turn and journey anywhere interesting or funny. <br /> <br /> There's almost half an hour to waste on showing guys do rock concert (and a lot of people look at the "free TV" - because when that happens?) Of course, the script could do something more creative; see how all the random elements of the first film were carefully linked converging them in the scientific presentations. Not in this film, which largely ended the franchise Bill and Ted. The joke was over. <br /> <br /> Diagon thrown into the mix, for any reason. This infusion, as the whole plot is bad and not enough spark for a comedy or enable the audience. There ZZ Top impression killed for no reason. There's a light, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing truly creative or funny. <br /> <br /> Skip this fake thing.
