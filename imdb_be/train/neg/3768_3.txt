That's right. The film is written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and his family. (Fred should have known better, having worked kits "Titantic» and «Dogma».) <br /> <br /> Thus, the plot. There are some scientists and some foresters, and a hot chick with huge fake breasts. They are all very bad at their jobs, including a hot chick (which I think should be a photographer, but who cares, because she wears a bikini). One of the rangers noticed that scientists are "professional people", and that's good, because it would be terrible if they were professional maggots or jellybeans or Ewoks. <br /> <br /> They're hiking through the woods in search of some amazing ape bones, and no one ever mentions that the bone might just be those infamous Bigfoot. They just wander around and one of the rangers brazenly goes to the beauty. We all hope that he will die very quickly (along with his sister, who is meant to be pretty naive one, but really just annoying). Then they * * choking, find Sasqu ... I mean, ape-like animal cemetery. No, of course, does not mention that it could just be they messing with Bigfoot bones ... I think scientists and foresters just do not think about those types of things. <br /> <br /> Then, Sasquatch and his tribe really get angry and kill all the people who we do not like, drives the other lost away and hides it grandmother and cousin Josh Muriel (who died in the accident trout accident) again and again. <br /> <br /> insipid, boring dialogue (I passed out several times), a silly plot, bad characters, bad the CGI (a man in a monkey suit will look better), and act, that just is not very good all add up to make movie, I will not look. again <br /> <br /> You test it, though; it is good for some unintentional laughter.
