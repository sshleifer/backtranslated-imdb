Do not you just hate it when you order steak, but the restaurant gives you a chicken? <br /> <br /> That's how I felt, watching the so-called «Battlestar Galactica». Arguments can be made for its quality, but the fact remains that this is not what you ordered and fans. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you were sitting in the notorious restaurant I mentioned. You've been waiting years for them to recover their famous New York Strip steak that you loved. If your food intake, you will find that they have used the name «New York Strip» on the chicken dish. You complain, but the waiter simply said, "but of cheeken, EEC Zira really well!" Do you really care when the chicken is good? You like New York Strip - steak! The waiter then says, "You Zi Zira, ze chef wanted to do, as you Zai, zomezing NEW. We felt that the re cheeken will be more popular zo we gave him the name of our last delicious deesh ». You ask if you ever have an original New York Strip on the menu in the future but that, as the restaurant has a dish called «New York Strip» is now on the menu, you will never see the original New York Strip - ever. <br /> <br /> This is the case with the creation of something new and slaps «Battlestar Galactica» namesake on it. <br /> <br /> * This mini-series is an insult to all the fans of the original show! * <br /> <br /> It's a shame the production team put in charge of this new version, obviously, held contempt for the original. The team responsible for the resurrection of the BG must love the original series - trying to improve what the fans love, do not try to shamelessly sell this new series, by exploiting the name of Battlestar Galactica <br /> <br /> If you would like SciFi Channel. to give us a new show, then do it! Give it a new name! Do not use a name that we fondly remember in an attempt to lure in viewers. This fact makes it impossible to see any semblance of the original in the future. <br /> <br /> We've been waiting 25 years to see that we know how to BG, because we LIKED something about the original! We do not just want the name and the remnants of the basic concept. There are things that we loved about the original series! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, probably the best elements of the original were the ones that were left out. Of course, the original BG was imperfect, and could use some updating. This mini-series, however, has not been improved in any respect, but the special effects (which were good, but not unusual by today's standards). <br /> <br /> Many viewers will discuss back and forth about the quality of this new show, but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore to destroy our dreams. <br /> <br /> That being said ... I'm going to offer some comments on the merits of this new mini itself (not in comparison with the original): <br /> <br /> The battle sequences was the best part. The effort is clearly put into making the effects more "real" in appearance and less "wow - look at this bill," I would not say these sequences were exceptional for today's standards, yet they were in accordance with the made for cable original movies. . What's the deal with this "pseudo-cam"? Some species have tried to fake the effect of a "real" camera with a backward track and jerky zoom. However, he was excessively used, taking into account it was not apparent source of these cameras. Infinitely more intelligent ser BGN, Babylon 5, this is the only case I saw a "live cam" is used effectively, as we have witnessed the alleged actions by the security cams. <br /> <br /> scenario, you ask? The script felt like it was written by a teenager, for other teens. The characters felt and cardboard stereotype. in fact, the whole story felt pieces from other well-known stereotypes. The only good traits throughout history there have been those few items that have been retained from the original series. It was, obviously, "dumbed down" to digest your average audience. <br /> <br /> human interaction was pathetic. Instead, the drama based on the fine looks, expressions and precise timing, each time a human stress was exaggerated to the point of being so obvious that they have lost all ability to move any refined audience. This was evident in any interaction between Adam and his son. The director must try to ensure that the most dense and insensitive audience will not miss it, even if you do not pay attention. Sorry, but real people do not behave like all the time. <br /> <br /> I would not have thought it was BAD show was worth it on its own. nothing great it will never be revered real fans SciFi or artisans, but it would be watchable masses. I personally could live without it, though. I just watched it to see how it really capture the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> It will always remember this mini-series, as a symbol of how the quality of speaking was thrown away, to reach out to large numbers. As even the SciFi Channel has "dumbed down" its production to satisfy the masses, as opposed to its true niche in the market, the supporters of science fiction. . This is the time, we asked for a steak and they insisted on giving us a chicken, despite our complaints <br /> <br /> I leave you only one thing - <br /> <br /> NOT "MUR". <br /> <br />
