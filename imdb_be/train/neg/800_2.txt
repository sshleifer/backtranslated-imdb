In fact, this film made in 1999, has a pretty good production performance. The actors are attractive, and talented enough. There are not a bunch of clowns running around to water, spending hundreds of patrons, but never hit flesh. There is also a wild chase / accident where thousands of dollars beautiful cars aimlessly in the basket. <br /> <br /> The interior looks respectable, modern, architecture, and the equipment will look. Well, there is that high-tech computer room with furnishings that look like leftovers from the '50s electronics lab. And the pancake makeup on corpses cracked me. Nha pancake make-up in the usual sense of the word, but what looks like dried pancakes smeared over their exposed skin. This is supposed to support the idea that the bodies of soda - although, as the virus will perform this conversion exercise left to the student (viewer) <br /> <br /> Oh yes, a virus .. I would like to tell you, that is not the worst room for the sci-fi horror flick I know, but I can not. A computer virus that is transmitted through (or computer monitor) and the TV screen becomes a deadly biological agents? Give me a break. Deformation drives a la «Star Trek» is one, and the photons are viruses? This is so stupid desired "fear factor" just do not realize. Flick could use one of those awful dream sequence where the dead come to life, or a cat jump out of the closet, or something, because the virus does not do this thingamajig. <br /> <br /> One assumes, Robert Wagner has the same excuse for a game of this senselessness that the Lord gave Oliver for some of his later, weedy places. He needs money. No other comparisons between them should not be construed, however.
