Ok, I was bored and decided to watch this movie. But I think the main thing that brought this film down, it would be an hour of footage, it was mostly the minute repeated 4 times. It consists of 1. Meeting the troops and discuss the plan of attack, 2. Flashbacks wives 3. Approach troops marching in a long line 4. Men running up hill and firing, as a rule, the first bullet in the head and then 3 other people to save him. 5. The enemy's defeat and calling for the base said the success 6. Men are flashing back their wives and singing 10 minute song. This was the main movie, and the same sequence of events occurred around 4 or 5 times. and every time he did a flashback to their wives, it would show the man, his wife and him. There were about 10 men or more, which would have a memory, so it took a lot of time. In addition, people could not kill his enemy, except with no bayonets and grenades. I liked the music, and there was a lot of action, but the action was repeated. Overall, I probably will not see him again, but it was not too bad.
