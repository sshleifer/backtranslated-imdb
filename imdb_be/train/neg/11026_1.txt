I just finished reading a book about Dillinger. This film was terribly inaccurate. This is how they got the list of names and just made everything. His robberies and the shoots were well planned, down to the second - when the time comes, they leave, if they had all the money or not. They were notes of each road, where to turn, etc. Purvis had never seen him in a restaurant, he was told that Dillinger had paid for the meal after Dillinger was released. Purvis never even SAW Dillinger to night Dillinger was killed, but his pictures. The way the death of his gang members were fictitious. Dillinger never robbed a bank itself, as it did in this film. If I had never read a book, maybe I would have enjoyed the movie. The action was a bit over the top in places. The rally was overdone as well. On second thought, I doubt if I would have enjoyed it a lot, even if I had not read the book.
