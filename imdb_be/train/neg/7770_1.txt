It's a complete mess of a film director Bill Rebane, the man partly responsible for the really infamous anti-classic monster and-Go Go. As I approached the end of the cold, I came to the conclusion improbable that this film was actually worse than the 60-shocker. History ?? such as this ?? about three eccentric millionaires who invited a group of people to their remote mansion, to play a series of terrible games. Anyone who has managed to last the pace and survive till the end wins $ 1 million. This is a very simple plot, but Rebane still somehow manages to make the proceedings in the face of the incomprehensible. Things happen. Symbols completely forgotten. Nothing makes too much sense. And then it ends. Awful. I mean, what the hell is that ending all about precision? I believe that you have left to draw their own conclusions. Production values ​​and actions are no doubt pornographic film standard. In fact, Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) is not even that good. It is so incredibly scary that it convincingly. Unfortunately, the same can not be said about this shit festival as a whole, it is simply discounted stuff.
