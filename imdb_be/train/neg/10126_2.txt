Provision of budget and time constraints of series production, Batman and Robin, however, gets a place at the bottom of any list of "Cliffhanger", not enough style, imagination and atmosphere of its predecessor in 1943, BATMAN. <br /> <br /> producer Sam Katzman, was known as "The King" and whipped up as its director, Spencer Bennett, seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement. (Unfortunately, this team has also released two series of Superman, starring Kirk Alyn, including sticky fly animation that broadcast music, and blunt supporting players.) The opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come: thoroughly silly name ( "Robin saves Batman, "" Batman vs wizard "), mechanical music drones, and our two heroes, stumbling toward the camera, looking around, either confused or are having trouble seeing through their cheap Halloween masks. cowl of Batman, with his devil horns and an eagle's beak, breathe zits so bad that stunt must configure it during the fight scenes. His "utility belt" is crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments, of which he still manages to pull out a blowtorch and a tube of oxygen at critical moments! <br /> <br /> In any case, the major players miscast. Robert Lowry shows a bit of charm or individual talent, like Bruce Wayne, and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as Batman. He gives the impression that he would rather be somewhere, anywhere else! John Duncan as Robin has significant processing difficulties of its limited dialogue. He's too old for the part, with the filling of even older stuntmen in for him. With the suit, Lourte and Duncan is as exciting as tired businessmen amble for a drink, without one ounce of chemistry evident between Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft in 1943 series. <br /> <br /> Although the series has not been known for the development of the character previously BATMAN able to present a more energetic cast. This one offers a group that goes through the motions, and not that the movie creators provide great support. Not one of the thugs is released, and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever, "The Wizard". (Big-name!) In fact, they are led by someone sporting a curtain, a shawl, and a bag over his head, with a dubbed voice that is desperately trying to seem threatening. "Prime Suspect" - an eccentric professor, radio - it's just annoying <br /> <br /> Even the established comics "regulars" excessive .. It is difficult to distinguish between a lot of romance Vicky Vale and Bruce Wayne. In spite of the danger it faces, Vicki reflects almost no emotion. Commissioner Gordon is not too bright. Unlike the previous series, Alfred the butler simply walk along which the most important focus is the "residence of Mr. Wayne." They props for a protracted, stunt-laden, incoherent plot, further complicated uninspired and repetitive music amateur production design. Wayne Manor exterior looks like a suburban middle-class home in any comedy, the interiors of those cheap roadside motel. Batcave office is in desperate need of restoration. (Clothes are stored rolled up in the files!) <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the filmmakers could not have put more effort into the creation of an exciting adventure. While the presence of two series on DVD plus for any serious Â«Batfan," one should not be fooled by the beautiful illustrations on the box. They take most of the true mood of the comic book, than all 15 Batman and Robin managers combined <br /> <br /> now for the good news -. this is not the version of one thousand nine hundred ninety-seven!
