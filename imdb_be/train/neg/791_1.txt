Imagine a scene where a bunch of writers sitting around a table, and one says, "allows a black woman fit unsuspecting member of the public (also in black) on the street and ask him if he's black, and then leave." Other authors lie laughing hysterically until it assumes that they repeat it in every episode. More laughter. Now, when you think that the room is ridiculous, and show contains a lot of these kinds of situations, you will enjoy this show. For the rest, use the Zapper and find something more entertaining, like watching paint dry. Those who wrote the light of the report of the show should either get more or be forced to watch television comedy that's really funny. Another example of the humor in the show, she is trying to get out of paying at the supermarket checkout, the cashier trying to hypnotize. Moderately funny the first time but why repeat it again and again in different shows with different cashiers? I could cite other examples, but it just might be seen as spoilers, disclosing why this comedy just is not funny.
