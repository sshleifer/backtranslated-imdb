This film is so bad you almost feel infected by them. In fact, there is a strong sense of relief when it's over, relief that you can now put the tray back into the rewinder and RUSH it back to the store video before it infects the rest of your video collection. I jokingly suggested that when we shot it, it looked like the kind of film where William Hurt to "phone in" his performance. I mean, he will not try very hard. But lo and behold, a huge number of scenes this film, Hurt, Bill is actually on the phone! Our implementation of this irony was the only pleasure we have received from this tangled mess. the cinematography and editing muddy and confused as the story is chaotic, and the sound barely audible. There is very little resemblance to the «Falling Down» but this film would in boldly disturbing storyline, great writing and acting and appealing soundtrack. "Contaminated Man» just some broken-down old European tourist trap, and watch as the management of some unfamiliar road back to the unknown country where you do not speak the language at a steady rain as soon as it got dark, such as windshield keeps fogging. you get the picture? Do not get it.
