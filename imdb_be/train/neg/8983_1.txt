Ulises teacher of literature, which comes in the coastal cities. There he fell in love with Martin, the most beautiful girl in town. They begin a whirlwind romance that ended in the tragic death of Ulises sea. A few years later, Martina married Sierra, the richest man in the city and lives a quiet happy to be surrounded by money. Once Ulises ghost will make her passion to get up and act without considering the consequences. The plot is quite absurd, and none of the actors plays a decent role. In addition, three quarters of the film are sexual activities that are still good shot, quite tiring, because we want to see more of the story. This is simply a bad film Bigas Moon, with a lot of sex, with no arguments, and silly characters in the world.
