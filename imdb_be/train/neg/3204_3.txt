Although not as bad as it was made to be (I've seen much worse), it is still very lame movie. Basically rehash «Bluff Coogan in" Siegel, the main difference is that the hat Clint Eastwood has more charisma than the average Joe Don Baker, unattractive actor, when he was one. <br /> <br /> However, Venantino Venantini is a great (and very fun) as the bad guy, like Gassman budget. He is the main reason to sit through this steampile, the rest of the actors deliver largely horrible actions, especially the girl. Poor old Rossano Brazza, it is difficult to believe that he was once a romantic lead (see «Mondo Cane», to see how he runs away from women). Looking to herein as the second tier of Gazzara, he gave nothing to do. This show is all Joe Don, unfortunately. And it killed a generic 80 "Action Movie" music that could not be more boring. <br /> <br /> Graydon Clark can make a good B-Movies ( «without warning"), but here it works, falls, breaks his nose and lost three teeth. Well, at least the place of Malta have been good, and there Venantini, to try to save the day. 3/10.
