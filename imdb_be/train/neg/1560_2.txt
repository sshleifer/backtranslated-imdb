This movie can not even say what is bad for him, unfortunately, just hurt indirectly. Having no real mind or imagination, thin plot stretched to the absolute limit and `jokes (which are predictable and worn out) to turn to such inordinate length that boredom and yawning quickly overtake the viewer. Another cut to mark the sad fall of John Waters and a reminder that `shocked 'or entertained us 30 years ago does not work quite the same way as at present. We've seen it all before, and he's no longer in violation of any taboo, because they have long vanished. The main mistake.
