I've seen bad movies, but this took the p ***. It does not make sense, and all the characters make it swear by every few seconds, the second, and I think that one has a low sperm count. It's very good. Welshman plays sweary cockney. Posh English guy plays dishonest cheater from neck Unlovable paddy wagons, and some lesser lights dim played pies. <br /> <br /> And there are some Russian gangsters. Ah, yes some one has a gun and may negotiations debris while high on drugs. <br /> <br /> Avoid this film like the plague.
