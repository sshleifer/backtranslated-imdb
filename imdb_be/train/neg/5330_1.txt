Some here have noted that this is the worst Elvis movie ever made. Well, they only partly. For me, this is the worst movie of all time! I've never seen anything so vile crude and offensive and disgusting, and against human nature as this film. The present challenge for the film industry, it is not even so bad it is good. There's no bad mannerisms was interesting to be here, as in some other bad Elvis movies like Clambake. This one is so rotten that it is painful to sit through. Pure garbage. Native Americans have to sue for their bad formulaic and stereotypical treatment here. In fact, perhaps, all people must submit to the court for a crime and a disservice to the film makes for a species as a whole 0 stars, seriously. Evaluation: F
