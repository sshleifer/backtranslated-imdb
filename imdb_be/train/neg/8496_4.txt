Have you ever seen the movie, which consists entirely of wide long-shots? No? Me neither. Well, I finally saw "Spring in my hometown," and I must admit, now I know why people do not do it. Technician "art", to be sure, but it definitely was not ripe for public consumption. Technician strongly spoiled simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and, possibly, could be an intention of the director. I do not know, I can not read minds, and I, of course, enough about the director, to be judged not know. <br /> <br /> But one thing about this movie that painfully obvious is the ridiculous anti-American sentiment. As an American, I am well aware of my country's involvement in the Korean War, and I am very well known that we were not always angels, but I'll be damn if I take this guy's version of how it all happened. In accordance with the blind fool, Americans were not only at the root of the war, we were the cause of the war, and we almost single-handedly destroyed the country. Whatever, Mr. Director. And I think you'd still be doing this film in communist Korea, if we had not intervened, is not it? It's about forgetting their history. It's almost like doing Nazis "good guys", turning the Allied forces in the "bad guys." This film is so historically naive, in fact inaccurate, that it is almost embarrassing to watch. For a man who comes from a country that owes its existence to the American intervention, it sure comes off as a tall and strong and willful.
