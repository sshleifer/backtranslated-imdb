Body Slam (1987) is a flat film of trouble. Low budget carries pedestrian direction (at best), as well as writing and the action is lame. But if you're an old-school fight (about 1970 until the mid 80 '), then you will be more entertaining than the average viewer. I must warn you that this film stinks on ice. I gave him two, because I felt like being generous. This turkey was "directed" Master Stunt Hal Needham. Star Roddy Piper, Tonga Kid and a bunch of bush fighters and from the list of actors (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> synopsis of the "film" of the promoter, who wants to unite the "rock hair," and struggle. But they, and others, who do not want him to succeed. There's more, but I do not want to spoil it for you. If you can stomach the bad acting and nonsensical plot, there are some surprises near the end of diehard wrestling fans. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to my worst enemy (and I mean it).
