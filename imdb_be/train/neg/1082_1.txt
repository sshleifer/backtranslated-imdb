I think I've seen all the movies now and Grisham in general they are all very poor for The Rainmaker, except, but this one is so bad it's unbelievable <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILERISH <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where the hero makes a stupid irrational things that no one will ever do. He's a lawyer, for Christ's sake. Why, when his children disappear, he did not call the police. Oh yes, it's because of all the police hate lawyers, so they simply ignore it, and let it be attacked. <br /> <br /> If he is arrested for the murder, they just let him go free, he will be locked up in a cell awaiting bail hearings. <br /> <br /> Why did you drag the child halfway across the country, if you could easily protect their homes. <br /> <br /> The police did not bother to try to find the escaped mental patient, they do not bother to interview his daughter. <br /> <br /> As for that ridiculous ?? finals. <br /> <br /> In short, stupid, very unrealistic and a waste of time. <, Br /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst movies ever made.
