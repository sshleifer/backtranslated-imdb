I am very surprised, positive reviews, because we had four that you saw this on one screening, and we all went out. We personally felt that it was painfully slow to watch and could not sit through the whole movie. And we really tried to follow. In particular, in the group, who really wanted to like it because of his personal experience with sexual orientation exclusion in the school years depicted not like or identify with it at all. :( <br /> <br /> However, it is great to see that this film really resonates with a lot of people here on the boards and reviewers. This is the beauty of the subjective form of the film :).
