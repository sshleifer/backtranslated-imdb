This film was poor, to say the least !!! A lot of great cars to shame, as demonstrated in this film LAME. It starts with a race to the memo in Las Vegas, to be completed in 1 hour and 45 minutes ... in the F430 Ferrari. I did it in 1Hr 50 minutes in a tiny 140hp 4cylinder One one thousand nine hundred ninety-three Honda Accord. Seriously ... this film does not make the validity of these cars. It is obvious that these authors simply that, and perhaps the drive under the speed limit with your hands up @ 10 & 2 hours. I remember being in the news, Eddie Griffin crashed $ 1.5 million Ferrari Enzo going 30-40MPH >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> <br /> And ... ANDY director Cheng most big sale !!! He is a disgrace to his own race. I wonder how many people he verbally glad just to break into Hollywood. He took part in the film, which depicts the Asian American in such a negative and false way. Asian women >> cheap money digging whores. >> Asian men lose compulsive gambler & thug getting beat all the time. What the hell is all of the fear of Asians ?? Why you should always display them in a negative way ?? I'm so tired, like Hollywood always portrays Asians in a negative and false pretenses.
