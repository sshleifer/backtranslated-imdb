Probably encouraged by her many fans-better "Orlando," Potter then supplies the car to himself in the worst way: she writes, directs, stars, and in fact, co-wrote the music, including sugary love songs. The film is strongly reminiscent of a high school or college teen project is convinced that her own intimate love and melodramatic obsession are exciting for us as it. But the character of Potter as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unpleasant, and all film awkward manifestations of narcissism under the guise of celebrating tango. Maybe if she had not rushed it could work. She just can not act, regardless of whether or not playing yourself. Pretentious, over-ambitious, dull and stupid.
