I must say that I was very interested to see this film, and he was considered a notorious disaster when released by 20th Century Fox has also appeared in 1970 on several lists of critics bad movies and it just deepens interest because I just had to see what made this film so bad.Upon seeing it, I think I have the answer. Although I will say that it makes for a curious view that act, the direction and the script is so bad laughing, that the alleged satire is completely absent. Raquel Welch, it seems, is trying to carry the film, but after the opening sequence of sex-change operations, the film is so far down the hill, she can not cope with this task alone. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner, of course, does not help, as he licks and Leers on the screen, it sometimes looks like he asks himself what he was doing there. Rex Reed jumps around as Myron, the alter ego of the Worlds, and even has its own famous masturbation scenes. Bravo for debut performance! Farrah Fawcett played the dumb blonde; She, of course, we see this role. But, of course, perhaps the most notorious role went to Mae West. View of the 75-year-old woman with a plastic face makes sexual innuendo seemed more appropriate for a horror movie. I do not want to put this person throw down; but in this film, no one goes to look good. The direction seems so fragile and does not exist, the film is not only bad, but boring as well. Throw in some old film footage of old stars, and the film becomes even more excommunicated. To each his own to anyone who enjoyed it, and I was glad that at least seen, but Myra Breckenridge catastrophe seems that he has always been famous for since the beginning.
