I fell asleep on the couch at 7:35 pm to watch Larry Sanders last night (I usually DirecTivo, but not last night). I woke up at 3am (Invesment bankers on the west coast), and was fascinated to see it on the HbO2. I was shocked by how poor was the "film". Seriously. shocked. So shocked that I had to write a comment on IMDB. It is really too bad. writing sad, but the management and editing of just less than a freshman in high school movie. <br /> <br /> So, he filmed the video. Keep in mind that shot on video instead DIGITAL VIDEO. It looks like a soap opera. Skateboard video clips have a "movie" feel to them, then this horror. <br /> <br /> I would like to describe a bad directing, but I honestly can not remember anything. Arrows and lock stupid. Yes, I chose the word "stupid." Sun unconventionally, without risking, not thick, not boring, just plain stupid. I know people reviewing this review will say "well give me an example." I can not. It was 3 in the morning. But believe me, I know that you will watch it anyway, you will be shown the terrible reviews. <br /> <br />
