I was drawn to this film, when I looked at the list of actors, but after I watched it, I must admit that I felt a little disappointed. The main problem with this film is that the actors are not able to hold the film on the back. Why? Because of the bad script. Although, Dillon, Lane and Jones try very hard to take the film to another level, there is no innovation and direction of speaking too ordinary. So for fans of Matt Dillon is a watchable movie, as well as for fans of the beautiful Diane Lane. The legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great, but this is not a film for him; far below his level. So if you get hooked on this great actor to watch, but nothing great or extraordinary is not expected. The only thing you will remember about this movie is the scene Diane Lane; the rest is very forgettable.
