I have seen this film twice in a Pentecostal church my family attended in Nanaimo BC in the 1970s. I was at the tender age of 6, my brother 4, and then again when I was 8, my brother 6. This film is the horror of my brother and I in the form as we looked at the world with a grain of salt. It was not just a film, but it was also a philosophy that embraces so many "Christians" of the "mark of the beast" and hobbies. This film, a church, and a volatile careless upbringing, cause severe paranoia towards the future. For many years I lived under the insane affects the church and the fear of being forgotten by Christ. I am now 40 years old. We drove through the years of counseling. Once I told a psychiatrist that movie and the system of the church, and family beliefs. I was tied with a mad disorder. I actually started to believe in it, it was my brother who reminded me that it is a cult philosophy actually happened. I am no longer afraid of the future, I have come to terms with fear injects into it a member of the church. I took this experience to fulfill the purpose, I moved to the licensing, as a psychologist specializing in childhood trauma.
