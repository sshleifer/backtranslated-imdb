You know that you're in trouble when opening narration basically tells you who survive. It all goes downhill from there. Unnecessary, "MatrixÂ» -influenced bullet time camera work.

Even zombies sad. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that at least the "so bad it's good" zombie movie, but the "so bad, who is involved with its creation should be barred from ever make a film again." <br /> <br />
