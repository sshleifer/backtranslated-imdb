It was not what I wanted to see. I bought it on DVD and a movie I found myself irritated and turned off the film for a moment <br /> <br /> That's what I do not like :. <br /> <br /> 1 shot parents <br /> <br /> 2 tribes was really annoying <br /> <br /> 3 dinosaurs (mostly) look fake <br /> <br /> 4 poor scholar well it annoys <br /> <br /> 5, the image quality on the DVD was very bad <br /> <br /> What I did like: <br /> <br /> 1 music by Jerry Goldsmith. This music is really cool. I have a bootleg soundtrack of this movie. Unfortunately, the sound quality is not very good, but good for its time. <br /> <br /> 2 The first time we see the dinosaurs they cause a kind of awe. <br /> <br /> 3 Child kinda cute when he is in the water and playing <br /> <br /> 4 funny scene with a tent. <br /> <br /> 5 children to see this film, we hope to learn that evil always loses.
