I must admit that I do not keep a lot of New Age fetish. When people are "energy exchange" I always wonder how many kilojoules are actually exchanged and how it can contribute to solving the problem of global warming. If the energy of "forcibly" I always wonder how they managed to break the laws of entropy and still without a Nobel Prize. If people feel, how good instinct allows them to accurately navigate the complexities of life, I wonder how they are able to do a simple thing, how to find the train station. <br /> <br /> But, again, this is not the first film with plot holes, and most of them I find quite acceptable and interesting. If it was the case with "the Celestine Prophecy" I would Do not write this film down, but unfortunately, this is not the case. Each actor, seems bored with his head and not being able to understand what it actually should be doing on the ground. This leads to many "I-c" and "On-s", as I usually do when it comes to quantum physics with someone who actually knows what he is saying and pretend to understand. <br /> <br /> direction uninspired as well. one would expect something more from a man who made "what dreams may come ", but hey, I thought he was well paid for his work and took the attitude of the driver in New York taxi:" it's your money, man .. " the only one who seems to be happy is constantly bad guy Prochnow. Moreover, he has a job, he is one of the few actors in this film, which may have a few wise cracks on this eternal and terribly boring New Age babble. <br /> <br /> This film is very similar to one of these lunch dates, when you discover that your date is really a terrible bore, which does not seem to be able to shut up. At some point in time, it seems, the words turn into little ping pong balls that are thrown in the head incessantly, until it hurts. <br /> <br /> If you want to have a good time and have to choose between this film and sticking pins in your age, take my advice: choose the latter.
