Before I saw it, I've seen some pretty bad Christmas movies. But as soon as I saw it, "Jingle All the Way" looked better than "The Godfather." "Santa Claus" is a hilarious film about Santa rescued some children, but it feels almost demonic look. He paddles Santa ho-ho-ho replaces evil, diabolical laughter, which I'm sure got a lot of kids on Christmas. The plot of this massacre is very strange that fits together with all the presentations and dialogue. Santa lives high above the Earth at the North Pole, where he is, and children from around the world to get to Christmas. But Santa has an enemy named Pitch, or Satan. Pitch is trying to destroy Christmas Santa Claus, making three mischievous boys, as well as by creating a diversion, as the movement in the chimney and make the door hot. If Pitch leads to be attacked by a dog Santa is Santa's helper to Pedro and Merlin the wizard to get Santa out of this pickle. <br /> <br /> All of this film, however, really bad, it's so strange. Satan dances a lot, and it really seems to be much more fun than Santa. Santa talking about the delivery of gifts for all boys and girls, but it seems to only deliver up to 5 children homes in Mexico. Deer wind up toys, and, when the reindeer laugh, I'm surprised that does not bring tears to the eyes of the baby ... it's scary. All this is terrible. The first 10 minutes of a Santa plays the organ while the children sing it. Probably one of the strangest scenes of Santa Shooting Step in the example of the mini-gun and deafening laughed at her, and Pitch dancing around in pain. I think that parents are better tell their young children about where babies come from, than to show it to them. The only positive it will have you laughing hysterically if you can appreciate a bad movie <br /> <br /> My rating :. BOMB / ****. 85 min.
