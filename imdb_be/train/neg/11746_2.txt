Well, this movie is, of course, there was a fair amount of hype; From the buzz at the Toronto Film Festival, showering the reviews on CBC Radio. Refreshing, silly, hilarious indie film, apparently. I'm looking forward to it for months. <br /> <br /> How can I put it this simple? He sucked in a very big way. An exercise in cinematic lameness, which makes Adam Sandler look like a comic genius. <br /> <br /> At best, it was mildly amusing, and at worst induce a coma. Amerterish scenario strongly directed and poorly edited in the old mess. <br /> <br /> And with the music being 500db louder than the rest of the soundtrack? It was just really weird about it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a really funny, weird movie with aliens, try RepoMan. There is no comparison!
