I rented the copied-English version Lensman, hoping that since he came from a well-known novels, he will have some substance. Although there were hints of a substance in the film, it basically does not rise above the level of a kiddie cartoon. Maybe it was a bad movie adaptation of the book, and he lost in the dubbed version. Or maybe even the original novels were mild. But for some reason, there was not much there. <br /> <br /> I've noticed a lot of details that have been derived, sloppy, ill-dramatize, or otherwise insufficient. Some examples: the opening scene seemed borrowed from the "Star Gate" scene in 2001 and Star Wars Hyperspace image. Robot for processor looked like anthropomorphized «R2-D2». <br /> <br /> He starts trying to lend a comic style embossed Star Wars, but fortunately (because humor does not work) refuses to comedy and playing it seriously. In this sense, it is superior to the franchise Star Wars, which began with a clever sense of humor, and eventually deteriorated to the unfortunate stupidity in Jar-Jar. <br /> <br /> agricultural parts, apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm. Harvester traveling through the middle of left field on uncleared dumping silage culture, instead of working with one side to the other and dumping silage already assembled row or a truck. Corn (maize) pouring chute grains, but farmland were depicted as a field of wheat. <br /> <br /> When it was time for Kim's father had to face his destiny, there was no dramatic weight to the scene. This may be partly due to the fault of the English language voice actor, but the images do not show much weight either. Kim's reaction in that scene were as unconvincing. <br /> <br /> In the same way, when a character named Henderson was killed, Chris showed very little reaction, despite the fact that they apparently had to close. (Death Henderson entirely spoiler, his name was not disclosed until his death scene.) She seems to forget it quickly. Someone expression of sympathy shows more feelings than she does. I think that the voice of the actor deserves much of the blame in this case; there is at least a hint of feeling in Chris drawings. <br /> <br /> In some cases, the villains are not able to fulfill their orders. villain leader often punishes those setbacks with the unfortunate death. I can not say that it rises out of Star Wars, or, if it occurs at an earlier source. - possibly, Lensman books <br /> <br /> There's a scene where a spaceship crash-land. As down to earth, of the ship to stop. But so many pieces fall down, there should be nothing left of it by the time it lands. <br /> <br /> While in most cases Chris seems competent, tough space hero, there's a scene where she cries out how incompetent Woman in trouble. Somebody tough enough to get over the death of Henderson so fast should at least be able to shout, "Help, that is me, and I can not reach my gun!" Instead of just squeal. <br /> <br /> The character with the person himself (almost too much at times) is D.Zh. Bill. He sounded like Wolfman Jack, in D.J. in American Graffiti. Interestingly, when it is well voiced in the original language. <br /> <br /> The two planets in the film exploded. Explosions were spectacular, and seemed to have a lot of inspiration for Star Wars. To his credit, however, the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the main weapon of the Death Star. Conversation was good, interesting explanation. Many other explosions in the film looked good, not just planetary explosions. <br /> <br /> Some of the sound effects are very cheesy, as though borrowed from the late 1970's video games. Some images look primitive video games, and some influence from Tron seen too. On the other hand, the sound effects are often quite decent, although it emphasizes the cheese-sounding parts. Art is also good, especially if he stays away from the often bad-looking computer graphics. <br /> <br /> And finally, there is a story. If the film tells a good story, he can get away with a lot of production defects. But the story here was pretty easy. Naive boy trying to help someone on the lame spaceship, and acquires more power, he does not understand. He and his team are very virtuous comrades to fight against the strong, unredeemably worst enemy. He is friendly, learns about his special powers, and grows into a young man. If he is persistent and virtuous, he may even win an evil enemy. Details on the way you can do this story rises above the simple circuit, but there is very little more than the movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's just a children's cartoon. But, as it looks like the main target audience of older children, maybe it does not need anything more than that.
