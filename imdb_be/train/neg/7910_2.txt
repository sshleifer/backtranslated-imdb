I have seen most of the «My Bollywood Bride» today NKKRA Film Festival in New York, and was forced to leave the theater because of the nausea rising in me. I have seen Bollywood movies, and I've seen a Bollywood movie satires. This film could not decide which one he wanted to be, so it ended up being a joke about themselves. <br /> <br /> It seems to have been freely copied from films like Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling, and that sloppy, lazy work in this. As Bollywood ever separated from its determination to stick to abuse, laid scripts? Is not there someone who can display millions of real, exciting stories, which undoubtedly exist and are set in the land of billions of people? Overly clever automatic driver, a cow on the street, gratuitous scenes of foreign places, meaningless scenes Mumbai street, they are all there. Diverse clichés about India in good faith on. So sick predictable. ugh !!! Actor's speech is weak across the board for Neha Dubey, who is a talented and beautiful exception. I wonder why she chooses a project like this.
