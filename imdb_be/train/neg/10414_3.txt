This is an extremely foolish and little seen film about slavery in the West Indies and Puddy stars of the show «Seinfeld»! Patrick Warburton made his film debut in this film is far-fetched, and it is noticeably slimmer here. Oliver Reed got top billing, but it is unlikely in the film at all. Warburton plays a white slave and it's fun to see all the young and horny wives of rich old bidding on it, because they all want to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays the owner of a brothel, and they are so much nudity in the film. If it is not a drunken orgy in a brothel, his young wife, who are they turning to him. Then, of course, before the end of rebel slaves, and there is a bloody confrontation. There is no real political message as the film «Burn», but just another contrived plot device to move the story along. Incredibly, they did continue and Warburton, and all the other actors are back! I hope they paid a lot of dough, because it is the first film is very bad. Nudity keeps it watchable, and the absence of Warburton in any accent does this from time to time clown. Very bad movie, but I must admit that I would like to see continued.
