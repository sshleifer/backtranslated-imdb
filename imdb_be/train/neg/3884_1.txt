Many months ago, when I was seven years old, I vaguely remember the trailer of this film. He appealed to my sense of naive curiosity, I decided to ask my parents to take me to this film. Being wise adults that they have, they told me: "It is not! This is a bunch of garbage, "Of course, I was very disappointed that I would not be the first kid on my block to see <br /> <br /> It was not« Incredible Melting Man Time "-.. Maybe a couple of days . I forgot about «the Incredible melting Man» and my disappointment lost. Twenty-five years have passed, until he went back into the forefront of my thoughts. while surfing through the channels on digital cable, I found a long-lost relic of the film. my curiosity I was raised, and I finally decided to take part in this forbidden fruit of my parents. I should have listened Xia to them. "The Incredible Human melting" probably the worst movie known to man. It makes films like «Def-Con 4," MetalStorm "and" Freddy Got Fingered "look like an Oscar nominee. I feel violated spend almost two hours of my life watching this vile filth. the story was incoherent, and even the effects of a crude 1977. As someone who believes the film company to produce this film me. <br /> <br /> do not make the same mistake that I did. Listen to your parents when they forbade you to watch this movie. They were right.
