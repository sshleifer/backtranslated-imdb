Needless to say - it bitch! (I gave it a rating of 2) <br /> <br /> look only if you are suffering from insomnia. <br /> <br /> There's plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up, but not much else going on in this movie. There's no tension, no deep, shocking secrets revealed, there is no real threat to the well-being of the heroine. Several differences, a slight increase in voices - this is pretty much it. Secrets do not have anything that could happen to anyone - the last "secret" is revealed in the film is quite predictable that point <br /> <br /> The plot, such as it is, revolves around a young woman named. faith (Meg Tilly), who is an artist, who is hired to paint a series of wall panels in a huge ballroom in a huge mansion on a very, very rich, old widowed woman, and the growing ratio of the type mother / daughter that an older woman craves with her. <br /> <br /> is the daughter of the older women, Cassandra, is dead. You can very well fit the other pieces together. <br /> <br /> Even the scene with a mysterious man threatening our heroine does not progress to the point where you actually fear for their safety outside, maybe a second or two. Why is he still hanging around years after the death of Cassandra is a good question. <br /> <br /> There is also the question of what this vast mansion is only one servant, a dedicated butler, who seems to do everything-- cooking, cleaning, food service, answering the door, and etc. All, except, perhaps, closing the door - because it was the only explanation of how a character simply walks into the room, where faith <br /> <br. /> There's nothing that will have you clutching your chair arms and leaned forward on the edge of your seat because there is "mounting" the tension in the film - a soft, pathetic revelation that get thrown out from time to time. <br /> <br />
