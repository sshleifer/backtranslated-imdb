My nose bent out of shape a bit, as I write this. I sent the previous comment on this movie a few weeks ago, that still did not show up, so I guess he was rejected, even if it fulfilled all the usual rules. <br /> <br /> I found this movie interesting for the first thirty minutes, in particular, the performance of moles, a veteran actor who has appeared in such major productions as "Blow" and "The Alamo." Leonor Watling is also pretty good. Unfortunately, all sinks in the end under the weight of the truly awful, melodramatic script. There is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the story or borrow even impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully photographed piece of art. <br /> <br /> The actual day trip to the beach in Valencia will be much less complex than have to deal with these fictional characters again, anywhere, anytime.
