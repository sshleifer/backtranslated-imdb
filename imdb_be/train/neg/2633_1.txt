I saw the trailer a few times in the theater, and I'm excited. It looked like a classic thriller, like those made in the 1990s. It reminded me too volatile movie, cat and mouse chase between Douglas and Sutherland. However, the Guardian is the most tasteless fighter of all time. I see a lot of people say it's like a TV movie. Not exactly. Firstly, there is a much better television films in this genre. Second, television movies can sometimes be a lot of fun, but this film is the opposite in order to have a good time. It's not all visually stylish and most importantly, the tone of the film unsightly. This is not a thriller, there are two action scenes consist of chases and collisions. In addition, they are not big action scenes, but worse is the fact that these actions scenes are very tasteless, like the rest of the film. Love between Douglas and Bassinger was very unnecessary. In addition, the murder conspiracy of the president is the most clich√© stories in this genre is anything but they insist on it. And it's not a cat and mouse movie, as it should be. Although Douglas is very old, he still has the potential of acting action thriller. In the film, Michael Douglas could not be like Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is a wrong choice or because you feel as if you are watching Jack Bauer and some way, his character is one of the reasons that make the film as a TV movie, Eva Longoria Parker, a strange choice, of course, she 'it is too passive, or right in this film, because it is a soap opera actress. The film was not fun, even one second for me, so I could not get for some time.
