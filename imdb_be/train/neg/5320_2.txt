It is a dry and sterile recording function on one of the most interesting events of the Great Patriotic War and in the history of the war behind the front line. Bad composition worst drama of this film, as the plot to assassinate Hitler is suppose to be pretty dramatic event. There's no character development in general and the idea that involves Tom Cruise to play the commander of higher rank, which calls into question his deepest inner thoughts of patriotism and Betrayal totally insane. I believe that Mr. Bean will play better. Generally speaking, the film is pretty much looks like a cheap copy of a good German TV movie "Stauffenberg" since 2004, but could not get close to this film in relation to any aspect of the film at all. Nevertheless, the film is clearly receives financial goals with popcorn audience that appreciates Hollywood rapid blood mood and values ​​of shallow Arts.
