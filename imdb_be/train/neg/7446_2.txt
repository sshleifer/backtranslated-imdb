I have two words for you. Sean Bean. He is the only one standing presence in this film. But even in this case, do not watch this movie. Despite the fact that it was good, as the main villain, you do not want to waste your time. <br /> <br /> I do not care about the characters (except for the little boy), and in fact, I really do not care if the unfortunate lovers ended with or died. The film does not make me care about or believe that these people care about each other at all. I read a lot of "classic" novels after watching the film and this film made me not even want to read the book. History seems to be so boring. But I can go ahead and read it, to try to make up for the story in my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doone. The actress, who plays Lorna in Sense and Sensibility, and it was much better at it. Hours Sharp, Horatio Hornblower, A & E has great movies novels like Pride and Prejudice. Or miniseries as The Forsyte Saga. Check them out, do not bother with the Lorna Doone.
