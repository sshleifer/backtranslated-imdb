Fragmentaric film about a few people in Austria at the time of abnormal heat. This kind of movie has been done often, and most of all, better. Stories do not really have anything to do with each other except for the deplorable finale:. "Ugly people hard flesh, unpleasant people, and a film that is too long on the road is not really making a point ... Ultra-realistic Hardly?. .. Bored? Really. Do not even great Franzisca Weiss can save it! 3/10
