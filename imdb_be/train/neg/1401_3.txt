Someone mentioned editing. It is edited poorly and what started out as a few intriguing was incomprehensible mess. To begin with, let us know what you are trying to do with these experiments. Why these people are the best choice for the type of experiment they participate in? And what they test? Apparently there is a grand plan, that some agencies are going to use. Action is very bad. Each emoting. Each person keeps secrets. They often say that if there was no money, they would hang him. There's a crazy minister who spouts scripture. On and on. But again, the biggest hang up is the lack of laying out the playing field for actors. There are some really cheese items. These small rooms and those sunbeds. Terrible wallpaper (wallpaper was it?). It was interesting, but seemed not to go anywhere.
