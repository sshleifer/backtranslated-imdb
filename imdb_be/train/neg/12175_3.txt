Why watch a good movie, if you can see the "trancer II?» <br /> <br /> Oh, this movie is soooo inaccurate. I can only imagine the cast and crew to travel around with L.A. video camera, throwing in extra bad monsters make-up in a poor, long-suffering Timea Tomerson. family stars actually appear to play a cameo, probably because the Full Moon could not afford a "real" extras. Lama effects, lame sets, and script so confusing that would be eons untie all knots - it should be a classic trancer <br /> <br /> And yet ... and yet ... the rule !. Please note this is the same thing I can say about "trancer IV.» I say this because it's true. What can beat watching an old guy in a raincoat mow the zombies and then erupt with quips like, "Do not worry at home, they are bio-degradable '? Well, a lot of things that could be better, but in any case it's still a good . material <br /> <br /> My only substantial order Megan Ward that really stinks up the joint it is a lousy competitor character Helen Hunt -. both young pieces of eye candy, and it would be more effective if they are in actually a little more contrast. Well, you can not have it all. at the very least, a great plot device "long the second hour "back in place, and we have more Hap Ashby, the least compelling athlete in the history of cinema (oh, wait a minute - he has a competitor in the form of David Ogden Steirs in" Creator ») <br /> <br /> I am. not seen in recent years, but I remember that Beswick runs twice during the final battle. Cheers lousy continuity! Just one of the many moments in the thin film.
