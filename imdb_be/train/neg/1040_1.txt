I can not believe that this film managed to obtain a relatively high rating of 6! It almost watchable and incredibly boring, of course, one of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time. <br /> <br /> In a non-budget way it reminded me of Star Wars Episodes I and II for the distinct impression that you're watching a train wreck full of creativity. <br /> <br /> This film should be avoided at all costs. This is one of those "festival films", which only please the pseudo-intellectual, because they are so poorly made these people think that he is doing this "other", so good. <br /> <br /> A bad film industry is not "different", it is just bad filmmaking.
