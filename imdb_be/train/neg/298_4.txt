Daraar left a pretty good start. The first scene really left me on the edge of my seat wondering what will happen next. Moreover, the first half of the film is common BORE. All of the first half of the film about Rishi Kapoor falls head over heels in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, do not you think he's a little old for her ??? <br /> <br /> Things finally start to the middle of the spice film when Juhi talks about his pre-husband; and nothing that lunatic he is! He was extremely protective, neat freak with a very hot-tempered! He Juhi bring down the poor for no reason! One of the reasons why I really do not like this film, because I can not see Juhi (my favorite actress) get so abused. This film generally has too many abuses and bloodshed; I find it so sick !!! <br /> <br /> In any case, all I'm trying to say is that if you think about Daraar lease, you have to put it back on the shelf where you found it, and choose something else!
