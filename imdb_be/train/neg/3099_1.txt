This film is not just bad, not just a cliché, it's disgusting. Something about Daphne, a terrible call girl, of all the bloody (and I use the word literally) film emits grotesquery, that would offend brothel mistress. This movie makes my skin crawl, makes me regret having sexual organs, and makes me feel unclean. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothers me most about this film is that they used such a good concept. A creature that makes fantasy with disastrous results, not clichés Worst Nightmare and overdone Twisted Desire, it's really exciting idea of ​​the film <br /> <br /> The idea :. The reason why houses should be killed until the day that they are attracted to bright lights. During the day, the bright lights do not appear good, so that they can go anywhere <br /> <br /> Count the house :. Four brownies turned out of the studio, and yet, at least nine of the harmful toys plush- killed throughout the film <br /> <br /> Discussion Question :. If you have a cold, demanding, ungrateful friend, you would enter the garden-tool against military chunkhead? Explain.
