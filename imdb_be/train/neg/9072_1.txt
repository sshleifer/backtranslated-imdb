This movie has no plot, no attention. Yes, this should be a slap-stick, a silly comedy, but the screen-writers have no idea what the film was about. Even the name does not go along with the movie. This should be called Â«Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something like that. Characters are not developed, and no one cares what happens to them! The character of the girl roommate (from what 70 Show) was the only one worth watching. It was fun and stole every scene she was. The rest have to make sure that their own college diplomas in the works, as they will need in their careers, in addition to acting.
