My wife and I found this film to be highly unsatisfactory. Although the plot keeps you interested and busy wondering just what happens when you leave the theater, there are just too many loose ends that have no meaning. (Spoilers ahead), Christopher Plummer, extremely rich Head Bank of New York has a terrible secret hidden. Brings from the Second World War has to do with the Nazis and hiding the loot stolen from the Jews, he keeps evidence (including diamonds and documents from the Nazi swastika) in the safe in your bank. Why? If he does not want it to never be revealed why he did not burn and destroy documents of years ago? And the diamonds? Obviously, he does not need them - why keep them rather than get rid of them? As the bank robbers find out his secret? How did they know to zero at this very safety deposit box # 232? Ace detective Denzel Washington also opens bank data show SD boxes No's 231 and 233, but not 232. # interesting. He meticulously took the time, somehow, to make a tedious search of bank records to unearth this one interesting fact. All the while dealing with hot hostage situation and bank robbers threatened to start their performance at the moment. Wow! It's about a superpower for a detective. <br /> <br /> bank robbers leave millions of dollars in free currency in the safe they opened. They only accept SD Box # 232 content alleged to blackmail the president of the bank. It can not be a rational attempt a logical explanation for the fact that the film depicts how the criminal genius, so i for its associates with a smaller brain. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster, using his political connections with the mayor of New York, received permission to enter the bank, which is under the control of the bank robbers during many hostages. It offers a main bank robber transaction to buy back the documents he now has in his hand, but he is not interested. So his point (if any?). <br /> <br /> My wife was offended arrogance of all players, Christopher Plummer (bank president), Denzel Washington (Detective Ace) and Jodie Foster, crack problems shooter for powerful problems. <br /> <br /> Last Jodie Foster movie I saw, «Flight Plan», also riddled with holes, which makes no sense at all. I thought that I liked Jodie Foster, but I will probably avoid her upcoming films. <br /> <br /> Now my problem is that I can rarely convince my wife to go to the movies. I could not agree with her on this one ... "a waste of money and a waste of time." I warn. Correctly composed film great actors, lousy script writing.
