I think that's almost all there is to say. I feel obligated to explain their actions, though. I've basically never seen such a production Armateur, and I mean that in every sense of the word. Although the physical camera work, the boom operation MIC and other technical aspects of the film funny, unfortunately, it is not only in the regions. <br /> <br /> In contrast to some of the classic independent films that have been retained by their scripts great characterization and plot, it is, unfortunately, has a terrible scenario, horrible actions and worst of all, terrible annoying character. <br /> <br /> it is a crime that, for each independent film that gets spread like Haiku Tunnel, there are 101 other indie films dead silent death. I do not know, Kornbluth brothers who knows the Sony, but this may be my only explanation of how this amateur production of the family ever has spread. I am completely taken aback, why they chose it. <br /> <br /> The only part of this movie, which keeps any intrigue is his name. However, the reason for this even later. I hope this review will save a few people who may be intrigued by this name with movies going to watch it. I've seen a lot of movies in my time, and I am very forgiving if in a movie, but it was too much. I will never forget "tunnel" to mark an important moment in my life movie experience. Shame is such a low point. <br /> <br />
