Innocent (Steve Guttenberg) has one night with the wife of his boss (Isabelle Huppert) and. She sees a woman (Elizabeth McGovern) is attacked from the outside, but it can not call the police because it would undermine her marriage with the boss Gutenberg (Chenard). Since Gutenberg, honest citizen that he is, when he discovers that the other woman was attacked and killed only about half an hour, comes forward and claims to have witnessed the first attack, just intending to pass the information made available to it Huppert. Well - do not bear false witness against thy neighbor, as they say, <br /> <br /> This simple attempt to help the police catch the killer turns quickly twisted .. If he meets the first friends of the victims, McGovern, she immediately sticks that It happened, but agrees to keep quiet at the moment. But then Guttenberg finds himself in court, shall identify heavy (Greenquist) and we find through the cross-examination that he was short-sighted and can not identify objects at a distance, not to mention the people. (Not that this is important because, in the end, he never saw the creep in the first place.) The plot becomes almost a labyrinth. Guttenberg pulls the prime suspect when Huppert killed. <br /> <br /> He barely escapes arrest and the opening of the now pretty McGovern. Guttenberg McGovern and hatch a plan to catch the killer. It will serve as a lure. They will follow a disgusting creep in one of his shabby shelter and McGovern will act as a Doxy, the killer brought to simply get him to try to kill her. But everything will be fine, see, because not only will Guttenberg closely monitor it, and not only did he warn the police a few minutes after she enters the dive, but it will keep the bank mace handy - just in case. <br /> <br /> I ask you, proactive audience, makes this scenario unfolds as planned? Elizabeth McGovern has mockingly interesting bone structure. It seems the whole jaw and a tiny mouth then, but she was alive. Steve Guttenberg has hair on his muscles and that's about it. Otherwise, it is just as helpless as the character he plays. If Isabelle Huppert can act, not obvious in this film. Killer and is formed so caring that he looks like he's wearing one of these masks ugliness in this episode Dark areas of greedy heirs. <br /> <br /> I do not directed by Curtis Hanson, keep doing "LA Confidential"? It was beautifully done piece of work. Here, everything seems awkward and flimsy, even to small bit parts. Immediately before the inevitable culmination of tough, uniformed police officers entered to delay the rescue McGovern, and the scene embarrassing to watch. Dick Olsen has a cameo appearance as a late buyer. He was a neat guy and always reliable. Chenard as the cuckold hubby has a strange face, which seems to be made for the stage, and he does an excellent job too. <br /> <br /> It is notorious joint where McGovern has attracted the attention of the killer, where she plays pool with a pair of hairy monkeys, was shot in a bar in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, not far from where I lived. Method interior installed, it is clear that it must be dangerous and dirty dive. In fact, it is much more elegant on the screen than it was in reality. <br /> <br /> In general, it is the territory of Hitchcock and it brings tears to my eyes to imagine what he would do with this story.
