There were some funny films about the spirits to come out of Hollywood. Cary Grant was an angel in "The wife of the bishop" (1947). Of course, the best thing was a movie Topper in the late 30's and early 40's. And, more recently, Warren Beatty «Heaven Can Wait» (1978), which was a remake of one thousand nine hundred forty-one «Here Comes Mr. Jordan." They were well written, funny, entertaining comedy, all of which are centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels. <br /> <br /> Now there is written and directed by Jeff Lowell, making his debut feature film of the stories unpleasant, cynical young woman, Kate (Eva Longoria Parker), who dies on her wedding day, and then returns to stick to the spirit of a young Ashley (Lake Bell), which falls on the bride Kate Henry (Paul Rudd). The only thing clear from the outset: Longoria Parker Sun Constance Bennett (Marion Kerby in the first two films, "Topper"), which is the standard against which it measures all women's perfume <br /> <br /> There is. the right line at the beginning, when Henry's sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane), Henry says, "You do not smile." That's exactly my situation described in this film. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film is that the script just is not very funny. But this is exacerbated by the presence Longoria Parker, just rubbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen. Just to start with, compromising its lack of comedic talent, it is covered with so many pancake make-up, who knows what she actually looks like? Kate is killed on her wedding tuning falling frozen statue. It is so stupid, that an angel who instructs her that her life after the death of go at it (well, it is really just disappears), so Kate finds herself back on the ground, like a ghost, not knowing that its mission . <br /> <br /> Chloe Henry wants a snap with funk, in which he, of course, went down after Kate's death (from what I saw Kate, he would have felt a wonderful relief), so that it enters it into Ashley which actually doesn 'know what it does, as a medium (it is also cateress, to make ends meet), to see if she can get back to Henry ~ d in contact with Keith. There are many meshugaas, what's going on. <br /> <br /> emptiness embodied film "B" story revolves around an assistant Ashley, Dan (Jason Biggs). It is thrown in toward the end, but the way it handles Ashley indicates that it is as much of a boob, Kate. As Dan seems to attract both women with severe disabilities, he deserves what he gets. <br /> <br /> In the end, Kate is Ashley and the fun to begin. It does not, and so much the worse, because it could be quite funny in other hands. As it is, Norman Z. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray & Co. must be turning over in their graves to see is that they shine in the first two films, "Topper" created.
