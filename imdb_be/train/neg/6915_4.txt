This is one of those movies that I remember how in the bank for many years before anything happens w / it. I do not think it's terrible, but it's not very good. Alec Baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is kind of shaky, at best. The cast is pretty good in the fact that they have given, but then again you are only as good as the script. Baldwin directing it, even though I could have sworn that he did not send it all, I thought I read somewhere a lot of repeat runaways was not bad, but it certainly has some potential there. Despite the fact that his work on "30 Rock» is not nothing but a genius and should keep him busy a little longer. I just hope that the show bows gracefully from the Seinfeld, but maybe not even that long. 9 years old he went. So if you want to watch a movie that you do not get a lot of, but not really good either hate it for you. I can not remember the last time when the film was wrapped so long before finally released only on DVD in it. It was nice to see, Alec Baldwin & Anthony Hopkins back together, as their great yet so many people have seen «The Edge». Now pick up this wonderful movie for some real entertainment.
