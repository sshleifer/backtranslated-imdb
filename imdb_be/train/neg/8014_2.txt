"Wild Tigers I Have Known." It will show only in big cities, to be sure. This is one of those films SO pretentious, it does not make sense that so ever, except for the director! I hate those! And all those of the so-alternative / pretentious people are desperately trying to find a "metaphor" that EVIDENT dog. <br /> <br /> There was no plot, no story, no moral, no history, nothing funny or touching. For me it was a bunch of scenes thrown together, that had nothing to do with each other, and it was to "show" to show how the "artsy" and "visual" they could get. It was an attempt another movie for teen angst, but missed the mark on every level humanly possible. Then the credits! I waited for it to make sense! I was expecting a "good side." I have about 60 independent movies in my DVD collection, many of which, perhaps, could be called "art-house" films. It will not be among them. You will be very angry at myself for paying to see this movie, much less ever buy it on DVD.
