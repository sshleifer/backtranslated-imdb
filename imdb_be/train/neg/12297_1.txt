Witchy Kneph captures a group of people in the isolated accommodation and selects one per twisted, disgusting methods. I thought I had seen it all until one unfortunate man is not crucified, and then his head was set on fire. Hildy is quite the joker as she takes painful harpies and sews her mouth ... then hangs it with his feet on his head in the chimney just in time for the fountain of flames of fire! "Enchantment" made me sick. It made my eyes hurt. I was not ready to write it off as the worst film ever ever ever do otherwise competent people ... to the final. I must admit that I liked the ending. It includes the boy and his toy tape cornered Linda Blair is looking fantastic possessed. The scene only lasts for one minute and the film is over, but you know that old saying: "If you have a great ending, people will forgive you just about anything"
