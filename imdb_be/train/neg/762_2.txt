Loyalty to Peter Falk all that kept me from giving this terrible picture (1), which it deserves. (However, loyalty to Mr. Falk was what kept me watching this movie all the way from head to tail.) Even if you forgive all the glaring mistakes, it's just the poorest excuse for made for "Columbo TV" movie ever. I'm glad I watched it on TV for free, do not want to be coughed up the bucks for printing.
