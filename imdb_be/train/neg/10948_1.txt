What were they thinking in the "Cannes"? One of the most annoying, films of all time. Every detail of this film, no matter how pointless it was shown. If I had to watch her put on these boots one more time I think I would have cried. If the point of this film was to show how miserable life was Rosetta, it was covered in the first fifteen minutes of the film, and then the loans should have been run. But no, we should have seen countless redundant scenes over and over again. All of it was filled with unsympathetic and unsympathetic characters. They deserved the suffering that was Rosetta. And to think that I passed up "Tumbleweed" to see this over-hyped film of boredom. It was like watching grass grow, but what is more exciting.
