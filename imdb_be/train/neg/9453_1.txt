Holy cow, what a piece of crap this film. I do not like these filmmakers could take 250 words of the book and turn it into a movie. I believe that they did not know how! I do not remember any humming or belch in the book, is not it? <br /> <br /> They took it all at children's classic, added some rumbling, belching and sexual inuindo and prostituted Kaka joke. This should give you a good idea of ​​what these Hollywood producers to think like. I must say that it was visually interesting, but brilliant visual storytelling destroyed toilet humor (if you even think such a thing is ridiculous) I do not want kids, I know, to think that it is. <, Br /> <br /> do not take their children to see, do not rent a DVD. I hope that the ghost of Dr. Suess ghost comes and chases the man who made the film.
