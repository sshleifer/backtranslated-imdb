I'm a big fan of David Lynch. This film, however, was a very disappointing experience. Besides environmental background music ?? which really sets the mood of the film ?? it lacks almost all of the qualities that I have come to associate with the work of Lynch. Visual stupid, to put it mildly, and the dialogue is vague and monotonous to have any interest. <br /> <br /> It's more like film students uncomfortable trying to make Arty dogma film, than the work of an experienced director. I've seen a lot of amateur movies with far superior camera work, sets, sound and script. This film has almost all the artistic quality. I feel as if I'm watching one of the Davids home video made during a trip on the weekend with friends.
