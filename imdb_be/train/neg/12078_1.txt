I literally fell asleep 3 times to watch this movie. Of course, it's Shakespeare and takes a certain mindset to be interested or not. But this film is superior to any barrier of long monologues, and what is not, which can prevent many of simply not caring about Shakespeare's history. <br /> <br /> The biggest obstacle to this is the production of complete flatness signs. Often interacting in character, it is practically difficult to distinguish who is who line. Of course, I believe that this film is dubbed in English. Of course, they could have obtained the voice actors, which could add a little more drama, these classical, literary line. <br /> <br /> It would be difficult to evaluate this film more than 1, although it is possible that it is based on prejudices about, perhaps, age and what seemed to be a very low budget. Nevertheless, it is absolutely painful and sad. If you insist on Hamlet, do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1/10
