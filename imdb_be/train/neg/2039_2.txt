This film was almost unbearable to sit through. I can go beyond the fact that it looks like it was shot with a home video camera and that this film should cover more than a week of time before the characters do not just change clothes, but the action broke the 4th wall to pieces for me, I've seen better acting in 4th grade play. In addition, the story is not realistic. If a man suspected man, he would have turned it. I was also very disappointed that all the murders were done with a gun, which is parched that. It's not a copycat Zodiac did not kill, using only the power of the gun would know it was not him. Another thing that really bothers me that they called dissociative identity disorder DSM 4, if the name of the book, which is used for the diagnosis of people with mental disorders, rather than the name of the disorder. Overall, I think this film is not a film that could be done with a low budget, at least not as low as they are, or they could have done to have the best actors and more gore. Many people went to the budget route low due to use terrible actors look at the Easy Rider, which was Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a low budget.
