This is the best way I can describe this film, which focuses on young, moving into a house that is haunted by her husband's first wife, who died under mysterious circumstances. It sounds good, but what is played for an hour of pure boredom. In fact, one of the most fun things about this film is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film, which promises to anyone who dies of fright free coffin. Well, believe me, no one took them to this proposal, if someone out there is not terrified of plastic skulls, peacocks, strange gardeners and knocked on the door. And the music is the worst, it consists of a continuous tube of music that sounds like it played any sixth grader. And you'll find out a terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what people thought in the movie. Someone dies while running and hitting his head, and the police are never called upon to investigate. So in the end this is a slow tempo (which is really bad, considering the film is only a little over an hour), boring a small story that is easily understood by a common man. Perhaps none of the characters in this film was not a person on average.
