wow this is the worst movie ever. the only reason why I signed up for IMDb was, so that I could complain about this film. I have never walked out of a theater or to stop on the DVD, but I almost stopped this one (and I have). but I watched all the way through only to allow again with absolutely terrible end. Wow, if that's all that Wes Craven could lead to his long-time up. I never saw the first ever after viewing. his horrible actions with a horrible story. hey look someone sparkling mirror we let go check it out. and the sad part is that when the film was released on DVD it has been fully tested on blockbusters ever. so I feel bad for all the people who saw this garbage.
