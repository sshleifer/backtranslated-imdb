Spoilers <br /> <br /> Well, one line summary says it all. Melville's «Le Samurai" is an original, and there are elements of "Leon". And they are better - much better <br /> <br /> In «Samurai» Alain Delon lone warrior / professional assassin who holds a bird in a cage and steal for their jobs cars (with the uncertainty in their scenes!). Even the end the same way: the samurai looking death in dignity and to get shot with an empty gun in his hand. The world has changed, he realizes there is no room for the Samurai in it. <br /> <br /> Delon Sun kills so many people, like a ghost dog. But I believe that Jarmusch like «Leon» very «Desperado» Rodriguez. Thus, he added that too. And let me guess: she becomes a professional, like a ghost dog (as Natalie Portman in "Leone») <br /> <br /> So what was Jarmusch think in the end? Where it is a unique, original idea in this film? <br /> <br /> I can not see the point in creating a carbon (celluloid) copy. <br /> <br /> A 4/10 rating on Macaulay Connor
