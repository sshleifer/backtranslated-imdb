I've seen my fair share of poorly thought-out endings and end turns to movies, but I do not remember a single movie, who committed suicide directly, like this one did. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers clearly hoping that the big turn will "surprise" all of us .... and it did, but perhaps not as directors had hoped. I left feeling surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburne and Capshaw had nothing to do with this turkey, individually or collectively. <br /> <br /> The film until the final thirty minutes it was quite interesting and I like how the story unfolds and the nature of the film as a whole. But after the turn has been found, plot holes and inconsistencies were excellent, the main motive was revenge and ill-conceived ways things so carefully designed to Bobby Earl was ridiculously far-fetched. What's worse is that after the turn found the rest of the movie was painfully predictable. <br /> <br /> Harris gave a terrific performance and Connery, Morgan Freeman is that he never gives bad performance, even if the film is not so great! So all in all, it starts well and deployment keeps the audience interested. During the last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable of the nose dive in the history of cinema.
