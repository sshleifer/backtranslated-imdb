As a rule, I have no problem with a movie or a story with an ending that leaves you interested to find out what really happened, when it's done on purpose ... <br /> <br /> But this film really feels like they got all but the last 15 minutes did we realized that they had $ 5 left end on ... <br /> <br /> I saw it on TBS ... I recommend that you do not spend money on it either. If you catch it on TV, watch everything, but in the last 15 minutes, and then go off and do your own end in your mind. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film would have been better if they had just left, and return to the State Poice just the feds, to find that the city and the car was not the cemetery, and apparently never was ... <br /> <br /> "I wish I had more fingers, so I can give this movie 4 thumbs down!"
