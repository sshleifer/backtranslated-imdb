Dear. While Chevy Chase and the gang in the SNL set new highs with the sketch show format it fails miserably at every level. Fortunately Chevy little in this at all, and can not be blamed for this complete tripe. This is serious, very, very bad. While meant to be a US political comment at the time of its release (1974), he is still not funny or keenly observed. Sketches all too long, and any satirical impact that they may have been lost as they are stretched to the point of complete boredom. It credits as the film debut of Chevy, and I am glad to say that everything he did then improve it. Avoid even if you are curious.
