First of all, this movie reminded me of the old movies I used to watch in the class of religion in school. This is not a good thing. Basically, it's just an instructive and pretentious piece of dirt, as well as the terrible "backward" series. I'm not offended religious movies ... but I take offense when these religious films were simply very bad. I just wanted to be able to say nice things about the Christian film, but it does not look like it will happen anytime soon. I bet if you gave the Bible thumpers decent budget, they would still not be able to come up with something good. Just avoid this one. In addition, the fact that the «American Family Association» (basically, lackies Reverend Wildmon c) beam of this film on their website there is another reason to get to hate me. In fact, after I looked at it, I went home and watched my copy of NC-17 David Cronenberg praised «Crash». Forgive me father, for I have sinned. Hahahahaha!
