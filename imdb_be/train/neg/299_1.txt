It was the third remake of sleep with ENIEMY After YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996) <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI was the only one that worked was the best movie <br /> <br /> DARAAR is a director Abbas Mustan, which, unfortunately, failed in their attempts here <br /> <br /> the story was good, but the treatment was not as good, and the heroine was shown too regressive and menopause has also been disappointing <br /> <br /> the direction of the music is good is bad <br /> <br /> Rishi reprises his role YAARANA (strange, who was also a remake SWTE) and looks too thick for the lead and it was good Juhi decently while Arbaaz too eager smiling in his debut and failed in many scenes, to cool the audience, but his voice was too loud horrible Johny
