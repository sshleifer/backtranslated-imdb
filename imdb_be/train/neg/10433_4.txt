The fight scenes were great. I loved the old and new Cylons and how they painted those on their side. It was the end, that I hated. I was disappointed that this land, but 150K years ago. But to travel all this way just to start all over again? Are you kidding? 38K people who fought for their existence, and as soon as they go to heaven, they refuse to technology? No way. Of course, they ate paper and rationing of food, but it's over. They can live like human beings again. They have only one good doctor. What are they going to do if someone has a sore tooth never objected to giving birth ... yeah right. No one would do this choice.
