Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Tea Leoni? Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My mouth watering. I gave up everything to watch this movie on cable. 30 minutes, I had problems to sleep. 60 minutes, and I pressed the record button, and fell asleep. I finished watching it the next morning. There should not be disturbed. What a waste of a great cast and ideas that could be an interesting story, "A Day in the Life ..." Treatment of insomnia, if you have, and watch this movie. I guarantee you at least one and a half hours of uninterrupted sleep. Dialogue terrible. Continuity does not exist. Camera work can be done manually Super 8 and looked better. <br /> <br /> This film was a complete failure.
