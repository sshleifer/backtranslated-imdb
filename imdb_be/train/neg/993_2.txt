I'm going to write about this film and "Irreversible" ((in) famous scene in it). Thus, you are warned if you have not seen the movie yet. It's just my thoughts why I think the film fails (in the end - the pun). <br /> <br /> By acting wisely, Rosario Dawson is really good and almost transports drawing almost one decade younger (teen in other words). Villain guy is good, but loses its "evil" touch right to the end. If he really never changes, why he allowed a woman to tie it? He will not, period. Then we also have a bartender / 2nd rape Dude. In fact, I do not think you will need it. At least not for 2nd rape, but more on that later. <br /> <br /> Let's repeat history. Rosarios character sexually dangerous, perhaps even lesbian tendencies (see the scene with her friend). It was not intentional, as Rosario asserts itself, but there is sexual tension between them. Rosario character meets a guy who is a sexual predator, all the bad feelings. But it makes an impression on her. <br /> <br /> Rosario said that her character was a guy before. I beg to differ. Because it acts as if it is her first boyfriend, who also emphasizes its telephone conversation with his mother. Speaking of his mother, that's another problem. Once we have the first rape, Rosarios character does not tell anyone what happened. Seiing, that her relationship with her mother is very close to one, none of this does not get examined after that. If Rosarios character will no longer call her mother to behave strangely, mother worry like crazy. It had so much potential here. In addition, her friend: We see it at the party, it is obvious there is something going on, and "boom" she went <br /> <br /> The first rape is almost unbearable to watch .. but feels like an extreme case, if you compare it with the end (rape), which feels like you get hit with a sledgehammer! After the rape there. 1 we get too elongated scene. Open topics (for example, its construction is an indication that it might be a lesbian, as one man states that have tried to get to it ...), but remained under the open sky. No real social contact is not installed, if you leave the bartender guy with participating in the 2 nd and last scenes of rape. It is obvious that he is not a "good" man and fleshed out his character's come a little bit. But if Rosarios character again meets his rapist in the class, it being in the film seems pointless. We get the point that Rosarios character is not the same anymore, that she went "bad" and can hurt people. (Too) Many scenes show that it is, her being without emotion just doing drugs and other things. Go back to # 1 rapist who cheats on a test catches the Rosarios character, and they decided to hang out together again (really?). As absurd as it sounds, the guy meets her, not without us having previously seen him with another girl (it is likely that he also raped her, though we never see anything that, fortunately), and his football car ' EASURES. Well career stretch, and he scoffs. This is an attempt to give his character some depth and almost works, but again too clich√© to stay with you. So Rapist # 1 is in Rosarios character ... why? Because he had promised her, it was her day? Again, really? A guy like that never loses control, especially with the woman he raped before ... I guess that's supposed to show us how stupid he is. The bartender guy would work, as someone who could hit him on the head or something, but allow him to imagine how it just feels wrong. Another possibility is to have the drug in his drink. <br /> <br /> So the rapist # 1 strip and get's blindfolded and let Rosarios character tie him to the bed .... seriously, it's just crazy! But further, even crazier. Firstly, she talks to him, it "closes" and it causes the object to it. It's just as hard to watch as the number one rape scene. It's not that this guy deserves it or not, it's just intense. And, of course, it was that they sought. Now, after she "made" the bartender guy comes and rapes ... Rapist # 1 If this is supposed to work as a revenge movie, it would be better if Rosarios character and herself was to do all the "revenge." Having henchman does the job, he takes everything that has been built up. <br /> <br /> It should be interesting / enjoyable, it's hard to see and it's art house. But 10 minutes (I did not count) rape scene in the end, just breaks everything. Rosarios character more or less, just watching what's going on. This brings me to the biggest disappointment <br /> <br /> Irreversible comparison :. "Irreversible" was the rape scene, but the film went on (even if it was back in time). Rosario looking into the camera, in the end, and says something about how to get about it. Firstly, it comes too late, that he must see, as she says, that after the first rape. And secondly, and most importantly, this is where the art house film was to come. It is more interesting to see if there were Rosarios character will go after the second rape scene, and how it will cope with the fact that she did. But then again, it does not actually physically do a lot (see above) ... a broken character, the film cuts ... <br /> <br /> Good Intentions (Talia and Rosario worked before), but failed to pass the majority of things they set out to do (even if you can see what they had in mind, it has to be convincing, otherwise it does not work) ... not to mention the very long scenes of violence, as they ...
