I'm a big fan of Ted V Mikels and original «Corpse Grinders» is the main reason why, but it is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Even the brilliant casting of legendary Liz Renay ( «Desperate Living») can not save this useless piece of junk. This film should serve as a lesson for all past, present and future filmmakers ... if you have a film as successful as the original «Corpse Grinders» was probably, you have to leave a sleeping dog, and you should definitely not try to revive him for more than twenty years later (if you do not have the financial backing to pull out of a superior sequel, such as Herschel Gordon Lewis made a «Blood feast 2: All U can eat") Even if you decide to do this, you should probably spend a little more money than you did on the original, and for God's sake ... never make a movie on a video ... why filmmakers even try to do it if everybody knows that quality will turn disgusting ... I personally have yet to see a film shot in such a way that even worth powder to blow it to hell ... if you can not afford to make a sequel that is better than your original film, the right to sell the movie to someone who can ... and Ted V Mikels think about (or smoking) when he wrote this god-and wful script? I mean come on, cats and dogs "alien" from another planet? Cardboard box painted to look like a destructive machine capable of crushing human bodies ... the bones and clothes and everything? If any of these actors, except Liz Renay, was paid more than five dollars for their disgusting performances than they greatly overpaid! Avoid this film at any cost and to watch the original instead.
