It was shown on the channel and the biography was just as informative as the children's comics! I gave it a 2 out of 10 for this attention to detail, because for the most part it was the 70s feel to it and the three houses that played the original three angels looked like they make so well. <br /> <br /> This was to be the biography channel biography, but it has been stripped of everything, usually / normally seen in one of their biographies. Many interviews with survivors of the actors, crew, members of the production team, etc., or their friends, family and biographers any of these people. In fact, I'm just as now many know about the program, as I did before I watched this movie, which was based on the (allegedly) biographical book. As to actually learn something that no one knew about the program and there was no total is well known, that it never happened.
