Steven Seagal .... you could be part of such a terrible movie? I rented this movie because your films usually were very clean. I lost a lot of respect for you, I am in a terrible film such as this. Very, very bad taste! I am embarrassed that I even rented the film. Stephen, if you continue to act in a movie like this, I believe that your career is over. My husband and I enjoyed watching many of your movies because you can always "get the bad guy" with a few hand maneuvers and make it clear ... and the language is rather clean in your films ... but this one is something else. I'll think twice before I rent another movie about your.
