Having in-laws over the weekend? Then this film to hasten the departure, otherwise, it will cause unconsciousness, to bring welcome relief from the constant nagging. <br /> <br /> The film is supposedly set aboard a luxury cruise liner, which is more outdated car ferry; the plot has more holes than a colander and average plaster extracted from the depths of the list celebrity D. An interesting part of the added fun playing "spot Villain», as the passengers on the ship. You can not go wrong !!!! With the help of a script, is sinking faster than a brick, the clichéd piece of kit, and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubling the blood of this film try to cover the thriller genre, thriller and Gore-Festival and at the same time do not fulfill any of them. <, Br /> <br /> A must see movie if only laugh at how bad it is.
