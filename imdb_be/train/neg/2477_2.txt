If you want to know the real story of the Wendigo, I suggest you pick up a copy of the original story Algernon Blackwell. This film was not only bad, but it has nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> I loved this book when I read as a child (in the Â«Campfire Chillers" EM Freeman) and was so excited to see a movie based on its output. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there was too much of a PC (politically correct) half a ton throughout the film, which had no place in the film. If the book was written by PC does not even exist. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is do not waste your time and money !! If you see it on the video store shelf to leave it there.
