I went into this movie thinking that it would be neat football drama (in the same vein, Remember the Titans); However, I came away feeling that I had just attended Ted Haggard preaching about ascension. The only thing that was not enough the request for acres in the end of the film. In fact, you could probably get more out of televangelists preaching than it is a bad excuse for entertainment. At least with the televangelists preaching, there is a quote from Scripture, not quotes from popularist full of himself cellulose. The plot was entirely too predictable to ensure that anyone with a long enough attention span may have posted the entire area within the first 15 minutes of the film.
