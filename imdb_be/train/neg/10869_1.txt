My friend lent this video for me, and I was pretty excited to see him, but after ten minutes of slow-pitched vocals of James Hetfield in and Lars banging his drum set in seemingly slow motion, I began to think, 'Why am I I watched it? This issue will be running through your minds at 5 ?? 10 minutes after you hit Play. I gave the cassette back in the day, as you suspect, is not worth buying or playing! <br /> <br /> Just my opinion! <br /> <br />
