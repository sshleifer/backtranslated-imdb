This is a film that tries to retelling the history of Thailand, located in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this movie, because I thought that it was modeled on many Thai movies that I watched and enjoyed, one that has a Thai actor who speak Thai and martial arts madness. Well, it does not concern it. This film was shot entirely in English, filled with English actors and production values ​​are so scary is ridiculously bad .... but it's not funny! Who can we blame for this stuff? Action, dialogue, and most of the sets were pretty bad. Some of the action scenes looked like they were choreographed local high school drama club. Special effects were mostly bad, but some of them were just cheap patch animation on the screen, especially submitted cheesy effect. He has a big, epic style open battle scene where thousands of add-ons to get to run across the field in a suit, but if we see that the two armies clash in battle - HA! Which is a joke! The film does feature a couple of beauties. It is a pity that they do not show a little more skin. At least it would be something for the boys and girls to be appreciated. Do not disturb.
