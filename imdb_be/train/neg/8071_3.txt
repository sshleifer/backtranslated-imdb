I would like to see this movie because of Eliza Dushku, but it has only a smaller part of it, and its character is not very nice. However, the main character, played by Seyzhmiller, very beautiful and perfect delight to watch throughout the film. It is in fact nothing but a showcase for her looks and talent. It does a very good job. <br /> <br /> The story itself is, at first glance, pretty pointless. After a car accident, some friends may have died, but continues to live his previous life, while all sorts of mysterious things happen. Some bad guys are after them, but we will never know who they are (perhaps they were the ones in the other car, but we are, of course, nothing about why they then can not hear them). The final scenes in particular seem filmically ambitious, but I can not get anything coherent out of it. The first scene where the bad guys (who are some strange mask) wrist cut blonde girl and collect some of her blood never explained or happen next. If the bad guys do not have to be a representation of surgeons who try to pull Cass (Sagemiller) from the dead ... but no, it does not seem to work. The bad guys are bad guys; they really just mess up a story that might have otherwise been interested. The supernatural stories about death, love and sacrifice, who the hell needs a bad guy? <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
