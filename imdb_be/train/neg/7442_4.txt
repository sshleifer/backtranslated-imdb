Unfortunately, this film does not scare me, it just annoys me. It was so frustrating when I saw the potential, and that all that fell by the wayside. Children! Father! Premonition! If so much potential and ziltch! zero should be! I've heard it all before. Scary! Nope! I scare myself alone, here where I'm sitting, than they would in the cinema. There are people who write this figure, that women should be so annoying? And? This film was quite atmospheric. Or at least it would be if the director / writer bothered to handle it. We could have a good music that would add to the tension as if someone made the effort. What I really want to know why they get the money? Just give it to me, and keep all that care. Lost? ... No, we're somewhere betrayed
