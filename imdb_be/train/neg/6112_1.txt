I was thirteen years old when I saw this movie. I was expecting a lot of action. Since the Escape from New York 16 rating in Germany, I went to the movies as a fallback. It was so boring. Then I realized that it's just crap, when the husband takes his wife. I mean, today you do it through the Internet, and you pay for instant access. This is more than 20 years ago, but I'm still angry that I'm wasting my time with this film. This soft porn for schoolchildren. After Derek stripping and painting the color - nice. But then they have to call the film After undressing and painting it.
