I've read reviews that apparently you have to be a student in a very strict British school in the 1960s, to understand it. Maybe it's true, if it is so, then this movie is outdated. <br /> <br /> ************* SPOILER ALERT ************** ************* ************* ending has the same meaning, like all children, are you anti-government and anti-corporation, not having any better solution, which is not the type of society cutter scale Mad Max. <br /> <br /> So, the main characters could get away, but they do not. The reasons they go about it does not make sense. There is not enough character development, to explain why. That shooting a bunch of innocent people should mean never explained or even hinted at. He noted that the war is the latest creative expression, it is possible only to discover that all the characters of this movie is, and it does not make any sense. <br /> <br /> characters who go on killing spree do not fight the establishment, they just kill people. I thought that they may have already used all the explosives to blow up the place, or, at least, in the sanctuary at the end of what I would have done more than symbolic meaning, but they do not <br /> <br /> TL ;. Etc. - This film is a teenage dream fight against the power that plagues them, when in fact they need. It has no moral, symbolic of truth or meaning to it; This movie just plays out fantasies of killing the teacher and the person in the "power" that annoy you. <br /> <br /> If you think that you do not like killing rampage / similar school shooting at Columbine or Virginia Tech is a rational and reasonable way to deal with teachers and institutions, then I think you'll love this film. If you're like me, and you are working in the direction to make a life for themselves, and not just blindly (very blindly into this film) rebels against the "man", this film is a juvenile and sad. <br /> <br /> You can also say, in part, that the funding was not enough, and the story seemed to be a touch of attention deficit disorder. <br /> <br /> Overall, this seems to be a very rough draft of what could have been a good film, but no effort put into the dialogue, character development, or moral, so it's just ... badly done. <br /> <br /> If ... only I could get my two hours ago.
