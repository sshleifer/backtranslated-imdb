All that could be potentially interesting sank during the first few seconds, with the proviso in the material that the events that we are going to see may never be known, and "It's a whisper [rumor] most often say" one of the most high-profile Hollywood "secrets". <br /> <br /> Good. Thus, we do not get anything new (and E! 'S "Mysteries & Scandals" gives a better foothold in the specific incident ... and it's not so much approval). What do we get? <br /> <br /> We know that Hollywood viper's nest and decadent. No big news there. More interesting, we learn that washed director prepared to do to restore its position of power in the entertainment industry and / or the political establishment. This raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich speak from their own experiences with these characters. But what he said so cynical and ugly and confused, we are left with guilt for witness heap of nonsense, which claims to be the story. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film has an interesting quality of a sudden, I found more annoying than fun. We do not empathize with someone. And a big "Citizen Kane" polishes on the relationship between Davis and a heart in a much more convincing. In "The Cat's Meow" we are never sure Davies motivations to be with Hearst. As soon as we said one thing, it makes the other. <br /> <br /> And we believe that Davis had a love for life chaplain? Or is he just trying to cockold one of the most powerful US - and perhaps stupid - citizens. The film never clarifies. <br /> <br /> With strong production values. There's also a wonderful holiday yachts and historical costumes. I got more from looking at building some of the lapels on jackets for men, than the following story, which is the instigation of many of the most famous personalities in the history of Hollywood. No one will remember that the scenario is pure fiction. Disclaimer The surrounding film just to make it all the more tentative and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Artists can not be violated, although Mekla Tilly misses parody here. Kirsten Dunst never disappoints. It gives the most sincere work in the sea chewing the scenery. Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material, but to the extent that it seems to be distancing themselves from the whole enterprise, not telling him. One of her first lines, "I'm not here!" And I'm sure she wants to, she was not. <br /> <br /> It's not on par with the poor, Bogdanovich's so bad-is-well "Finally, love." He sat on the attempt anything serious, but hesitates and stumbles mainly because it is so crowded bitterness towards the "beast" called Hollywood. This «National Enquirer» filmmaking. And it is not only spoil the names of those who place the film on board Oneida, that weekend, but the audience gets pretty dirty as well.
