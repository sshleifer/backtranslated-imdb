My God, what an incredible film it! Reminded me of so many similar scenes in Mel Gibson's film "We Were Soldiers" when "the company is not lost, they just cut off," A different scene at Pearl Harbor, when a British officer says Ben Affleck "If all Americans, just like you, then God help a nation that is at war with America! <br /> <br /> Place all 3 movies together, and you have enough garbage to fertilize all of the Sahara desert. <br /> <br /> the history of the battalion clipping can be very real, but the film could have done without all this American instructive chauvinistic propaganda attached to it. were heard groans in the theater during the aforementioned scene in Pearl Harbor (not a joke) Lost Battalion, however, it is actually in a class of its own. ?? <br /> <br /> "Americans think they are invincible ?? inspired ?? courage." I actually cringed and nearly vomited all swill be thrown away throughout this dyspeptic disasters (film, which is ) <br /> <br /> The fight scenes were well done (3 stars for this), but if the script manure wraps even in brightly colored tape, it's still manure. author James Carabatsos, also wrote those other loudmouth ?? Hamburger Hill, No Mercy, Heartbreak Ridge. Someone please shoot him before he writes any more such rubbish. <br /> <br /> Director Russell Mulcahy is an Australian too. God, shame !!!
