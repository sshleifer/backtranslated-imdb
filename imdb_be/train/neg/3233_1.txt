Come on, man, you can not be serious, yet another case of tobacco advertising, when it is not completely! It is not even remotely scary and not a terrible or indecent - it's just downright awful amateurish videowork, made for the next batch to get the girl put <br /> <br /> parched incredibly bad, even the eyes. -scene far it makes me want to puke, but only makes me want to take a camera and hit those guys in the head. She just lay rubber face, not moving at all. It would be ridiculous to use a real doll instead. <br /> <br /> One season "I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of here!" worse than this. Do not waste your time and money.
