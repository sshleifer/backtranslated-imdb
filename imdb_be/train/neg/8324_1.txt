First of all, these great actors must need money ... Surgical scenes were ridiculous .... and, of course, they need to know that people who have little knowledge of medicine would find it totally absurd ..... . Sun anesthesiologist to leave the room during a heart transplant .... and they do not do the operation in a small room, deprived of tools, equipment, heart lung and sterile techniques ... just kidding ... could not focus on the story line because all the silly scenes surgery ... no blood, no frames, and then the doctor comes the hero and take on. .. this is not a film for adults to think .... In addition, the budget should be limited ... street scenes were OK, but who was the technical advisor .... It seems he was sent to an idiot .. Save your money and wait until it comes out on DVD and do not rent it out ..
