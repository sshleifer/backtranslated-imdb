Now, do not get me wrong, I really love Christmas movies. I like its a wonderful life, and I really enjoy the version of A Christmas Carol with George a. Scott and Alastair Sim. but this film is terrible. I think I love life song ghost of Christmas present sings particularly painful. Albert Finney sings quite well in Ani. I do not know what happened to him in this movie, but it sounds as if someone is trying to sing through the mouth of the dead gerbil. the only thing that saved this film for us to shut the sound off and watch dance performances accompanied by the South Park Christmas cd.
