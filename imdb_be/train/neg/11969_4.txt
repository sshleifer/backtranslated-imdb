If you want to have fun, do not go see this movie. If you would like to see the heroism of war, do not go see this movie. If you want to see good acting and a great script, do not go see this movie. If you like the typical Hollywood war movies that end up just in time to give a politically charged appeal to the public about the majesty and glory of war GO see this movie. Otherwise, do not waste your time. I'm always interested in films about the war, because I think that if they are done well, they can give us something paradoxical about the qualities and useless war. This film shows a bunch of guys running around in the countryside, speaking whorrible clich√© line, making the most predictable things, defend the oppressed and with exactly the same force and brutality, let's depressed. This film is a shame for a film in the United States of America! Can you imagine that a man from Europe or Africa or in any other country and watching it, say it, as Americans, really? Not surprisingly, everyone hates us! Please, please, please do not waste your time on this piece of junk; if necessary, wait and rent it out. 4/10
