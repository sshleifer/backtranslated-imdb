I just got through watching the DVD at home. We love Westerns, so that my husband rented it. He started apologizing to me halfway through. Saddles, costumes, accents - all were excluded. The part that I was so mad, where the guy did not shoot "collector" with a bow and arrow, as he takes the soul of a fat guy. His only excuse was "it was only 2 left arrow." We watched it all the way through, and as someone said ... too many bad things to highlight any one reason why it sucked. I mean the fact that the boy accidentally pull out the evil of stone from the reservoir to the same month and day it was found, what's the point? And why were there the grave yard where everyone died on April 25, but people whose souls were taken from borscht before walking? If you want the movie to make fun after a few beers, it can be your film. However, if you want a real western, you will hate this movie.
