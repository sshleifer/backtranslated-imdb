What happened in the making of this film, so that ultimately the total mess that? Only one year after «The Breakfast Club», brilliant film with many of the same actors as in "St. Elmo Fire" (which, incidentally, looked and acted in the last over, they were still high school misfits from the former but without handle or discipline in drawing their role. <br /> <br /> is this really was directing or writing. as this was the same man (Joel Schumacher), it should be both. but since Schumacher times gave us the "phantom of the opera", "Phone booth," "a time to kill" and two films Batman, "Batman and Robin" and "Batman named yes ", which range from good to great directors. something went wrong," Steph, "because it has no genius at all, nor comedy is worth nothing, and very far from the mark of what is truly valuable in <br life /> <br /> Example :. character Wendy (rich girl with a heart to do good and help the less fortunate plays Mare Winningham) shows Billy (unruly slob, who cheats on his wife and her friends drink too m Uch not It has no sense of order in their lives, respectively played by Rob Lowe), that she is still a virgin. Billy really see the problem and possible conquest, but Wendy's "not ready." Wendy is actually not so ready it hard to believe that it is in this bunch of friends. Later in the story, when Billy, whose wife left him taking their child and married another somehow drawn a few lines of their lives together. Billy went to New York, desertion and abandonment of all parental responsibility for his daughter, he convinces Wendy ~ d, that her virginity would be ideal, "leaving a gift" from her to him. And Wendy, who works as a social worker helps families destroyed, it seems, will not be stopped at all this despot. Give me a break. One thing she can give only one time, it gives a loser who leaves his family and friends? Schumacher footage of this scene as beautiful and touching moment. <br /> <br /> Many more examples exist where there is a complete gap between what is real and the cost of the future thrown overboard, and acts to appear in force. <, Br /> <br /> I suppose some might say that "it was in the 80s," but I remember it was in the '80s, "that people began to take responsibility for the child, which they have adopted or in or out of wedlock. <, Br /> <br /> I think this movie is so bad, because it is out of sync with what is really valuable and right. <br /> <br /> As far as technique (not a story), it was awful as well. It is incomprehensible and feels 3:00 movie, which was edited to 1 hour and 40 minutes. Transitions and jumping during just do not make sense. Take what is on the cutting room floor, put it back and the film is likely to flow much better ... but it's still a terrible film. <br /> <br /> Maybe, Schumacher became better and stronger director since 1986 (it should be), or perhaps he was on his mind when he came to write the script for the fire of St. Elmo, or perhaps this group of actors took on the set and went their own way - that's what I really think happened.
