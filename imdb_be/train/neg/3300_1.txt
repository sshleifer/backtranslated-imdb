Very typical for this type of Swedish films. It is strange that the action was soooo bad, these actors usually give a good show. The casting was poorly done, it made you wait for something (I will not tell you that). The protagonist was awful ... I do not know where they find it. Anyway, stay away from it and go see the «Den Tredje Vågen» instead, it acts in the Swedish primary.
