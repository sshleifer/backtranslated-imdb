I'm honestly surprised Alone in the Dark. It was so bad, I could not believe what I saw. There are no characters, only a few stereotypes, wandering around and be killed. The development of the character was to give each character's name and occupation, and that's about it. There was no real story, and none of the characters did not seem to have any motivation. In fact, many scenes just started independently, proceeding out of nowhere with a pounding techno track. While I was watching this film, I went on to ask: "Where is it happening What is going on?" The action was the middle school quality drama with a rigid wooden delivery as if the actors read with a cane cards without realizing they line their problems. shipping line was even more obvious horrible sound design. ADR sounded like it was recorded in an open room. Actors are constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks, looking almost robotic in their movements. Thus, these lingering automaton slip through a series nepravdapad bnyh and intricate scenarios, often without the benefit of the transitional scenes. They were here and now they are there. This is, at the moment, what's going on. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had a lot of fun watching it. Definitely not worth it nine bucks, though.
