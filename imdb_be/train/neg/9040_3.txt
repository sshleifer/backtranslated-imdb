I agree that, although the story of Melville just might be unfilmable, it is not even worthy of the confidence to try. In order to move the story in the 20th century just resent the intention of the original story and the nature; perhaps you may have been able to move him to England, but it should be part of the period. Even our story teller - the owner - says in his memoirs, coming back even further, somewhere around 1800. By the end of the 19th century, oddly enough naughty employee will be discarded without thought. And the 20th century? Come on! Give me a break expletives deleted !!! Even around 1800, this behavior does not work well, due to the end. And the movie is over? I do not know what it was, because I did not watch the whole parody - I had to stop. It was, as the installation of "A Streetcar Named Desire" in Elizabethan England.
