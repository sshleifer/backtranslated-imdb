If there were no speeches Barry Diamond and Art Evans how ignorant Stoners, I will not have any reason to recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> The plot centers around a 10-year-old middle school reunion, which takes place in an imaginary abandon high school (more like a prop from the 1950 low budget horror flick), and rabid student classroom pulled very traumatize the prank on. This student wants to kill the whole class for revenge. <br /> <br /> John Hughes falls in love with his characters too much, since only one student was killed, as well as a dinner lady (Anne Ramsey Goonies). We are led to believe that horny combination kill, but never see the blasted thing! This is a terrible film, which went on a downward spiral National Lampoon during the 80s and 90s.
