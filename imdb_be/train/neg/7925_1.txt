You want a great recipe for failure? Take the s **** y plot, add in some weak, completely undeveloped characters and the cast is already known in the worst horror movie special effects. Let simmer for a week (the amount of time, probably generated by doing this garbage). As a result, Corpse Grinders, a film that makes bad movies dangerous and exotic lowlands. <br /> <br /> The film is completely blown. My words can not tell you how it hurts to watch. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of. This is not a Plan 9 from Outer Space. It's a long, boring, boring waste of time. Corpse Grinders II is the biggest waste of energy and talent I've ever seen. I submit myself when I realize that people actually took time out of their lives, to act this shit, if you can call it acting. But than again, if you have a bad direction, bad storywriting, bad everything dramatic is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This film is like a huge, disgusting piece of shit that you crave to quickly get rid of the existence of fear that a friend or loved one might somehow see. I really with I could somehow destroy all copies of the film, so it will not pollute the minds of first-time filmmakers. Thank you, Ted V. Mikels, for giving me a new found respect for each movie I've ever seen. You have shown me that this is really terrible, and why I have to evaluate all those movies that just cheesy or boring.
