* Spoliers * not read any further if you have not seen this movie <br /> <br /> Picking up after depressing "Phantasm IIÂ» has ended; Tall Man kidnaps Mike, while Reggie and the new kid Tim spend most of the rest of the film trying to get it back, and do not end up as slaves to the highest person in the "Red Planet." This one gets really silly: thieves trio in hot pink hearse were only there for comic and karate black chicken (can not remember her name) was so annoying, I could not wait to see if the Tall Man killed her character. This one sets it almost look like it will be Tim's character, which comes at the end, and, ultimately, is a hero, but ... it's not quite work out that way. Until the end of the story, Liz felled killer midgets, Mike gets a silver sphere implanted into the skull, and the scope to get Reggie gnomes get Tim, and there is not left to stop the tall man alone. The bad guy wins - now, as it's a surprise twist at the end <br /> <br /> It was filmed in 1993 and unreleased until '95, and the end of this one was at the time of the final, and although it is frustrating and It is disappointing it was also relevant and appropriate ending for this amazing little series. But the fourth change is the ending and adds nothing new, but more bad jokes and even worse and senseless ending ... <br /> <br /> * 1/2 to ****
