The film without conscience. Drifter agrees to kill a man for the gunman with money. Then they double cross him. At the same time, he falls in love with the wife of the deceased, and, without her knowing that he was a killer, moves along with it. Then he "accidentally" kills her when she finds out. Then, in the walking kind of heroism, he gets revenge on the gangsters who double-crossed him. The first problem is that, by agreeing to take over the murder on the instructions of the lease, the vagabond loses his sense of sympathy, dignity and heroism. We can not accept any good in it, and, as a consequence, the rest have no moral center. We simply can not take care of that kind of guy. A wife (well played Fetching Kari Wuhrer - sheriff in Attack of spiders), high-class lady who runs a mission for the homeless, as well lose a degree of sympathy by jumping straight into bed with a homeless vagrant (despite its apparently weakened state after her death husband). And when she finds out that he's a guy ?? what it does? She locks him in her house (as if all the houses were castles, you can not be opened from inside) with her and proceeds to scold him. Stoo-PID. George Wendt, however, is terrific in the role of the brawny thug. Directed by Stuart Gordon made it a lot better with the RE-animator and DAGON.
