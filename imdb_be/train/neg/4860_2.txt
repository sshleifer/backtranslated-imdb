Terrible, terrible TV show! Why does Comedy Central decided to repeat the old episodes of this program is beyond me. It really sucks! I, of course, talking about the season after the first two. The first two seasons were gold, and if I were just talking about the seasons, the show would get eight out of ten stars. None of the comedians that appear after the first two seasons, which were not part of the original cast entirely nothing good. They were, and terrible. Comedy is not funny. AT ALL !!! <br /> <br /> original cast was full of talented comedians like Artie Lange, Phil LaMarr, and Mary Schorr (or whatever her name is), all of which were supposed to get better deals after they left the MAD TV . This show is highly overrated, and less worthy of your channel surfing time than Saturday Night Live, another awful show. Go out on a Saturday night and have fun, and leave MAD TV wither and die, as it deserves.
