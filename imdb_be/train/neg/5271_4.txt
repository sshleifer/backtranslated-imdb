Squabbling, American family vacationing on the west, discovering a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. Little do they know that it is a ghost town once was a testing ground for nuclear bombs, and the presence of death chasing them. In general, I like horror movies, a mystery like this. "Cube", Spielberg's "Duel" and "Birds" all great examples of films that do not give any answers, but nevertheless, we are interested in and leave wanting more. Apparently, the "disappearance" of writer / director Walter Klenhard tried to do just such a film, and whether it will be or could not be up to the viewer. I personally think he got about halfway there, the movie just sunk. <br /> <br /> The actors all kinds of just a "ho-hum". They were not particularly bad, but we as the audience never really feels their fear, and they react to the situation in unrealistic ways. Does anyone else really SICK characters just came out from investigating strange noises?!?!? At least give them some sort of excuse for this!?!?!? <br /> <br /> As far as made-for-TV movies go, it's above average fairly accurately. Director Klenhard It should really be commended for milking in the desert for all proposed and some settings were incredible. There's a really cool scene where two characters find old nuclear test site was the sand was completely melted glass as far as the eye could see. Interestingly, when it was really ?? <br /> <br /> A lot of gore to speak, and "creatures" ?? or anything, hell, that's what it is after these people ?? never shown, not to mention the fact that we had never even given a real key to understanding that they (the mutants, aliens, ghosts and evil spirits of ancient Indian ?? Oh, it really narrows it down for us!) or come from where . <br /> <br /> There are a lot of clichés here, too. Why is it that the city-folk in these kinds of movies are always very, very stupid? Why always the old guy everyone thinks is crazy, that is correct? Why? Why? Why? How about a new scenario, people! <br /> <br /> «disappearance» is trying to be different and clever, but ultimately not that in many ways it is very familiar to us amateur straight to video horror fodder. Hey, I've seen a lot worse movies, and disappearance is not bad, it's just too ?? Avg. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
