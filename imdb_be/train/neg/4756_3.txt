1972 remake wonderful stage performance, beautiful casting Caine as the nemesis of the character from the first film. But doing nothing good at all. <br /> <br /> parr under performance of the actors, the rights and Kane, diluted further weak self-indulgent direction. <br /> <br /> The heat setting in the original felled for ultramodern homesetting. The subtle interaction between Olivier and Caine, who made the first film so watchable, is replaced by an unpleasant, insolent arrogance, which instantly breeds contempt in the viewer. But it's not smart to-ing and froing taste one or another original character advances as well, it is obvious OTT character assassination as a character from the word go. <br /> <br /> This version detective would not have to look, to see the original film, and be dazzled by heating.
