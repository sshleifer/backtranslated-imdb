I think we all start a lot of reviews, "This would make a great movie." Crazy former prisoner recently appeared, neat suburban home his goal. Revenge, revenge, manipulation. ordinary masonry Marty on Karo syrup. But, unfortunately, somewhere in Universal's high-altitude memorandum gone. Each ham it <br /> <br /> Nolte says only with the eyebrow, Lange bitch their way through the cigarette, Lewis! «Ohmagod in" her way though her scenes, and Bobby D ... Well, he's on a completely different magic carpet. Referring to a kind of Cajun / Huckleberry Hound hybrid accent, he chomps fat cigars and giggle at random crimes such as "Heavy baby." And I want you to imagine the emphasis mentioned above. Now imagine that beating brain-jangling religious rhetoric in the upper volume as he swallowed six Bibles, and you have a feature De Niro here. The most distracting of all, however, is its most exaggerated use of «De Niro face" because he made fun of for. squint your eyes, forehead crinkled, lips curled. Crimany, Bob, you look like Plastic Man. <br /> <br /> seen, began the story behind the scenes 14 years ago, when Nolte could not spare time in De Niro bighouse for various attacks. After his release he feels misrep Nolte about it then warrants terrorize him and his family. And we have to give the character De Niro small passage because Nolte withheld information that might have shortened his sentence. De Niro is one of those criminals who, despite the fact the perpetrators of heinous acts, feel their captivity justifies continuation of such acts on the outside. Mmm-Coy. <br /> <br /> It comes after almost hostess Notle (in a scene some may want to turn away from), his wife, his daughter, the family dog, I know. Which is one of the shortcomings of the script Strick: complete predictability. Since each of the claims De Niro becomes more terrible, you can pretty much call the remaining steps before it happens. Strick is completely discredited, because it controls several exciting dialogue-driven moments (De Niro and shabby exchange Lewis in an empty theater is the best scene of the film), but mostly it's all over-crank. cartoon photographic approach Scorsese comes off as forced, not to mention the horribly outdated processed Bernard Hermann accounts (I kept waiting for people-wolf to show genetically enhanced tarantula). <br /> <br /> Thus, we come to the comedy of the film. Unwittingly comic, that is. You know those scenes where something terrible happens graphics, but you can not help but giggle out of sight of others? You'll do it here. Nolte and Lange clucking about infidelity, thumb courtship De Niro, he was dressing, kitchen and sliding on a certain matter, which must be seen to believe. And Bob infernal, continuous, constant mind damaging, sun end in sight unreliable braggart all "philosophy» disovered he was in prison. I wanted to kill him, to shut him up more to keep this annoying family. <br /> <br /> I always hate to borrow ideas from other reviewers, but here it is necessary. this really * is * Scorsese version of Freddy Krueger. the manner in which De Niro relishes, said tails, stand the pain until his jokes, Vintage Freddy after pot of scalding water thrown:. "you are trying to" offer sumpin 'fumes in his eyes? "Please. This is just one example. <br /> <br /> If you were not a fan of the original one thousand nine hundred sixty-two Flick and want the thrill of seeing Balsam, Peck and Mitch almost 30 years later (or wants a serious head shaking film experience), to avoid a trip to the Cape.
