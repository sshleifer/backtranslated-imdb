Remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood, because he made great movies? These days to feel more and more distant memory. <br /> <br /> While "Hollywood Homicide" is not in any way afraid it routine and surprisingly boring buddy cop movie. It's a comedy, which is not particularly funny, and the film is not particularly interesting. Oversupply podagovorami can not mask the weakest of the central storyline. <br /> <br /> Ford, at least, it seems to have enjoyed himself more than his last few projects, and it can carry a movie most of the time. Hartnett is adequate, but he and Ford did not quite Newman and Redford, as far as chemistry is concerned. <br /> <br /> In general, "Hollywood Homicide" is a pretty fun diversion, but only slightly. Take Ford, and it's not even that.
