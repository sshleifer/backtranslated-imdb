Think no-budget version of the Chinese syndrome in student directed the film, which idolizes John Woo, and you get the «Power Play». The idea was good, but the execution, acting and dialogue is absolutely killed it, not to mention the ridiculous number of sequences of violence and natural disasters, which have been used to compensate for the lack of substance and the development of the more interesting parts of the film. <, Br /> <br /> This is the story the reporter is investigating the disappearance of three members of the guerrilla group of activists, who mysteriously disappeared without a trace after they broke into the offices of power, which is suspected of having rabies causes earthquakes. Rather unceremoniously reporter, going against what was supposed to be more ruthless bunch Execs companies prosecuted by the city (along with what he says) to "clear" all the convincing evidence can remain factory faults. <, Br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no real sense of emergency, as the characters interact with a lot of indecision, combined with idiotic dialogue and a lot of hardcore action. Not to mention, the viewer, who can draw only in the movies, because the action genre appeal, forced to endure the mounting number of bodies and a ridiculous amount of violent shoot-em-ups, plus earthquake scenes. The trick has been put in the wrong place, to blame for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that should be promoted history. It may have been much better if the filmmakers focused more on the thriller, and paid more attention to the development aspects of the corruption of the story. Terrible villains, a naive journalist, and those who try to prevent the reporter from the wrong actions in motion. This is a pattern, but at least it would have been interesting.
