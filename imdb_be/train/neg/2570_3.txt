I read that "There's a girl in my soup" was released in the low period of Peter Sellers's. Watching the film, I'm not surprised. Almost nothing happens in the film. It would seem that the very presence of sellers and Goldie Hawn movies should help; he does not. The entire film, it seems that they just randomly shooting everything that happens without anything scenarios. Maybe I have not seen every movie about a middle-aged to elderly people trying to be a hippie, but this one gives these films a pretty bad name. <br /> <br /> In general, both sellers and Hawn indicated in much better than the movie it is, so do not waste your time on it. Pretty useless.
