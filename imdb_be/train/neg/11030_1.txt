I recently watched the film at the festival 30'Th Gothenburg Film, and to be honest, it was at the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to watch. Do not get me wrong, there are fun and entertaining bad movies (eg «Manos ?? Hands of Fate"), and then have terrible bad movies. (This one falls into the latter category). The cinematography was incredible, and not in a good way. He felt that the operator deliberately kept everything out of focus (except gratuitous nipple shots), the lighting was something between "one guy running around with a light bulb" and "non-existent". The actors were so bad, like soap actors, but not as bad as porn actors, and the impression that each line was a complete surprise to them. Only a softening mask was the look of a killer, classic look a la Jason Voorhees from the "Friday in 13'Th». The plot was very poor, and ending even worse. I would only recommend this film, who need an example of how the horror film should not be similar or maybe insomnia need to sleep.
