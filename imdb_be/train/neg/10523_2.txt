During the first forty minutes, the Empire does form itself up: it seems to be strong, confident, and relatively unknown gangster flick. While I do not know why, I thought it was good- but now I do. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with this film, it is purely and absolutely disgusting. I do not mind movies with loonies and things to prove dot take Jackie Brown, for an application, but they are all so terribly shallow in this, but this is obviously thrown in for fun. You literally feel a knot in your stomach pull. Another important issue is the main character. He was smug, arrogant, yet- ironically enough- not so bad. He does not seem tight enough to be with the business woman killer drug. The fact is, in the end, this film is completely pretentious. Nha slippery, sun smart, just bored, and meaningless- this colossal mess to be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> * ***** with (1 of 5)
