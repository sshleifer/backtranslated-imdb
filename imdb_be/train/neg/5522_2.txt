I searched for the right words to describe this film. At first I was inclined to just skip to the more important issues, such as the film does not rise to a decent standard comment. <br /> <br /> However, I stopped, wondering how to describe things and more intrigued by the challenge presented by the question: "What can I say about this movie" Rubbish? No, this is not garbage, garbage can be recycled into something useful. Greenhouse gases? Nope, it is not a greenhouse gas, greenhouse gases help plants grow big and healthy. <br /> <br /> And finally, I hit the "not bad," Customize the phrase "not so" is sometimes used to describe the theory in theoretical physics, which is hopelessly flawed and not even worthy of correction. That's it then, Georgia rule is not even bad.
