I had the pleasure of watching this film early, and I must say that I thought it was going to be boring and ask, how could they ever improve in version 1984 Bachelor starring Tom Hanks, which I thought was very well ... I was right ... to be honest, I thought it might be better ... of course, there were some funny moments, but it just did not seem to hit the mark with me ... Action was OK, and the story is quite well the original, but I think it could be much better ... this film, I would say that the approach BT and young hearts; full of women's bodies, alcohol, and sex ... It's just another typical run of the mill party movie that has been made over and over again. 4/10 my voice to this.
