It is strange that this film is one of my hitlists after all. This is by far the number 1 worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I have not only never been so sad before (thankfully, no more than 1.5 hours), pre-teens attempted humor that the function is not even close to getting, but one of the corners my mouth is slightly tilted. After a very uncomfortable first hand, you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least a little bit better. You hope in vain, it only goes downhill from there. <br /> <br /> The film has no story worth talking about in general, and repeats this non-story three times. One can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of the film will be lost forever, and Trent Harris never puts his hands on the camera ...
