Um, please forgive me, but there were no more than half of the signs is not enough? In the original novel, Valjean is the man jailed for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread, and then tries several times to escape. He breaks parole and is pursued relentlessly by Inspector Javert the police. Along the way there are a lot of characters that were not in this version. Some of the worth to mention Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche, and Enjolras. The only character with the same name Javert. I was confused and frustrated throughout the film, trying to understand how it was in any way connected to the epic novel by Victor Hugo.
