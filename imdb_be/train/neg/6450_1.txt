Well, this film is surprisingly awful. I felt sorry for the actors involved in this project, because I'm sure that they did not write their own line. That sometimes comes with a touch of sarcasm, that lead me to believe that they did not take this film seriously and would not anyone who is watching this hideous monster from the hit slasher. While viewing this «Creature Unknown» I could not help but think that it was not a big budget or a competent author on the crew. But, if you go to watch it for a laugh, you will be happy, the film shameless to mock myself because I can not see how anyone could look at it and is proud of the pump it directly to DVD cliché wants to be a thriller / horror movies fightfest to light.
