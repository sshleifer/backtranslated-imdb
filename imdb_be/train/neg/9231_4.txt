I went into this movie thinking it's going to be the next clerk but left feeling let down. Humor was weak, and the characters are rather flat. That is not to say that everything was bad, the idea of ​​love in the grocery store seemed quite fruitful material, but the director has switched focus to cliche'd «save mom-and-pop store from the evil corporation guy." I felt as if he had just stuck with the familiarity of the plot, he would come back with a much more memorable film. Now, to make the validity of the movie, I'm from Rochester and loved how he portrayed Webster. In fact, the best Kevin Smith (Clerks) celebration here give props to his hometown. Webster, New York is that the order Red Bank, NJ is a clerk. The director wisely threw in the date on Nick Tahou years. Believe me, as far as things to do in Rochester, garbage plate at the top of the list. I was lucky enough to see this film in Little in Rochester, so that everyone knows when an ode to the city came and appreciated them.
