I've seen some bad films (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this film is so horrible, so boring that I got about half way to the end and could not look at anything else. Sorry. With talent like Kenneth Branagh, Davidtz and Robert Duvall and John Grisham novels, what went wrong? Bran is a big time lawyer who has a one night affair with Davitz. Her father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hanged her cat, etc., etc., so that Branagh was sent to a psychiatric hospital, and he quickly runs away. Somehow (I could not figure out how), Robert Downey Jr., Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger all mixed into a story that moves slower than stationary. I wanted to like it, and being a big fan of Grisham, read all about this film, and I (foolishly) expecting something interesting. This is honestly the worst film I've seen so far, and I would like to have your money refunded. * Since *****.
