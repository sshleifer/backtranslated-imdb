Where it buried very deeply in this film at the halfway decent movie trying to get out. Only a few traces of the early scenes in Los Angeles (in the bar and the cemetery), and then a few pieces of production design. As I say, I buried very deep. One of the biggest problems faced by movies with supernatural, how to react to the characters believable in improbable situations. Annie McEnroe reaction to being told that her sister (presumably Dee Wallace from the first film) (was?) a werewolf when I remember, along the lines of; "Really?". Not one of the best responses to the call said. Non sequitirs continue, as the story moves to Trannsylvania searching Stirba (apparently self-appointed) "Queen of the werewolves." As Stirba, Sybil Danning is two of the best things in the film. So, even better than group sex scene shifter acting Reb Brown, and surprisingly monkey looking werewolf costumes. End loans acquired the status of a minor legend and are available in all its glory (at least until the censor does not find them) on Youtube. Check them out to see why, and remember that the whole movie makes about as much sense. If you happen to catch it on American television credits have been edited to replace the endlessly repeated shot Dunning ripping off her top with another endlessly repeated shot it did not explode cloak only this time she has something on top of the under, It is a kind of absurdity, the cherry on top of the time which defies satire.
