... and even then, even they can live without seeing him. To be honest, this film (if one has deigned to call it that) is really only of interest to the bondage freaks. Bettie Page fans will learn absolutely nothing new (and I mean * anything *), and they will not enjoy the warm pussies to feel something familiar, loved, and cherished. <br /> <br /> Nevermind unfathomable scenario, wood, less than a community theater actor, a complete lack of direction, Freestuff lighting, or any of the other values ​​of industrial discounted. This, of course, "Hey, kids, let's make a movie!" Movie-making lower order. I think we can be grateful that they at least knew how to run the camera. No, I'm sorry to say that none of this has relevance, why this thing is so right * wrong *. <br /> <br /> This is wrong, because the young lady plays Bettie Page, several gorgeous girl whose only resemblance to Queen curves dark hair and bangs on the mark, it is not able to bring something to the role of willingness to be bound and gagged. This, obviously, it is good for film career before and after this excess miserable, but not for the excess miserable, which consists essentially of numbers reproduced loving B & D Set-pieces sandwiched between awfully terrible pseudo-biographical scenes delimitation Ms. Page's fall from grace (so to speak). There's actually probably more about itself, about Page's life in the opening and closing credits, than the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled. It is not worthy companion film «The Notorious Bettie Page." This is not worthy of the film at all. This fetish part, which trades on the charm of one of the largest contact windows of all time, and does so without class, without style, without any real sense of understanding the nature of Bettie Page in general. No true fan of Bettie Page does not find that it is nothing but disappointment, I guarantee. <br /> <br /> Avoid any price. If free, remember that time is money, too. Your may not be worth it, but I bet it's worth what you're sorry for what you have spent time with this. That is, I did, you've been warned.
