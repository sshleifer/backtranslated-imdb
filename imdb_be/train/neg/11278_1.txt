this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made, and is a damning indictment on not only the British film industry but talentless hacks at work today. Not only is the film to get a dominant spread it also has a good cast of British actors, so what went wrong? I do not know, and I just do not care enough to engage with the debate, because the movie was so horrible that does not deserve any thought at all. be warned and stay away from this garbage. but apparently I need to write ten lines of text in this review, so I could also detail the plot. man bump configured to evil friend and colleague of his father's company, and therefore leads to a meeting with the Russian mafia and quirky accents and stupid, very stupid plot twists / devices. I had to ask for their money back, but was probably still in shock from the experience. if you want a good detective movie to watch the usual suspects or compadre, how about a castle .... shares of peak contemporary British crime film .....
