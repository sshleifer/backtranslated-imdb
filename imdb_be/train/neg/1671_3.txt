I saw it on the market at the Cannes Film Festival. Sun <br /> <br /> This is a real cheapie sight - nothing wrong with that, but you have to make up for it with a small amount of blood, sex or baked, or both. <br /> <br /> Think Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> Sean Young interesting actor - well done to the manufacturers to connect it I think <br /> <br /> The first scene in a spacecraft descending cheerful. - You could imagine all the crew hands shaking it around! <br /> <br /> Haha, - but I want the people who made it well - at least, it's not pretentious.
