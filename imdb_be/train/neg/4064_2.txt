This film is very sad, he tells a story about the owner of a gas station and a female of her life. Nothing exciting ever happens. The director really "keep it real" and he feels the same way as the camera follows a woman about how she lives her life. I had to watch other movies of this director to class, others were not so sad. This film was also observed for concessions ... better be worth boringness with good !! In general, if it is not required, do not watch the movie. But do not ignore the other films of this director, because they are not so bad ... and does not devalue other films about Africa, they are usually good, especially when done by Western director.
