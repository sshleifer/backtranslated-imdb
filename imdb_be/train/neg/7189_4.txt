What a complete disappointment! The price here on 6,1 IMDb built some moderate expectations, but, my God, I was disappointed. The first thing that bugs me the Braindead, stereotypical university kids. Yes, I know that teenagers can be a child, and so on, but for some reason they are always displayed in films like Braindead complete morons? There was one sign, which I thought was good, but he / she has (without opening it here) was killed the way through. The remaining characters are poorly implemented and even imaginary hero / heroine is simply not do it for me. On the positive side: The plot is quite good and the setting value is higher than the cut for this kind of movie. Action was generally not very good, Rutger Hauer stands in a small role. But all this can not be a soothing and Braindead signs. You just stop worrying about them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and then be generous).
