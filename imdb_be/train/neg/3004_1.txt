What a terrible movie. The acting was bad, was bad walks, film was bad, was bad direction, the "special" effects were bad. You expect a certain degree of hazard in the slasher, and even murder were bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the past event that has created the motive for the killing went on for 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could have removed 80% of them, and explained that he was good enough. <br /> <br /> Then the victims were invited to a "reunion" in an abandoned school, which until now has been all utilities included. One of the victims thought it was a bit strange, but they rejected it and decided to break in any case. <br /> <br /> And finally, the murder was so fake that virtually unwatchable. <br /> <br /> There's no reason to watch this movie if you do not want to see some breasts, and the chest is not very good at it. This film makes Showgirls virtually indistinguishable from Citizen Kane.
