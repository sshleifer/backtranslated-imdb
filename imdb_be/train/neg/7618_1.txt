This is not a movie. It's not a talent. It is not informative. It's not scary. It's not interesting. This is not anything at all. <br /> <br /> I got it because my cousin says, «Diablo! COOL! »Yes, it is. The only thing cool about this experience was the only fact that I did not buy it, but rented it instead. <br /> <br /> He shot like a bad soap opera. Do not wait. Soap operas, at least look professional ... Variety. This? It looks like it was shot with someone's camera. This is terrible! Miserable! It SUX. <br /> <br /> cinema disgusting! Who is this director anyway? I do not even care enough to look it up. He stinks! These performances of these poor unsuspecting actors were much better than this shit festival deserve. <br /> <br /> 2.6 / 10 in the "B" scale. <br /> <br /> It registered about 0.3 / 10 on a scale of "A" from ... <br /> <br /> enemy 's :.
