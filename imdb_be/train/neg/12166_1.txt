Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes, it is related to Bruce), the killer from the first film, to her old tricks again. She is one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills. While the girls in the camp is good and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing things okay. But a few steps over the line and kill them Angela - cracking hoaxes all the way <br /> <br /> The original «Sleepaway Camp» was vicious and nasty splatter but has some good points to it .. It's a vicious and nasty, too, but not It has good points to it. The plot has been done to death, and it does not add anything new to the formula. There are many bloody murder here (people burned their heads cut off, Throat slashed), but all the gore is so obviously fake is really getting ridiculous. It also has the least amount of campers I've ever seen, and almost all are too old for his role (especially Higgins). As you might expect, there are gratuitous female nudity (here is extraordinarily mediocre Valerie Hartman has) and always a good girl / boy a good team (Rennes Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the sole exception of Springsteen and Higgins lousy acting - even a shredder cinema standards. There's also a hard edge of this film, in which one character is drowned in the toilet! Boring and patients with blunt plot, pointless nudity and bad baked blood. Skip it.
