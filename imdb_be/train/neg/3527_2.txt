I had to see it because it looked like a big scary premise- prisoners find a magic book, oo er! claustrophobic fear comes, etc. <br /> <br /> but it does not seem to be a story to go along with a great idea. instead of cooling / physcological horror, it relied on the effects performed in an open fire and OTT horror- body that did not scare at all, if your over 12. <br /> <br /> The logic at the end of funny characters to be killed by anything other than Bodycount. waste of good characters-, which were the best thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously, low-budget, which does not spoil it, the film is really going nowhere, and, believe them, preventing going to say this- it needed a Hollywood remake. you just lose interest in this version. certainly not in the same league as the other French films coming out over the last few years, as the crimson rivers that were at least watchable / entertainment, malefique entirely watchable up to the end, to be honest. and I'm sure you can guess the ending before you watched the movie. really really disappointing- impossible to recommend.
