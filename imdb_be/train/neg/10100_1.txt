usually I support independent art, and I try to be very inclusive and tolerant ... I tend to support everyone, because their efforts are ... <br /> <br /> but this film is simply removed from all understanding and tolerance! border <br /> <br /> Imagine this situation: <br /> <br /> 1. really think about the worst horror film you've ever seen in my life so far. <br /> <br /> 2. think about a large, attractive ART for DVD-boxes, that this film ... and a promising story ... <br /> <br /> 3. voila! You got ZOMBIE NATION. <br /> <br /> only see if you really are not anything else better to do. Nothing better.
