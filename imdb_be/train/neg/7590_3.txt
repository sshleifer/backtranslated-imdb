Excellent body, gorgeous colors and camera work, pretentious dialogue, hackneyed plot. Name diva, Camilla and flowers of the same name, which appear often enough to remind us of the scene similarity with Dumas novel La Dame aux Camelias, cinema Camilla starring Garbo and (I think), Robert Taylor, and last but not least opera Verdi's La Traviata. Beautiful, not too virtuous lady, outcasts for one reason or another, love, broke up, reunited just in time to die from tuberculosis in the last scene ... One simply banal scenes and silly unreal dialogue in opera, but why waste Hayak Don Sutherland, a beautiful rendition of Los Angeles in the 30s, a deus ex machina earthquake that conveniently kills another woman, and all that beauty on this ordinary turkey, where not even a beautiful singing?
