One of the more "literateÂ» Lone Stars, with time spent on character development and interaction, dialogue and acting business. The opening scene sets the stage (literally) for gamblers persons Kansas Charlie (Eddie Chandler) and his friend, John Scott (John Wayne) Rodeo (say, Ro-Day-oh) Star, both of which are more lustful . Film their adventures as they try to best each other in pursuit of the Mexican Juan, and then in their quest for a perky Mary Kornman, which has a necessary evil brother (though he was allotted the real villain and wants to repent). And, of course, they are wrongfully accused of two crimes, and must serve a prison sentence to escape and be relieved of the responsibility in the end. <br /> <br /> The culmination of Scott constantly and deliberately staring example of Mary in her grocery store, and throwing away the ladder it is on so that he can catch her and grab her when she falls. It all seems a bit modern for 30s western, but it sounds better than it actually is. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the gripping elements of the actions that we find in many other Lone Star sorely lacking here. How many Kanatt. Cheap and bad use of footage of horses falling riders. A lot of George Hayes. Stooge sad, as the bi-play between Scott and Charlie, Charlie swinging on Scott, Scott stomp on his foot, and then pierce it (repeated two more times!). Specialist Paul Fix underloaded. Himself Eddie Chandler, behold, he was a big star turn, not very believable as side impact Randy. The villain looks too old and fat. Just Chandler, who spent his later career in more than 300 films as credits roll. Mary Kornman, twenties "Our Gang" (see "Mary, Queen of the Small" 1925) cute in her scenes with John Wayne, but that to do so. Seeds best western buried here. <br /> <br /> P.S. Ultra-painted version, which looks good, moves so fast, it's all over, if you blink a few times. Fortunately, though, uncomfortable scene with Eddie Chandler were reduced.
