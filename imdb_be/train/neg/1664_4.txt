This film is quite interesting due to the excellent performance of Virginia Madsen and the fact that Lindsay is an excellent Hon. However, the reason why the movie is so predictable that we have seen it all before. I have not read the book a gift mother, but I hope for the sake of Britney and Lynne Spears is completely different than the movie. Except for the ending of the film so that, in fact, a music video, the original idea, the entire film resembles the word plagiarism.
