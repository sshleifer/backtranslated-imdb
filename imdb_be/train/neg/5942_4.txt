If this should be the black experience, let me on the front or back door. <br /> <br /> A boy mom one day to see the 2 young hoods walk and since then it's all down hill for him, Angela Bassett, one brilliant mercy in this film plays it over a protected, religious mother. Despite her anger at the way his life has become, in the middle of the picture, it really decides to accept it. It allows your friends to come in and suddenly it all right to use profanity as long as it is not in the presence of children. <br /> <br /> This is a sad state of affairs in the field of gangster rap. You know where this film is headed. <br /> <br /> I just laughed, when in the end, when Bassett accompanies her son's body for burial, she argues that while his life was cut short at the age of 24, he became a man. What man? He was convicted of a criminal, he wrote the most disgusting rap constant vulgarity and contempt for society. The scene in the classroom, where he says that the teacher, as a sanitation worker, he will earn more than the teacher is an excellent example of what is happening in our schools. Complete and total lack of respect for the teacher. <br /> <br /> East Coast, West Coast rap gang rivalry was never fully explained. All that we see the gun. <br /> <br /> terrible picture does not do anything to prevent gang violence. What a terrible role models, these rap artists and their music foul. African-American community should be offended by their existence. Who was that fat slob classless, which reflected Biggie? He Rerun from old TV shows seem thin in comparison. I know that it was on the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant, who changed the chubby little boy in the vulgar monster that he was. What a sorry state of affairs, if this is a movie called entertainment.
