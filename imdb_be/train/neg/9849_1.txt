This is one of the worst films I have ever seen *! This is bad, even at the level of standards of TV Movie. The plot is fiendishly shortcomings, and well-known names in this film waste to be confused, uncertain characters. I do not know how the director managed to save this excuse of the film together - it's that bad. Billed as «Psychological Horror Thriller» - this is, of course, terrible. There's nothing fascinating about it. And it can make you a psychological harm! The first opening stage held such promise - the possibility of landing on a soul just an aspect of the brain, but also the utter carnage that followed the car crash scene goes beyond faith. No matter how hard you try, you could not care less about the characters. There are so many watered ideas that the film in the best case, a collage of disjointed phrases of Chinese philosophers, and in the worst case, the film will actually make you go Brain Dead! <br /> <br /> I bought more than 300 films on DVD, and this is the first one I'm going to get your money back. Stay away.
