... ill be intentionally bad ... <br /> <br /> This little gem shot straight to the big screen MST3K. Although it is obvious that the film does not attempt to be taken seriously (I hope that their aim, anyway ...), the film is still clearly bad. Hell, it does Leprechaun In Space looks great budget ... <br /> <br /> In short: Paint my muscle car prunes color!
