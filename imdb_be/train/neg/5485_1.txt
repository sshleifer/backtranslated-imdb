Without repeating what has been said above about the movie, I would like to add that I can not wait to watch this movie ... cast / location and outstanding work directed by Michael Winterbottom, etc ... It was a vague shadow " Do not look Now "on the storyline from the beginning. Stay in a variety of settings (Italy again) to darken the grief of loss ... or perhaps that's how I see him? So why I was sitting there, waiting for the story to unfold and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign country in Europe .... and I sat there and sat there .... and guess what? nothing really happens! and I do not mean anything !! You do not even given the chance to get into the characters as they are so one-dimensional and vacuous..You make believe with the pace of the film, something must have happened to make the entire film upside down ... the older daughter flirting with the local boys, the Vespa, had a great opportunity to take the film in another direction, is the younger daughter of a vision of her dead mother eventually be fruitless and pointless, parents attempt to seduce one of his students felt ridiculous, given his age. He felt as if the script was the last review made where they have decided in the last minute in order to eradicate any ulcer history and went down the peel to a minimum any effect. If credits are rolled (suddenly) you can not help but feel robbed time spent sitting, watching the pile of garbage.
