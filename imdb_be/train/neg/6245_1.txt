The only thing that "An Inconvenient Truth" shows that Al Gore still an idiot. These "raw feel", experts are indisputable, as the answer to their senseless hypothesis is usually lower than the actual science. Basically it is a pseudoscience people. The largest source of greenhouse gases - CO2 - is people, we breathe it, and if you're not ready to start sacrificing your brothers to save the world, there is not a darn thing to do. We heard how the world is going to end as a result of people for more than 50 years. Fools publish a timeline for their end of the world, and when the time goes by, nothing happened. "An Inconvenient Truth" is just another vehicle by which cunning fraction of American society can sell their food. <br /> <br /> And, as Al leaves tobacco business because of his sister's death from cancer, that is the load too. Al could not run his farm better than he could run the country. He loses money for the operation, because he did not want the farmer, when he could make more $ on speaking tours. The only thing that global warming is undeniable is the hot air produced by this gas bearing!
