If a friend gave me a boxed set of "12 Amazing Scifi / Horror film" I understand a little bit careful. But, as the item was a gift, I do not actually pay my common sense a lot of attention. After all .... movies for free! So if they are a bit ropey. After much deliberation, Alien Intruder was the first of those films. Ironically, it was the first choice because it looked the best of the bunch. All I can say is, if this is the best of them, I shudder to think that everyone else is like. <br /> <br /> On the surface, it was a few good things going for it. Four (count them!) The actor that I was familiar with. Billy Dee Williams, Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conaway. I said to myself ... "Billy and Tracy was some good SciFi (Star Wars and Babylon 5, respectively), so they will not sign up for a turkey. Max is a veteran soap actor who was never able to break into the movie .. .. but not too bad actor. Jeff .... well ... he did good and bad, as far as movies and TV course ". I soon discovered that Jeff decided to add a" disgusting "to his repertoire of films. <br /> <br /> the first key was in the first stages. Jeff Mug their way hungrily through the "I'm with the mind" stage, before finally killing himself. Amusing cameo appearance, in fact, e. Unfortunately, this is, without any exaggeration, the highlight of the film. It goes downhill from there. <br /> <br /> We then commander of the mission (Williams), who is sent to see what happened with Jeff and his team are busy choosing a new friend from among the ranks of the criminal element, but this range is not as Dirty Dozen -. more like an unconvincing four Furthermore, one of CRIMS, computer hacker, said working away on a laptop computer in his cell.. Is not that a bit like giving a murderer running a gun shop in the slammer? Prison pretty lame if you ask me. <br /> <br /> When they finally take off really terrible consequences. It looks like a model of the spacecraft was knocked out in the afternoon some boring 8 years old, who were parts that were left him Airfix kits. <br /> <br /> But the horror does not stop there. While on their way to the area where the ship Jeff missing, criminal team rewarded for good behavior, while data weekends virtual reality in which they indulge their male fantasies. All is well, and the use of scenes from their imagination serves as an introduction to the «Alien Menace», which is beginning to appear there. But they have to drag it to a pretty sooooo loooooong? Alien Intruder? Alien sad, more like. <br /> <br /> In the end, they do it for the G-sector and the alien presence makes them fight against each other for her love, yet only a good old Max went. The ending, in fact optimistic garbage Vienna film hints throughout - as if! In addition, it makes an appearance in this film character I nicknamed «Sweatdroid». It should be androids, but apparently, this fact was lost on the make-up crew, who secured his sweaty feature at every opportunity. But do not worry, he's just there to fill up the number of the body count at the end. <br /> <br /> Williams and Scoggins to be true, do very little in the film. They only almost sleep, let alone act. And, as I said earlier, Jeff gets an early trip to the showers, so it can not enlighten manicness most of the film. Max tries his best, as do several other actors, but the film is simply atrocious badly, frankly. <br /> <br /> one, and only halfway art thing this film offers a vessel name. They are named after musicians - Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the movie is bland and inspiration. <br /> <br /> Made in 1992, I thought that in the initial view, this was one of those '80s straight to video works. Looks like they still made good shit movie in the '90s, it seems. <br /> <br /> It is better to avoid. Even in the movie Beer n chips this movie bitch, but at least you can rewind it, I suppose.
