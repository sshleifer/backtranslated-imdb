I saw this movie, only now, when he was released and hailed as the best film of the year here in Israel. and summarize all right now, I'll just say :. this is not a good movie <br /> <br /> This is the second feature film by Dror Shaul, and I must admit that his first TV drama, and he made before this picture is much better. Moreover, this is his first attempt to direct the drama. early works were comedies, and were fun and efficient <br /> <br /> The first thing you need to know if you ever see this movie :. Israel in the 21st century hates the kibbutz and its value was represented as the State of Israel. the real state of the kibbutz very serious, and some of them disappear one by one. kibbutz Hebrew words for the team, was a native village for members only, where the value of equality and socialism was a dogma for everyday life. with changing social values, with time, it now appears that the kibbutz was a place where the human spirit was arrested, locked up in the framework of dogma rules, without a ticket with. Entrance capitalist values ​​and lifestyle in the 90s and still made it really hard on kibbutzim, in order to survive. crazy mother in the film the central metaphor for this. <br /> <br /> But, I think this film as having nothing to do with nostalgia for the good old days of the kibbutzim. once, it was the dream of every young couple to live on a kibbutz and to raise children in this quiet and beautiful surroundings. but the film shows the opposite. that the kibbutz, with its socialist dogma, there was a place like the cult of crazy people with crazy ideas that undermine the freedom of each person in the team. is the central philosophy of the postmodern capitalism: your personality is the most important thing. You have to put yourself in the center, and no one except you is business. This philosophy means a film, and this is only the first sin. <br /> <br /> If you do not agree with me on the political side, I am sure you will agree that the current tone of the film, this is the scenario, and this direction are four sins that followed. the film has no real visual text, and none of his shots are not something to remember. it is also very "thin", a weakness that is not more than artsy Fartsy attempt to provoke emotion, not the surface, but not in the movie, and not with the audience. it does not bring anything but boredom <br /> <br /> Can someone please explain :. why this film has received so many awards? maybe because it shows that Israel is in line with the rest of the world that hates socialist and human values? or maybe it shows that Israel is a "thin" place, not giving in dogma and fanaticism? we are basically very human and good people, capable of emotions, especially if they are fake ones, just as capitalism is waiting for us to be? or maybe because it says one of the biggest lies of Israeli cinema in recent years, the lies that undermine the justification for the existence of the Jewish state? no matter what the answer, it is not good. Sun for the world, but not for human values, not for the Jews.
