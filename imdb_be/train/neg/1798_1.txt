As the film may have Ozzy Osbourne and still suck? I just do not understand. It's no joke meal failed to do so. It sucks and love it. <br /> <br /> It's no joke meal is one of those films that I have to warn people about. This vomiting is induced vile crime just begging to be reviewed, so you can feel even worse about yourself. Trick or Treat has no saving factors. <br /> <br /> For a film about heavy metal, it sure does not seem to understand that heavy metal or whatever it is. The film manages to make a heavy metal look lame, and it was in 1986, probably one of the most powerful hours of heavy metal. This is quite a feat, but negative. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat = so bad, you'll be mad at yourself for having watched it. It's a simple equation, we hope to keep you from this brainless and spineless film.
