It's awful bad piece of debris manages to be racist, sexist and homophobic all at once, pretending that terribly chic and sophisticated. Hard speeches, cliché ridden script and sad direction make this film one to stay away from. Two scenes were particularly offensive - one in which Schaech scrubs his tongue after kissed another man (maybe it really was, that's gross), and the scene in which Eastwood kissing best friend in Schaech, who pretends to Russia. After he leaves the room, she exclaims «F ** king foreigners!" So much for it to be cultured artist who dreams of living in Paris!?! <br /> <br /> Zhonaton nis can be cute actor on the screen, and it's amazingly beautiful. It's a shame that he did not have learned more from working with cutting edge gay director Gregg Araki on the previous film, and try to save the film from slipping into a string of gay stereotypes and homophobia slime.
