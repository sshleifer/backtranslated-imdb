This movie is great, mind you - but only in the way he speaks very bad story. Stella so terribly rude, and will never know, the better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and narrow-minded. Neither never know better. Is it real? Anyway, Stella realizes that her daughter is shy of her tasteless manners and dress, but can not understand what she just needs to tone it all down? I do not think so. Stella is a good woman and a good mother. Throw itself so that her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snob disgusting. <br /> <br /> A lot of what we see, perhaps, was the normal time - people with a beer or two while enjoying the piano player, dance - but it is made to be a kind of moral inferiority. "I can not have our child to live!" Dismiss. <br /> <br /> This story tells about one thing: that unwashed working class can not ever hope to aspire to the heights of the upper classes. And it's just a load of garbage.
