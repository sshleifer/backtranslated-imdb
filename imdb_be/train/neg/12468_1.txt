Simply put: the film boring. Cliché to cliché is confirmed and storylines never come together. It seems that the director was sure to make a film or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent ordered to kill the oil prince, falls, and then warns the Prince (why?)) And so some elements were added to make the film more interesting. Thus, a child dies, resulting in a "natural" father answered freely advising man indirectly responsible for the death of his son. The lawyer has drunk "friend" and keep it around, why, no one knows. Some children become suicide and blow up the ship. <br /> <br /> In general, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in quite a while. I was neither fun nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed and cried, I did not get the understanding I was not forced to learn more or to take the cause. It means nothing to me, that in my eyes is the worst you can say about the film.
