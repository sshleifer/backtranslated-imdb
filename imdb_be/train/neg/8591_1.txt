I'm trying to decide if we jump into a tree shredder will be more enjoyable than this dreck. He completes the destruction of what was once a classic pair of films. With the Jedi, Menace, clowns and Sith, we have the death of Lucas' career. He wants to swallow Annakin Vader is nonsense? I never believed it was true. This film will justify these feelings. History does not use the phantom Moron, and each new film is simply piled crap, until all that was left was not a toy parade. I have to go. I know where some new stones to throw it. You want spoilers? Here they are. Luke and Leia are not linked. Vader is their father. Duke Countoo should be moved to the other side, while he still could. Yoda has fewer than verbal skills Berry Yoga. His advice has never been of any use to anyone. Obi-Wan lied to Luke for the first two films. Annakin not built C3P0. He found it in the desert, and lied to my mom about putting it together from scratch. Chewbacca fleas. This whole mess with Vader and the fall of the Republic can be charged with this stupid b *** h Ama-Lamm-Ding-Dong. If she had brains, she would not have come within a light year of Annie, but she said do what George Lucas wrote for her. Which is a drug!
