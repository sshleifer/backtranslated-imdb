First of all, the reason I give this film 2 stars and not 1, so that at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic job as a Lieutenant Columbia. Only he can get 10 stars for something to save this otherwise completely useless attempt to create a movie. <br /> <br /> I was initially all lit when reading the comments of the author, Andrew Stevens in this film gave "the performance of his career." For me, it was a pitiful performance Stevens that completely destroyed this film, so I was ready to give all kinds of insults at the man who made the above comment. Then I thought, what else did Stevens? So I checked and, you know, that man was absolutely right. In the 17 years since it Columbo film was made, apparently, each of the 33 projects, Stevens was in since crap, so it is doubtful that anyone had even seen the rest of his career. <br /> <br /> If you like s ever see each of the 69 names before watching it. Do yourself a favor and save the worst for last.
