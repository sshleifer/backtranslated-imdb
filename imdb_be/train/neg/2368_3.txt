Well, that is nonsense, they say that they do not make another movie nightmare that is the "last" one ... And what do they do? They are going to make another one, not the next one (part7) was BAD, but why they are playing with us. In any case, this movie makes no sense what-so ever, it was Extremelly boring, the characters were very one-dimensional, of Freddy was another wild card, which is very silly for such a good series.The plot is very, very bad, and it's even worse than part 2 and 5. I have not received the film, his stupid story in the third, it is meaningless! Id say. I hated this movie so much I still rmember all parts I did not like what was basically all film.This so different prequel, it seeks, and seeks, but it's one trying the hardest, and got a slap on the back face .Again were hadly any death scene even though they were different, they were sucking Bigtime. How can they have gone so far? Didnt they see it, they made a big mistake on the part of 2 and 5? However, they do it? Its all bout money, does not see the reasons for SAD NIGHTMARE SERIES. <br /> <br /> I GAVE A Nightmare on Elm Street, six (6) 3 of 10. <br /> <br /> The good moments of the film :. If a potential site <br /> <br /> Cons of film: Terrible action / absence of death / Too funny to be classified as a horror / very confusing.
