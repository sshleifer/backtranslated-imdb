It willfully whimsical adaptation Borges short story is a typical Cox. Its strong visual sense, as usual, to destroy awful soggy effects of most actors. The film, of course, in the tradition of Mexican surrealist Bu√±uel period, and sometimes looks like a poor man to take on the elements of Lars von Trier's crimes. obviously Cox takes a preference for one, jump cuts, and surround sound recording of all work against the effectiveness of the film. Worth a look, but ultimately disappointing.
