Stuttering story, uninteresting characters and sub-par (to put it mildly) the dialogue is annoying TV production, which could hardly be interesting even to the production of billions of dollars of budget. <br /> <br /> Symbols Sun likelihood, their motives, actions, or their professed profession. The plot reads like evil Dungeons & Dragons (TM) crack, but with plasma rifles, and force fields. There are serious problems of continuity and extent of meaningless interaction between the characters is the author, at least, wincing. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague. Watch any episode of Dark Angel, and you'll have more acting, dialogue and plot. Ugh.
