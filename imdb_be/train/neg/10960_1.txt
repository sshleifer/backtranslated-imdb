Ouch! They do not come much worse than this terrible adaptation of the beloved Lewis novel. While adaptation is very faithful to the novel, acting awful and sets and special effects on a scale equivalent to a school play. I have read that the budget of this miniseries was magnificent, that the BBC has ever given at the time, but of course, they could have scraped together a little more than $ 2, it looks like it was filmed for. The worst effect of all Mr Beaver. I know that the computer effects were not at the level required, or even cost-effective at the time, but a suit man in a suit store look was reversed. It would be better just to cut the character from the movie, you do this for the role! Avoid this at all costs.
