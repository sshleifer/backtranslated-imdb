I'm working my way through the Horror Classics 50 Movie Collection updates and an uprising of zombies is one of the films in the set. I watched them with my soon to be seven year old daughter, which makes most of these films laughter riot. <br /> <br /> I had high hopes for Zombie Riot, after watching White Zombie, which really is a precursor of so much that is the basis of a zombie in a movie (think Serpent and the Rainbow Clive Barker and James Bond Live and let die funeral scene, not the night of the living dead). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, even if the name includes the word "zombie" is little more than a love triangle involving anthropologist Armand Louque, which caught fire Claire Duval; which, in turn, is taken with her companion Clifford Grayson. What a yawn-fest, my daughter fell asleep halfway through <br /> <br /> I had a real hard time deciphering who these people are working for - or an ally here. but I think it really does not matter <br /> <br /> I was shocked when I saw Bela Lugosi in the credits of the film. but of course, it was his eyes (by White Zombie), which acts as a mind control device for a zombie.
