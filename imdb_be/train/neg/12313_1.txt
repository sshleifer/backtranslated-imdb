This may or may not be the worst movie that Steve Martin has ever made, but it is, of course, was far from his best. Obviously, he did that shit to pay checks. Dreck, as it certainly does nothing to enhance its reputation as a funny man. What he does not seem to understand that when people go to see a movie of Steve Martin, they are waiting to be entertained and not bored to tears. It's sad that he pulled Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman with him. I do not understand why talented people can not get a grip on the fact that people do not want to see them in lousy movies. If you're going to name a movie comedy, it's supposed to be funny. It was not. Shame on the US military for what he associated with these trifles, too. Full Metal Jacket was more laughter than the accident to "serve the comedy." Of course, Phil Silvers is rolling in his grave.
