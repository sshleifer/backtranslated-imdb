I read somewhere that Hollywood has to focus on the adaptation of bad movies and leave the classics alone. We can only hope. Although it is a remake was not a waste, I still wish I had six bucks back to go in the direction of the original DVD. A lot of violence and one of the worst endings I've ever seen. This version does not give anything new to add. He reminds just why Hollywood should leave the good stuff alone.
