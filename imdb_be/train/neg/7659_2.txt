Alone In The Dark is a BAD movie and associated Deuce Bigalow for the worst film of the year. I wish all I had to say, but, of course, IMDb provides a word count and the like. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to about how bad the movie is the worst kind of bad movie. Low budget dreck as the Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a huge budget mess as Gigli, or superbabies this guff. You can see such films as Monster A Go Go and Lomonosov happen because the director does not have a clue. Movies, as is the case because the director is stupid, money grabbing idiot who just does not care about his audience. <br /> <br /> This is more shocking when you consider that Uwe Boll (the mastermind behind this shocking shit and already has some real garbage under his belt) established that only happens once in a blue moon. Really very bad horror movie. All of this mess. Cheesy CGI, bad story, crazy cuts random camera and a terrible sound. <br /> <br /> Alone In The Dark is a terrible film, which is to look at absolutely no one. Woo Hoo! The survey of more. Give me a bud, a roll for 2006 and, probably, I will never talk about it. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie.
