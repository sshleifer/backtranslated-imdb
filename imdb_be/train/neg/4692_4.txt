When I first saw this film, he was named the terror on the train and was back half of the double feature. Glenn Ford, expert Arms aims to defuse a bomb hidden on the train loaded with explosives. Tension slowly and gradually; and this black-and-white film is only about an hour and twenty minutes. All through these years on television; tension and drama have lost much of their influence. It is still a good movie, how the early 50's standards go. <br /> <br /> However, Ford, Vernon are Ann and Maurice Denham. Villain / pest plays Victor Maddern.
