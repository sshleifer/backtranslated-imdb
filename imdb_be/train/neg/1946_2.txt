As a mother of 2 young children, who are, or should I say, I was growing up with many reincarnation Scooby I feel well situated to comment on the historical and current version of Scooby. <br /> <br /> If a family we have not seen any episodes to Shaggy and Scooby get a clue, we enjoyed it as light weight, nothing special Saturday morning cartoon. But this is, in fact, the problem is in its current format so lightweight that it will not have the longevity of the "old" Scooby and the gang. I'm sure he can succeed in a short payback, but I'm sure that in the long run to buy the old and young to the very real danger of losing. My 6 year old son to see the new version really unhappy and without any prompting said that it looked really bad animated and why he is not anything like the last series (Where are you). <br /> <br /> Scrappy doo was an anomaly, but still much better than that. Hopefully, it would be appropriate to get the keys referring to the producers.
