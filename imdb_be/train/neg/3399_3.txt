Birthday girl does not know what he wants to be - it's a comedy ,, a drama ... she just does not know. What could be a very funny and touching film ends in a no-man's land. The room is quite original, which is justified by the script, full of interesting scenarios, but is unlikely to deliver any and finishes petering out. It's a real shame if you look at the cast - it is a very solid all the way through, but they do not get a chance to shine. Very disappointing.
