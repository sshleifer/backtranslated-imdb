The film is much horrible and humiliating for the victims of rape. On the surface, this may be a bold film about the rape, but if you dig beneath the surface, that is it is not a positive message about the rape. Aishwarya rape victim is shown that a helpless victim, who can not handle all because she is a woman. She needs someone to help her. If society makes taunts about her and throws her comments, she did not stand up for themselves. All this left Anil Kapoor make all the talk while Aishwarya doing everything went crying. <br /> <br /> The director (Satish Cart) down the wrong path by drawing a rape victim weak and submissive. What would be more effective is drawing a strong woman who rebels against his enemies in a courageous way. The director is famous for being chauvinistic. His films are usually full of weak women, but he tries to hide them in a controversial roles. He must learn that just because a role is controversial, it does not mean that the character itself is strong. <br /> <br /> The most understate the scene in the movie, Aishwarya when "clean" themselves after only raped. It does this in order to please his father, who thinks she's dirty. While it is commendable that Shah shows a stigma against rape victims in this harsh light, he does not show us whether it was wrong to do his daughter Esha's father do such a thing. Thus, we are left with a confusing message about the rape. <br /> <br /> The comedy also do not need a strong subject of the film as it is. Especially, the comedy just is not funny. Ash from a tree in her role while Anil Kapoor does not do anything but cry. Music commonplace for the title track, which is great a movie (the only bright point of this film), except. Bendrya role is disappointing and pointless. In general, it could be a great movie to remember, ends up being a horrible mish-mash that will give some viewers serious indigestion.
