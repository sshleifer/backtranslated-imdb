Feelgood Wang is a movie about a guy who is trying to lure girls into his new van, in order to entice them. The only thing that this film does not fail precisely showing van fad in the US in the late 70s. It seems that it was completely done by amateurs. This is rubbish, but I loved it! I must admit that I am a fan of 70s trash! I hope that this one makes it on IMDB bottom 100! <br /> <br /> 2
