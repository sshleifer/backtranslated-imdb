In an attempt to return the teen slasher genre that was taken away from the deceptions like Scary Movie and Shriek, if you know what I did last Friday the 13th, Valentine's is not possible. Why do people like Halloween? Because it was original, new and goes beyond anything that's ever been done. Why do they like to cry? Because at least it made sense. Valentine is just silly slasher film, which has almost the blood, so ever. The plot is so similar to Halloween and Urban Legend is not funny. And in that moment, the killer comes on the screen, you know who it is, it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable. Teen slasher genre DEAD Get over it! <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10
