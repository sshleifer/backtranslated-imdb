After Highlander 2 (which I still deny), I thought that there was not possible to make a sequel that can make me cry because it was so bad. I was wrong. I loved the original Wargames, however, this film is inaccurate with the computer details and the details of the original film. The original Wargames at least had some hacks that worked. Who wrote this film does not know anything about computers, except how to use a word processor. I doubt that he or she even watched the original film. Actions do not even convincing. Save yourself, in any case, do not watch this movie. I do not care if the channel is delayed on the TV screen, and you can not turn off the TV. This film will ruin your life.
