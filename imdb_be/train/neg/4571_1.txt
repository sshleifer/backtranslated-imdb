What we know, we know that this is confusing and haphazard look at the secrets of the universe. We are represented on the imaginary parade of experts (none of which are not named), which are randomly and thoroughly in the pontificate unscientific manner. Their interviews are crushed into small segments and aggravatingly dispersed some grandstanding CGI and banal mini-sites. <br /> <br /> The film pilfers topics from science, philosophy, theology and politics, cut them together without regard to accuracy, and then somehow identifies several prose and absurd conclusions. We are led to believe that quantum physics tells us about the purpose of our existence, and any other hard to answer the question of what the filmmakers want to point the finger at. <br /> <br /> It is impregnated with errors and logical nya-sequiturs. As we begin to quantum mechanics, and eventually with the pseudo-science of spirituality and mysticism? It's like saying, "two plus two equals four, so I can move objects with my mindÂ» <br /> <br /> There's nothing original in this film, and almost anything that is accurate.. - no discrimination will irritate the viewer heavy editing, intrusive and senseless effects and a general lack of substance. Educated audiences will be disappointed to tears by the pressure of science and any other subject of this film touches.
