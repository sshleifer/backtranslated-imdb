An overview, but ... <br /> <br /> Avoid any price, thorough waste 90mins. At the end of the movie I was none the wiser as to what actually happened. It is full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3mins) Jack Dee (30 seconds), "Philadelphia" girls) and some vaguely recognizable people, but it just does not make any sense. Will the story just got lost in the editing I do not now, but damn it ... <br /> <br /> Put on a DVD instead, or go to bed and get some rest !!! <br /> <br /> 2 of 10 (for a cameo and Morris Minor car chase) <br /> <br />
