Thus, I had low expectations of this film, to begin with, but he was unable to meet even. while there were some funny parts, even one or two of the laugh, the film fell terribly short of what I would call good. funny jokes were unexpected and again very quickly, leaving us sitting there going Â«WTF just happened?" In addition, there were a few jokes that just dragged on and on and on. the part where it falls down the mountain, I yawn. In addition, the editing is really not enough. there were some poor transitions between scenes, but it seems to be the style nowadays. It made me laugh, but I would not watch it again, and I am very glad that I waited it out. give him a chance, you might enjoy it, but do not think you are in for something along the lines of 40-year-old virgin, or Superbad.
