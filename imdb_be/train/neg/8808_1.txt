"Strange" Cries in the LA Times on the front panel of DVD. They were referring to the fact that so pathetic piece of shit was ever released. The film revolves around a bunch of girls who have a disease that causes them to become cannibals and kill innocent people just to stay alive. Their skin is peeled throughout the film, we also see the broken legs, head, etc., are as convincing as Halloween Fuzzy Felt kit. There is a lot of talk b * LL ** a little human kitchen and some strange guy zombie hunter who puts in the suffering of said skin disease in her closet, tied to a chair, before stabbing them in the head, cutting them into bits. .. <br /> <br /> you get the picture. Given that there is no acting talent on the screen at all, and the blood is ridiculously unrealistic, meaning that all of the hash? Again, looking at the video box, the guy responsible for this is the "underground cult film director." Will it be like those weird religious cults, where they brainwash you to think in one direction, when it is clear that the opposite is true? Because it's the only possible reason I can think of for those who enjoy the view of the tax write-off. Then, in the same paragraph, he compares himself to Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George A. Romero. Hahahahaha to stop him. Now you're just stupid. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? You are offended above view? If yes, then you must be a member of this cult. Do they exist in your payroll pocket? Do they allow you to see other family members? They make you watch Andrew Parkinson movies, as long as you think he is the best director since A.Hitchcock? Tell me ... it sounds like a special brewing Panorama me. And say hello to the critic of the LA Times, when you return to your colony, will you? 0/10
