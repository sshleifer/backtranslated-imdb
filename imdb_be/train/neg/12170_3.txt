Not surprisingly, Pamela Springsteen has not given up acting to become a staff photographer; it's much better idea to have her behind the camera than in front of the other. Although this film is not without interesting elements (mullet from hell, etc.) outweigh the disadvantages. On the one hand, Angela, killer advisor, apparently about the same age as campers. With older, more threatening to the camp director did a lot for the film. And then you have a murder scene. The budget was clearly too low to run the majority of them properly (no pun intended), although drowning someone in the toilet toilet, certainly original. But in general, there are tons of movies out there that are worse / more fun to spend half an hour of his life, watching.
