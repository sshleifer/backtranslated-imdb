I agree with everything people have said that in this, but I must add that the soundtrack is probably the worst I have ever heard, all my life! There are actual vocals at times when you should be listening to the actor say! And as the vocal version of the Broadway Danzig singing "darkness of the forest! About darkness dark, dark forest! "Or something else so harmless. Singer is how vibrato and was recorded with the microphone treble-over some synthed up string section and counterfeit drum beats. This is terrible !! <br /> <br /> So, men terrible results. Such women. This is one bad case of gender stereotypes - is so bad! All they say revolves around being a man or a woman, just by playing the stereotypes to the maximum. It makes me sick. Soooo sad !!! <br /> <br /> The kids were so echoey in their line, you could not understand them. And why a woman ghost children always wear a cute little bows in their hair, a pretty blue dress and long hair? And the ghost of the boys always wear clean cut pants with a nice shiny blond hair? Do not be scared -. STUPID <br /> <br /> Pope's face was very clean and defect-free, to be a person who lives in a cave. Good beard and fringe, pa. You are perfectly cut with a knife by yourself or you will be held in the city and go to a salon? <br /> <br /> Stupid movie.
