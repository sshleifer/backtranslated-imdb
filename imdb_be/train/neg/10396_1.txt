As a filmmaker myself, and having a few dark and subversive sense of humor, I thought I was in for a treat when I got home "... My Evil" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, but does not choose controversial quote from the director polemicist, Chris Morris, "a short film, including scenes"). I should have known better really, and to avoid this tasteless (and often abusive) twoddle piece. <br /> <br /> The scene in the church ' It is repulsive to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with the skewed ratio Maurice to pedophilia from it notorious television series, Brass Eye), and serves no purpose other than to shock. As the film comedy Set I will never understand. <br /> <br /> The commentary runner sounds like a new idea in principle (visiting Runner themselves often interesting and uninhibited look at the film-making process), but this is unfortunately not the case. Instead, we were treated to a public school student talk about dogs on film, before concluding that there is no really big films starring dogs. This is all very interesting, but not worth a single frame of celluloid. <br /> <br /> To say that this film is not going nowhere, it would be an understatement. It belongs too much to it heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely disturbed and unfulfilled. Its simplistic message - that people should take responsibility for their actions. - at the same time clearly and poorly illustrated <br /> <br /> The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately he was unable to persuade, entertain, educate, and only ends up being annoying. If you want to see a really big piece of a short film, I highly recommend "Franz Kafka This is a wonderful life," Peter Capaldi.
