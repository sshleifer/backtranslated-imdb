This movie is not funny. It's not interesting. It does not contain a single second of originality or intelligence, and will not lead you to take the least interest in the characters or situations. It should be added that it is about as juvenile film, like all lately. It is as if a group of 14 or 15-year-old pupils of high school, who never met or had any type of relationship with a real girl sat down and wrote the film based on false fantasy that to be an adult person would be like, this movie is boring , insulting heady and sometimes insulting and disgusting. At best, it contains one or two things that make you laugh. In addition, it seems twice as much as his 85 minutes of work time.
