I am commenting on this mini-series from the perspective of someone who has read the novel first. And from this point of view, I can honestly say that while pleasant, I can understand why she was not relayed at any time in recent years. More specifically, the mini has some serious problems, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) It's terrible miscast. The actor who plays the younger generation were all between 15 and 20 years older than the characters. Ali McGraw (45 at the time) plays Natalie Zhastrou, which was supposed to be about 26. Jan-Michael Vincent (39 at the time) played Byron Henry, who was supposed to be about 22. The rest of the children of Henry and Pamela Tudsbury, also played the actors are too old for the characters that were supposed to be in their 20s. <br /> <br /> 2) Some action was absolutely awful. Ali McGraw sometimes almost made it a mini unwatchable. I've seen more convincing performance in high school plays. <br /> <br /> 3) direction was poor. To be fair to Ali McGraw, a bad action and character development are likely to directing. Hitler's image was way overdone. His character detached look and behave more cartoon villain than charismatic, sometimes charming, but always a diabolical genius Herman Wouk painted it as a novel. Some other characters are made so stereotypically (Berl Zhastrou) they do not get the depth of the character, Wouk set up for them. <br /> <br /> 4) This small, very outdated. Fake music, pretentious narration (it sounded like a middle school of cinematic history), and all the prime-time soap opera mini sensation made almost comical at times. Furthermore, too often Byron and Natalie are costumed and made to look like they are in 1979, not in 1939 <br /> <br /> Anyone who watches it without reading the first novel use is likely to not sit through it all, because it will come off more than in the late '70s / early' 80s to 'take yourself too seriously, "primetime soap drama, rather than the TV version, which, of course, a modern American classic. <br /> <br /> remakes of old movies and the like, sometimes poorly made, but it is probably one case where a creative and inspired director can make a very stunning and memorable, and the production of criticism. I never see that happening as Remek be as long (15 hours) or more, to do it right, and given the short attention span of most of the current American viewing public, it will not fly.
