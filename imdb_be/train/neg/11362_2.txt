Â«Fly Me To The Moon" has to be the worst animated film I've seen in It says something for a long time., So I took my son to see each animated release during the last 4 years. The story should be generous ... corny. brutal voice, too cute sounds. diversity humor Romper room. Animation is passable for the type Nickolodeon cartoon, but it is being released on the big screen is not cable TV. <br /> <br /> it gets only 2 due to its OK 3 -D visuals. Some scenes were moderately stimulating image, but we have already seen much better than in the past. I also question the requirements of directors, the characters to fly off the screen, rather than in his most scenes. While that is interesting in the first it has become tiresome after the 3rd or 4th time. It seemed smack of indifference to me on the part of the creators. <br /> <br /> I'm going to talk about it, though, it was pretty cool soundtrack. And for the record my son was not too crazy about it either. Bad movie.
