BAD zombie uprising. There's nothing remotely entertaining about the film. It's sad, lifeless, he acted badly, and bad scenario. I have often complained that the original Dracula bit slow for my taste, but this film makes Dracula look like a roller coaster. 65 minutes of time, it seemed as 165 minutes <br /> <br /> The story :. The expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of the mind control through a "zombie". One person finds a secret and uses it to make the woman he loves to marry him. Once this happens, it releases the zombies under his control to dire consequences. That's all. That's the whole story. <br /> <br /> For most of the film, I was trying to figure out where I saw a man's role. He looked so familiar. I had a lot of time to think about it. Nothing happens in the film. Just before the "zombie rebelled," he hit me. It was Dean Jagger. I saw him recently, as a general in the White Christmas. This is how I "entertain" himself for much of the film. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad I did not buy the DVD for this film. Zombie King is on the other side, and it is a masterpiece of filmmaking in comparison with this film. For what it's worth, I'll give it a 2/10. (I will not go, because of 1/10, believe it or not, but I've seen worse.)
