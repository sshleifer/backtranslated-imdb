I am stunned to discover the number of fans of the show. I not said that friends were at best "average" situation comedy, and not as big as others made out. Let's face it, if it was not for casting Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Leblanc, who knows if this show has lasted as long as it was done. I very much doubt that. Although, as the series progressed, the friends got progressively more predictable, lame and boring that I could not care less about the characters- of which are the most overrated TV or Historic their plight, no matter who is sleeping with com. And it went from amusing for the first four seasons, sometimes funny. And even then, when it was all of these A-list Hollywood actors from the worlds of film, I still did not bother to get better. Composing friends became stale that I lost interest in the show with the sixth season of the year and for the end, well, it was predictable to say the least. <br /> <br /> which is annoying, but the fact that it lasted for ten seasons, while some of my favorite show lasted only three or four seasons for example, and it was eventually canceled and taken off the air forever. Shaw needed came to an immediate halt until the cast wanted more pay. In fact, as well as a series of loose, it was a show that was more than the actors themselves, and not vice versa. <br /> <br /> When it ended in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom. Now, there is talk of a reunion of friends show coming to TV screens very quickly. And yet, I for one will not be looking forward to it at all.
