Do not disturb. Prosciutto bit can go a long way, but that we get pure ham, especially Dunaway. The plot is one of those episodes bumper car ... it jumps to the other, and all changes direction again, until we are just scratching your head wondering if you would ever plot. Gina Philips is really good, but it's hard to play against mystify Dunaway plays Lady Macbeth lost in Duck Soup Marx Brother. Oh, Raven ... now there's an actor. And it has a relative who is just lying and bed and looks ghostly. Or Dr. Dread, which is filled with a lot of darkness and without any working funds. I'm one of those suckers who just has to see the movie until the end. Quoth the Raven «Nevermore».
