This film is outdated and misses. It is far, compared with 89 Batman that he's trying to coppy. The fact that a woman singer, her name can not act, and we can see why the death of her film carrier. Notice how this film died at the box office no one to watch this movie on TV, too. My uncle and father were waiting for Batman, and movies seems more Cop Rock. It is not necessary to rent a 3/10
