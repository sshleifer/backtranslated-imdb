Determination of contamination as defined Dictioary Webster is a "cause distaste or disgust." If someone can come up with a better word or definition than it is for Alone in the Dark, please let me know, because it's the best thing I I can think of. However, I will not feel that somehow this word describes how truly awful this film. <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie with two of my roommates. One has a very similar tastes to me, and the second is the Flick action / adventure guru. This is usually the last guy does not care about the size of plot holes, as long as the film contains a lot of bang he leaves satisfied. <br /> <br /> That being said, we went to the theater to see on Friday alone in the dark. Little to my surprise, we were the only people in the theater. When it started, I immediately knew why. <br /> <br /> It starts with the opening scene of the worst of any film, and, unfortunately, I have to admit that it only gets worse from there. The opening scene 5 minutes scrolling text that is passed. Nevertheless, I understand why it was transferred. The director should have realized that only illiterate people even thought to install pay to see this movie. However, it is not only the first scene of a long scrolling text in the history of cinema, but it also makes no sense. It seems that in the same sequence, we hear about how to completely separate movies. One of the ancient civilization and its falsification of the portal, and the second of the mad scientist and his experiments on orphans. If you are reading this and confused, you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Then, a terrible plot, action, effects and camera work to begin. Tara Reid is terrible as an actress. It does not do anything that even for one second to make you think that it is the custodian of the museum. Slater just bad, is not convincing, and has no chemistry with Reed. <br /> <br /> The plot is probably the worst thing that has ever created by man. All this time I was a roommate with similar tastes are asking questions like: What is it? And what happens? Besides scrolling garbage we have multiple transmit sequences from the Slater. Are they good? NO. Do they have something to explain? NO. Have we at any time, as the audience have a clue as to why we should care what happens? Again, NO. <br /> <br /> Then we have random sex scene. We are told that Slater and Reed together, but as soon as they act as if they even care about the other. But then the BAM ... sex scene. Once again, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Good, oh I do not know, 30 seconds after that miserable scene ends, we have a skirmish with 20 or so soldiers and the same number of foreign things. This is set on the track of heavy metals and causes cerebral hemorrhage greater than one has ever thought possible. <br /> <br /> And if that was not enough ... <br /> <br /> There does not exist the main villain. There are scientists and have the "wrong" things. At some point, scientist manages alien things, and stands on a hill, and ordered them to attack a military outpost. Why? He became supreme commander of these things? Why are they listening to him? Once again, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> The film ends with Slater and Reed go in to evacuate the city. Why is the city evacuated? Or alien things break? Is the military to tell them? Who knows ... and up to this point, who cares? I did not, and never will. <br /> <br /> But to top it off, Slater and Reid attacked by a foreign thing. Despite the fact that it was stated that foreign things are clogged when exposed to sunlight. And that is true, as you may have guessed, this is the middle of the * &% $ ING day, and it's bright as can be. Maybe a foreigner, he bought a pair of sunglasses, I do not know and I do not care. <br /> <br /> At present, after the movie ended, I ran outside the theater, all 6 foot 6 inches me waving my arms and nodding African told everyone not to go see this movie. Even my fanatical action / adventure roommate (who would see the film, which is simply cut and paste the 2:00 explosion in 1 movie to be the greatest thing ever created) admitted that the plot holes were very evident in this film. <br /> <br /> To sum up this shit-FEST I give it a 0.0 / 10 and would like to give him less if he could. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the worst movie ever made. I would not want this movie to my worst enemy.
