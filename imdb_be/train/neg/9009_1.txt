What a terrible movie! For some reason, science labs, and found the staff there are always shabby, dirty, mean, misanthropy, people living inside. These are people who are supposed to work together on complex research projects, can not agree on how to survive a death in the hands of the CGI Dragon. Spoilers: extra-nasty scientist, chief acting skills "sly" and "ominous sight" cloned dragon. Despite the fact that the laboratory had to work on this kind of stuff, other scientists in shock, because, apparently, they are far behind in their experiments, and got caught with their pants. The rest is history, as a thing, or Ten Little Indians, where the staff hunted and killed as they attempt to formulate a way to avoid and / or defeat the "Dragon." CGI creature dragon dark gray, which seems to be a popular color for the majority of cheap CGI special effects. It hardly looks better than a caricature, and dark gray tones make it difficult to see some interesting details in the body of the dragon. All this looks like a gray blob. Actions less than horrible. These scientists are a bunch of kids who can not agree on anything, and it makes it easier for the dragon to kill them in the various attempts to escape, hide, etc. Dean Cain is slightly better than either of unknown actors cast in this film. He seems to have descended to the level of his supporting cast. This film is really, really awful. Act is bad. History dumb. CGI is very very cheap and amateurish. There's nothing praiseworthy about this film, it's not even a good time to look at the killer, doing housework, or other work.
