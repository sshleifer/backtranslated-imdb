This film is one of the most horrible I have ever seen. Not only that awful dialogue, it never ends. You'll think it over, but it is not. How long did it, 140, 160 minutes? I do not even know. I know that I'll never see him again. It's like someone took a romantic comedy, has got a comedy, then I decided to downplay the romance, leaving us with a bunch of shit that could make its way to the screen. But do not take my word for it, find out for yourself how awful this film.
