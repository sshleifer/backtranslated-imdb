This film is so incredibly bad that I almost felt bad to look at. Up to this point, other fees, at least one good thing about it. Part 1 was also suspenseful mountains. Part 2 has been ruled out beat and entertainment. Part 3 was interesting to great effect. Part 4 was great music, good special effects, as well as new entertainment Freddy Krueger. Part 5 sadder than I have ever seen. Alice more appealing blonde with part 4 returns with her boyfriend Dan. In part, this must Elm Street installment turns into a daytime soap. Newer characters seem harsh, and even that sweet Alice has a chip on his shoulder. Freddie seems to be completely out of it. He looks tired and does not seem to be as dire. His one-liners seem out of place and different where, as in paragraph 4, they can be quite funny. History Leslie Bohem in never gets off the ground and the direction of Stephen Hopkins is so bad that my grandmother does look good! The whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic. It is also confusing and rather silly. Avoid Part 5 at all costs!
