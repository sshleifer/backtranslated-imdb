This is interesting in the first place. Naive park ranger (Colin Firth) marries a beautiful, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) he is only known for a short time. They seem to be happy, then she disappears without warning. He is looking for her, and a few dead ends, stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and dowdy recent past, which may include criminal activity. And then, it seems to me that the filmmakers did not know what to do with the story. Start, and not as suspenseful as it sounds, at least watchable. Then it ceases to be interesting or even make much sense. And the ending is so lame, so sad, and so devoid of any emotion or the intellect, you will think that the writers did not know what to do with him, and got bored trying. Which is a pity to waste a good idea!
