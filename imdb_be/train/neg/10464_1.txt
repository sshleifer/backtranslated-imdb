This film is not based on the Bible. He completely leaves Christ out of the film. They do not show the Rapture or the Second Coming of Christ. Let alone talk about it. This is not a quote from the scriptures. The end times refer to the great disaster. The film does not even show the bad times. Seven vials, seven and seven trumpets Viles opinions were reduced to 15 second news Sea stock is changing its structure. Antichrist was killed by 3 1/2 years into the tribulation, and this is how the movie ended. Only part they got right there were two prophets. Do not use the names there, of course, because that would be too close to the truth of Scripture. The worst part was I really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted to take the non-conservation of the man to him. I feel that the film is bad. This fake, like all, that the devil does. I just hope it does not take away from the upcoming film based on the remaining books. <br /> <br /> The second problem with the movie is it was just bad. Bad action bad effects, poor plot and poor character development. I saw the best episodes of Miami.
