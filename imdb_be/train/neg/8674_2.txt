The first few minutes of «The Bodyguard» actually there Feminine charm: it opens that ran the text of the Bible (part, Samuel Jackson recites his soon-to-be victims in "Pulp Fiction"), still with two karate teacher school New York arguing about the eternal questions of humanity (who better than Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), and then you receive Chiba, playing himself; he immediately stops the plane hijacking and smashes the bottle in two with his bare hand. Unfortunately, any entertainment value that intentionally or unintentionally, soon gets crushed fragmentary story, no action for a long period of time, as well as low quality of any given action. To keep it simple, that's why "The Bodyguard" unbearable film look: <br /> <br /> 1) You do not know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) whether any fighting there. <br /> <br /> 3) The fighting, which has a short and terrible shot. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba cool. Judy Lee gorgeous, her face perfectly. This is only for them that I give "The Bodyguard" second star of the film 10. This makes 87 minutes feel 5:00.
