Indeed, the use of the reserve of the nature documentary swarming bats, BAT PEOPLE hired some of the best ever. There are a lot of arrows bats hanging from the ceiling of the cave, swarm of bats flying out of the cave or swirling about near the mouths of caves. That in itself is enough to be disturbing: Imagine, they consulted after you? And they really are swarming that was supposed to be a sequence of show-stoppers that occurred approximately forty minutes, Mark, quite inappropriately hilarious sequence where teeming swarm of bats seem to attack the police car, splashing through the windshield as bloody broken eggs , The problem is that this sequence occurs in about fifty minutes too late to save the film, the majority of which consists of one or a few people running around, screaming, waving their hands in the chatter excitedly about some poor Goofball, who managed to get bitten by a bat during their stay. <br /> <br /> fear is that he descends from rabies, which really suck, so that their vacation spoiled, as the plot synopsis at the top of the page links THE BAT PEOPLE really show out. So effective resume the movie: A young couple goes on a romantic getaway, which was destroyed when man bites a bat. They boldly strive to stick to it, but he begins to wander, trying to convince those around him that's a little more complicated than the rage that he could not control themselves and they must all be protected. <br /> <br /> Now, when some of them foaming at the mouth, covered with sweat, his eyes on the incredible, as one of the cheapest dolls and yelling at you Get away from me, you'll get from it. You're not trying to give him the drugs, you do not try to tell him that you love him, you give a guy a place, go home and try that stage an escape in the next year. <br /> <br /> But no, the people in this film all behave like idiots, insist on the promotion of Man to the edge, and it is turned, mutates into a part of the human type of the bat creature, and killing a bunch of minor supporting characters. Nothing wrong with that, but the film does not forget that it is a low-budget Creature Feature and trying to be some kind of psychological research. Instead of a monster movie, we get a lot of people running around trying to get this guy to take Chilla tablets, and eventually he runs up the hill looks far more people than it should be, people insist that chase it down and pay the expected price. <br /> <br /> The main thing wrong with the movie is that it should have happened in the first fifteen or twenty minutes, thirty tops, and the film was about a guy after he was turned into a bat man, not going there . He takes good eighty minutes to really raise the pairs on this front, with some interesting sketches of nature along the way with always entertaining Michael Pataca, as the small city police, which lost its moral edge, and the late Paul Carr, a friend the doctor, who did not quite get the message. <br /> <br /> film terribly boring, about fifteen minutes too long and missed the opportunity to be good, a little forgotten Creature Feature of the mutant rampage, as the Italian favorite of Ratman horror that I saw today and sadly inspired to try it after watching. Me and my bright ideas, although the scene with a police car was howler: It is a pity that we could not have another twenty minutes, <br /> <br /> 3/10.
