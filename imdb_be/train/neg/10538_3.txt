The first branch (1990) was a terrible film, which was released during the late '80s / early' 90s era of cheap horror films. I found this film very sad, but very funny in parts. This film is not so much sense, and trust that it's not even funny. Quick justice system in this film makes Texas look weak in comparison. Lou Diamond Phillips in way over his head with this role (he plays boiled cop) and Tracy Griffith (more attractive sister Melanie) plays a psychic. Do not waste your time with this, because it is bad. That moment, I take it back. This film makes a large batch of film. Check Switchblade crucifixion packing nun, she has the strongest legs I've ever seen on Joshua, who was not in nunsploitation flick of Jesus Franco. Yeow! <br /> <br /> This marked the end of an era for L.D.P. His star was tarnished, and he could not draw a fly of the dunghill. It was D.T.V. for him until his "resurrection" a few years later. <br /> <br /> Not recommended if you are not desperate.
