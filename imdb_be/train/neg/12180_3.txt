This movie is absolutely horrible, but nevertheless, it can be fun at times, though it is completely unintentional humor. <br /> <br /> The plot was behind the ridiculous. I do not even think that 2-year-old is satisfied ridiculous idiocy that film makers have tried to prepare in history. However, on the positive side, some of uzhasayuschh nonsensical plot twists provide a great sense of humor. For example, "Oh, Lady Hogbottom has a giant rocket hidden in her backyard!" It gets worse (and even funny), but I will spare you. <br /> <br /> action usually ridiculous. Most of the children's roles are kind of cute, but not very plausible. On the other hand, Annie pretty terrible all around. Adults do not take their role seriously at all, but in many respects it is a good thing. If they tried to be plausible, the film would have been even worse. It is difficult to imagine. <br /> <br /> After you complete the general crappiness film is actually a few standout moments of almost-nya-crappiness. The scene in which the son of the lady in Hogbottom escapes with the maid surprisingly cheerful, although it is annoying disappointment when they are caught by the police. Butler character, while very small, a ray of sunlight, which is almost, but not quite propiraet gloom. <br /> <br /> Watching this film is actually caused me physical pain. However, there are some redeeming parts that made it almost watchable without start bleeding internally. Judge alone on their good parts, the film will be about 5; Unfortunately, the rest of the film is hardly deserves 1. Thus, I give it a 3. <br /> <br /> So be very generous, I would say.
