Read the novel before seeing the film, I was extremely disappointed with the wooden acting and arrogance manufacturers in their blatant disregard of the plot. I feel that this film in no way reflects the brilliance of the work Bronte, but rather the impression of a shallow love story. The condensing film for a short 2hours, the film has lost many of the key features that make the book meaningful and progressional, thus resulting in several jumping area with a bit of ground. There is no build up of romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so it looks pretty sharp and unjustified, since the two symbol has the infrequent interaction, you can not help but imagine their "love" is superficial. It is such an injustice to the novel Bronte, you do not give the impression of a dodgy cheek Jane and courage that attracts Rochester to it, and his nobility, which attracts him to Jane <br /> <br /> Despite the bad scenario, I think . that some of the characters were portrayed very penetrating, namely Mrs. Fairfax and Grace Poole, but the overall production was poor. Given better was perhaps the film would have been more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) with ZILom Clarke and Timothy Dalton for outstanding production.
