As a huge fan of the original film, it's hard to watch this show. Catchy set of decorations and harshly lighted sets take up any style of this remake. The mood is never there. Instead, it has the appearance of a number of television films the seventies. The slope is not a bad choice, as Walter Neff, but soon his wardrobe and "boasting" the apartment is not fit the mood of the original, or make it interesting character.He doing everything possible to make it work, but Samantha Egger really bad choice. English accent and California does not look soles velvet voice and sexual attraction to Barbara Stanwyck. Or J.Cobb tries powerful fashion Barton Keyes, but even his performance simply rough, without style. <br /> <br /> It feels like it was a TV movie, and again reminds me of some wonderful original film is still there.
