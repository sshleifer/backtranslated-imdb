Usually, when I go on the roads of the local Hollywood Video I am going to the horror B-movies. For me, the basic principles of in-Horror film is a value camp, Heavy Gore, a lot of unnecessary nudity, and special effects that anyone can put together a bundle of corn syrup and latex. I rented Cradle of fear strictly, because I was a fan of the band, as they released the first demo they were in 1995, the film began on an interesting note, and then when I saw Dani Filth stomp on extremely clear latex mask I laughed. When I saw the lesbian sex scene for a lesbian sex scene I laughed even harder. I spent quite a lot of the entire movie laughing, and if I did not laugh, I shake my head to think about how the multi-million dollar rock star wanted to make a film that seemed like it was on a budget hundreds of dollars of multi, The whole point of this film I thought, to attract Â«Hardcore Goth kids who think death, destruction, sex, blood, and Satan is the greatest thing invented since lava lamps. This was indeed the case. For me, this film seemed to 80.5% of what happened just happened in this movie to be Satanic. this film has a lot of potential and could really be a very good film, but in the end, this "film" is really just extended Cradle of Filth video
