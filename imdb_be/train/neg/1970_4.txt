Looking at this movie for the action, and a waste of time, because the dummy on the ships are better than people. This is the mercy that Anthony Quinn could not convince anyone else to let him send any other films after that turkey. <br /> <br /> But it is filled with entertainment value, as Yul Brynner have hair, Lorne Greene shows unconvincing French accent, and the rest of the big names in the rack of comic fashion.
