Janeane Garofalo was very public in her displeasure about the film, calling it, among other things, Antifeminism. She also said on her radio show, she hates to do, "a romantic comedy," because she does not believe in them. I fully agree with Jan here. This film is a trifle at best. She does her best, but overall, it was just another boring, incredibly "romantic comedy", which has no basis in the real world. While there will be those who will say "suspend disbelief", one gets tired of having to suspend it almost every time you get a romantic movie from Hollywood. character Janine, for some reason, as a rule, are taken in the shade and darkness, which makes it unattractive, while Uma character is shot in bright colors (which is probably unhappy with Janine, and probably one of the reasons why it I hate this movie). It really hurt the film, if we want to buy the premises that Janine is supposed to be better looking of the two. As many have said here and on other comments threads, Janine is not ugly, but it is actually quite beautiful. I have not read one review where someone said Uma better look. Having said that, though, I believe that the character of Ben Chaplin is more than likely to stay with Uma, not Janine. Many men do not like smart women actually (and many women do not like very intelligent people), and, unfortunately, Ben probably would have stayed with Uma. And, despite the attempts of the director to make Janeane unattractive, it does not work. Its natural beauty comes through anyway. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of fans Janine man who is obsessed with her, like this film, because they like to think of yourself in the character of Ben Chaplin, and actually killed from Janine. Janine is much more complex than the character she plays here (real life is always much more difficult, than Hollywood could imagine), so take a cold shower gentleman. This is the role that Janine is best known for, and it's a shame, because it really is not so good movie.
