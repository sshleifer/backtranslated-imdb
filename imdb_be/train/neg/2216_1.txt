I'm a fan of B movies, let me genetically mutated bat, and I'm in heaven. These movies are good for you to stop thinking about everything else going on in your world. Even silly B movie, as a rule, makes me laugh, and I still think it's a good thing. Then there was the Hammerhead, who was so awful I had to register IMDb, so that I can warn others. First there was the science of creating a shark-man that the film barely touched. To keep viewers interested, they just made sure there was blood every few minutes. During one attack scene camera moved the attack, but did you see what appears to throw a bucket of blood stagehand you to know that the attack was bloody, and people will probably be dead (which is fabulous special effects). Back to the science, I thought it was very interesting that female subjects were held naked and require test equipment that they will be controlled through the breast tissue. Anyway, this film had a weak development of the plot, a terrible story, and I'm sorry to say very bad acting. Not even William Forsythe, or Tile Jeffrey Combs can save this stinker.
