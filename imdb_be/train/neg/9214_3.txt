Many things became clear when watching this movie: 1) acting scared. Tom Hanks and Crewson so-so, but the father-child conflict boundaries soap opera-ish. The other two boy: Pouty overly stereotypical prodigy and your I-a-baby-but-I-really-sensitive inside blonde handsome; 2) film is generally disappointing and depressing; 3) dream and prevent episodes Robben (performed Tom Hanks); 4) inclusion in the beginning of love ballads strange choice ( "we are all special friends"); 5) the strange lines and the side portions are not made better a terrible effect; and 5) it really is a bad film. Wait to be disappointed - and probably broken.
