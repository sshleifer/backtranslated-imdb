I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico, and I ended up playing each Nuyoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I do not see 50% of those living in poverty. When I see people who are struggling, they are, as a rule, Haitians, Dominicans and Cubans who have recently arrived on the island. There's no such thing as Spanglish ... or you speak Spanish, or you do not know .... and from what I've heard ... you do not know. Pedro Campos Albizo NOT MLK me. MLK was a great man. Campos great man to those who want independence, which is 1%. The rest of it is replacing, as Osama bin Laden. Puertoricans, who want the independence of a bunch of fools. If you want any proof to all of you dreamers independent Puerto Rico, see Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, the whole of South and Central America and Mexico. It worked wonders for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this film was about Nuyoricans and their struggle. <br /> <br /> In order to face the complaint that not enough of Africa on the show ... it was suppose to be about Puerto Rico ... nya Africa. Denzel will make one soon just for you. <br /> <br /> In conclusion ... for all those ignorant white people who think that we need a green card to arrive in the US, and want to see as prime minister runs things, it is not good documentary about Puertorican culture. Tell your children to pay attention to the geography and history classes. <br /> <br /> *** Update *** <br /> <br /> Bocabonita ... "Doc." There were about Nuyoricans. It helped, as if it, as we all feel. If it was called ... "the year of soy nuyorican ... lunche ... can not speak Spanish." Discontinue use of Puerto Rico, Rican, Boricua, or anything else related to the PR WITH THIS NUYORICAN historical lessons . God forbid, they play it on the island.
