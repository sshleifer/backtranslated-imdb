<br /> <br /> After I ignored some of implausibilities, it was actually pretty decent horror / monster film. Thus, I will give some good points first: - the dragon was very convincing, especially when she wandered through the tunnels in search of dinner (hint: she loves people). - the action was pretty non-stop, and after a weak start, I got quite absorbed in the storyline. - Unfortunately, I was kind of introduction to the dragon - it was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the film <br /> <br /> Now for the unbelievable things maybe some spoilers ** **: -. If you hunted firedrake 1100 AD, you would have to charge to his cave with a barrel of gunpowder on hand? Duh. - a female character with all-American name, blond hair and clear Slavic accent, trying to pretend that it is Spanish? And? - a leading scientist, Slavic accent you can cut with a knife, and he reportedly was born in Chicago and educated in the United States? - a military helicopter pilot who makes their own repairs, flying a huge transport helicopter with no other crew, and is an expert marksman and a combat soldier in the bargain? GOOD. Uh-huh. I will not even mention it by giving 3 different callsigns for 2 minutes at communicating with its base. <br /> <br /> It's still better than some of the Japanese clicks monsters from the 60's, but not much. If we are lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, although, of course, the ending left this possibility open. Or, maybe, they will hire a director of REAL next time. <br /> <br /> In spite of everything, I gave this movie 4 out of 10. Add 2 if they rewrite the story, and Dean Cain gets eaten within the first ten minutes. <Grin>
