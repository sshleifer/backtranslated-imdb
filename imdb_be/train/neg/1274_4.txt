It was a movie about Sam and his wife, the glorious and Peter Falk as glorious Olympia Dukakis. It would have been a film worth seeing. Instead of this vehicle, Paul Reiser, Falk also a small one. Gorgeous Elizabeth Perkins as in this film, but you hardly know it. I believe Reiser is under the impression that he was a giant movie star who needs a suitable carrier. He's not. Even more outrageous is the fact that Reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best actresses of female characters on the screen now and then shoved them all into his background. Dukakis does not show up until the last 15 minutes, but when she does, the screen lights up. The story of Falk and Dukakis for sure, but it survived for a senseless, stupid, ridiculous road trip in which Reiser gets to show it can be, for example, as a very sweet, precious and about as deep a psychological (sic), in restaurant scene, I imagine Reiser hoped was "Cassavetes, as" there is the ridiculously false opposition between Reiser and Falk, so obviously ridiculous, I was ashamed of Falk.
