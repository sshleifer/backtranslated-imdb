I'm not one of those who think that the king is a great writer, his books are excellent distractions for a few hours, and often have interesting premises, but they are, in my opinion, fall apart pretty quickly if you give it any serious thought. <, Br /> <br /> This film suffers from being very precise retelling of the history of King. If you read the book, there are zero surprises, no change, no change scenes or characters. This is a film made by supporters of King for King supporters. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, there is nothing wrong in a film, this "Gypsy Curse" horror, with its twisting be a curse being that many people want to become thinner. The final third have some serious structural problems, and a little forced the ending seems to violate the rules of the genre a little. <br /> <br /> There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but you could also read the book, because there is nothing new ... <br /> <br />
