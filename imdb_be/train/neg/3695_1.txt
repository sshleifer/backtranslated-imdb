No better director movies.The actors focused on the star actor is projected, and not giving a good entertainer. Can be the hero himself, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it.But definitely not worth for neutral sequences audience.The battlefield are all comedy.The dance moves in sequences helpless songs. Music average.This film was the biggest failure for the actor. Despite the hype created over the film, the film failed miserably. Do not even think to look this step, even if you want to kill time. You can see some cartoon instead.A good movie buff can not digest this shit for 2 1/2 hours.
