I heard about this movie for years, and finally got the chance to see him. Massive minions guard even in 1963 and 1969 will eventually lead to a cheerleading camp to close. Fast forward to 1982, and Bambi, a former student opens it back with the new recruits, including candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (by Reinhold judge), and Sandy (Debralee Scott). One by one, they killed the killer, until only one remains. It is when we find out who did it and why. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film has Tom Smothers makes a terrible accent as a Canadian Mountie, and Paul Rubens makes his Pee-Wee Herman chip. The plot as a whole is not very well developed, and rather lame, but some funny scenes take place, namely Bad Pies house and strip poker scene. The ending seems that this is thrown together, it's a shame. <br /> <br /> In general, good for about ten or fifteen minutes total, and the rest you can just rewind. Maybe catch it on TV, but it's not worth buying.
