Watching this film was a waste of time. I was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie, but I resisted. I do not know what to appoint Ridley Scott, but I learned that in the army, women are just as stupid as men. They learn to spit, to insult and fight in the battle, and it is also a waste of time (in my opinion). And, anyway, what the hell, that final scene in Libya? They are still struggling Gadafi or is it that it's easy for everyone to believe that Islamic people are always dangerous?
