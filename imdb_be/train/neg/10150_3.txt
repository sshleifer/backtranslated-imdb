Humphrey Bogart clearly wanted to be in this film, and will be forced to play the role of the Mexican-or he would be suspended. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! Presumably, after the success of "Dodge CityÂ», Warners tried tracing with Errol Flynn and his pals the usual list, Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank McHugh and the ubiquitous John numerator, but they made a huge mistake I am trying to imagine Miriam Hopkins as the love interest for Flynn v. Randolph Scott, and as a singer, to really make things bad, because it has proven one thing, and that she can not sing. History is not so bad, but with a clear withdrawable also miscast, he was a bad western, which was long, and on a low budget, but in fairness, the color would not have helped.
