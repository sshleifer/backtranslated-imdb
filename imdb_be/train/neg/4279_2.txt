I found the DVD of "I Dream Of Jeanie" in the hopper $ 1.00 Wal-Mart. When I saw that it was "the story of Stephen Foster's" being a musician and music teacher, I had to see. I had no idea what year it was made for it does not say on the cover, just that it was a remake of the 1939 «Sewanee River". Image Bill Shirley composer sometimes painful, sometimes funny. Man has no testosterone and a wimp all the way through! I have a hard to believe Stephen Foster thought the music publishers are doing him a favor by publishing his songs ... not paying him for them! In addition to this absurd notion, there is almost a 20-minute segment, Ray Middleton and his black face «Christy Minstrels» sing songs of Stephen Foster, it was hard to look at, to say the least. I can hardly believe that somebody would take the film corresponding to revive in our current time. This confusion and should be forgotten. Fortunately, the songs of Stephen Foster never be forgotten .... too, Eileen Christy image with Jeanie, of course, is the highest point in the lowest point of the history of Hollywood.
