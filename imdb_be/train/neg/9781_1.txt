I do not think I'm too far from the base to say that this is perhaps the worst film I've ever seen. I worked in the list of my favorite movies about the war: "The Longest Day", "To hell and back", "Bridge on the River Kwai" (all black and white), all of which have good plots, rich characters and a lot of action. I have seen a better dialogue and acting in high school students' written one-act plays. The plot, however, is not a bad premise - just poorly implemented. It's kind of like a traffic accident, though, I could not seem to turn it off! The film did not need big money or big sets that "Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifeboat" to be good ... so that the budget is not an excuse. What were they thinking?
