This show is just annoying !!! Sorry for the actors to try to be funny (especially Bob Saget), a laugh track is trying to cover up the sad jokes and «Awwww» track is in the unnecessary time. The more dramatic the children are no exception, especially the Olsen twins. In addition, it shows the cliché of the city. If you were to look up the word cliché, it will read «Full House» Each storyline has a "life lesson" to be learned at the end. Juicy speech do better and even have the opportunity to make the most obstinate child has a sudden realization of good breath too bad it can not be possible in real life. I do not know how someone could watch this show, not bad mouthing behavior of the characters or laugh track. I find myself yelling at the TV saying "that is not FUNNY / SAD / CUTE» If life were really like this, the world will fall apart.
