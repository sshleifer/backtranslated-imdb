Nothing can prepare you for another lousy Bimbo picnic! At this time, this time brought to you never inevitable Fred Olen Ray! With regard to the operation of movies go, this one does not click! Like science fiction, it is clearly not original! All that we see is an ugly feminine android wear a bikini to destroy the earth, and all show that almost naked to resist! Give me a break f --- ING !!! If this kind of entertainment is your thing, then why not dust the old SI swimsuit MAGS from the attic to change? It would be much better if he did not put the sleaze factor very high, but still would not make it a great one. I would like to mention another movie called The Assault (1996) by Jim Wynorski, reminiscent of the transferor entity. This shows why the first-class first-person "femme fatale" Adventure does not translate well in America. Sorry guys!
