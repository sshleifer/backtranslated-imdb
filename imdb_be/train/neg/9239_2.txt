Heavenly Days commit serious comedy artificial: it is desperately trying to give us a lesson in citizenship, and he will not stop until we have passed the exam. Fibber McGee and Molly take a trip to Washington, where they see the Senate in action (or inaction, if you prefer) have a dispute with their Senator (Eugene Palette in one of the most feared roles of his career), meet flock annoying stereotypes of refugee children, as well as to meet with the man on the train, reading a book, Henry Wallace. Henry Wallace !! A year later, it was considered almost a Communist dupe, but it was A-OK in 1944. Add in some really terrible musical moments, a whole bunch of nonsense flagwaving and the sad story of the newspaper reporters, and you have a film that had to be prepared to pen Philip Wylie generation Vipers 2: PT Boogaloo. Radically unfun, heavenly day another reminder that the devil has all the best tunes.
