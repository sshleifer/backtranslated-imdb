Below average film with a bad music is considering a film based on the music ??? Normal Script & Direction with full slips. Salman Khan was in his usual activities. Ajay performance degrades over time, as well as his appearance, especially his styles as rock star was poor. Osin was only exhibit. Overall, I felt like spending their money in the movie. Salman Khan is still immature as 10 years ago compared to Amir Khan. There were a lot of songs in the film all the boring, except for «Man Ko Ati». The most important song to impress the UK Music Sponsor was the most impressive. «Khanabadosh» can be very easy to understand the sponsor of English music. Another movie that I saw in the «Wake Up Sid» last week, which was a slow love story with good leadership and action, despite the average music
