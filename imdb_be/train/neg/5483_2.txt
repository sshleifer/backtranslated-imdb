I just blew up four dollars to rent this movie! Why Atlantis Alliance will contribute to this poor excuse for a film me. But even more surprising was that enough good reviews that it is time the Canadian newspaper critics gave the film. I am tired of our media to justify the film simply because it's a Canadian and a low budget. It's like they expect that Canadian movies to be lousy, so they give a good view no matter <br /> <br /> Now the movie :. Action was below average (with the exception of the lead male character, which was actually pretty good). The quality of the film was poor, I think you would expect from a very low budget. The script was absolutely horrible. An example is a story that revolves around one of the main characters, female drug trafficker, was flirting with one of his clients, so she could recruit him to correct and steal a bicycle to his gang, whose only goal is to accidentally destroy the SUV. Presumably, many of the members of her bike gangs killed in these events (I do not know how she can not afford to just buy a new, as it has to be this big drug business communications from Vancouver to Toronto). <, Br /> <br /> In any case, the history of a point (which does not appear in more than half way through the movie) is that a drug dealer plans Firebomb buildings in the Toronto area, to try to make the home more accessible - as No single will want to live in the area <br /> <br /> - .. Need I say more <br /> <br /> Shame film Festival in Toronto for making such a film, a TV movie for its support, and the Globe and mail and Georgia Straight newspaper for the provision of such biased reviews. <br /> <br /> film should not get special treatment just because a Canadian !!!!
