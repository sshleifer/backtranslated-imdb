Summary: Dr. Mark has developed a new theory of how to produce energy, knowledge that can unbalance the world. It retains its encoded knowledge and mystery, and desperately want to get out of the Soviet Union. KGB on the other side desperately wants a new technology. Thus, they are set in motion diagram. During a rescue attempt to free Markov, KGB steps in, Markov takes place in secret and beckons him to reveal his secret, saying that they are in Sweden, as well as the work of the UN. As a backup, the KGB kidnaps daughter who lives Markov. The CIA now send their best agents, the team (Swedish?) Ninjas, to prevent the KGB and save Markov and his daughter <br /> <br /> Note :. Cult film, despite not being very good need to see. The film is quite ambitious, but lacking in many areas. Firstly, it is very dark, probably to hide the location and bad consequences that some scenes are difficult to understand. You can not see what is happening. The second thing that is lacking is the martial arts, though the ninja movie. Of course, there are some with a rather poor quality, but mostly Ninja shoot automatic weapons or sets of explosion. Automatic guns are a problem just as they seem to have an endless supply of ammunition. And Ninja seems almost impervious to bullets while Soviet guards are dying like flies. <br /> <br /> What does he have that said about him then? The idea and purpose of the whole. Some indeed, especially for Swedish cinema, decent action scenes, though not martial arts. Some good scenes slow and a lot of blood and gore. And a very interesting technology, new weapons, making the victims of the heart or brain explode. Basically, all the details that you are looking for in the B-movie. <br /> <br /> Because, of course, is a B-movie, no error can not be there. But if you are expecting, and watch as a B-movie, it's interesting. But do not forget that it is not only B-movie it is installed in the eighties. Some girls, for example, in addition to wear ... lets say "interesting" clothes have lethal dose shadows for eyelids and make-up. <br /> <br /> In general, refer to cult status and ambitions. Enjoy it, and forget about it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
