I can not even believe that this show lasted as long as it did. I believe that this is all part of the dumbing down of America. Personally, I like David Spade said, I liked this show better if he went by its original name - «Seinfeld». What bothers me most about this show apart from the obvious, the foundations of meaning "humor", and the general obscenity, is a pretentious way entitled episodes. Really great show is still funny after many repeated viewings, as "the one where Rob gets accidentally hypnotized" to "Dick Van Dyke Show" or "the one where Lucy and Ethel working at the candy factory." In other words, it is an honor had a great program, the audience. what the authors and producers of "friends" will have the unmitigated arrogance is actually the title of the episodes, in itself, so before anyone else had a chance even to see it a second time, saying not only the incompetence and lack of original thinking on the part of the said authors, but also with the stultified the minds of its viewers. <br /> <br /> Did you read the comments of some of these people, and you can only come to the conclusion that they live in a Hallmark Card, like Neverland, full of feelings greeting card. True the meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Call. These people need to work in a cafe and looking for a job as actors, but they somehow manage to live in a $ 4,000 / month. apartment? Get real. All I have to say to those among us who want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic life in New York with the Rosses and Monicas, success with all of this. This New York does not exist for those who make less serious six-figure income. But good luck to all that, anyway. Now, shut-off and transfer of soma.
