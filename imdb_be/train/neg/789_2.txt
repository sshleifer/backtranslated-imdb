five minutes after seeing this I went into IMDb, to warn all of you out there do not bother with this film ... Genre: horror? These were moments of mild uncertainty and throughout the film, I thought to myself, "what is going to happen in the near future," it is not so ... when the movie ended I felt so embarrassed for the writer / directors I've never been the biggest fan of Patrick sub ' objective this guy just does not know how to make movies, and after watching this pathetic excuse horror flick I've gone from not the biggest fan will not follow up one of his works .. <br /> <br /> I had got into a short story please, do not make the same mistake. <br /> <br /> I made this film for 2 actors..they was not bad and it was not there fault they got such bad direction ...
