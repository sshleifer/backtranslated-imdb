Despite the fact that many other people thought about the first film, I really liked it. This one, however. How to sum up in one word: This film (and here comes the word): Shit <br /> <br /> But let's look at it part by part: That is the story: Finally, the old queen has been removed from his castle, but its successor: Snow White has a problem of another kind: Court-Jester, the father of her son, lost, like super, Spliss, goes to extremes to combat gray hair and sells royal offspring for some blond and full of hair. In his desperation, Snow White is looking for help Bubi (Otto Walkees), which should be the first to find his six other dwarf satellites, and then try to find a royal offspring, or at least try to find the name Rumpelstiltskin. <br /> <br /> the whole story seems to have been written for the weekend, where the writers were very drunk, but was only under pressure from the studio to write the script. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some good jokes. Even for fans of the first part, or for fans of any of the other actors, it's really not worth buying a DVD. Trust me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that, at least in part saves the movie from complete oblivion, are the performances of some actors. That's why I gave the course 3/10. Unfortunately, the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them taken together can not compensate for bad history. <br /> <br /> For example, at one point, they even crossed into our reality, and unfortunately nothing funny .. they do while here. <br /> <br /> However, a lot of good actors in this film: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen (especially funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann like a mirror, Helge Schneider and many more but Unfortunately all of these comedians are not able to prove this is a very bad scenario for life. <br /> <br /> Maybe, it is a pleasure for some hardcore fans, but also for ordinary movie lovers or DVD right now tenants or buyers is not worth the money. <br /> <br /> I even regret renting a movie.
