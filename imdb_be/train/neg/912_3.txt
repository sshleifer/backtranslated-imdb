Sequels are not based on a novel or a book does not have much to often, and this is a great example of one <br /> <br /> Well I'll be frank with you :. I even laugh a little, it has a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor. But do not buy it, rent it. Just let some other idiot to do it or download it. <br /> <br /> 4/10 This film will be remembered, and the director is probably laughing already ...
