it was the most pointless movie I've ever seen, as there was no plot and the actors do not seem to care. 90% of the film was absolutely no plot at all, I laughed so hard my ribs began to ache. bits, where the old, if the grip Robert Duvall was ridiculous. on the director's level, to make a film noir does not involve a lot of rain and meaningless sequence to close-ups of the protagonist. This unsuccessful attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienate the viewer with incoherent scenes. seeing as it was based on the "manuscript" John Grisham I do not consider this as one of his books adaptations because it does not reflect any of the unknown and attractive plot in movies such as "company" or «The Rainmaker».
