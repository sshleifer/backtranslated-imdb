The only reason why I am commenting because I finally understood why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realize it at the same time this week, Dr. Cox bald, because they showed these scenes in a different order than they were filming them. The last episode, when our favorite irritable, Jesus loves Nurse Roberts dies Dr. Cox shaves his head. We should have shown them out of action for some reason, and forgot they were wrong continuity. Feel free to scrubs. They made mistakes like this before. I remember when Elliot tries to date Scott Foley and her hair is wet for 2 seconds before the water hits it. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite show must activate it.
