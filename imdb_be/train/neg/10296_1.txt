It was probably just my DVD --- but I would not recommend that anyone try to watch the picture on the DVD. <br /> <br /> I had to turn up the volume on the TV to the highest possible level, in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialogue. Some of the calls remains subsonic. If you are from Scotland, you might have a chance, albeit a thin one. <br /> <br /> Peoples voices were drowned out almost all ambient sounds, including unwrap the package, steps, even smoking a cigarette. <br /> <br /> With the volume up to the level at which voice can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will call the police, when a scene change in a noisy environment, such as at the disco, and that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down. <br /> <br /> There is an art and is art, even in the field of audio mixing. But this effort, in time of war, in accordance with international criteria to be classified as a crime. <br /> <br /> About half an hour I gave up, having seen nothing redeeming in the picture, either.
