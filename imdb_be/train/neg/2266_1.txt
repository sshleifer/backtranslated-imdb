Manege, pathetic excuse Jerry Springer for wasting film, which should be reused as toilet paper recently destroyed my faith in the art of cinema. First of all, it was done. Second, people have gone to see it. Third, some people voted it the best movie they've ever seen. If a monkey can make a movie, I'm 100 percent sure that this will be one billion times better. Most Crappy movies have their moments (even Godzilla had several cool special effects) the time this film was when I went to the theater nauseated. The only thing that maybe could have made this film will be worse if Jerry Springer was the star. If I want to look at the shit for an hour and a half, I'll take a dump in the bank. If someone does not despise this film, I feel sorry for you and your children and your children's children children; However, contrary to the beliefs SPRINGER, I obviously do not condone children having sex.
