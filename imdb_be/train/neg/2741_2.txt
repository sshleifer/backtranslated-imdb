Of course, not funny. <br /> <br /> Bonham Carter realistic (one assumes) tries to lifelike speech was difficult to understand than the first 15 minutes in a Lancashire accent «Full Monty». <br /> <br /> poetic ending with him on a high hill with her buried under the terrible his plane was too orderly.
