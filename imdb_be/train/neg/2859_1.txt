It is made in 2007 and CG bad for a film made in 1998 on the one hand, the film is stop motion shot of a dinosaur, which is really looks good, but it just makes it extremely amateur work on material CG look even worse. <br /> <br /> in writing, acting, directing, and everything else in this film, just awful. This is as bad as, if not worse, than the island and Raptor 100000000 BC ... pure crap! Again, as with other films, but the scary part of this movie is that it's actually been made and is currently being aired on the sci-fi channel. <br /> <br /> I still can not understand how they in some way to the people who really have some acting skills to act in these films, and then somehow make them act as terrible as everyone else in the film. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are not sure if the other poster, obviously sarcasm in his review ... or is he one of those who worked on this film.
