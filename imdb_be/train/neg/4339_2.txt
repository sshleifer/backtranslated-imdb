This movie was not what I expected. <br /> <br /> If this movie has been named something else no one would notice the difference between them. <br /> <br /> it's really weird, because I do not see the point. prequel and sequel lets just say it makes no sense, it is not even the same. maybe I'm naive, but not 1 and Volume 2 is matched. <br /> <br /> Carlito was in prison in the first and dies in the original and in the prequel, he lives and is not going to jail. <br /> <br /> plot was okay, but they need to be changed round some actors and some of the storyline and the film's title, and it would be a good movie. <br /> <br /> I really expected it to end like the other began. <br /> <br /> If someone has an opinion on this post it please.
