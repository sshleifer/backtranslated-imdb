Summary: According to legend, the Valkyrie Brünnhilde challenged each and was chained to a rock, surrounded by an eternal flame. Only a pure heart, a warrior can go through the fire, free Brünnhilde and free her from Odin's claims, and have it to yourself. Now war is brewing in the Nordic countries, and the king needed an alliance with Berserk. Berserker warriors claim Valkyries Odin, eager for war, blood and flesh, and, consequently, the marginalized, and the advantage in battle. The leader of the Berserker is despised son of the king, a boar, and the price for the alliance is his brother, the future king, Barek. But after King wins the battle, he does not want to give up his only remaining son, violating his oath to the boar, and to give him and kill him. Wild boar is retained only when you call in Barek after Odin. But this is only the beginning of the battle between the brothers, and the final battle is about to start now, millennia later ... <br /> <br /> Comments: I was hoping that it would be a movie based on some Viking land, the quality of the movie too little about Viking has been done. He started very well also, with detailed and long shells of ships, beautiful and fitting landscapes and battle OK. <br /> <br /> The fund myths æsir is thin and appears to be very corrupt me. Odin far more vengeful, angry and missing, which I remind him up from school, and Valkyrie has been transformed into some vampire-demon. I'm no expert, but it seems that it is not just like that. <br /> <br /> But the fatal flaw of the film to move the time setting of the initial period of time to the present day. When the two brothers fought it at the right time, with some decent battles, this movie would have been much better. The installation is now, suddenly gives way today in Stockholm. However, Odin Odin is present and sends a boar and his berserker for Brünnhilde and Barek, giving the foolish scene when armored and painted with berserker swordfights Barek among industries. Beautiful mountains and forest were replaced with cement. And if allowed to concentrate on the singles battles, not mass battles as in the beginning, I quickly realized that the fighting skills of the actors and the slow and clumsy. <br /> <br /> As a result, a thin story, it is sometimes difficult to follow, and sometimes just plain stupid, and the only thing that can save him, action, drawn from the slow, stupid and clumsy swordfights. He draws very little from the Æsir myth or tradition of the Vikings. As the story and the action fails, and the film is simply bad. <br /> <br /> And finally, as a Swede, this film is a bit confusing. Presumably filmed entirely in South Africa, it still contains some familiar Swedish badges, plates and what seems to be a real police car. However, a poor effort and only goes so far as to ascertain it in Sweden. Names are not a Swede (possibly with Anya, as an exception), are not familiar scenery is not the Swedes, they (presumably) to speak a little (ancient?), Norwegian, Swedish Armed Forces. And the form, as the police and health, is clearly not Swedish. If they were not going to even try to do it right - and actually give the illusion that it is established in Sweden, why bother? <br /> <br /> 4/10
