I saw this movie today at the Film Festival in cinema Haifa in Israel, after hearing rave reviews, but I believe that the critics just suck up Willem Dafoe and his wife (the director), who attended the festival. This is definitely the slowest film I've ever seen numerous nonsensical, ridiculously long scenes nothing. Also Defoe, who was a decent acting from two and a half other people in the film, Dafoe Giada wife included, was terribly funny (as they put part of a saleswoman in a bakery for me). This film is pretty much plot less than a lame attempt to be abstract and from the wall. The only scene that mixes any reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came out of nowhere, as though just to add some shocking stupidity, which this film. Sorry for so harsh, but in fact this film is a waste of valuable time and money. I appreciate a good indie movie, but this movie is not worth the time moviegoers.
