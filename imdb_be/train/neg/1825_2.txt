I'm not sure. I just could not laugh at him. I had an open mind. I do not want to be tight- @ ss about it. But I seriously could not laugh at this movie. It was just not funny to me. Some parts of it, it seemed like Ben Stiller and Jack Black overdone. Just because you put two very funny people together does not mean that it will be a great comedy. Some movies simply should not be made. This is one of them. Because it makes a lot of old jokes and the action was just silly. I know, I know that it's a comedy. Sorting at least. But I just was not impressed. I'm sorry, but I can not give it anything less than two. And that's all I give. <br /> <br /> 2/10
