First of all, I must admit, Batman: The Animated Series is the best series of orderly far. We watched as it used to be on TV. I had not realized that there was a season four. In fact it was not. BTAS end of Season 3, and he had to stop there. <br /> <br /> Why do they have to mess with a good thing. Catwoman and Poison Ivy is now horrible gray faces. Joker goes beyond scary, it seems that every time they revise its appearance it looks more and more terrible. He seems to have no more to have students, and now he does not even look remotely human (though it is). <br /> <br /> Bruce Wayne voiced by Kevin Conroy, who makes the best Batman. Despite the fact that it now looks like Superman. There's nothing that distinguishes it, because they both look the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes. <br /> <br /> Night Wing really needs a haircut, please! Alfred has a pupil of the eye, more like a character from the 80s. <br /> <br /> I've watched three episodes from the disk 1 in the series, and I think that this version is more powerful and graphics (to eat. blood in each episode) <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Batman: the Animated series, Batman NO season 4. They just turned the series as the season 4 to feasibility. If they just released it as The New Batman Adventures, I do not think so many people would buy it. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the frustration and follow the seasons 1-3.
