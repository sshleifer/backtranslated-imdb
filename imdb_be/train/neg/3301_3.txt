The standard procedure for the Swedish films today seem to start throwing the credibility of the window and continue on this path for the rest of the process. RÃ¥narna another excellent example of the film makes very little sense. <br /> <br /> Banks in Stockholm robbed of highly effective "military-style" gang of robbers. Two police officers started investigation of the case, which will soon become more difficult than it may seem at first glance. <br /> <br /> As usual in the Swedish film actors are mainly composed of the same people you saw, over and over again. Mikael Persbrandt should be in every Swedish movie from the past few years! But that's okay, I guess, because Persbrandt is one of the few that performs respectably here (as he usually does). The problems associated with this film mostly revolves around the story. First of all robberies feel primarily as a background. Rather, it's more a film about a young Yvonne struggles to prove herself in a man's world (as it has been done a thousand times before, instead of with a decent actress Sofia Helin). In addition, there is an absolutely incredible twist at the end that seems as plausible as Aliens landing. But still, I really thought it was a pretty nice touch, considering I slept right then. This sharp things up a bit (and actually saved the rating from falling another step). <br /> <br /> In the end, the main problem is the same as most other Swedish films of this kind. Just that action and suspense do not live up to the standards that we are used to from other kind of movies (mostly Hollywood). It feels cheap and relatively weak in comparison. In my opinion, the Swedish filmmakers should try to focus on the story and the action and forget about trying to make the "Hollywood-action of light," as they do now. Because it is becoming another forgettable effort by the Swedish film industry. I rate it 3/10.
