I'll be brief and to the point. This film was insult any of IQ room temperature. Unfortunately liberal feminists etc. No woman will never Seal. They can forget about the project or to be in a battle, too. Not going to happen. You see, it is difficult, as to understand or accept that men and women are physically different.Regardless the fact that it is 2007, the reality can not change things for people to avoid their feelings hurt. Men can not give birth or breast-feeding (O-I forgot about San Franfreako). <br /> <br /> The women do not have enough physical strength to be on a par with men in combat or other physically demanding situations. How many women have to play in the NFL or the NHL? And, finally, I could not give a bloody hoot in hell, if what I just wrote you.Come care to think about it - if it is not upset that only warms my heart more. I did not write one that was not true. This imbecilic film is nothing more than a comedy and lousy at it.
