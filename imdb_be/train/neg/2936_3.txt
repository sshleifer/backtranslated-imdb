I was also intrigued by the high (8.5) rating for this film, and was very disappointed. I just saw a couple of good foreign films and was looking forward to make it three in a row, but it was not to be. I went with a friend speaks Spanish who felt the same way. There is not much plot, if any. I'm not sure that in the film, but for this it is necessary to somehow entertain or bring me. The best thing that I could say that it tends to be Altman-esque film, albeit from a very small ensemble. Of course, there are moments, but after a few minutes easy to get thinned 97 minutes of slow anything. I do not understand the high rating for this film. I give it a 3. <br /> <br />
