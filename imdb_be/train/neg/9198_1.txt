There are people out there who will Greenlight nothing! It's the only explanation I can offer, why House of the Dead movie there. And that's just the scary part for the entire film. It's so bad that you'll go from a movie ever. I seriously wanted to switch it off and switch on the TV to the channel Paint drying, but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing. I do not know why I'm doing these bad things to yourself. <br /> <br /> As if it matters, that is the main tech with "stories". The group of twenty so desperate to get out on some island in the Pacific Northwest (Canada actually, because it's cheap) for Â«Rave Age" (consisting of about 8 people and non-insane music) that they pay a craggy old fisherman $ 1,000 to take them there after they release the main couple. This must be some kind of rave, are all that dough! Fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the island of the dead (hang on, I thought it was the house of the dead?), And they are all doomed yadd yadda Yadda. <br /> <br /> The first mistake here. Why tiny rave (Ages my foot!) Will be held on some remote island? Why would anyone willingly pay tons of money to get it? Why pay more craggy old fisherman to take them when they could just go back to the others? <br /> <br /> Once they arrive, they find that the rave (consisting of about 2 tents, a small stage and a port-a-john) was broken, there is blood everywhere, and no one is around. What would any rational person to do? Run for your life, of course. But no, these ignorant, apparently blind people decide to go to look for them. They soon discover an old ramshackle house that is 50 times as big inside as it is on the outside. Just half an hour stumbling around in the forest stands as an excuse to kill some of the smaller characters, and after much anguish they again come back to the house. Symbols, like a movie, go nowhere. <br /> <br /> stuck in this terrible catastrophe is overkill gibberish dialogue, action will be, fetish exposure and countless clips of the once-popular arcade game with the same name. Why it was recognized as a good idea with the directors, I'll never know. Clips have no relation to any of the scenes and only aggravate the trash even more, if at all possible. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with the game except for a cheap, single line at the end. This makes Resident Evil look cinematic glory. Heck, even the movie Double Dragon seems multi-Oscar Worthy compared with this junk. The only one who comes out of this with his dignity intact are Prochnow. He could have just picked up his money and ran, but he tries his best to worst scenario and brings tiny pathos of his character. The rest of the cast to suck, I'm afraid. Symbols idiots and deserve to die. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you cut out swearing and pointless nudity, I do not see any reason why this film should not be shown on Saturday morning TV. It's not scary in the least. Pirates of the Caribbean scarier than skeletal bad guys in this film. And where all these bad guys come from anyway? There were only a few people on the island to start with. I believe that this justifies the reason they decided to reuse the footage again and again. I'm not kidding, you see the same zombies die dozens of times. <br /> <br /> Who is ultimately to blame, that the scandalous waste of celluloid? No one except the director Uwe Boll. His control over the movie does not exist. You can clearly see the actors do not have the slightest idea what they should do, and that the zombies do not really taking it seriously. Actors, it seems that they read from the crib, as they constantly break in the middle of long sentences and to talk as soon as they see the next card. All this looks very unnatural. <br /> <br /> In addition the film is as a two-part mini-series. I really saw the best television productions. And do not get me started on the editing. The film is an incoherent babble with thousands of thousands of senseless shots and dozens of mindless camera pans. There is no real skill or talent not been put into making it at all. It really boggles the mind and excites both films is mysteriously ill can get done and George A. Romero can not even get anyone to call him. dead house do some stupid references to Romero in a lazy attempt to be "postmodern," but it's just annoying that they think it's in the same league as a true zombie movie. <br /> <br /> For what it's worth, 1.85: 1 anamorphic picture looks great and Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean, but very impressive and serves only to say much more excessive ADR. DVD comes with extras, but why torture yourself. Is not that a review warning enough? Stay away! You're all doomed, I tell you! Convicted! Convicted !!!
