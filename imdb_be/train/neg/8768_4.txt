Now, please do not start calling me names, as "unpatriotic", "eccentric" and much more. <br /> <br /> The very length of the film (4 hours .. !!!) is his biggest mistake. No editing at all - unlike, J.P. Datta fell in love with his project too much. Even Lagaan was a long 4 hours - but it was interesting and gave a message, as well as <br /> <br /> It is based on real incidents and real people .. Kudos to him, but there were repeated scenes of war really necessary? On top of it is constantly changing focus from one battalion / squadron to another, and it was impossible to keep track of them all. <br /> <br /> Between battles, there were songs about loneliness, Lovesickness and related things. They were friendly conversation. In the beginning it gave some relief from the violence, but it has become so monotonous that later could even correctly predict the nature of the upcoming conversation. <br /> <br /> Why did the soldiers go, as if they were lions in the jungle, not knowing that the enemy is lurking somewhere close? And when they were removed, it is sympathy, but it seemed to be paying no attention to them, to be so confident of their safety first. <br /> <br /> The music was melodic and the lyrics were sincere, but do not fit into the movie, better to hear them on the soundtrack, but not in the cinema <br /> <br /> Acting It was a saving grace :. From experienced veterans like Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan, relative newcomers like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshay Khanna, all act like a professional. Manoj Bazhpai and Ashutosh Early deserve special mention for lighting mood every time you need it. <br /> <br /> Conversations ranged from brilliant ( "From Madhuri .. with love !!") to illogical / monotonous ( "Pakistan currently zyada musalman Hindusthan Maine Hain"). Bran whoopee, consisting of all the CA, BCS, Cs and the F-word is not really required. <br /> <br /> LOC Cargo attempts to provide a tribute to the brave Indian soldiers, but tries too hard, and ultimately fails. Indian soldiers certainly deserve a better tribute.
