I was excited to see this movie, expecting that it will be a continuation of the cult "Private Lessons", which show the dream of any male teenager. <br /> <br /> «Private Lessons II» has nothing to do with the name I mention. This is just an ordinary soft core Cinemax flick that will not make changes in your life. There's only one hot sex scene in the roof, but that's all. I watched it a long time ago, but believe me, it's just plain boring soft core flick. <br /> <br /> Women are hot, but this is not enough to rent or buy the movie. My advice is to look only if it is broadcast on cable.
