This movie is terrible. I'm really looking forward to it, I thought "Lanthanum" was great. <br /> <br /> In the following review may contain spoilers * * <br /> <br /> <br /> ***** <br /> First, the good things: it looks great, some of the He performed in order. Bad things are still on it. <br /> <br /> The story, as you may know, some of the guys who go fishing and to discover the body, with a twist, they find it on Friday, but to continue fishing, and finally, to inform the Sunday, when they return to the mobile (cell phone) range. However, the film takes the time (boy does it take your time) to get to this central event. <br /> <br /> With the ensemble of characters (about a dozen), rather than one, it seems like another (which, I believe, consistent, because they are all unpleasant). I was very disappointed with the inability to adequately explain how the characters are related, and it was not until near the end of the film, which I could vaguely build a family tree. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think about the film we relentlessly dark, that the denial of narrative structure, as life of the character, it seems just as bad before fishing as after. Once you have set the bar so high that it is hard up he grabs all committed suicide. <br /> <br /> There are silly mistakes in logic. The killer dumps the body in the lake, and then somehow drifts miles upstream into the mountains. Fishermen go out on Sunday morning, but for some reason Byrne comes home late at night after his wife went to bed. Then the first thing the next morning, the police beat on the door to get it to come down to the station. Um, they did not hear the phone? At the bottom of the station, the media know the whole story, less than 24 hours after they reported the body? <br /> <br /> In general, the story lacks debate Guys, of course, it was after they found the body. It's a secret - everyone asks them "how could you do this?" And the audience asked the same question. (The discussion about what to do with the body is a key scene in "Liberation"). I know exactly what I would do in their situation. Someone has to go to the car to go to the mobile range, call the police, wait, and send them back into place. When others are waiting in the camp and fish, who cares? <br /> <br /> A lot of it all just seems false. The only thing that rang true in the fact that the girl was wearing a black, local natives seized fishermen as racist actions -. "It would not have done if it was a white girlÂ» <br /> <br /> For all have an interesting indifference to someone who could kill a girl (I think that the topic is mentioned once), and there is no secret, as the viewer sees the killer in the first scene. <br /> <br /> So I'm sitting there at the same time sad and confused when there is a twist - not in the plot, but the subject suddenly becomes quiet dignity of the dead natives, which lead to the QMS. otnay ending with some incoherent material on the black-and-white reconciliation. Yes? <br /> <br /> This is the Australian film "in the best possible way", depending on age.
