I want to say that I am a Christian first (and I work in the film and television industry), so I know how it is to work on a feature-length film, so props to the filmmakers in this regard. I'm all for positive, sublime messages if true nature of life (this is a fallen world, and that things do not always work ... even for followers of Christ). I am glad that others who have the extremely positive response to open the Christian message; for me it was just that the execution, where the film fell on his face. The film lives and dies on its history, and here you have a one-dimensional stereotypes, exposure, and a wealth of spontaneous changes in the behavior of characters who, for unknown reasons, to say the least. I believe that the film is not the club you over the head with its message, to get the point across. I'm sure Kendrick Bros. improve with time, and that their storytelling techniques will be well. Maybe they could send a script someone else as his next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports movies are not really my first love, but a good friend (Ferrand, Field of Dreams, and so on) can cause a variety of ways. If you would be interested in a PG-rated film that inspires, to Steven Soderbergh's "King of the Hill" look. All truth is God's truth ...
