I went to school with Jeremy Earl, which, as I heard about this movie, I do not know when he was in the theater at all. I do not remember the name. I've seen it, it's like one of those after school specials. Actions in order not great. The plot was kind of weak, and the lines were fairly commonplace. Thus, the only comment I can give this film is "E" I borrowed a movie with Jeremy, if I was in the video rental place, it is one that I would walk by, and after seeing it I would not recommend it to anyone past secondary school age. I also noticed that a lot of times, when the city children drew, jargon abused or simply outdated. Many times I think that's what makes their characters incredibly.
