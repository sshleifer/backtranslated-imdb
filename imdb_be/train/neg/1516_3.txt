While the herd has some pretty good acting veteran Richard Gere, and some good shots that could HARKEN some back to the days of Silence of the Lambs, the movie takes trust to the point of rupture and destroys itself in an area that really leads nowhere. <, Br /> <br /> film about Erroll Babbage (Gere), who works in the department of safety and preparing to retire. His office imposes him his replacement Allison Lowry (Claire Danes, Stardust), who discovers quickly that Babbage was obsessed with his work. And this work is not very fun. It controls hundreds of sex offenders who are on parole in their jurisdiction. Allison comes with Errol many calls to check on his "flock" of criminals and learns that he desperately needs in retirement. But Errol good at his job, even if his methods are not. He mocks sexual predators, and even has a physical conflict with them. Errol justify their actions, educating the past these perverts. It is "a good excuse" that challenges the audience on some level that allows us to see how hard Errol and yet how is the touch he became (by being too close to his work). <br /> <br /> When a girl goes missing in the "area" Errol, he jumps to the immediate conclusion that it was stolen by one of his flock. But how could he know? Is Errol is good at his job? Allison challenges him and Errol moves. Their battles became as furious as Errol need to find the missing girl. <br /> <br /> While the setting for the story was good, he had no umpf! I will give credit to Richard Gere, however, who plays the character very well Errol. Fighting in retirement. Worried about all who are close to his flock. Dissatisfied with those he is responsible for overseeing. Dissatisfied with in order to do some things that he does. Quite a change in the character image to Gere. But not much else besides him. Some of the sets in the order (a dark and dangerous), but there are so many other issues, how to be funny. <br /> <br /> I'll be the first to admit that the suspension of disbelief is a requirement if you watch movies. But the suspension has its limits. The biggest push against these limitations is to destroy the very life of crime scenes. Someone as meticulous as Errol will know that the body movement would not be a huge no-no. Or trample through crime. Or evidence move. This goes beyond the hurt and the movie will not end. <br /> <br /> On the other damaging part of this movie is that we never get into character Danes, Allison. She almost fell by the wayside at the end of the movie, and we have never been involved in what may be its intention: Will she stay or go? Will it end up like Errol if she did not stay? It's not a terrible film, how it relates to some uncomfortable moral ground, but the story as a whole need to tighten.
