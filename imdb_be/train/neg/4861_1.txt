In the glory days of the 90s (rest his soul), you can enable a large Comedy Central at any time of the day and see the greatest sketch comedy show of all time on Saturday Night Live. Whpat glorious show that was, whether it was the original no-Ready for Primetime Players or the second golden age of SNL depicting greats- Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade ... and then it all went to hell, I was first exposed MADtv year and a half ago, and I think I must have been cut down from the shock. As it may seem so scary dominated for so long? There are so many terrible flaws. I suppose I'll start writing. Compilation, for the most part, it's terrible. This is nothing like a kindergarten bathroom humor. The cast, for the most part, is an incompetent. There are a few sketches I used, for example, some of Ms. Swan and Stuart, and there are several talents on the show, such as the splendid Borshteyn. Phil LaMarr talented actor, not just as a comedian. While a few rare moments haha, they are not enough to pay off this endless line of horrible nonsense populated babbling idiots. Miss this one.
