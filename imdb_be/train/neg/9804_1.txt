Power Rangers, the senile merchandising TV kids show from the 1990s, to be the most senseless and ridiculous television show ever produced. <br /> <br /> What is the meaning of the show anyway, but to sell a second rate plastic nonsense children? There's nothing even remotely interesting or sacrifice on the show anyway. <br /> <br /> Look for costumes that look like spandex spoiled. <br /> <br /> mullet hair style, earrings, and fashion of the early 1990s seem quite ridiculous these days. <br /> <br /> To avoid this show at all costs!
