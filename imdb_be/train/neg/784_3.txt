Despite positive reviews and screened at international festivals, this film is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story is very similar to other films in which a teenage girl from a family of immigrants must overcome many common personal problems of her age, and also to deal with the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. It does this by choosing any kind of sport, and with the help of a local boy who, for whatever reason, falls in love with her, she is faced with problems and defeats. <br /> <br /> In Girlfight is boxing in Bend It Like Beckham's football, and now it's kung fu. <br /> <br /> But the fighter is much worse than the product of the two, it was just embarrassing to watch. Semra Turan, the "actress", which plays the role of a teenage girl, probably can do many things, but one thing she can not do this act. Her presence on the screen of anemia and clumsy, the dramatic situation in which she is trying to show some emotion, horrible, her body language and people is amateur actresses bad instruct the director. The rest of the cast is a bit better, but they can not save this movie clich√©s with stereotyped characters and shallow story. In addition, relatively few good moments, this film has nothing new or interesting to offer. <br /> <br /> Even a kung fu fight that is no reason to look at it, it's just so sad. The slow movement was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and lacked inspiration and most of the kung fu scenes just training or standing in all kinds of kung fu position is not really fighting. Not to mention how funny it looks when a small and slender girl fights big and muscular boys, and knocks them down. <br /> <br /> The only reason this film was seen at all, because it is European. It is very easy to publish this video - the first martial arts film from Denmark, but do not be fooled, this is not so. It's just a stupid drama about a teenage girl and her problems, which, incidentally, is not very convincing. <br /> <br /> A bad film with awkward lines, actions and history.
