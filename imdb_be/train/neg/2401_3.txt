I've seen the best teenage werewolf movies in my time, this is one, however, takes the cake. More comedy than horror, «Full Moon High» puts the "s" in the cheese festival. Star quality in this film is not bad. Just the way it was done simply sends the box office under the mountain. Adam Arkin plays Tony, an all-American high 50s football school who ends up never gets old because of the bite of a werewolf in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the film was a violinist. He went every Batty! Ed McMahon played his ultra-conservative father, who met his end his own bullet. Father Adam, Alan plays a psychoanalyst who does not seem to the top of his game. After all these years, Tony, it seems very ridiculous because of the attack, and then he'll get a chance to catch in his state. More laughter than to shed blood, this film is just the beginning in the 80s, "cub" was an improvement compared to this! 1 out of 5 stars.
