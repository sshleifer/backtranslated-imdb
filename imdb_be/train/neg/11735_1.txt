This movie made me really mind, because the main characters, or all characters have a Southern accent. I lived in Iowa for 29 years, and I know that people do not have a Southern accent here. This film is about a guy who makes methamphetamine, and I do not know the real story and the film assumes to be well. He has some pretty graphic drug use in it, and it really hurt so much to see that these men used methamphetamine, as it was sugar. I lost my brother, methamphetamine, and this film makes me sick to my stomach, because it is an attractive product. The film makes him look cool to use the drug, but I was happy at the end, when a guy almost made it across state lines. I also know that the majority of women who experience a traumatic rape do not want to make love with her boyfriend or her husband the next day. The film is simply wrong in all directions. I would suggest «The Basketball Diaries», if I was going to suggest a film about drugs.
