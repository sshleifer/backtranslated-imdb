I usually comedies. I really enjoy it. But I do not get the point, "Envy". I mean, she has a dull content / topic, and it's really not funny. <br /> <br /> Although the actions are generally good, it is not enough for the film to get a little interesting. Stiller and Black does not show all his talent in this film. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to comedy, I suggest you do not go exactly to this. If you do not want to annoying, and I can see that I am not the only one with this opinion, because even Jack Black apologized for the fact that (pay attention to the little things).
