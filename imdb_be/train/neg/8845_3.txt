I was watching this, knowing almost nothing about him, except for a brief description I have read here. After seeing it, I originally was going to say that the director shows promise, but it seems kind of an amateur, then I looked at the other things he did, to see if it was his first or second film, but no, he did the house on haunted Hill and fear Dot Com. He kind of missed on both of these films, and it was the same thing with this. <br /> <br /> The story was pretty awful, too, can someone just fall in love with a girl because she is beautiful, but has a mind of a child? I gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that I quite enjoyed towards the end, but on the whole this film is quite scary.
