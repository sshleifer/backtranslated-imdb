I believe that I was attracted to this film as a story because of the sound and the lead actor, so I gave him a chance, the director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) is set by the police, especially Superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), he is forced to go on during the formation of the gang and go up against them to clear his own and his family's names. That's really all I can say about this story, because I did not pay very close attention, to be honest. Also starring Orlando Bloom, Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts, Julia Cook, Lawrence Quinlan Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton, Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as the Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon, Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths Susan Scott. Ledger does a very good job for what it is worth, and the film does have this eye-catching moments, especially with a shootout to the end, but I can not say I like the way I looked at it, good!
