Being a big fan of horror movies Corman I was expecting from him a bit more Western than I do. Well, I'm having fun all right. I was almost as much laughter as watching Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles. <br /> <br /> See the spectacle of mobile tire tracks on the prairie of the old West. You can kill time, considering them, if you happen to be otherwise boring scene takes place. And the horses seem to have a transfer, they also considered fast-forward pursuits. See also the swinging bar room queens traditional Wild West saloon makes a number that resembles a trendy dance from the 1920s, there decades before the style coined. Hopefully salon around them do not crumple. <br /> <br /> In the middle of all this mayhem main actors do a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are all really good. do special praise for them the best they could with the material, which seems to be mainly being raised from "Johnny Guitar", but not quite hit the same way. But in fact, nothing wrong with a ridiculous Western like this. Just as bad is actually an old horror film, it may not be one way, but managed to give joy anyway. This is one of the reasons the workers called Corman to me, and therefore I have the right to recommend you to experience this movie, if you get the chance.
