I saw him last night at midnight Slam Film Festival des du Monde in Montreal. What a disappointment. This film is clearly ranked higher IMDb fans. The action was just, but regularly. The guide is nothing new or interesting will bring. The plot is significantly lacking: the film is all about the graduates of colleges and the games they play by making prank calls (7eventy 5ive). And on top of that you can predict the end of the film in the first five minutes. If you want to prank calls and slasher with an ax, which makes you jump only once or twice during the movie, you would like it. If you do not, this movie is not worth it.
