As a kid, my friends and I all felt that Gimkata was the most powerful, bloody movie ever made. I do not know who started this rumor. He was probably born with frustration 10-year-old, who was not allowed to see him for one reason or another. Years after Gimkata was released, he became the perennial late-night cable movie, and as a result, I was able to make up for lost time. I must have seen the scene of this terrible grounds for the film more than a dozen times, and I can always define it with 1-2 seconds of screen time. However, aside from the forced connection gymnastics and martial arts, bad dubbing, dialogue is stiff and defiant difficult storyline, the film has some things going for it. With all that is bad about the film visually, the sound is actually very interesting. Never before had a stroke or a blow landed so little effort and so much volume! Canned kung fu sounds are arrogant, but slowed down and broke down the music, and almost 5 minutes, slow-motion scene is really strange. The chase through the city crazy, bloodthirsty resident of the village is not very hard, as this is annoying, and there is enough bad wigs and an addition to everything, but look at the camera and wave to make this train-wreck of a little fun, maybe went to the cult classic status? Where MST3K, when we need it?
