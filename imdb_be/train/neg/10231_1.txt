Frankly, I'm pretty angry that on the basis of dazzling reviews are attributed to Stephen Smith I spent almost two hours on his debut proposal. Were all of them were written by his friends? Action clunks together, the music is annoying and is used again, the script is just pathetic and the actors (except for the gardener), at best, mediocre. I think that we should support the efforts of the young filmmaker, but says it's brilliant, if it is not, of course, only encourages him to make the same mistake again, that is, continuing to write their own scripts and using the same actors for the other companies. Yes, this is his first film, a low budget, etc. - I understand, but it is also there for the public to buy, and it's just not up to scratch.
