This was said by critics about the death, if it truly is not that great. Of course, the "chaos" and "INSIDE the MAN" in the literal sense of the same movie, but with variations in voltage. But I have found "chaos" more enjoyable, because it was a fast-paced kind of like a stupid movie "Swordfish". The reason this film is more popular because it was released in the United States and "Chaos" was shown around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters, but have yet to find a distributor in the UK and the US <br /> <br / > it is true that this film makes a lot of you, but that does not mean tribute to classic movies like DOG DAY DAY Spike and other films, it's a nice movie to watch. <br /> <br /> See if nothing else is on TV, but you probably get bored after a while.
