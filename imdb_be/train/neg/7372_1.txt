I'm so confused. I was a big fan of Seagal for 25 years. I've seen all his movies, and many of them dozens of times. I can only describe this film as "strange". Steven Seagal action script writing and producing credits on the film, but a really hard time in my belief that he would choose to overwrite on his voice so many of his lines, with the voice of a thin, whiny impostor in not less. What I do not get, if they had to re-record some of his lines, why his voice is on the rest of them? I expect that Segal age as the rest of us. But Segal in this film exudes a little part of the same swagger, confidence, bravado, charm and tight it is so easily revealed to us in all his previous films. What I have discovered that lacks most of his daring, self-confident attitude and his bullies taunt that easily moves in this magical smile. Where is that in-your-face attitude and charm that has made it such a huge star ??? I hope that this film is not an indication that Seagal left us to offer - if so, his life-long fans will have to recognize that we all knew and loved is gone Segal.
