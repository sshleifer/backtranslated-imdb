Well, I blew, Woody Allen film that I came out after half an hour (I know about the moral fragility of commenting on the film, which I saw less than half, but I hope you will understand why). Basically, it has become apparent very early on that we were going to be a patron from the screen: the script, install the self-conceit, as though with a bullet point; cast, who are all trying to be characters from Hannah and Her Sisters (with the exception of Chloe Sevigny), and were directed to this bad; and a camera that sat around ominously, but there was nothing to shoot, but to communicate and actor of his delivery. Drama? no one; it is partially pre-narrated, but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation. <br /> <br /> I may be too early to leave in this case, but then I decided against another hour and a half one -liner-Allen clones. The script has its funny moments ?? I went almost entirely on the back of statements Will Ferrell in the trailer (trailer hooked again, DOH!) ?? but there is a bit of pace to allow them to fly carefree as it best. Worse than this is not the yield. Saying that the film timber makes the wood look like a jelly outdoor caf√©s binding discussion is the most pathetic case in point. The only thing that should be done by the numbers Played review ?? 2/10.
