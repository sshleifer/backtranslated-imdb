I love the image of the 30-ies and 40-ies in the film. I love Salma Hayek. I was more than ready to love this picture. but. ,. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> not No, sir, nothing good about it. Only entertaining aspect for me was the character of Colin Farrell is a writer and dangerous this scenario, despite the decisions of the juicy topics of racism, it is approaching to the audience in a fashion to ABC Afterschool Special. <br /> <br /> a single person who does not sound like he was "acting" was Sutherland, and his minutes were not enough. <br /> <br /> stale approach to the tired plot.
