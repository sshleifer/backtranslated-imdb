I remember when the golden child was released in 1986, he was widely criticized and made I`m Talking cooked so much that it is more or less finished a brilliant career, Eddie Murphy, so I think that this film has something is <br /> <br /> for him he goes to a bad start where BuddisT monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face. The bad guys go to the temple <br /> <br /> A child sits with a blank expression <br /> <br /> bad guys crumble monks <br /> <br /> A child sits with a blank expression <br /> <br / > The bad guys get a giant bird cage and stick the baby inside, which now sits ... Go to the assumption? You get the impression that even if they mistook him for a night on Michael Jackson`s miracle ranch he`d still gives the same blank expression, this movie would be better titled wooden baby <br /> <br /> title sequence and it begins to be in a movie with the 1980 pop soundtrack features strongly. Obviously, this could have been a cool and funky at the time, but now in 2004, it seems very dated. Not only that, but it is quite a jar with a few bloody revelation. In fact That`s the main problem (And boy `s serious one) with this film - the mood seems to be changing from scene to scene, so sometimes ono` s like watching a scene from a totally different movies spliced ​​together. I blame the director personally, but it should also be noted that as a writer and producer must share equal blame, too. Does anyone know before the shooting started, what movie would it be? It`s part fantasy, part martial arts, part of mate movie, part comedy and `s all crap
