Misleading terrible lie on the cover, "fun as American Pie," my friend and I sat in front of the TV waiting for the comedy ... and it's certainly not alone. You probably will not laugh once, if you are not one of those Jackass-like ever tiny minds. It's not even an erotic film that, at least, was something, considering that we are talking about sex ... <br /> <br /> So, what is it? Unstable part is dealing with a guy who wants to lose his virginity (zero originality, I remember, "Losin 'It" for one) and his gang of friends. The remaining characters (ie women) just come and go without any credible reason. Well, there is even the dwarves (so simple, "gnomes fun ho-ho ...") to act very TV-like (like the video look throughout the film) and, of course, an amateur in the case of most girls ... <br /> <br /> Ugly movie. Amateur, poorly made, and above all not funny. Children and teens love to watch it with friends because of the abuse and sexual jokes. In addition, do not even think about renting this movie.
