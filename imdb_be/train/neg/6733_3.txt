The exclamation point in the title by the way, though, and humiliation. This film is not just a cry - it screams loud enough to break the glass <br /> <br /> The filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone made a shrill, mirthless unexplained thrillers, tending to semi-documentary feel .. Here they filmed on real locations in New York from the tin "real life" to raise the credibility of the acoustics. But naturalism record sound only serves to reinforce the awkward dialogue stones and mouth foaming theatricality tortured butterfly Inger Stevens. <br /> <br /> The design is completely devoid of modulation, Stevens plays electronics wife upward James Mason (looking haggard and boring); Both in captivity extortionist Rod Steiger (looks bloated and sad) and his cohorts are slippery in the scheme to blackmail the airline with a deadly bomb that Mason unwittingly helped build. <br /> <br /> Here's another authority, the deformation of a copy of a criminal mastermind so brilliantly attentive to every detail, but enough knuckleheaded hire a degenerate drug addict as a slave. The idea Stones nail biting tension trapped in hysterical Stevens only Benzedrine fish rapist Neville Brand, filling the frame with his sweaty, drooling kisses. But the camera work is so leaden and so Mark (uncharacteristically) quiet one, the effect is hardly fussy, much less alarming. Stones, square in the heart of the pair does not even have the courage of their own lack of belief. <br /> <br /> The film, which ends with a stout Steiger chasing swift Stevens on the subway train track as clumsy as his clumsy heavy. With Angie Dickinson as amoral friend Jack Steiger Klugmanom, Kenneth Tobey, Barney and Philips.
