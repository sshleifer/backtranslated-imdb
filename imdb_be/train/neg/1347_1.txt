Inspector Gadget was probably my favorite 80's cartoon. I enjoyed the first and second seasons of the series, and in 1992 Christmas special "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas." Some fans of gadgets quickly criticize the second season (1985) shows, but they have to compare it with the release of DIC in 2002, "Inspector Gadget in the latter case: Revenge of the claw" for what they will find the second season to be an absolute gold. <br /> <br /> As an advocate of gadgets, I could not resist the opportunity to see an animated Inspector Gadget in something that was not related Gadget Boy. I bought this movie, and I swore to myself that I would be an objective; I know that sometimes artistic liberties will be taken from the original series. I was not even prepared for what I was going to look. <br /> <br /> There was a piece of the original show, or remains intact. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief list of some of the cons for this movie :. * Humor nonexistent with the original series <br /> <br /> * Penny and Brain (initially having a nearly equal part in series as Gadget) no action within fifteen to twenty-minute intervals. <br /> <br /> * original music and Sabana Leviticus does not exist, and the account that exists in subpar. (Got that Saban has his own production company now, but, at least, "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas" was good music, even without Saban.) * Do not expect to see any of the gadget nut who made the show so cute, such as gadget -copter, Brella gadget, gadget-beater, gadget-coat (which was actually used, but it was not even name the same), as well as its standard hats and other hand tools. In this film, his gadget telescopic legs instead of springs. This kind of thing irritate fans of this show, and simply do not need to change. <br /> <br /> * The gadgetmobile the original series now talk fast, they say, "hip" convertible. All fans of the original series enjoyed gadgetmobile transforming into a van gadget and vice versa. <br /> <br /> * Chief Quimby is very short-tempered and even a gadget. He was always grumpy in the original series, but this is pushing the situation too much. <br /> <br /> * Penny no longer has a computer book. <br /> <br /> Are there any positive to this film? Okay, here goes ... <br /> <br /> * Maurice LaMarche is doing a good job for a lot of Don Adams as the Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> * In one scene, Chief Quimby hints to the actual villain of the cartoon series :. Large Wambini (classic «Gadget» villain of the second season, announced by Louis Nye) <br /> <br /> in search of the redeeming factors for this film? Well, you're out of luck. Life to make choices and live by these elections. Most situations in life has a purpose, even if it is to teach. The lesson here is: keep in the original formula! "If it is not broke do not fix it" gadget True fans should stay away from this movie.; You will certainly be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, DIC and Shout! The plant will continue to produce more original series after the release of 2006 «Inspector Gadget: Original Series, Volume 1," containing the first 22 episodes of the series. As a true fan of the gadget lover 80 animation and many of the programs DIC, I encourage you to purchase a spectator "Inspector Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas» DVD, which is great and always bring back the good memories.
