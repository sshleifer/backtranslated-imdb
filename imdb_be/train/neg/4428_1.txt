You lose 100 IQ points just for tuning in. This show must be awful, I refuse to tune in from all that I have seen in advertising. Where did they dig this guy anyway? In addition, they intend to do next season? The secret is out. Everyone already knows a lot up? They're going to look for people who are already living under a rock star in the next season? Where are they going to dig a silly woman? It is not surprising that America is not a big joke outsider, see what you see !!
