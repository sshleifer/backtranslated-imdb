This film was one of the worst I have ever seen. Pure nonsense. As someone who can create a relationship with the heroine, or compassion for her, for me. I felt like I was watching the case history of the schizoid individual with borderline personality disorder. . Just awful <br /> <br /> In most generous light, it can be seen as an attempt to produce the film and "art" - except I could not, for the life of me find any art in it at all. <br /> <br /> If this woman had lived in the world of today, it would have been whisked to a psychiatric hospital and was given a couple of days of treatment with anti-psychotic drugs. That, or just allowed to roam the streets and become a bag woman. Why do the other characters in this film have found something soothing in it - and tried to help her in her quest to become an actress - says more of their pathology than any convincing signs she had that made it worth the effort.
