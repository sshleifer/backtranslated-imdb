The central theme in this film seems to be confusion, like relationships, setting, operating and social context, it all leads to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel seems to be out of his element, and lacks his usual impeccable clarity, direction and intensity. To make matters worse, the name of his character is "Che" and we just said (immediately, the narrator) is well in the film, it is not a "what" Che, a guy by the name of Che. Family relationships remain unclear until the end of the movie, and once identified, the family is divided - the younger generation in America. So cliche. Other reviews discuss how the film reflects the impact of the revolution on the boy's family; However, the director of the political position of the muddy at best, and we are never quite sure who is responsible for the bloodshed. Thus, they have lost their property (acquired gambling profits) - then what? Refusing to take a political stance, to create a film about the Cuban revolution, it is awesome and cowardly choice. Not to mention the film was in English! Why are all these Cubans say in English? It is not surprising that they have not received permission to film in Cuba. And if family life is the most important thing to look at here, it would be nice if we could figure out who is who - we are "introduced" to them all at the start - a cheap way to make the relationship clear throughout the film! The action was mainly in small, wooden, and incredibly, the time was ruled everything. The "special" visual effects have been confusing and distracting. Links to American films - and a black character as a Greek chorus - strictly gratuitous, intellectually specious, and consistently ridiculous. I just watched the whole movie, because I was expecting clarity, or at some point it all. It never happened.
