Seriously, I've read some reviews of the movie, and I have to ask if you were, people are watching the same movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I give a lot of credit set director for the opportunity to recreate the vintage 1930 in Los Angeles, but what? <br /> <br /> None of the characters are not likable, the story seems aimless, Karen Black is simply not a very good actress. Donald Sutherland just unsightly. (And his character "Homer Simpson" makes me much to the animated version. D'oh!) Then you had a terrible child actor Billy Barty terrible, and so on. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films moviegoers love, and the rest of us look at each other and go, 'What the hell! "
