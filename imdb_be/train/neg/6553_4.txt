Years after the fall of the last of the big corporations, the world fell into a new dark age, where the cyborg to collect its parts. Cash, cyborg woman goes to the doctor wasteland, to get the news that she is pregnant. On the run from risayklerzli (killers, hunting cyborgs), Cash trying to find their way to Cytown, mythical refuge for cyborgs <br /> <br /> «Cyborg 3: The Processors' is the third (and the last so far) Entry CYBORG trilogy. The first film was originally planned to be a continuation of the Masters of the Universe, but was quickly rewritten in the standard post-apocalyptic Martial Arts Fest, which has become something of a cult because of its bad scenes. CYBORG 2: Glass Shadow was a continuation of what is really improved after his predecessor, but has not been widely seen (and was dismissed the few who saw it as a cheap feed) <br /> <br /> This film, on the one hand, he tries. MELD be from the first two films (the first was a cheesy action movie, and the second was a smart cyberpunk story), but unfortunately falls short on both counts. The budget was clearly lower than CYBORG 2, a film set in the desert wasteland (like many other post-apocalyptic action films were 90th) shot around the old industrial buildings to save costs. <br /> <br /> The film's story centers on the area of ​​the device that pregnant cyborg that is as exciting as it is absurd (this film is not the first to try this idea, anime OVA series Armitage III uses it to a greater extent). But the film fall into the same trap that the sci-fi action so many low-budget movies are victims, that the snags (synthetic organisms) signs are no more than androids. The visuals do not make up more than prosthetic hands and make up. <br /> <br /> action is pretty standard for this kind of film, with the title role (Kristyn Haji), being one the worst performer on the display. Instead of being delighted by the news that she was pregnant, she acts all tearful and sullen. Her co-star is much better, Malcolm McDowell will be the usual type of gangster who gives life to the scene he appears in & Richard Lynch has a lot of fun as the main villain. Of particular note, Andrew Byniarski, playing with his right hand Lynch, who would later appear in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and a prequel.
