Now I just realized that watching this movie, I lost precious precious moments of my life I will never go back. Thsi film is not just a poor its terrible. It reminded me of every stereotypical black comedy ever made. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia said his problem with the race appears to be "white" people do not like it because it has a non-white actors. Mate, I think you'll find the reason why no one liked, because it was to watch paint dry a lot more interesting and fun, this is a bunch of nonsense. <br /> <br /> Please stop making shit films
