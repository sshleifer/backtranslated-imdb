It just flat out unwatchable. If there's a story here somewhere, so deeply buried under the terrible shaking of the characters and the camera, it was impossible to discern. There's also a group of vampire hunters, who go around doing their thing, and vampires, they are killing us little aliens in them. They stick their heads and talk like Speedy Gonzales. If you can imagine blood and blood covered the foreign puppy who screams in horror as a cowboy dude it zaps the animals before, well, that's what you get here. These people are loud, nasty, violent, and just very annoying. Then there are some anti-human people standing around in their CGI starship to be so unbelievably arrogant that it is impossible to accept. These people make Hillary Clinton, it seems as right-wing extremist in comparison. They made friends with some vampires or something ... who cares. <br /> <br /> Then there is the camera work. Remember how everyone hated thousand cuts-a-minute shit out recently Rolleball remake? The people who made this film like this stuff. There's plenty of it here are three really crappy nu-metal video on MTV. <br /> <br /> Nuff said. This thing smells. For comparison, Dracula 3000 is a masterpiece.
