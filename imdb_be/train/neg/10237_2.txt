The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes penalty, holocaust survivors of the experiments of Mengele on twins consisting primarily his version of what happened in Auschwitz, and comparison of emotions other survivors experiments twins. The film clearly had good reviews. This is one of those topics that no one dares to express the opposite opinion. <br /> <br /> I also for a large part of the movie, got caught up in the emotion of the film-makers so clearly wanted the viewer to concentrate on. One of the reviews of users on IMDb Eric Monder (obviously, not having anything critical to say about the issue in a public forum) could only find the sweet nectar. "In one of the many dramatic sequences of a group of Jews to argue with Cora at the Jewish center, the word" sorry "out of the question, but isolated and superior Kor holds its own" but until now, the juicy believes that the movie was on my sleep emotional repertoire allowed to freely enough that I could see clearly again. After the "strong-willed" Eva K forgive his "Nazi Thief" film begins to delve into what forgives all about, at least from the point of view of the crust. The film is about the direction of her, by her public statement forgiven the Nazis and into new territory. For me it was the meat of the film, surrounded by a non-edible fat her "act of forgiveness." Obviously, this was a sick cow. <br /> <br /> On a mission to test his theory of forgiveness in order to heal the wounds of the past, she makes her way to the "promised land" to meet some Arabs, to discuss the issues they face with them and see if the dialogue can lead to a better understanding of the situation and largely interspersing debates and discussions with the Jews in the United States on her act of forgiving the Nazi, including one in the Jewish center in Chicago. Since then, who is not as watery eyes, that they can not see the screen will be hard pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in his statements. <br /> <br /> In the first place, you will immediately notice her body language defensive and unwilling to listen to in a room full of Arab scholars and teachers. Her comments about how she was afraid that they might steal it shows how much a waste of time, effort and money all act. Quite unpleasant, Dr. Sami Advan (Professor of Education at the University of Bethlehem) gets it just right when he says of Kor for the statement it makes about how she would rather sleep in my apartment. <br /> <br /> Finally, the debate in the Jewish Center in Chicago, where she "grilled" on the meaning of forgiveness and of her right to do so, after that, that still suffers from the trauma acts. <br /> <br /> I will cut to the chase. By the end of the film, I hope that I did not choose to watch a movie. The film was poorly done, not having to delve into anything about Auschwitz, in addition to purely trivial, just enough to make sure that the Holocaust is updated in the memory of viewers and incite a flurry of tears. He showed that Kor, the subject of the documentary could not take part in an honest discussion. Her discussion of the possibility was limited to her parrot position in remission (at best) to complete unwillingness to listen or participate. <br /> <br /> And finally, all the way backward today, they can not tell the difference between the creation of the world and forgive? Citing another user IMDb, Â«I do not see it as a pardon weak- quite the contrary, she just wanted to lighten their power from her shower, she wanted flour will not, so she let him go." That would be the definition of the ideal layman to peacemaking . <br /> <br /> I think, in the world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness, there is no room to question those who "was more than a human mind can understand." <br /> <br /> PS Dictionary certainly must go to all these books to buy lists each continues to do.
