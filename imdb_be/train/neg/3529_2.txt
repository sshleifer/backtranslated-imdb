I heard that this film was a lot more than the stylistic director Guy Ritchie films (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch) has been directed primarily, the problem is that it may be too stylistic. Basically Jake Green (Jason Statham) out of jail after seven years in solitary confinement, and within two years he speculates load their money. He is ready to retaliate against violence-prone casino owner who was jailed Jake Dorothy «Mr. D »Makhova (Ray Liotta). In the process, the doctors say, Jake, he three days to live as he is dying from a rare disease of the blood, oh, and the urine is put on him a killer. Moneylenders Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andre Benjamin) need Jake to pay the money back, and do some odd jobs for them. The film is filled with Jake tells a few flashbacks, as well as through his last three days before the arrival to the big opening of Zack and Avte and Mahi, well, I think that's what it was. Also starring Terence Maynard as the French Paul, Andrew Howard, Billy, Mark Strong as a sorter, Francesco Ennis, Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith both Doreen and Elana Binish Rachel. They are sequences that include a bit of animation, repeating lines twice in different angles and changing speeds for moments, and all of them annoying point of absurdity and boredom by doing this foolish crime drama. Pretty poor!
