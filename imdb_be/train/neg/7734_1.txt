This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen. The storyline is weak - I could not even follow him. Actions high-schoolish. Soundtrack annoying. Attempts humor are not. Editing awful. Loans even slowly - I'd be embarrassed that my name associated with this film waste. Do not waste your time without even thinking about it attempted action.
