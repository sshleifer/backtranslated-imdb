I dread / Gore movie freak and this movie was so bad, I felt bad that not only "actor", but also director and producer poor sap who actually put their money on this hack. <, Br /> <br /> from the name, you might expect some big massacre, some of the plot lines and at least some direction or in the dialog box. Instead, you get something that looks a bit more tough and sexy episode of Three Stooges. At least, I laugh in the Three Stooges. Watching this shit, I turned the TV and watched Howard Stern, until something interesting happened. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I kept watching Stern. <br /> <br /> watching this "movie" I understand that I could get a film with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, $ 50 in fines and broken PC. This film is my inspiration to get into no-budget filmmaking. Watch this movie if you dare, but be warned ... there is a lot of nothing here, but a whole lot of talk and very little action. This makes «KaZaam» similar to the movie Meryl Streep. <br /> <br /> I am sure that Germany will not ban it because of sex or violence. Other countries should take into account.
