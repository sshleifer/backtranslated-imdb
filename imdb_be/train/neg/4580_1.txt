I'm still trying to decide if it really is the worst movie I have ever seen - a very disturbing problem with this film, that real scientists are interviewed, but their frames are edited to make it appear that they support the idea of ​​many BSers that populate the film. BS signal ratio of the interview is about ten thousand to one - after all, it seems, respondents have to say: "We want you to _think_ !!», but they are too lazy to do simple research that they claim ,. as a fact <br /> <br /> If you feel that you are open and you want to expand your mind, please, be open enough to read some actual books about quantum theory: "The Universe of Einstein," Nigel Calder (thin on volume, and not a problem), "Cosmic Code" Heinz Pagels. If you can not bring myself to read the book, please do not complain about referees, "open". <br /> <br /> Let's remind, that the film's incredible bad. <br /> <br /> You know, it's a really good movie, which calls into question the nature of reality? "The Thirteenth Floor," directed by Roland Emmerich, with tags, Gretchen Mol, Vincent DOnofrio. Smart, sexy, thought.
