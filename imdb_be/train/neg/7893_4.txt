In the beginning we see the beginning of the Privy Council some varieties. It all looks very promising to go from the beginning. With some supernatural elements added, the mystery becomes more interesting by the minute. The main character, who seems like a good guy gets into trouble because of his claim to the money that he has the right (temptation) and other factors. You really empathize with the guy, and you want to know what is happening. Usually people in his case will have a few options. Somehow it does not have such opportunities. In this film, there just seems to be one solution, even if it is clear that this is not his fault. With the blue, he meets characters who speak of the Church, prayer and God. And they provide an answer to his problem. It should be obvious, at the point in the movie, that this decision is. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with that statement. Since it is always beneficial. But was it really necessary to hide this message. This religious element is actually spoiled the viewing experience for me. While the message is good, it is not easy to move away from the fact that more needs to happen in real life, to solve the issues presented in this film. The mystery that is not presented to us does not get resolved. Instead, you are forced to deal with another theme, which in fact has nothing to do with the plot. Nha fooled due to Malcolm McDowell. The once brilliant actor is adequate, but if you look closely, you will see that it is not serious at all. It really must be desperate for money. Otherwise, it would have had an actor of his caliber to act in a movie like this.
