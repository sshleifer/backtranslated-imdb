I know that some of the films (I mean: European films), which are very bad movies, is now regarded as a great movie some "critics", just because they are un-American. I saw a 8.1 IMDB score of the film, and noticed that it has been selected for some major holidays. Do not let this fool you! If you're not one of those people that likes heady films like this and call it a great art then, skip it! The film contains one hilarious scene after another (similar to the Italian movie popped into my head, scary PREFERISCO IL RUMORE DEL MARE (I prefer the sound of the sea)). The problem with these films is that they are not only bored, as some other surprising praised films, but they are almost like playing camp. I mean, let's face it, acting badly (I mean: soap level opera), the story does not have a surprise (it was made endless times before connecting multiple storylines: Short Cuts, Magnolia, PLAY HEART, only much better), but not the only one realistic in it (some real freak-seeing on the road, pay attention to the fun zombie-like daughter), and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> As if that is not enough, the film is 135 minutes. (List!) For a long time, and finally director bank opens sentimentality. After a film with such a funny bad dialogue and scenes that made public a preview screening of laughter so much incompetence, well ... It is an insult to the film, and only receives high ratings, because it happens in the "other" language in this the case in Spain. Wonderful world in which we live ... 3/10
