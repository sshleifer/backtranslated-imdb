Well this is the first post I've ever commenting on the IMDb., You will receive it, this movie made me come and warn all the good souls who never cease to experiment with cinema. <br /> <br /> As with most of them gave their comments, I think watching this film, because it seemed to have some decent actors (although reading the worst criticism against the film), I thought experiment is considering it some comedy flick. , well, it all started well with some um., comedies .... then everything started going a pathetic person ... you can believe in your self, you WUD feel like banging your head to go and every time a miserable looking for a woman named heroine of the film is made helpless. ..Huh ~~ Well, how many people can digest all the sick witch owned a kind of a ghost trying to do everything she can to annoy you and stop you from what you are doing. <br /> <br /> the next worst thing about the movie is, "zombie" hero, but he loses his fiance he wanders around like a goat, with black marks in his eyes NDER., and "terribly stupid," the sister of the hero .. you WUD bleeding from head to toe, and when you tried to inherit fully watch the movie ~!
