From the outset, the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy-handed that the result is quite predictable. Any good tutorial on writing scripts advise layering of characters, including the character arc and three-act structure. In this film you will not find anything like it. Police wicked, and thus are shown as small, panties and incompetent. It never seems to occur to the creators of this film is that the police can be honorable citizens who see the sun coming into the police, like a good way to contribute to the welfare of society. <br /> <br /> viewer gets no opportunity to fill up his or her mind, or Ned Kelly a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film begins with his arrest for stealing a horse, but we do not get a key to understanding his guilt or innocence. We see how he goes through the door of the prison, but only knows that he was for three years, when we hear it much later in some dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film contains a lot of shots of Ned, looking at the camera with a serious expression. I found the film a real chore to watch. This trend for modern films, and this one pushed me to watch more.
