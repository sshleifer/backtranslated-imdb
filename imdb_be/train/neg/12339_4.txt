This comedy has some passably funny stuff in it, surrounded by a large amount of material is not funny. Almost every scene involving the castle servants and their silly antics of a waste of time. And sketches are so ugly that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started shooting it, or they just do it all, as they went along. (* 1/2)
