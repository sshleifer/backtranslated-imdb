Dr. K (David H Hickey) is trying to master the formula that will put an end to all diseases and obstacles, but needs a living donor, to complete its work. His physician brother Richard (Dennis O'Neill) has a son named Eddie (Derek Philips), which is accepted to medical school. Eddie is a girl named Sarah (Lizabeth Cardenas), which is pre-law, and plans to attend law school myself the arrival of autumn. She and Eddie restore their relationship, when Sarah calls things with her current boyfriend, who is also the mistress fucks Walt (Bill Sebastian; best friend Eddie, who recently paid for a boob job Cheating his friend). Eddie accidentally hit by a car and appears on the agony when Dr. K makes an offer to Richard..let him "recover" Eddie, using his secret, illegal methods. When Dr K uses its serum Eddie horrific results occur. Eddie's face sticks huge warts, while he has also acquired a taste for human flesh. Many will die, so Eddie can feed this uncontrollable appetite he can not satisfy. Soon he may even pose a threat to his father and girlfriend..Eddie monster must be stopped. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, terribly straight to video horror film suffers from a serious lack of budget, the acting, and the overall talent premise that seems interesting fright festival, can not even deliver as a zombie flick. Blood limited number of chewing scenes, but most of the violence comes from the camera. Using the time to move the story along is really annoying.
