"National Lampoon goes to the movies" (1981) is absolutely the worst movie ever made, surpassing even the brainless "Plan 9 from Outer Space." The film is unwound lampoon in three separate and unrelated vignettes, each of which has different artists. The only common thread is a complete lack of any redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe there is one. Another reviewer on this site, said that fleeting nude pictures are good, and he is right. Misses Hansel and Dusenberry flash their assets magically, in the first part and second part, respectively. But their spectacular displays, unfortunately in vain. The director seems to have forgotten that even T & A requires an accurate history, to surround it, and is not in sight. <br /> <br /> In the third segment, starring Robby Benson and Widmark, most disgusting of three, and a bad choice of how catchy this film. Benson plays an eager-beaver young policeman, bright Statements for the first day of life, ready to rid the streets of evil. It works in tandem with the old, cynical cop Widmark plays, and if the partners of oil and water set on his first patrol together, we feel a possible buyout of previous failures of the film. Maybe, just maybe, a cynical veteran reformed tall sense of his new partner of duty and loyalty. Maybe everything will end well after all. Unfortunately, this movie is headed straight into the toilet without money, without a happy ending, not a coherent story of any kind. <br /> <br /> Before "National Lampoon goes to the movies," I think we've seen the worst trash that Hollywood could have. Unfortunately, I have not seen the half. <br /> <br />
