Do not get me wrong, I assumed that this film would be foolish, I honestly do, I gave him an incredibly low level of pleasure. The only reason I even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls Going (another story for another time). When I started playing, I noticed something, this movie was terrible. Currently, there are two types of scary, there is a terrible Freddy vs. Jason, where you and your friends to sit and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, then there is a film like this. Cat in the Hat could not create even a short-term interest to me. As I watched the first bit of this, not only I was bored senseless, but I felt as if I had somehow been violated horrendousness said film. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love most of his work, but something in this film are not pressed. One of the things that the director / producers / writers / whatevers changed in that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book (red, black, white) to any character except Cat. Coincidentally or not, but they also refused to capture any of the original (and I do not want to use this word, but it fits) zaniness original. The book was like Ice Cream Tuesday, colorful and tasty, and the film was about how soft and hard to swallow, as sawdust. <br /> <br /> To avoid this, like a leper prostitute.
