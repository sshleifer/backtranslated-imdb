Please, for God's sake, do not look. Now that I know what you're thinking, it can not be that bad can it? If everyone is saying that it is as bad as they say I have to look! Do not do it! It will be like a terrible accident involving a petrol tanker and young children! You'll be scarred for life ... the image will never leave you! I could only watch half an hour of this, before becoming very ill. Actions is the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen Barbwire !!! If you do risk tearing your eyes and make this film ... I do not say I did not warn you! The cover and the story line is a trap !! Zombies? Satire? Shaun of the Dead was great! This film should be the same .... is not it? NO !! Compilation = shit direction = garbage Action = there was no action. Still not sure? Then your soul will be tormented forever !!!
