Wow, I love and respect in pretty much all that David Lynch did. However, this film seems to attempt the first director to create pseudo-art video. <br /> <br /> In order to give you a few examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch, as a rule, a visual director, however, is a little visual artistic content (bare walls, "shots" from the ceiling in the background) <br /> <br /> 2. David Lynch usually takes great pride in the audio, however, in that you can even hear the hum of the camcorder. <br /> <br /> In fact, it is very difficult to swallow the idea that he had nothing to do with this film. ... when there is no <br /> <br /> ... this is a joke, from David to get a supporter to search your website (a few hours) only to find this nonsense. I hope so, because, at least, that the idea is ridiculous.
