Very good story for the film, which, if done properly it would be very interesting, but where the hell is the ending of this movie? <br /> <br /> In fact, what is the point? <br /> <br /> scenes zip through so quickly that you felt that you were not part of the film emotionally, and the feeling of being cut off from the understanding of the storyline. <br /> <br /> in the performances of the troupe are questionable, if not plausible. <br /> <br /> I miss a conclusion somewhere in the film? I believe that we should continue to wait. <br /> <br />
