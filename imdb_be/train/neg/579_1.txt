Listening to comments directed confirmed what I suspected, while watching a movie: it's a movie, filmed a guy who wants to play in making the film. The plot is the kind of thing that misled teenagers in large numbers when they go through it, "I could write a book / screenplay / award-winning sitcom" phase. There is a germ of an interesting idea buried there (probably because it's a sequel of some one another), but it is completely buried under the following terms, poorly executed and ridiculous UN thoughtful script. <br /> <br /> Line miserable, and speech-not attractive, although, again, I'm inclined to blame the director. He seems to have been consulted with actors at all about what is needed and let the script in their ru kah showed the camera at them and told them to get on it. Who knows, with a little training, these actors could have proved themselves better (say what you like musicians in the film, Jon Bon Jovi was very rich in Row boats and more acceptable in the title role). <br /> <br /> As you can see, cast no chemistry at all. Excellent opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism are transmitted in parallel, when in order to infect the character Bono Jovi with vampire blood from his sick of the hunter, he transfusions. It should bite him. Keep in mind that they had to look vaguely interested in each other throughout the film, too. The only real moment of sexual tension between the two female lead, is the director's own admission accident. He originally intended to use the silent sequence as a pretext for a mindless plot exposition - yes, I believe that the final product could conceivably worse. But not too much. <br /> <br /> To be honest, in the movies go, it's bad painted, stupid and forgettable. Even crappy movies go it is not enough or sexy enough bloody to be interesting. This could be a fun and bloody little naughty, but the director had left with a lot of comedy, for all the wrong reasons.
