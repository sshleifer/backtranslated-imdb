I'm a big movie fan 1930 and watch virtually anything I see on Turner Classic Movies Thats new to me. So I gave it a shot, after all this is a great Harold Lloyd, who competed as a great Chaplin silent film comedian. I watched a lot less than the silent films of Lloyd with Chaplin, but I must say that I am much more Chaplin fan. In any case, this movie fell flat for me so that I did not finish it. I can understand why his sound career was so limited that he did not get very good material to work with. Once you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy make boxing parody (or violence in general), one very forgettable. I was also interested in watching Menzha, I really enjoyed it in Paths Of Glory, but his role here, too, did not do anything special for me. Maybe they should get into boxing before, because at least half of the film (at least it seemed that way) is, before he gets in the ring. I can say that there are a lot of fans here Lloyd, and it used to be a popular review, but I have to evaluate it compared to what else was there at the time, 4 out of 10. Do not look at it with someone you're trying to reach like the old movies, because they can not see another one with you again, very flat. For an alternative to anyone who actually liked it or looking for a little-known comedy in general, I recommend "Kelly II" made a few years ago, nobody would boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role, Charles Chase. They were both shown on the channel Turner Classic movies.
