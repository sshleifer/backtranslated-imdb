From everything I've read about this movie, I was thrilled to support the film with a Christian theme. Everything about the film was very unprofessionally done. Especially now! Without good writing film has no chance. Writer / director said in an interview that he did not want to give, as the name refers to the story. Believe me, it was not a big surprise. I kept waiting for a teenager / young adult history unfold, but he never did. As someone who has been through a divorce, I was very disappointed. This film would not have been any comfort to me when I first went through emotional turmoil that divorce can bring into your life as a Christian!
