I had to register IMDb simply leave a comment about how awful this film ... my cats and string ball better storyline than that. Not the worst actor I have ever seen, but if you destroy almost the entire cast of the film for 5 minutes, it leaves much to be desired. There have been no "fear" moment in the film, except when they watched the movie "Halloween" on the TV screen. All around, it seems that it may have been a good story, rolling credits and say that Chase Lane was in it was a bit of a loss as I did not recognize her at once, and her scene was over before I could 've said, "Oh, yes, there it is." I'm so glad that I saw it in the hotel and not pay for it, I would be a real check, if I paid a dime to see it. I usually like me can at least find a mitigating factor in the movie, but this one is an exception. It's so bad that it was not even that funny as well-is-bad .... it's just bad.
