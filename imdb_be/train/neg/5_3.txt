I basically run the film, but enough to catch watch the story was about. To tell you the truth, it was kind of sad for me, and in some places it does not make sense. The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see Chace Crawford !!! He was so hot, but in this movie, his hair was a little strange. But still hot. <br /> <br /> However, despite how hot the Chase, it really did not make up for the film. I believe that the story is not so bad, but what really threw me was the fact that they Cass in every sentence like. Is it difficult to express their anger, not to mention the F word every time? Swear annoying and all the screaming, shaking the camera, which gave me a headache. <br /> <br /> In general, although the plot was OK, I found the film to be boring and more dramatic. That's why I only cut to scenes from Chase in it. LOL Anyway, I do not entirely rent if your a die-hard supporter of a certain actor like me. Oh yes it was hot cast. The girls were HOT !!! But Chase IS THE BEST !!
