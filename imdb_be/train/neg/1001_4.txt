I rented it on DVD, and I kind of feel bad because Dawson and Lugacy so sincere about it in the DVD commentary. It's not exactly a bad film, but it's one of those films that desperately want to be a profound comment on human nature, not realizing that his story is almost a genre. In addition, it is a bit simplistic about the problem in a lot of ways, and the behavior of the characters often annoying faith. I would say that St. film that you get something out if you do not have a lot of movies / tv / books / life for you (be honest, I saw almost exactly the same story in the horror comics even). Otherwise, his point was made before and smarter. And it gets a big problem, which is that he really does not have much of cinematic interest in him, besides the point. He ends up being rather insipid film in general that puts all that the main story is shocking and convincing, and it really does not pay off.
