I had high hopes for this film. I thought that the room is interesting. I lingered over it, although I found the current, except for Helena Bonham Carter, unremarkable. I kept hoping that my time spent will pay off, but in the end I left me wondering why they even worked to make this thing. Maybe, in the version of George Orwell has a message should be transmitted. If this film to achieve anything, it inspired me to read classic Orwell. I find it hard to believe that his story can be just as frustrating as this device. If the message is a filmmaker "secular life worth living," and then they have succeeded. I would recommend this movie is not one; 101 minutes of my life wasted.
