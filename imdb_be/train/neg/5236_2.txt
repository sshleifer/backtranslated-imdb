my friends and I saw this movie about a week ago, and I feel that it is absolutely necessary to tell the whole world (or at least those who will read this) that this film is not only the top five worst films I've ever seen, but actually has the distinction of being number one. I've seen a lot of movies, but none compared to this stupid. You might say, I suffered watching this ... my only excuse that we were waiting for a few hours and could not go to another place without freezing our buttocks off. I do not recommend it to everyone. At first I thought that we have seen some really bad porn movie, but I realized after 10 minutes, that is not so. it is not a comedy, a drama entirely, is not an act, it is not fear, it's just awful!
