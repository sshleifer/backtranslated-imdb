I was not expecting much when I saw it at the Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend. It was an alternative choice when the other two films were sold. Nevertheless, I continued to hope. It sounded a bit more like "Bride and Prejudice" (LA guy falls in love with an Indian beauty, parental conflict, blah blah blah). B & P was not perfect, but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and cute characters. <br /> <br /> Â«My Bride Bollywood" has not been anything like it. Actions seemed unnatural and method for on-the-numbers. The characters were so cliche stories, it seemed that it might be written by a high school student's freshman drama. Technically, the sound is really bothering me. It seemed that there were many in dubbing the dialogue. I mean a lot. I know that sometimes it is necessary, but it sounded like half the movie was filmed in the closet, and it was very distracting. <br /> <br /> The two stars are now more generous.
