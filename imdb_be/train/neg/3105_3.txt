I can not believe how anyone can make a comedy about the problem, such as homelessness. Of course, Brooks did _real_ comedy about the homeless. No mention of drugs, prostitution and violence in these streets. The people we meet are homeless in the land of fantasy in this film, so that the only difference between them and us is that they do not eat very often. Brooks' films became worse and worse over the years. This is just another nail in the coffin.
