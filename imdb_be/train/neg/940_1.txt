Okay, guys, we know why we watch movies like «The Invisible Maniac» (just look at the cover, man!). T and A around the position (of much greater than T A). ? But ... is it should not be a story to go with it <br /> <br /> «Come on," I hear you say - "it's just a girl collects naked Who needs history! ??! "<br /> <br /> Well, if it was called" Naked maniacs ", I would have no problem. But since these guys are cheating with the "Invisible Man", they should have a bit of the history of the local, you know to keep your mind busy. <br /> <br /> However, all they can muster as the mad doctor creates invisibility serum and, if it cracks, use it to spy on naked women and ends up killing a lot of teenagers. And if you see insinuating promising teenager, he goes after that, you will be grateful. <br /> <br /> One star for the T and A, but there is a bit too much gore for fans of the skin, so proceed with caution <br /> <br /> TIDBIT. - Yes, that's what Savannah.
