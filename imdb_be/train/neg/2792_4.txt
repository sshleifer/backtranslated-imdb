STUDIO 666 (aka The demons in the UK) is another subpar slasher who looks movies directly to DVD. <br /> <br /> While many of the films straight to DVD is fast-paced or unintentionally fun in the so-bad-is-good sense, STUDIO 666 is a sad failure. <br /> <br /> at the time of writing, every comment on the first page includes the assessment and negative feedback, each of these people hit the bull's-eye. <br /> <br /> two people (as of this writing), who wrote a commentary with a rating of 10 out of 10 are not to be taken lightly. It is obvious that they have seen some slasher movie and have a more limited understanding of the horror. <br /> <br /> The only really positive thing I can do about this film is that it is better to go than the throttle and one of these two very mediocre Slasher films that I would not want my worst enemy! <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie should be done hundreds, if not thousands of times. The film has a small twist (and the one that is processed in bad) to conventional expectations. Singer depression commits suicide. Soon after, her spirit returns to have one of his surviving friends. He said a man possessed one goes on killing spree. The rest of the story is really too weird to take stock. You just have to see it yourself, indicating your interest has not waned to the point of extinction, of course. <br /> <br /> action in the film is very poor for the most part. The actress, who played Dora was an exception. Her character has always been interesting and seducer, when she was on the screen. It helps to raise the film above similar to modern efforts. Unfortunately, some of the lines she was given to say, were poorly written, to put it mildly, and thus prevent its film preservation. <br /> <br /> The direction was equally poor. Villains do not give up, even a little threatening, every murder was completely devoid of suspense or tension, the atmosphere was non-existent, and the camera-work was incredibly easy. Some of the special effects (if you can call it) reminded me of the TV series, the ghost. Unfortunately for the producers of the film, the ghosts were intelligently written script, believable performances and made excellent use of angles. Maybe when the producers watched the show closely, they picked up a few techniques that could save this excuse for a movie! <br /> <br /> Music is completely unsuitable in the tone of the film. It's just rock music, and not the best examples of this type either. Do not get me started on that horrible song played at the beginning! <br /> <br /> Some of the aspects of the film, in particular, the dialogue unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, they are not funny enough to move the film up (or should that be down) so bad-is-good level. <br /> <br /> In general, STUDIO 666 is the usual mediocre slasher with very few noteworthy aspects. I recommend it only to those who are supporters of direct to DVD movies and have a desire to see every slasher ever done.
