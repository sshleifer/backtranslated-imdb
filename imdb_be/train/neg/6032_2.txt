I am a Christian, as a rule, believe in the theology set forth in the Left Behind. That being said, I think Left Behind is one of the worst movies I've seen in awhile. <br /> <br /> In order to be a good movie, you need to have a well-written script. The rest fell sorely lacking it. On the one hand, it is radically different from the book. This is sometimes done to condense the 400-page novel to a two-hour movie, but in this film I have seen the changes that it makes no sense at all. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the zero character development. If the characters in the stories will be saved (I will not say who), the book makes it clear that this long process of introspection. The film is fast and artificial. The book is written quite well, where people like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seems real, but in the film script consistently given prompt treatment without anything substantial. In another scene where a character is angry about falling behind (again, I will not say who), this seems artificial. <br /> <br /> I know, as a Christian, it is unedifying for me to say that I did not like this movie, but I can not in good conscience recommend the film I feel terrible made. Perhaps it would be better to make the first book in 2-3 movies. In any case, Christians must understand that should be taken seriously as filmmakers, we should start with collecting film in high quality. I understand that a lot of effort probably went in backward, but that's the way I see it.
