I really wanted to love this film - the boom in mostly filmed in Pittsburgh and trailer had some lovely photos. But even in the off-cartoon, it was really poorly made film. Continuity and walks were both terrible. The best bits of the film are under the end credits, so that (almost) worth sticking it through (although, oddly enough, is to pick up a bit in the last half hour or so). <br /> <br /> If the best performance in the film, Andy Dick, you know that it should be a problem ...
