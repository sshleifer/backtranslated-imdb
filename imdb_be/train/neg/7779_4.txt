"True," the story of the late monster that appears when an American industrial plant begins to contaminate the water. Funny, though not very well, a monster movie has a lot of people who are trying to get the monster and find out what's going on, but not completely with the path. Give him points for giving us a giant monster that they are clearly built to scale for some scenes, but some take away the fact that it looks like the sun threatening puppy. A funny movie that operation pleasant stupid in the right mood. (Maya, one complaint is that the seal is used in the production of Elvira is so poor that it looks well-worn copy of the videos, which was in the past the prime 20 years ago.)
