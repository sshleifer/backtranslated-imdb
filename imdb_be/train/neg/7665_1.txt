Honestly, I can not be bothered to waste my time writing this boundary cinematic incompetence - life is just too short. What I have to say that Alone In The Dark manage only three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. He manages to throw a few useless areas in the air, but dropping all of them. <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> 3. It completely dishonor the classic PC game, where he allegedly on the basis of being a complete failure in all aspects of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Dr. Ball, if this is really what you (I mean here proctology), what on earth are you doing in the director's chair?
