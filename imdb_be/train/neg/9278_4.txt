The fact that I was watching the whole film says something about it ... or me. This is not a good film. Terrible in fact. But terrible in a way that kept my attention in this perverse manner, it seems to watch the tragedy and not being able to look away. This would make a great subject MST3K <br /> <br /> Most of the things that make a terrible film enjoyable here :! Bad dialogue is unacceptable music, flimsy plot sequence ridiculous pseudoscience. You'll thrill to the slow motion death sequences, the poor victim with open mouths and waaaaaaaay too much time to contemplate their doom, before defiantly contrived Savior of their death. Your heart will be warmed up the old cliches of action scenes, like when two women fighting over a gun and goes, but who SHOT? Both are looking at yourself, then the second, then themselves, then (seemingly after 15 minutes), one finally goes down. You'll be singing (in Latin, of course) with a street chanted, which turn into a terrible death's choir, which for a moment threatened to turn the film into a twisted musical. <br /> <br /> So, if you think I can do it as a movie even worse, they are better then this may be the answer for you. It's not as funny as my current sci-fi schlock favorite, "They live" with Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's more fun to watch than the warm onion movies like Omen II or III. <br /> <br /> I give 4 10.
