Alien Hunter: 5 from 10: Is it me or does every film that begins in Roswell, New Mexico suck. Take alien mixed with the thing, mixed with a contact, mixed with all the things on the beach, the Andromeda Strain, class scene with Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, and throw in a small Stargate to download. <br /> <br /> The derivative does not even begin to describe this film. Of course, with nothing original plot wise they Fluorescent H Gore up and have sex right? Nea blood is flashing and you miss it affair and sex all the teasing. (James Spader causal mentions he needs a shower and attractive Lely Stefansson asked to join him ??. He turns her down. AGGH!) <br /> <br /> In fact, if a movie is ever needed in the shower stage to liven things up before it. I mean, if your going to have an incredibly nice woman in white swimsuits wandering around a research base in Antarctica, why not go to the bank. <br /> <br /> With about 30 seconds of actual thrills throughout the movie Alien Hunter Remarkably, serious and slow motion for the sci-fi adventure. We need a much better twist to spice it up and, by the way Alien itself terribly clich√©d artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half title. <br /> <br /> I also asked during the show that children in the space of corn motif. (Please note that from Jason in Friday the 13th fame, Pinhead from Hellraiser and Leprechaun business went into space to kill a marriage teenager, why not sow?) Characters in a cornfield dress like Run extras logo, and I was just waiting for the stems come alive and attack them. <br /> <br /> But this would be an interesting and apparently against this movie covenant. It operates mainly good as Spader reprise his role in Stargate while Stefanson and Janine Ten modeling the latest beach in Antarctica. John Lynch however read the whole script and acting like a mad villain long before this story will show it. <br /> <br /> Alien Hunter disappointment derivative tedious that makes me sad Proper Children of the Corn in a space movie.
