Well then. I just watched a shit-load of movies - all with varying degrees of quality. I was not sure which one I would consider first. Then it hit me like a sack-a-Rat: Rodentz. Warn people about Rodentz. This ugliness is not one star and painfully boring to sit through. And it's about a mutant rat killing people. Yes ... a real freaking "original. "Food of the Gods", or who "Willard"? It was better than this, and it does not say anything ... <br /> <br /> ** Possible Spoiler ** Well here's the story: Inna laboratory scientist and his brave assistant experimenting on rats and their laboratory in poor neighborhoods and Freestuff building and feeble-minded friends Brave assistant shows a drunk, and everything becomes food for rats and mad about everyone dies, and, oh yes, there is one giant rat that looks nasty, but she would be killed, the end, there, all at once an award! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff !! I beg to differ! Second, we all understand that there is a giant rat, we all know that will die in the end !! ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Here's the breakdown: <br /> <br /> The good: <br /> <br /> --Well, I watched it for free, but for everyone else .. . Um, no. There's nothing good here. <br /> <br /> It does not hurt does not help: <br /> <br /> --Um ... well. gore was decent. --Very average cinematography. <br /> <br /> --CG rats are not as bad as they could have been in a few shots ... <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: <br /> <br /> - .. and in other shots, CG rats were pathetic that look cheap. See if your film is low budget, maybe you should not rely on CG. The lesson to take to heart. <br /> <br /> --The works very poorly <br /> <br /> --The of uninteresting characters. - we have a mishmash of cliches and none of them have not even done it well, <br /> <br /> --Booooooooooooring <br /> <br /> --Been done before. - many times. <br /> <br /> --Stupid history, just stupid <br /> <br /> --Giant rat looks like a fat man in an ill-conceived bear suit. - it was funny - but not funny enough to give the film any value. <br /> <br /> --Retarded, unreal and sad dialogue. <br /> <br /> --All college student rat chow people drink tequila from huge plastic milk jugs - and yet they do not seem to drink anything longer than a few seconds. Adhere to the path of continuity, the boys <br /> <br /> Ugly :. <br /> <br /> --This film bad. Just awful. Worse than you can imagine. It's not even funny bad as, for example, the "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead." Now these movies shit you can enjoy. Even if they make you more stupid <br /> <br /> Memorable scenes :. <br /> <br /> --The lame action movie ending, complete with intact characters and explosions. Because he did not feel at all like the rest of this ugliness - but still sucked <br /> <br /> Acting: 2/10 Story: 1/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Operator: Development 4/10 marks. : 0/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 4/10 nudity / sexuality: 1/10 (I was committed to my son at times during the film, so I may have missed it, but there was supposedly) Violence / Gore: 4/10 Dialogue : 2/10 Music: 1/10 (average time) Record: 1/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> cheesiness: 7/10 crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br / > overall: 1/10 <br /> <br /> See, only if you like rats and pests on the basis of a horror movie. Wait ... Check. Do not look. This is crap. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
