This whole film has lasted 45 minutes - maximum. Although interesting concept / theme, it does not develop as history. After the initial idea brave (foolish?) Expert on explosive ordnance disposal (cowboy?) Entered, and it occurs very early in the film, the remaining repetitions. Characters that have not been studied, and aspects of the deployment and policies have been ignored. We had a good understanding of the enormous difficulties faced by the troops in such an environment, and the difficulty in differentiating between the way and the enemy. But the way in which the device is stretched belief! Individual performances were good and the special effects were adequate, but not enough to overcome the main disadvantage of the content.
