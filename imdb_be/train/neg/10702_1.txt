Dialogue: stilted, formulaic; Responsibilities: stilted, formulaic; The plot :. predictable, formulaic <br /> <br /> Just because Christopher Plummer Kinsky makes the «B» garbage? Plummer has been well established for several decades before the film was made, Kinski were masterpieces like "Tess" and «Cat People» for her ... I must be desperate. <br /> <br /> The bad guys all have bad guy accents - * bad * bad guy accents! (Plummer especially! * Where did he learn to do * "German"?), And most of them have a bad guy makes fun as well. Innocent bystanders all overdo their panic enough to make you laugh. Good guy survives, among other things: * 5 "throwing knife buried hilt-deep in his shoulder - just pull it up and use a hand without a job at all, * Marine Corps machine-gun fire (I think someone refers to .50) after a few seconds leg, which he understands, tying a bandage around his leg and then he barely has a limp; * a few fisticuffs in which it supports several blows to the face and skull -First triggered in the door frame ;. * and, in the autumn reverse direction from that similar to the third floor, n and paving, without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconveniences scenario has exactly 3 clever line, the rest of the time it's all so boring and sad. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not so bad. Plummer really brings a certain class to its parts, and, undoubtedly, the best actor in this movie. Of course, it does not say much, but he can make callous villain without the ham methods most used are the villains. he de his liver «Ve HAFF Weiss and meance» line type with a certain risk, but you will always be aware you are watching the current villain Christopher Plummer. <br /> <br /> This film really terrible waste of time. Actions such as this, is their native 70-007 movies wooden shipping line meets Bruce Lee very obviously fake fight scenes, but it's not even anywhere as good as anything Roger Moore 007 or Bruce Lee movies. Do not disturb.
