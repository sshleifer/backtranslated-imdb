We laughed a lot - because it is so incredibly bad - sorry for the people, but it is definitely one of the worst films I have ever seen ... I know this is a low budget, but in any case: the actors behave as play in the soap, dialogue is absolutely bad, and the last time I saw such a strange picture was endless garbage on some video youth festival ten years ago. I appreciate that people get together and shoot cheap movies, but at least some of the quality to be achieved. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the film was quiet interesting and looked good - and the bill was really worth listening to. DVD cover promised much, but it is definitely the best this film has to offer ...
