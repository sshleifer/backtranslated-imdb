9, the film I can not wait for a few months .... was little more than a disappointment. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised by the absence of 9 on the history and development of the wonderful nature. It's not up to the strange world of the sequence of actions for a callous nature. <br /> <br /> A strange, almost thrown into the occult order was not only ridiculous, they were furious. The story about robots and scientists ... why did it suddenly become a wannabe horror Necronomicon with mystical symbols and magical green dotted lines instead of to provide answers that would be wonderful horror story device ?? <br /> <br /> how, what, when, why .... questions baud ask only if you care, and it is becoming less and less likely that you will, as you get to the theater. <br /> <br /> The film as a disappointment because of the lack of depth .... I would watch this film, made in the shallow, when the story was good. But the filmmakers relied on CGI wizardry and Burton's name to draw in the crowd. ... that is what attracted me to Russia, but not able to get my respect. <br /> <br /> 9 can be weird ... with a few rewrites and a little more respect from their own creators.
