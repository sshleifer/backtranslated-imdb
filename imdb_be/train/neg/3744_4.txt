This film is an attempt to introduce Jared Diamonds theory of "Guns, Germs and Steel," which explain how Europeans have dominated much of the globe. <br /> <br /> I've seen versions of this documentary was released on 2 discs covering 3 hours. I think this information could be presented in 20 minutes. There are totally useless scene: Professor Jared Diamond, bird watching binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond is not able to use a bow and arrow correctly, muzzle-loader Professor Jared Diamond of shooting bad. It was this film should make a hero of the "Professor Jared Diamond?". This part of the movie was so bad, it would be a travesty. Worst of all was when the diamond is shown destruction and tears, when touring the ward of malaria in an African hospital. None of this helps me to understand his theory of "Guns, Germs, and Steel." By the way, "Guns, Germs and Steel" is said to have about 100 times. "Can Europeans guns, germs and steel to get them out of this difficult situation? Stay tuned and find out! "When he finally to the point, his theory of equal parts interesting and quite sad. Europeans conquered the native peoples of other countries, because they had arms and thin blades against the stone and wooden weapons. Do I really need a professor to convince me of that? Part of his theory, explaining how Europeans came to have advantages that allow the conquest of interest, but the coating paper thin. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think that the documentary only trying to convince me that non-Europeans as capable as Europeans. If I'm not racist, I already know what it is. When I was a racist, Jared Diamond is not going to convince me of his clumsy use of native instruments. <br /> <br /> I do not think that adults are the target audience for this documentary. Children can enjoy it more than I did, though. I read that book, from which this film is much better than a documentary.
