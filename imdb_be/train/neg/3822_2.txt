In order to be a fan of Buster Keaton to your heart broken on a regular basis. Most of us first met Keaton in one of the most brilliant feature films with his long period of independent production: "General", "Navigator", "Sherlock Jnr". We recognize him as the greatest figure in the history of film comedy, and we want to see all of his films. Here begins the mountain. After "Steamboat Bill Jr." Keaton in-law Joseph Schenck put pressure on him to sign a contract that Keaton put under the control of MGM. Keaton became just another actor for hire, doing other people's scripts. Then his alcoholism worse. After "Steamboat Bill Jr." Keaton never made the film truly first rate. Several sources describe the future masterpiece of comedy that Keaton claimed that he was * almost * got to do in MGM: parody «Grand Hotel». Biographer Tom Dardis offered compelling evidence that Keaton did that story. <br /> <br /> Heartbreak increases, because, among the many long years of steady decline Keaton, he only occasionally came up with a good film ... such as his short comedy "Grand Slam Opera". I continue to look for lost frames dramatic scene Keaton with Spencer Tracy in "It's a Mad Mad World»: the sequence in which the embittered police Tracy Phones old retired Crook (Keaton), and trying to enlist his help in stealing cash Smiler Grogan, this footage will almost certainly disappear forever, but I keep looking. <br /> <br /> «Speak Easy", unfortunately, one of Keaton's films from the beginning of its decline. MGM tried to create Jimmy Durante (which, coincidentally, played Smiler Grogan three decades later) as a new comedy stars. Unfortunately, MGM tried to create a united Durante his Keaton, whose style of comedy was simply incompatible with Durant. (. I am a fan of both) Throughout his career, Durante was a ruthless kidnapper scene: commendable, he knew that he had built up due to Keaton, and Keaton was the only co-star that Durante never tried to overshadow. <br /> <br /> Keaton often cast as the victim of an extremely hard fraud. In the "Speak Easy", he plays a didactic and sadly professor Midwestern College by the name of Post (because he is as wooden as one), who receives a letter that informs him that he had inherited $ 750,000, which he had go to New York to qualify. It makes it to "phone call to verify this? Does he even check the postmark? no; he takes his life savings from the bank and sent to New York. As soon as he left, the waiter Post admits that he wrote the (fake) letter shove Professor station with its tracks! <br /> <br /> Post who thinks he is 3/4 millionaire, crosses paths with Jimmy Dodge (Durante), who is trying to make a musical revue, but does not have any money. Symbols that two brilliant comedians who play on the screen just do not intermesh. Keaton plays one of these egg-headed (as Mister logic «Viz»), which intellectualises all. Durante plays one of those annoying hepcats, who are unable to make any simple statement, because the script requires him to always speak slang. There's a painfully unfunny dialogue scene in which Durante Keaton tries to talk to about money, but - rather than directly with him - Durante should use the more far-fetched slang terms like "cabbage", "somersaults" and so on ... in while Keaton, of course, has no idea about what to Durant about. I will give credit Keaton, his own voice, dry and dusty prairie, his flat Kansas accent, absolutely perfect for the character he played here <br /> <br /> Sidney Toler, it looks much more compact and more beautiful than it is here. is only a year later, impressive as excitable director revue funded (by a tick) Professor Post. Henry Armetta, which I have never found a fun, even less funny than usual here, offering a running gag with stupid bribery. Thelma Todd struck me here in a criminal version of the role she played in the «Horse Feathers» (much funnier movie). Edward Brophy, one of my favorite character actors, wasted. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem with the "Speak Easy" that recurring characters behave quite inappropriately. Lawyer Keaton appears in the theater of Durant urgent message for Keaton ... but he was not there, so that the lawyer continues to reveal personal matters Keaton to the first stranger he meets. (Fire, lawyer, Buster!) In another scene, Professor Post - a guy who is perceived as bankrolling this musical - blunders in the dressing room the chorus girls, and all the chorus girls squeal and immediately hide behind. I know for a fact that the * modern * chorus girls would never react this way, and I seriously doubt that the girls choir in 1932 behaved in such a way ... or certainly not in response to the "angel" controlling pursestrings their shows. <, Br /> <br /> SPOILERS COMING. After about half an hour not funny, "Speak Easy", a great Jimmy Durante sits down at the piano, smiling at the camera and makes it distinctive little shake of his head when he starts to play the melody. This is the moment when I thought that, in the end, this movie finally settle on its purpose of entertaining us. Unfortunately, no. The most annoying all the end of the film, which uses only the most banal and cliché-fetched at all comedy: one in which absolutely incompetent fool becomes a star comedian through his own ineptitude. (Keaton will be forced to repeat a cliché, in 1955 the episode "Director Screen Playhouse», Chaplin had already used it in the "Circus"). <br /> <br /> I almost cried - in anger and grief - to missed opportunities in the "Speak Easy". Mainly out of respect for the work that Keaton, Durante, Toler, Brophy and Miss Todd did elsewhere, I will vote for this film 2 points out of 10. <br /> <br />
