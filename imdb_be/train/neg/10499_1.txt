Well, first of all, Steve Irwin, rest in peace. You have been loved by many fans. Now ... this film was not a film at all. It was the television program "Crocodile Hunter" with bad acting, bad script, bad directing, and in between Steve capture or teach us about the animals. He was interested in the animal GOS / specialist. Millions will miss him. But the whole idea of ​​the film was a big mistake. The site was so impressed that almost does not exist. The casting was horrible. Actions do not even have to elementary school-level actors. Direction should be broken as well. If you can not get half way decent performance out of your actors, no matter how bad the script, you have to be not so good in the first place. I could write a better script. I wish I had never been to see this movie. Of course, I watched the $ 3 ($ 1.50 to me $ 1.50 for my son.) And with friends who insisted on seeing this instead of the live-action Scooby Doo. My son, who is not so picky, liked the movie well, but he still never asked to see it again. If you want warm memories of the Steve Irwin, to buy his series on DVD. Avoid this film like the plague. If I were Steve, I know that I would not want to remember this movie. Respect him avoid this movie!
