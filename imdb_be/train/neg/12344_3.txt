Tense comedy, sketch, like the revue, which was originally a car to demonstrate the one-time radio star Jack Pearl, but is now best remembered as an introduction to America in The Three Stooges. Actually, Larry, and Moe Curl charged with comic Ted Healy as Ted Healy and his Three Stooges. While supporting cast features Jimmy Durante (which is completely wasted on dull material) and Pitts, seiza, only the audience of the film these days puppets addicts, and even they will not find much to applaud here. Incredibly loud and overbearing, he shows how Hollywood had to go to achieve a certain level of complexity farce. * 1/2 ****
