What it was exciting and quite original series Fox degraded to a winding scar. During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly list of "must see", and not just because Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the powers that be over at Fox have decided that they need to "tweak" story line. In 3 episodes of season opener, they have completely lost me as a viewer (not even see Jessica Alba! .) I found that the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish new story stretched continuity and confidence in the show too thin on one of the episodes of the second season, they even had Max to sleep and dream -.. where the first season, she said biologically could not sleep <br /> <br /> moral of the story (the one that Hollywood never am rymlivae) .: when it works, do not tighten this! <br /> <br /> azjazz
