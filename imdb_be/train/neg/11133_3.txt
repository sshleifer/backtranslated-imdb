the better than average actor's two leads with the exception of this film is really very bad. Cheap production values ​​do not help. Of course, you do not notice that the production values ​​are cheap, if they do not continue to try to convince you that they had a production value to begin with. Even for the B-movie genre freak like me, this movie really sucks.
