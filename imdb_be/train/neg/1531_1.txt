This movie is so bad it made me sick. Poorly made, full of laughter free zone. Why in God's name would you fake film, which to some extent is a parody (and damn funny one at that), how is it? Set of funny, the effects are so bad that they are not even funny, and acting a farce. It's a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this piece of garbage. National Lampoon once made a home for animals that people still believe to be entirely cheerful. Now they have been attributed to the creation of television films, like this piece of ****. What are the swear words, and it can really be used to describe this film.
