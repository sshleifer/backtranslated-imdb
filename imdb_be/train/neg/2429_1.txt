Scary scary .. Yes !! Jam-packed with nudity (of fat people thin people), olives Beach takes place on a nudist beach in SA <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this film two years ago - we can say with confidence that did an amazing discussion topic at school the next day. This movie was terrible! A little romantic comedy - a showcase of nudity! This film hit its lowpoint with one of the new-age characters staring between the legs of a girl <br /> <br /> The girl :. You're not going to find God there! Guy: No, but I think I found the sky <br /> <br /> Stay away from this if you do not want to hear amateur actor to discuss topics such as farting, adultery and process superlguing their genitals together .. AVOID!
