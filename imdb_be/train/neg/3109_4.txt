This movie was not terrible, but it was not very good. I'm a big fan of Toni Collette, I think she is very beautiful and talented actress. The film begins on Robin Williams, who the writer and receives a book from the 14-year-old child. The book is great, and he cant't believes that the child wrote. Toni Collette plays the guardian of a child who you do not know where this kid really exists, or if it does it all. I'm not going to ruin the movie, but I will say this movie is not scary. <br /> <br /> action pretty well and the performance of Toni Collette was strange, and Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> The film was a huge disappointment, in my opinion, I would wait for him to come to DVD.
