Firstly, let me get ahead of this post by saying that I'm a fan of the original Star Wars movie ... I do not read books, play games, wear underwear or eat porridge (if there is one). I'm just a fan of movies. <br /> <br /> With that being said, I'm struggling to see how people give this movie so much appreciated. Taking the film itself, rather than comparing it's awful precursor of (EP 1, 2), I do not understand how you can say that this is an amazing film. For all the terrible shortcomings of the script - the cheesy dialogue, invented scenes (ie R2 suddenly be a bully, and long CGI intense chase scenes that have little human touch), hardcore action and pointed out plot holes ... as well? There was no real internal dilemma Anakin; it just seemed that the switch was flipped, and he suddenly evil. I was not interested in the movie until the last 20 minutes or so (which, incidentally, was devastated «NOOOOOO!» Frankenstein scene). If you bomb the screen much amazing effects CGI and fill in the blanks with absolutely brutal jokes, if more can and should be said that this is not a great film. For a film with such a "dark" tone that was too much levity to the speech of the characters <br /> <br /> I close with the question :. From the beginning to the end of the film, there was actually a sense of urgency and importance of what is actually about to take place?
