I can not believe that someone thought that nothing original or interesting about this film. I'm a fan of science fiction as much as the next guy, and I can even enjoy old movies with inappropriate location for the time they were written by someone other than a monkey. (See, for example, my ardent review Altered States [1980].) <br /> <br /> monkey could explain better why I have to second to take seriously the basic idea of ​​the film. The problem lies not in the fact that manufacturers have a low budget - is that they did not try <br /> <br /> Now, to publicly humiliate useless magazines, whose glowing reviews appeared on the field: <br /> <. br /> Chicago Tribune <br /> <br /> San Francisco Chronicle <br /> <br /> San Francisco Bay Guardian <br /> <br /> (in fact, I like to read the last two. It But their movie review trust passed the floor. But I know that if I ever do a movie with a handheld camera, cheesy storyline and blunt the effects, I'll show these journalists and to remind them that they were talking about thinking Hell.)
