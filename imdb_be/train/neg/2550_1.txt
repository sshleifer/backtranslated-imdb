It was the tag-line "in the tradition of the American pie" that deceive me to rent this film. What I got was a piece of trash in the Jackass-style, with the main difference being that in comparison with the Jackass movie seems to Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> This film made me wish I was awarded the other films 1 out of 10, because now I can not under it. This one does a pretty bad movie like cinematic feats. <br /> <br /> I actually he was expelled after 45 minutes, and this is something that I very rarely. But it was just too plain boring, stupid, uninteresting and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that some people actually reward it with a 10 out of 10. What do parents do? Drop your head when you were a kid? Or it was the first movie you've ever seen, so you got nothing to compare it to? Are you still a virgin and chest all that you ever thought off? Something must be wrong, at least, <br /> <br /> My advice :. Stay away from this. Even if your in the mood for a simple movie that does not require thinking, choose something else, or you will regret it for sure.
