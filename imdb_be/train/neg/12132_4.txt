Trio low life criminals, led by Matt Dillon, fails a late-night burglary. They run, but quickly crossing paths with the police, who just happened to be in hot pursuit of terrorists. Of course, the error police cracker terrorist gang, the real terrorist escapes and robbers are forced to take refuge in a small dive bar, hostage-taking, do not know why the police are so keen to catch them. And guess who else took the bar as a shelter for the night? <br /> <br /> Incredible? Absolutely. And it goes down hill from there. Spacey did buy a few good acting talent; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen, M. Emmet Walsh, but all in vain. Mainly because, after all the characters are stuck in the bar, all they do for the rest of the film claim. Endlessly and aimlessly. Even before the completion of the movie you stopped giving a damn about what happens to them.
