Unfortunately, sad realism. This movie, I thought it would never end, it would be better if all the characters have been dropped in the first five minutes of the atomic bomb. Where the blade when you need it? At the time, as gloomy as the martial CURRENT, Requiem for a Dream, and as horrible as Boyce MOI, DEAD there is not as much fun as any of the aforementioned gloomy films. While cannibalism may make gratuitous wannabe Jeffrey Dalmers heart race a little faster, it was not as exciting as predatory. In fact, I found it as interesting as night transfer, and as exciting as a trip to the dentist. If you have a strong masochistic quality, you may be able to stand it, otherwise, to anyone. I was very surprised that it was not done by people on Brain Damage, as it was the quality of the dead creatures.
