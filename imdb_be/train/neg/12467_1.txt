This film was slower than molasses in January ... in Alaska. The person who has put togeather preview should receive remuneration for management to put each of the 30 seconds that were interisting in preview. I had to wake up the people, I watched it several times. After it was over, I felt bad for what woke them. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is taken from hoping something will actually happen, but does nothing. It was easy to lose track of the motives of people, and the characters were flat and uninteristing. By the end of the movie, you just hope everyone will die. Each runs either contemptible, petty or pathetic, and usually all three. <br /> <br /> And even worse, we observed a minute or two of extra features, just for kicks and giggles, you know, and all that we saw people being complacent about how social know they there. If they were to spend time on the film, they pat themselves on the back, it may be worth a look. <br /> <br /> I was brought up in the excitement of waiting for 24 ". I got a lecture about social awareness through blery nap eyes.
