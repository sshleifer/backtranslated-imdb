If you are looking for eye candy, you can enjoy Sky Captain. Sky Captain just videogames injected with live performers. In visials beautiful and interesting to look at throughout the film. Now, saying that, visual only good at Sky Captain. <br /> <br /> In ten minutes, I knew that I was watching one of the worst films of all time. I was hoping that this film will be better, but it never achieved any degree of interest. Thirty minutes later, the desire to get out continued to grow and grow. Now I have more than 2,000 movies and saw, probably five times the number. However, this is only the second film I felt the comfort of my entire life. <br /> <br /> --- acting there. Three top performers are helpless. Jude Law (also in another movie, I wanted to go to) just awful in the title role. I would sit by Ben Affleck in Gigli, than watching the law again. <br /> <br /> Paltrow is trying so hard to be affectation, she goes to her face. In the last article I read said that Paltrow thinks sit at home and be a mother and not to act. Following this presentation, I would like to welcome the decision. <br /> <br /> The history --- Soap operas better written. The story behind the Sky Captain starts bad and getting worse as it progresses. HN <br /> <br /> --- no uncut. Everything was put into special effects, the story, acting and directing suffer greatly. Even "The Phantom Menace" was better to act and that is not saying much. <br /> <br /> I would give this film the "0" to "10". Avoid paying the price in the theater and wait until the video release.
