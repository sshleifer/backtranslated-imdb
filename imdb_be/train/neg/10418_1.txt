THIS IS NOT A FILM CHILDREN !!! <br /> <br /> This film is like a "bad trip acid" for children under the age of 5. For a month is 4 years from time to time will ask me, "Why is a rabbit bleeding from the mouth," or "Why is the bulldozer to bury all rabbit? ". (And it was not the worst). We stopped about 1/2 hours but the damage was already done. Intensely painful, oppressive, violent. Fortunately, he finally, I forgot helpless things. Who would have thought that this film should be in the market for children should be brought up on charges. ... (Go ahead blame me, my conscience is clear.).
