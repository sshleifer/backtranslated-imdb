... and I've seen some bad. <br /> <br /> I do not have anything good to say about this film. The current poor Jennifer Tilly - as one would expect. . Daryl Hannah does the job OK, but nothing close to being able to save the movie <br /> <br /> The biggest drawback in this film that the story is so weak - though based on a good premise - that the writer appealed to the "silly trick heroine "to create a far-fetched unknown. If all of Daryl Hannah have to do is to hide, she runs to her pursuer. The hospital scene is absurd. Without exposing too much of what takes place on the site, I think it will be difficult for the bloody petite woman wearing a pregnant woman from the hospital without being seen. Lame. Very lame. <br /> <br /> Save some time and select a different movie.
