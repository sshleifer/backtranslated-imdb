I thought that «Intensive Care» was very bad and very unintentionally funny. But, at least not as bad as I thought it might be. Sometimes it is somewhat alarming, but not a good shocker. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing is funny moments. But all the time it's a classic moment: Peter (Koen Wauters) stabbed and beat the killer. He is moaning in the corner of the corridor. Hey (Nada van Nie) crouches down next to him and asks: "Poor Peter, I have to get you a bandage?". <br /> <br /> This film was made in Dutch and English. To the cost of replacement, all the plates are the United States, and the background in the news studio is the Manhattan skyline. Very funny if you are Dutch and view the original version in the Dutch language.
