I saw Chan absent when it first came out, about four years after moving from San Francisco to New York. Maybe it's the prospect of several years away, but this film seemed to capture the essence of the city and its people better than anything else I've ever seen (still does). It concentrates on one particular community - the Chinese - but that's OK, because a large part of the soul of the city are refracted through the setting face, and may be higher, all the voices of characters <br /> <br /> It. Sun tourists in San Francisco. Settings submissive and every day by taxi, the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant, Richmond District row houses, small apartments Chinatown and small business offices, piers, Philippine senior center. This is what the city looks and feels like every day to people who live there - even now, in the era of Silicon Gulch urban redevelopment. Unlike, say, Dirty Harry (in their own way beautiful San Francisco film as well), all filmed at street level: We have come to understand the point of the characters view, from the point of view of their surroundings to give them, and not from some fancy dizzying shooting . <br /> <br /> Van apparently shot in B & W, because he could not afford to do otherwise, but one of the strongest visual elements of the film in natural light, it achieves. Often severe, pervasive quality of sunlight is one of my closest associations of San Francisco: It seems to put everything in the resulting buildings, hills, and other landmarks and down the scale, it is ridiculous that makes people you pass on the street It seems more personal and potentially closer to you than they could anywhere else. Photo Van perfectly conveys it, and even helps the story together at points. <br /> <br /> Van captures speech and conversational style of Chinese and other San Franciscans better than anyone else does, I guess. If there is such a thing as a true San Francisco "emphasis," is what you hear from alopecia taxi medallion broker (I think), which is talking on the phone in one scene (listen to what he calls the person on the other the end! ". I dingaling") <br /> <br /> history of acute and, in spite of some very small error, making it a beautiful point of anguish, which pull in the hearts of the people who live in older immigrant communities - in including justified political and ethnic grievances, and slightly ironic entertainment, which help feed them. All of this is passed gently - perhaps why some respondents think the film meanders here. It is not -. Suffice it to say that the search for the two taxi drivers for Chan becomes a desire for something more personal <br /> <br /> Chan missing ends with Travelogue Chinatown sequence supported by the infinite novelty song from the 1930s (I think) of San Francisco, and all his crazy variety. American cartoons, yes, but somehow not quite off the mark either.
