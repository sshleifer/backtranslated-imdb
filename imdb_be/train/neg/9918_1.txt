Another British film flag waver. Real rubbish on offer again here. I can not understand (I British), why is it over the top, patriotic nonsense was ever done. Eight years notice, from the time when the Second World War actually finished! Other commentators have noted here in the editing and imaginary seamless use of archival materials. This is very bad there. Archival footage in abundance. Model aircraft swing on wires in the "scene", as well as many children's kites in the wind. The usual sequence of map tattoo film room to make us supposedly drawn into the whole of Malta event. Guinness should have its worst performance of actor ever. Shocking why dogs fall funny fight scene. Hawkins bothers all of us to death in the region of the card number. Ealing has made many great films. This is clearly not one of them. They were supposed to stay away from such an unconvincing rot!
