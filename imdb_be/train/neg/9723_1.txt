Jeux d'Enfants, or the film was mistranslated into English Love Me film made stupid people and stupid people. I just do not know how I would have expected something worth seeing the film with such a plot: Two stupid ignorant kids are betting that one of them will do something (of course, very stupid) to prove to each other that (WTF?) they are "tough guys." I know that I exaggerated some aspects, but it is something that the entire film. They get older ... and instead of realizing that they are just a couple of eccentrics disposed continue to perform their crazy things, thinking that they are great people. <br /> <br /> One would expect such a film from Hollywood, but France? This is even more offensive to see the movie from the country that created Amelie couple of years ago, which, incidentally, the film tries to look like, but far, far away from. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
