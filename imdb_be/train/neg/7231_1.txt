I saw this on artistic cinema, which also shows the "last days" and some of the films of Charlie Chaplin. On the basis of the quality of other functions, I decided to give the "Immortal" chance. I almost did not come out of this movie, and I LOVE fiction! The story unfolds in a futuristic New York City, filled the sky advertising Blade Runner style and some other similar debate over cloning / synthetic humans. Unfortunately, the script is not condensed enough for the hour and forty-five minutes of the film. Three groups exist in this world: people, artificial people, and Egyptian gods. Artificial people seem to have the upper hand and control the policy of the city. People are slaves and used for eugenics and donor organs. Egyptian gods are floating pyramid (on the model of the Great Pyramid of Khufu, and is complete with a worn out, leaving smooth "cap" on the pyramid. There will be no floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition?). Pyramid rests above the town, and no one on earth can not understand what it is and why it's there. I will not bore you with the so-called plot, but there are a lot of unnecessary baked blood and a lot of gross-out scenes. The film, as I said, seems to have been influenced by the blade, and possibly as The Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the film works were listed thanksgiving Yous in the UK, France and Italy. French film, but uses British actors who do not speak French. Thus, it is obvious that their French dialogue was dubbed. It diverts attention and I thought that switching back and forth between real people and the animation is quite distracting. It does not help that the animation is poor - no better than video games. Skip this one.
