Well, allow me to invent a new word here: polyphobia: Fear of polyamorous relationships. This is another in a long line of films that start by tickling the audience about a trinity, just turn a dime and go all instructive about how this oh so necessary, and the only moral thing to find monogamistic decision. Only one person in a thousand knows the joy of being able to love more than one person, and this director is not one of them. . BLEH <br /> <br /> Remember my words: for decades, polyphobia will be just like a big faux pas, like homophobia, but guess who was too close-minded to understand it? Right the first time: the producers of this film. And as much as he. Why even make funny conservative and old-fashioned kind of movie like this? Proud of myself, infinitely open about homosexuality, it completely ignores the fact that we live in an age where monogamy is converted into serial monogamy, which, in turn, in developing rocking and Polyamory. Open your eyes, people, please! <br /> <br /> It's disappointing, mediocre chick flick. (But, damn it, I should say, Heather Graham nice to be alive.) <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
