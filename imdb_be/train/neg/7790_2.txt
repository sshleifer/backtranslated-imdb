Like some of the other people who reviewed this film, I was also nostalgic about it ... before I had the misfortune to actually watch it again. Unfortunately, my childhood memories of this film were very unreliable and dangerous adventures Pauline is now shown to be uncomfortable exercise in banal, racist and just plain boring film. Even the presence of the old pros Edward Everett Horton, and Terry-Thomas could not overcome the rancid script awful theme song, and some wretched "special effects." In addition, the stereotypical depictions of African and Arab characters make for painful viewing, especially when you consider it was made immediately after the civil rights movement. The original Michael Weldon Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports that Pauline Peril was originally performed for television, but for unknown reasons, end up getting a theatrical release. Judging by the results, that is plausible (and embarrassing) scenario.
