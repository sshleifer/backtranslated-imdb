With movies like this you know that you are going to get the usual jokes about ghosts. Eve, like a ghost, it's pretty funny. And the rest of the cast is also doing a good job. This trend and the history that is missing. This could be overlooked that the jokes work better. The only problem is that there is not a lot of jokes. Of course, I laughed a few times. Besides talking parrot did not have an ounce of creativity to be seen in the film. I blame the director does not use the premises for its full potential. Eve, of course, has a comedic skills to show more, but did not get the opportunity to do so. Overall, this film is ideal for lunch on Sunday. In addition, it can be omitted completely.
