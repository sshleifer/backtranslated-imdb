First of all, I thought it was naughty of them to say, in the credits, the story and the script was Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the best writers in Hollywood until his talent was not lost, and he was gone. However, he was not a Preston Sturges, it was Preston Sturges Jr. The story was mainly based on the novel by Robert Louis Stevenson's "Bottle ImpÂ». Good person comes into possession of an evil entity that will provide him with any desire, but which ultimately condemn him to hell. This is normal. No one says, the writers had to be original. Actors tend to be quite competent, given the mediocre writing that they had to translate to the screen. My biggest complaint comes to the end. Hero thinks he has found a way out of his dilemma, but is trying to solve this problem a little differently in an attempt to save the innocent. At first glance it seems to be working, but it is true to the code of the modern horror film, they feel that they have to provide one last batch of horror at the very end of the film. It's a stupid convention. Old horror movies very well suited to allowing the hero to win in the end. There's nothing wrong with good will celebrate over evil, regardless of the fact that the current crop of filmmakers seem to think. You can give the audience a good healthy scared and still make them feel happy in the end. In fact, I think it's preferable.
