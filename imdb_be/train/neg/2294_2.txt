Poor Paul Mercury. After landing the role of Scott Hastings in Strictly Ballroom, best film in history, he was able to find yourself doing a lot of garbage. None of the characters in this film are not very unpleasant, or even hateable, but lead Mercury is such a person, you would rather ignore - quite unloveable and he wears overalls. Big mistake in the design of the suit that one.
