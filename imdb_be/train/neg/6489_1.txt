What seemed like a good premise for a movie ... Unfortunately, he failed to deliver on almost every level. It is very difficult to follow in the beginning of the movie I really found myself struggling with the desire to turn it into the biggest problem with the visual aspect is the fact that the camera work just over with so many "artisticÂ» splicings and semi-subliminal cuts throughout the film that really distracts you from the total history. It's really too eager to immerse you in the moment, and to build on the disturbing final, but the movie just so many half-conceived characters and non-relevant scenarios it just leaves you feeling frustrated and confused as to why they were trying to go as deep with him,
