Rocking the hand-held camera was used, apparently in order to give the film a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that I started to get motion sickness just by seeing it. It looks like someone with cerebral palsy hold the camera (no offense for CP patients, but I do not think that you would expect to get a lot of work as a filmmaker!) The camera work was so sick, and so distracting that My wife and I thought unwatchable and abandoned it after 10 minutes of torture. I checked back a short time later (it is shown on TV), and he did not get better. I propose to give this one a miss, if you need to get rid of any bad sushi you can eat!
