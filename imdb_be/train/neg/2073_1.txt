Oh, my God. My God, I can not get over this film. It was god-awful. awful, awful! Do not even waste your money to buy it at 99 cents bunker. No, avoid it at all costs, I warn you !!! <br /> <br /> It was the worst movie I have ever seen. In my life. In my life !! <br /> <br /> First of all, G-Girl? You're kidding. Get real, that sounds like a new doll Barbie .. super woman? You're kidding. It was so fake fake fake fake. Residents even seems to not care that there were flying blond simply scaling their way around the city saving fire .. Oo big! <br /> <br /> Jesus, it was just me, or did the film seems insulting ?? I believe that you have to be a super hero a couple of double two, blond flowing hair, no glasses and skin tight leather suit? <br /> <br /> When he tries to be romantic than ... .. God, I do not know. It was awful, when love means accepting some one on the art show and how to have sex in the bed and in the air .. than they were totally love! <br /> <br /> He was gloomy, everything was going too fast. First of all, the guy was a bachelor than he meets with G-Girl .. than they broke up than he dated that girl Hannah .. and .. it just goes. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this film made me think .. How the hell did they get it in the theaters ?? !! <br /> <br /> To avoid this film at all costs.
