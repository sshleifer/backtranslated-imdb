Overrated and only for those people who have the 20-ies, which are especially fatty pink tinted glasses, who had never seen him in the first place because they were young. Terrible animation, dialogue and tired story. The real product 80s, the novel trick puzzle toy (That's right, TOY entirely absurd, pretentious and baby push "collector action figures"), which are sold on the back of poor cartoon and other devices, is only important for those who bought the toys, when they were "real" children in the period of "84" to "87". He became a cult because of those same immature adults let their memory. Avoid.
