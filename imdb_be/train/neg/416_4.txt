(Some spoilers) - as if you did not know how it will end <br /> <br /> My expectations were high Invisible. Very good commercial, director Paul Verhoeven and actors Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Shue, and a very interesting topic - invisibility. Each room has been made for a great movie. Unfortunately, these things do not matter. The film was very much a week, with no waiting, and very predictable. <br /> <br /> It's all about a bunch of scientists who discovered invisibility. After testing on animals could, Kevin Bacon decides to experience it for yourself. Once it is invisible, it completely changes, realizing the benefits seen. On this basis, to kill there's a fine line. <br /> <br /> Invisible Man is a sick movie. She suffers from a disease that many new movies: special effects. With difficult topics that could lead to a large manufacturer of tense psychological thriller, Verhoeven is ruining all the attention only on special effects, not giving a damn about the real cost of the film. I must admit that the FX is awesome, probably the best I've seen since the matrix, but it is not enough to make a good film. In fact, it is a problem with a movie today. Just as Verhoeven, most directors only care about the exciting scenes - and nothing else. The exceptions are very small, and probably the only film The Matrix, which combines some incredible special effects and a great plot. <br /> <br /> After Starship Troopers, Verhoeven again disappointing. Instead of a large film, HM is a cr * p. There are only two reasons why you might see this film: 1. 2. effects joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (I will not spoil this moment for you ...) <br /> <br /> Okay, so what went wrong with the film? All. Let's see what I can remember. <br /> <br /> --- It's not stressful at all. He was supposed to be, but it is not. <br /> <br /> --- It's too predictable. . You know, from the outset, who will die and who will live <br /> <br /> --- Instead of focusing on the psychological side, Verhoeven cares only about the impact of <br /> <br />. - - A lot of clich√©s. <br /> <br /> --- Of course, the bad guy wakes up several times before dying. <br /> <br /> --- Just as in every low-grade horror, the first rule to allow the characters to separate as much as possible. Every time there is someone alone in the lab, the perfect sacrifice for Bacon. <br /> <br /> --- Some holes in the plot. Example: in the beginning, Bacon must scan your finger to enter the lab. Once he is invisible, he can do it <br /> <br /> --- Ending :. Absolutely terrible <br /> <br /> --- after Shue Bacon hits in the head, Bacon falls down to earth. Then Shue and Brolin to leave quietly and slowly, not looking back. Is this normal? Bacon then rises, attacks them, they again to "kill" it. And then Shue screams "I heard an explosion," (there minutes ago), and they suddenly run inside. Had not she heard an explosion some time before? <br /> <br /> --- There's a scene in which you can see microphones that hang over the actors. Well, Mr. Verhoeven, I expected much more from you! <br /> <br /> So that's Hollow Man. What was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam. <br /> <br /> votes: 4 out of 10 (for special effects)
