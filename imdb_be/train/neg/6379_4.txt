With the film, entitled "Gay nigga from outer space", as you could possibly go wrong? Just throw in some more of the best patterns of characters, use the villagers as the main suppliers for the soundtrack, and throw in tons of gay gag. Portion does not matter. It is a pity that this film does not contain any of this and every joke misses the point. The characters are all similar to each other, except for the German gaynigger, one or two jokes to work, else fails. <br /> <br /> title made me laugh, and I was ready to laugh even more about the film. My expectations were high, apparently.
