I can not say what I think about this movie, it against the principles I have observed a lot of a lot of movies, and this must be the worst yet, very low budget, I believe that all the money went to the massacre scene, because I could to do a better job with the b & w 8mm camera and a crew of monkeys. It was so bad, I just registered to leave a comment, because I had to tell someone, rental space movie was not enough. But it is worth 2 cents, I believe, borrowing it from some poor sap who rented it and watch it yourself. Because I'm sure that will not spend money on it myself again. Now I leave you with this comment. I hope you did not rent a place if they will not give you back your money .. =)
