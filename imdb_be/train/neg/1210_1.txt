Where to start ... Oh yes, the message is for the bad guys: If you are the first to find the person you are tracking (to kill), who witnessed the crimes you have committed, do not spend time talking with her so that she has another opportunity to escape. Message to the victim: When the bandits speak to each other and arguing, take advantage of this opportunity to "escape" does not sit there and watch them until they hear a noise. Appeal to the Director-General: if someone has a 5 or 10 minute head start in the car or on foot, you can not have a bad guy on the heels or bumpers at once! time and movement does not work that way. It would also be nice to think that a woman should not be cruel to kill (4) man to empower itself to leave an abusive relationship at home.
