Funny horror film about a rich man (John Carradine) dies, leaving his four children, and his servants to share equally. One condition - they have to spend a week at his estate, to get money. And if some of them die, others get more. Guess what happens next .... <br /> <br /> I saw a brand new print of this movie on cable. The colors were bright and vibrant, and the house itself looks beautiful. It's about all the good things I can say about it <br /> <br /> Let's list just some of the problems that this film :. The killer apparently strange; servant called Igor and Elga - come;! some of the sound recording was so bad that I could not make out the dialogue (not a big loss, I'm sure); gore was a rare and very badly done; Other killings were just boring, stupid or impossible and this film contains some truly heinous acts - so bad, you simply look at the screen in disbelief. Even Jeff Morrow was awful! The only pretty good acting troupe was from Faith Domergue (who deserved better than this) and John Carradine (who looks sickly and infirm old here). I must admit, though - the closure of the line in this film is a gem <br /> <br /> Why is it was renamed the "Legacy of Blood" is beyond me - there are one thousand nine hundred seventy-eight a horror movie with the same name <! br /> <br /> Regardless of its name, is a bad film. It should be avoided at all costs.
