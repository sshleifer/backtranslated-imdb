Hollywood thanks. Another film classic completely destroyed cheap, shallow, the effect of heavy and excessive remake. The original "Planet of the Apes" was an intelligent and thought-provoking film with a very clear message. It was a film that is almost entirely focused on the dialogue, which sounds very boring but is actually very interesting. <br /> <br /> This film, on the other hand, seems to be committed with almost all dialogue. Instead, we get a great movie is incredibly stupid movie chase two o'clock. Conversation was kept to a minimum simple, character interaction and development are non-existent, and most of the time it is very difficult to understand what is happening. Instead, we get a bunch of meaningless scenes, some a little funny jokes and some very hollow quasi-intellectual conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth mentioning about this film, it looks absolutely fantastic. Makeup monkeys gorgeous and beautiful scenery and backgrounds too. However, this does not distract from the fact that the "Planet of the Apes (2001)" is very small and simplified film, filled with paper thin characters, silly dialogue and almost non-existent plot. Please, Hollywood, stop ruining the great movies, turning them into mindless action. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the ending does not make any sense at all. <br /> <br /> * with **** stars, mainly for visual <br /> <br />
