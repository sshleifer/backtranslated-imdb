Spoilers will be in it. The film could have been better if they had just had another script, the director and provider of CGI. Not quite right? The film has a man from his own theme park ... uh ... the zoo on a desert island, where people can see the dinosaur ... uh ... Sabretooths and called Jurra ... oops ... Primal Park. I am not against rip-off, because there are no original ideas for this kind of movie, but this one just slaps in the face of this, R e p e a t e e l y.There even "head beings on surveillance design" things. sabretooths, not sabretooths according to Mr. Primal Park (all the ancient cats murder), quite useless, but to achieve the crown is the one I call the «Sloggy». because, after getting rid of a large cat, the hero is resting a little, because there is the only one left. enter the country feeding the guy who says, Nah, we did three, the third being the monster that yagne yourself around with the front legs. Great, groovy. A group of college students is also on the island for a scavenger hunt, there is a test to get into their fraternity click or kind (I always thought that we needed a short alias). Of those who live alone one has completed his task, so I got a kick out of it. Oh, and be sure to "Evil capitalist must die" Click in force with not one, but two of them! Death Primal Mr. Park is the most ridiculous thing you will see in one of these films as a tooth bank statue saber-toothed in the loose (petting S loggy), compressed in several sizes, and pierces through the man's throat. If only I had gone so easily. I like the "toothed" better than a spin-off.
