This film looks promising, but it was really very bad. The room was O.K, but the story itself was awful. Actors tried with limited material, but they can not rise above the average college spiritedness of this sticky film. Jason Schwartzman was again very annoying - even more than in Rushmore, the rest of the cast were very un-eventful. Scenes that were fun, were, repel and incredibly minor. It is trying to be a Road Trip / American Pie, but not depressing at all levels. A total waste of time each.
