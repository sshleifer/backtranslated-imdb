Well, in the endless quest of terror, we will come through this movie seems to be re-released on DVD in recent years for some reason, the godless. Transmission quality is awful and simply sucks. I do not think that this is due to poor reissue or anything, I just think that the film is poorly made. <br /> <br /> Obviously, filmed in an abandoned school budget, which was no doubt spend money on cheap beer and no talent hacks, «Slaughter High» starts slowly and does not pick up the pace until about an hour. First, we get to see the "nerd" as he molested a group ... I do not really "do not even know what they were supposed to be ... jocks? The ringleader, with its ultra hooknose so ugly, he was definitely cast as a botanist. Then, there is "a great guy" and a couple of stupid losers and chicks, which are supposed to be "hot", but they are not. It's a mystery why this group of defective picking on one of their own, but I think the viewer to assume a collection of «Cool Kids» at the weakling. casting choice is terrible, like most high schoolers play thirty. Like other reviewers on here have shown, the actors (if you can call it that) a bunch of Brits whose accents to escape many times throughout this piece of shit. One could assume that this group of "children" were the only students in the school, as well as their "reunification" is only their school, which is now shown to give as soon as them. <br /> <br /> Killing the lame, the gore is not great, and the script as Scooby-Doo with real people; lines like: "This place gives me the creeps ..." and "Someone give me a beer" are the highlights ... It's just not good. Skip this one if you do not get wasted with friends and want to laugh at a lame attempt at a real slasher. If you want to see the good, get Bava «Bay Of Blood» made 14 years ago, and a heck of a lot better. If you want to see a good slasher BAD see "Before Dawn" or «The Burning». 2 out of 10 children.
