I decided to see this show after seeing the endless ads for it on the BBC for a few weeks before launch. I watched it in spite of the fact that I do not like pretentious kind of stuff that says Hollinghurst (sorry for my fans, but I think we are dealing with the emperor's new clothes with this author work). I admit that the current great, it's beautifully shot, and I was pleasant enough to him - however- I found that the story was very thin, and when all the three episodes feel very dissatisfied with this rather empty products. "Obviously" gay sex, the media mumbled about everything has been done before on TV - a few times - so that there was nothing very shocking, I'm scared. Full marks for production values, but low ones for the storyline / content, I'm afraid.
