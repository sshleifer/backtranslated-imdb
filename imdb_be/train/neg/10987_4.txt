I loved the novel by Margaret Atwood's "The Robber Bride," and I was excited to see there was a version of the film. Woman police personnel other for his own murder, and his friend, a former police reporter, trying to clear his name, checking on the crazy friends of the deceased woman. It is fortunate that the script of the film captures the awkward conspiracy Ms. Atwood, focusing on the history of these two men, the victims of treacherous women ... <br /> <br /> Heh. Well, you did. If these guys are mentioned in the book, and I'm sure they are completely made for the film, I'll have a little bit of my dust cover copy. Apparently, the three main female characters in the novel are not enough to carry the movie. ZENIA manipulations are not wondering if we can not see them happen to a man, and a man's life is screwed. Roses, Harris and Toni tell their stories - to the man. Because it does not matter if the person can not hear them. <br /> <br /> I like the characters in the book. It is painful to see how they pushed off to the side for the human story. I usually do not look at the feminist angle on the media, and I tried to enjoy the movie as it is. If I had not read this book, I would have enjoyed the film a lot more. So if you want a police officer and a former policeman, and you want to learn more about them, you're out of luck. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy the lush prose and characterization of thin layered through the storyline. This is the same story: the film unearthed it, iron it, and sprinkled it with men longing. It's like Revenge ZENIA Margaret Atwood.
