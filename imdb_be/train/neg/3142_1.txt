Once upon a time was a director named James. He gave us a strange, exciting science fiction, such as The Terminator and Aliens. These films were blockbusters things were made, and he looked at the fantastic future ahead of it as the dawn of computer special effects in the film industry has landed. Terminator 2 shows gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new era. <br /> <br /> ....... and then it happened ... 1997 ................ ........ countless awards. ......... obscene amounts of money ............ strange barrage of advertising ...... ...... ........ maximum profit Titanic I was here! <br /> <br /> I never (ever) been one to jump on the bandwagon and be too critical for this, in fact I often took the opposite position from the majority just get an argument going. Titanic, however, was a movie that I only took one with only positive - that the future is absolutely gorgeous Winslet for <br /> <br /> Fast - dialogue was like something out of Beverly Hills 90210, valid over a wooden tree house my nephew, images, designed to intimidate was actually comical (a man falls from the ship and blow the propeller), historically wrong (do not even get me started, because there is too much), he had a sharp theme music (there with the bodyguard cheese) and senseless love story was so exhausting, consuming itself, and guards pity that it is disrespectful to the share of all other participating (I was glad when he died and disappointment when it does not). <br /> <br /> It was clearly evident from the word go that this painting was designed to appeal to MTV to watch, chewing gum, boy-with-auto coinage, teenage girls (myself DeCaprio resembled something less heroic than weed member boy group), which will carry them on the basis of sex starved boyfriend of three and a half hours of chick flick hoping to get lucky later! The worst aspect is that it will not stop at this point. Millions dumbed down, culture vultures went to see this expensive celluloid waste, because "it costs as much to produce it should be fine" and "Steve and Barbara said that it was good, and they know that their films." <br /> <br /> crown profit if Titanic swept the board at the Oscars. King James Hollywood was a serious moment of silence the victims of that fateful evening, upon which his three and a half hours of slapstick. He looked at me as if he prayed for forgiveness after getting rich from the messy drawing the circumstances that lead to the death of large numbers of people. <br /> <br /> However, when people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of garbage, they deserve to get ripped off. Success in Hollywood, if that's how they want to make money, I would do it, if I had those kinds of chances in life! <br /> <br /> It is right up there on my list of the worst films constantly on the other stupid, historically false / human interest tripe like "The Patriot" and "Pearl Harbor."
