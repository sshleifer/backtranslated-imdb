I absolutely hate this program, people who sit and watch this garbage ?? OK, my dad and mom love it lol, but I make sure I'm well out of the room before he goes on. Its so difficult and dreary, but the worst of it acting, I can not stand all the programs, detective, such as this, because the detectives so wooden and heartless. What happened to the detective programs with a real mystery ??? I mean, who wants to know what happened to the fictional characters we do not know anything about how he died over 20 years ago ??? I want the BBC to put more comedy on BBC1 cos now with the Vicar of Dibley finished there is more room for crap like this.
