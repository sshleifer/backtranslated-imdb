I do not know how this film has received so many positive reviews on this site! I'm a big fan of Vonnegut, and I'm very familiar with the history of the Showtime original film twists of faith, but even if I was not, poor acting, very poor casting (Sean Astin as brilliant, sporty, and all-around individual Harrison ?? totally versatile!) and sub-standard sheets this guy has a scar almost watchable. Someone showed how cute that Maculay Culkin line. If you read that and thought that it was purely comic brilliance (unfortunately, it was probably the most intentional funny part of the movie), maybe you will like this film. But if you're a fan of Vonnegut or not at all crazy, do not see it. Please.
