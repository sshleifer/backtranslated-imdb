Volleyball genre strangely overlooked most of the writers. Fortunately, a very famous director Nelson McCormick brought us the second best volleyball movie of all time (rated below Side Out and above, well, um). However, do not let the cover of the film decieve you. Kill the stars soared up and coming stars Koji as a modern day Sherlock Holmes. Using high-tech gadgets such as a computer, which is less powerful than my Gameboy, Koji can help FBI agents to track the person who had committed no overt crime. Although there are other actors in the film, including a short cameo Denise Richards, a gay black man, and terribly ugly and annoying girl Koji carries the film on their own. Any fan of films like The Matrix or hackers, of course, love Slaughter shot.
