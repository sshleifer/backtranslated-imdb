What was the purpose of this film? I believe it was to make a few actors and producers and the director of a large salary to do nothing. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, he could not keep my interest in the close of the film. Braindead ex-boxer falls with a strange woman and her family. It begins as Fix-It man for a woman, and the winds and beating the man fall into the kidnapping scheme. It was so confused that I can not even write a decent criticism. If you see this, my sweet, make sure that after dark, so you can go right to sleep.
