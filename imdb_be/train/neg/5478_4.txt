Of doing anything better, I decided to check «Aztec Rex» (as it was to be billed) for the hell of it. <br /> <br /> The silly story would play better if the dinosaur effects were convincing. In fact, they looked like Animatics (those rough design, which artists use later to finish the CGI effects, adding more detail, smooth motion, etc.) just awful dinosaurs look, the only reason you will probably want to sit through it anyway. <br /> <br /> a redemptive factor was beautiful Luckman as Ayacoatl. She held my interest; unless the budget was increased and some convincing dinosaurs could be used. <br /> <br /> Poor. At least the cast and crew got a free trip to Hawaii, where the movie was filmed.
