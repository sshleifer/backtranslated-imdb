I do not so much as Love Sick, I like the image. Finally the film to express the sexual relationship Alex, kick, Sand their love triangle was full intenseness, frustrated and jealous, finally, Alex woke up and realized that they would have no effect and future.Ending but it was boring. <br /> <br /> Director Tudor Giurgiu was in the AMC Theater on Sunday 08/10/06 at 12:00, with us watching a movie together. After the movie, he told the audience that conceived to create the film, which was to express the sexual relations of Romania were some kind of complicate. <br /> <br /> In my point of view of sexual life is always difficult everywhere, I do not feel any special impression and the effect of the film. Love that lasted Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and her brother Sand was part of the history of the surrounding area nearby. <br /> <br /> The two main reasons why I do not like this film, firstly, the film did not tell us how they started to fall in love? It seems, after Alex moved into the building, which Kiki lived, the two girls fall in love. This makes no sense at all. As a girl fall in love with another girl, not a man. Too many snippets, you need to combine these images and stories of his mind. Secondly, the whole film was not a scene of sexual intercourse Aleko and kick, that's what I expect ????. Nevertheless, he still had some parts were deserved recommend. "Ear piercing" part was kind of interesting. Alex was willing to suffer the pain of piercing the ear to appreciate love in Kika. It was a touching scene, which gave you a little idea of ​​their love. In addition, the stage they were in the ballpark, we express our love was true and passionate.
