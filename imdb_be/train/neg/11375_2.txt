You say, "Me? (1987) is a pretty bad movie starring some dude that I had never seen before or after starring as the boy from the city, which is trying to become an actor. It's heavy Jones taxi driver as it tries to use the chip to make it big. When he finds out the hard facts of life, he is doing what everyone else is changing its image! He comes from a good guy to surf dude up for the night. His friend could not believe the changes (but he kills with Faith Ford and get paid a cool gig). Can this young punk keep it street cred at the time, which makes it great? <br /> <br /> This is a real lame movie that tries too hard to include too many things at once. An interesting idea that falls apart because of poor performance. Who knows, maybe somebody pick up the ball and run, because the filmmakers felt the ball this time. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this film. If you do not want to see a hot young Faith Ford and Bubba from Forest Gump. <br /> <br /> xx
