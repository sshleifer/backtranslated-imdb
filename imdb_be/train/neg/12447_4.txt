Sondra Locke stinks in this film, but then it was terrible "actress" in any case. Unfortunately, it pulls all the others (including time = real life boyfriend Clint Eastwood's nothing to it. But that Clint Eastwood is thinking when he agreed to star in this one? One reading the script had to tell him that this one is going to be real snoring. this is an extremely weak plot, basically no story or plot at all. Add to miss the bad acting, even from the usually good Eastwood. There is absolutely nothing but a pair of arguments, and as far as I was concerned, this film takes place at the top to uchy natural sleep enhancers. Wow! Is the film could be sadder? I think watching paint dry or grass grow might be more fun. A real bitch. do not bother with this,
