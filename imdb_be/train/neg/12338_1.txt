I saw this film was originally in the theater when I was 10. Even in this age of "humor" was a bit insulting to my intelligence adolescence. <br /> <br /> In the past, when I would see Ed Begley Jr. or Jeff Goldblum I would shake and begin to feel very uncomfortable and even a little boring. Until then, until I remembered the existence of this film today, I was not sure why I felt that way. Perhaps I blocked my mind about this movie until my negative feelings in relation to two of the perpetrators were. I guess I forgot that I have seen this film, but subconsciously mourned part of my soul, which had been stolen, NOT EATEN creators of this superhuman work. <br /> <br /> I was not brave enough to try it as an adult watching. I believe that as part of the healing process, I should probably be sought in the decision of this childhood fear, so that I * really * put it behind me. Some regression therapy and / or hypnosis may not be a bad idea either.
