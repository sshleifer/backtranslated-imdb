It never ceases to amaze me how you can take a great actor, and put it in the waste in a film like this. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but even he could not save this film. In fact, his character is the same as the one he played in the Cape Fear, which was actually very good, but I can not stand it when actors do the same trick more than one movie. I believe that is aging, and this is the case. <br /> <br /> There's nothing surprising in this movie, but then, the story has been told a million times. Wesley Snipes your typical baseball player, and his vanity shows through in his characterization. De Niro plays an obsessed fan, but his role in this film is less than entertaining. <br /> <br /> However, because De Niro in the film, which makes it a draw, if you're a fan (no pun intended), who sees all that he does not matter how bad. But to see De Niro at his best, see the "North Run", "Goodfellas», or «Cop Land», or even a way back and check the "taxi driver" or "The Godfather II». . Do not waste your time with this nonsense <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10
