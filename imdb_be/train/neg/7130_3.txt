The film was to be called Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who have not played the game Need For Speed ​​is mainly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot. It is perfectly true to Redline. The only thing about this film, which was A-Level were cars. Actions seemed forced and the script, the room was flimsy at best, and the plot has been virtually non-existent. I only really watched this movie to see how bad it was, and at that time it was pretty bad, it could be worse. And at least it was interesting. I just want them to show, Eddie Griffin Enzo crash somewhere in the movie. In general, do not pay for it, do not go out of the way to see it, but if it is on Showtime or HBO and there is not anything further, it's worth the diversion.
