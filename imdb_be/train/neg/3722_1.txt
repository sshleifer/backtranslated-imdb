I remember being forced (because - literally FORCED), to see this film in the Southern Baptist preacher when I was a kid, and even then I loved her awful. It is designed to scare the poor youngsters "saved" at the moment. The only thing that "saved" me was the fact that it was finally over, and I could go out and real life. <br /> <br /> Check the chapters in the book of the film Sarah Diamond Â«The Christian Right politics." Fun. And, of course, more interesting than the movie!
