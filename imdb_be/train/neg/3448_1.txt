I checked this film if he was still 6 votes, and it says, as a 7.2 or something, but seriously this is a terrible movie. It allows you to break it. The first thing you will notice about this film is that it was shot on hand-held digital camera belonging to freshmen in college. the next thing you will notice that the actors, all friends said freshman (he probably met them in the pub at night. Third on the list you will notice that the music editing awful, and they try to cram a lot of songs in the film, a 30-second intervals ... and digital editing is done on the specified home PC freshman in ... probably using Windows movie Maker. this movie was horrible ... pretentious, was undoubtedly a bad script, and actions that did the same. I would not recommend this film I know, but I have to sentence letter ennika and director, to see this movie in hell for eternity.
