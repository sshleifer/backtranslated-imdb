PROM NIGHT (2008) <br /> <br /> Director: Nelson McCormick <br /> <br /> Cast: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, Dana Davis and <br /> <br /> Area: three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of his entire family into the hands of his teacher (Jonathan Schaech), which has a little crush on her. Now she is preparing for her prom with her stupid annoying friends. Once there, they begin to die one by one, so that the murderer had escaped from prison, and no one bothered to warn Donna, because, apparently, her prom is too important to be interrupted. <br /> <br /> pluses: I got a few good laugh from the film due to a terrible dialogue and blunt character movement <br /> <br /> example :. <br /> <br /> everyone decides not to tell Donna that person who is obsessed with her amazing (it does not seem that big) escaped from prison. Their reason: They do not want to embarrass her in front of all your friends. LOL <br /> <br /> Cons: Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of slasher. I can usually get pleasure from even the bad ones. I even like some PG-13 horror movies. Tourist TRAP (1979), one of my favorite, was originally rated PG. I also enjoy Poltergeist (1982) and The Grudge (2004). Therefore, the fact that it is dumb slasher, which is estimated to PG-13 has nothing to do not like the movie with me. <br /> <br /> First of all, I had a big problem with the story. I like slasher films that do not have a history. At the very least, they may be of interest. We are talking about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills his entire family. A few years later, he's trying to do it to her, destroying her prom and kills all your friends ...? Then there were podagovory, I doubt that someone cared. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps and I could not care less. This was to be a feature of Lifetime, and not a remake of PROM NIGHT. <br /> <br /> And then ... it's slasher with horrible scenes of death. I do not even care that it's not what the mountains, some of my favorite slashers (HALLOWEEN, original PROM NIGHT curtains) were not the mountains, but they still have effective killing. Here we have half the characters who die in the same hotel room, behind the scenes, a woman being stabbed several times, no stab wounds, and close-up on the face of a bad actor as he screams in agony. I am sure that the 10-year-old girls were terrified, but I do not. <br /> <br /> I hated character. Was unrealistic sensitive guy Donna Bobby (Scott Porter), and I can almost guarantee that you will never meet a friend that sensitive in your life, if you're not a gay man. Then we had an annoying friends Donna Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the marker is a girl Chris (Brianne Davis). If you thought that the death of evidence characters were annoying, try to watch this movie. And do not get me started on Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and DJ (Jay Phillips), who gave me flashbacks to Usher SHE performance in EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> Add to all that the plot is predictable, terrible soundtrack and a great shortage of the feedstock, and you have quite a bitch.
