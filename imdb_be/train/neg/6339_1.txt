All David's Priory films awful on all counts: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, no budget (the director's brother usually cast as the male role). But they all have incredible entertainment value due to unintentional mirth. The plot almost all previous "film" David (as I like to refer to them) is basically the same. Manly unite all American commandos to blow communist villains. But unlike the other times of the Cold War waste, such as Red Dawn, the prior movies really funny, because their over-the-top space and action. The best part of the jungle attack scene in which Becker (if it was the other man?) Now called Mitchell General for the top-secret mission to South America. Funny line in the movie is then fed, then the effect of "this is my roommate, I taught him well." WHAT. You trained your roommate? And, perhaps, it will be their decision to avoid eviction. <br /> <br /> If you can find these gems in the video, which are used in any place to buy. They're funny, even funnier after a few beers. Watch them with a group of friends for a true experience of MST3K style. Until now, my friends and I managed to grab Night Wars and Aerobicide aka "Killer Workout." But the one I recommend the most of them all of the Final Sanction, with a bizarre look that Robert ZDarom.
