Proof that not all of Tarantino touches turns to gold. This is most definitely a plastic, all the way. It is easy to see that without the participation of Quentin this would probably sat on the shelf for years, it is provided that would have ever been made in the first place. We are talking about a woman with delight death, which receives the cleaning work after the crime scene, Angela Jones is not convincing in this role, William Baldwin better as a serial killer who keeps Jones at work!. Overall pretty sparse.
