This movie is hilarious. The problem is that this is not a comedy. One classic scene includes Kurt Thomas just happens to find POMMEL horse in the middle of the village square (which he uses to beat the bad guy.) Another trip to the "Village Crazies." It is a pity that this film was not made a farce, or I may have gotten better grades.
