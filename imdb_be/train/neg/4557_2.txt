Well, it's very rare that I complain, something I got for free. So I think that this film has pushed me over the limit. I saw him at a Hollywood cemetery for free, and left very very disappointed. Question One member of the audience to the Director on the use of Native American references as well as a "bookend" instead of being woven into the movie better, basically says it all, this movie failed at. <br /> <br /> Native American Indian Links --- Links felt really stupid and unnatural. It is obvious that the director and the writer was trying to solve the arena, they have never played before. They should stick to the old adage "write about something you know." If they really understand this, it certainly does not show at the cinema or the beauty of this unique culture has not been given proper justice. <br /> <br /> stamps and on the bridge --- I agreed to watch the film on the grounds that it was an indie. So I kept it to higher expectations. «Little Miss Sunshine» was indie and saw it before it became so popular. Before he even went on general release I have raved about how it would be a hit. Unfortunately, I can not say the same thing about the "end of time". "Sunshine" took us to the cliches of incidents, but the filmmakers were so clever in their approach, the outcome will take us in another direction, avoiding the traps to be a "cliché". This film, on the other hand, there was no way not to fall into the trap, because he was a trap from the beginning. Tricks Psycho Mom, Hendricks pair, etc. <br /> <br /> I do not want to say, but the best and the worst film I've seen this year were both indies. «Little Miss Sunshine» is the best and this film is the worst. I would like to say otherwise. <br /> <br /> But I congratulate the filmmakers for such a good turn out of their family members in the cemetery.
