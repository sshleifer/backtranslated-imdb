I did not expect that it will be a great movie, but it was, I expected it to be so bad. I hated the mother character, so much I had to turn the channel. I turned it back, hoping that it was just one part of the film, but no. And for my daughter to sit there to take embarrassed, or almost done with the work, or brought to the madness in her own home? Are you kidding? I was raised to respect (and even fear) my mother, but I would put it quickly into a nearby hotel when she proved that annoying in my house. I have to follow a set of rules in the house of my mother, after all. <br /> <br /> I did not buy any of it. I tried to give him a few chances, I really did. Sorry.
