I am for the "bad" horror film, but it was just a pile of dog sh! T! How can you call this a movie or steep decent to me. If you like editing rushed to cover the special effects, bad actions and bad script and then go for it! There was no stress at all and gore factor was ridiculous because it was so fake. The hostel will take or Wolf Creek on this pile on any given day. My partner gave up after about 20 minutes, she knows bitch when she sees one. I on the other hand stupidly spent the whole movie just have to wait and see if there are better. No such luck! I do not hay it another film set fire to, and I doubt if I'll bother now.
