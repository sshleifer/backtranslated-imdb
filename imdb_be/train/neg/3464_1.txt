It seems that some of the people who reviewed this film looked just that in the first place because he was shot near where they live. How's that for a ringing endorsement? If this movie was filmed near where I lived, I would not mention it in my review. This is terrible! Several reviews say that this film is a parody or insincere horror film, it is neither. It is sad to see this film is viewed as a comedy, it makes it not only a bad attempt a horror movie, but comedy as well. I laugh at how incredibly bad movie. <br /> <br /> This film has two good things going for it, a mask and a weapon of choice, unfortunately, it would be more interesting to watch for an hour and a half mask and a gun lying on the table, then watch this garbage . Social commentary for the film as funny, juvenile and silly. Do not mess with this film, you've spent reading this review, do not spend more time on this film. Arrggghhh! It is infuriating that films like this even get made. I expected that the whole cast crew will be credited to Alan Smith, the name is used when a person, as a rule, the director does not want to be credited in the movie, because it's so bad. <br /> <br /> There's nothing sacrificed in this movie, I spent $ 1.19 to rent and feel like I was ripped off. Avoid. 1 in 10
