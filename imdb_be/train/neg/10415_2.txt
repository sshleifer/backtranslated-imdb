2 stars out of a possible 10 -. And that excessively generous <br /> <br /> I thought that with James Woods cast Kathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr., and Henry Thomas - how could it miss. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only wonder what drugs Sam Shepard Weekend he cranked dig this piece. I have long suspected, Sam S. nuts be overlooking this film based on his performance, confirms this. <br /> <br /> This kind of pretentious BS LOVE the actors to sink their teeth into, because it gives them the opportunity to endlessly emote. However, for the viewer, sitting through this senseless waste, there's absolutely nothing to like about this movie. <br /> <br /> You did not see the problem of the family as long as you have seen the pile. According crazy, mom mad, going crazy son, and daughter, oh yeah, crazy. They also have their mouths they had uttered words that would make a sailor blush, especially teenage daughter <br /> <br /> In addition to the above, as if that were not enough, the plot -. And so thin you can read his full - has a hole in it the amount of Alaska <br /> <br /> Ma conspiracy to sell their worn-out farm .. As it turned out so Pa. Now I do not pretend to be an expert on real estate, but the last time I checked, joint ownership of property must have the signature and the owners to sell. If only one of them belongs to the property, the other can not legally sell it, so it would be pointless for that person to do it. Mr. Shepherd chooses to ignore this basic fact and, therefore, his story does not work. <br /> <br /> Not that everything else was really working anyway. <br /> <br /> The only possible reason anyone could have to see this film when they are totally lost hope of seeing James Woods in full frontal nudity, and I can not imagine why anyone would want to.
