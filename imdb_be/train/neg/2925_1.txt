After reading a few good reviews, as well as to hear nice things about it by word of mouth, I decided to rent Come destroyed. I must say I was very disappointed. The story was hard to follow, because the film is set as a series of flashbacks between the present and the recent past, which is very poorly executed. Characters, despite the best efforts of the actors are flat and uninteresting. Sex and nudity is more obvious than they should be. I've never seen a movie where they seemed so unnecessary to the plot. The ending is very anti-climatic and leaves many unanswered questions to the storyline that was not explained well to begin with. In my opinion, a waste of time.
