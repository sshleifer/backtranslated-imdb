Although the story was very detailed, and the story was clear that Steven Seagals voice was dubbed with through any one of the film it was disappointing, as you were not sure who speaks. There are many parts where he began to speak in his deep gravelly voice, and then the voice of the next someone else had to do to speak for him. I do not know the reason, however, when he had problems with his voice during the production of the film, I think that they could once again shot events that do not contain their own voice when he recovered. I rated this film 3 out of 10 based on the film quality. If one pays for a movie or do not have it in the theater or on DVD the film is not necessary to assume that the price was charged. I am a long time follower of Steven Seagal and all of his films, he has made during the last day years.To I think it's one of the worst ones we have seen yet
