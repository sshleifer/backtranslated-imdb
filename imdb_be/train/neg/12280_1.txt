I saw one of the stage in Denver and have never been less than impressed. The word "vagina" says it all. part of the body. Nothing shocking here. I could tell your doctor, "My left hand was a little painful after tennis 'or' My vagina hurts after biking" with equal or more social commentary. This may be a "triceps monologue" for all entertainment and radical comments I heard. Monologues were dull, but comes with the drama theme outdated, and I in turn bored and annoyed. Once I think I laughed, but apparently it was not, when I had to. Of course, this is not really a hit. Oh, and spoilers: I was Runet! - Oh, wait, maybe not, if you think about it. And unacceptable affection! And Crack Mom! This is about covers it.
