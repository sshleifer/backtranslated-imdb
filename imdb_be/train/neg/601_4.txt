!!!!! Of course, there is a spoiler !!!!! I am confident that this project began as a writing screen seminar on avoiding cliche in horror films: Female hero - Check the bad things happen to addicts - Check Heorine knocks the villain - Check the heroine does not notice the villain recovery unconsciousness - Check the Frame the sequence so we can see it recovered villain to sneak up behind the heroine - Check, unfortunately, it seems, someone sent this list cliche for the studio, instead of using it for the class. Dear oh dear, if only London transport was regular, like a cliché turn here. In fact, there are so many clichés and seen it all before times that nobody really thought about going into details as to what the eponymous creep, or how long he had killed people in the metro. I am led to believe that this is the result of the human experience and, perhaps, it is not until that night, he decided to take revenge on mankind, but it is so vague to be meaningful not be entirely negative, I very much doubt that if the producers were thinking, that they will make a film that was going to sweep the Oscars this year and there is always a market for horror films. Similarly, I doubt that it costs too much food, and one eye on a DVD-market rather than theaters, and I would argue that it is a bit better than in 1972 Death Line, which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the London Underground. it's just that, if you think all the clichés were used in this film is another cliché comes to rear its ugly head
