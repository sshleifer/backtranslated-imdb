In the sixth grade, every teacher, I decided that this would be a great idea to make this film a training plan for the entire semester. Each class has something to do with this terrible show. We have seen this in English and writing in journals, as if we were one of the characters. In mathematics, we talked about the cards and other marine shit. In science, we talked about whales (which was actually somewhat interesting, so it was not 100% waste of time). All day every day was torture. Not only that, but they will expose us to the horror, two times a day, making us look into the reading room, as well. I could see if it was a new series or something, but it was, like, 93. I'm still trying to block it.
