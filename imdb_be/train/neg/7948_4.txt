"The Seventh Sign" borrows much from "Rosemary's Baby" and "omens" (it actually blends two stories) .Even its name reminds Bergman s "The Seventh Seal." <br /> <br /> However, it starts well enough, with all the signs that have been scattered all over the earth, and in parallel -seemingly- clear plot with her husband Moore is trying to save the poor boy (who killed his parents, were brother and sister) from penalty.This death while Christian and Jewish religions are called to help (even Ahasuerus involved), which makes the line sometimes unintentionally funny (have you ever been to Sunday school? But they taught me that God is love !). IMHO the best scene, a short dialogue between the priest John Heard -Who does not seem to take things seriously, too bad he did not get a more important role because of its laid-back action priceless-and young Jew. <br /> <br /> Demi Moore probably registered the same desire as the ex-husband Bruce Willis: world.She salvation does not save the film for all this.
