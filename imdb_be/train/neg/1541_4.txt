I did not like this film strongly and went during the scene where a gang of loyal British shot. The film effectively accuses NI people as the cause of their own problems. It says that 25 years of war, there was a question about the intransigence and nothing to do with the British partition of Ireland and its history of domination ie NI was created by Britain in 1921, regardless of the wishes the rest of Ireland. <br /> <br /> characters are displayed as poor fools, even though I despise loyalist paramilitary they are fighting for the right cause - to maintain their artificial privileges of the Catholic community. It is a known fact that the British intelligence cooperated with the Loyalists during the war, no doubt, to keep at bay the Catholics and demoralize republicanism. <br /> <br /> values ​​of "courage Nineties", courage, etc. Belfast rearranged for 1970 and represented as part of the supposedly unique Irish "psyche", leading to violence. Silly song with a woman in the club - an old green fields of Ireland ..blah..blah .. - is given a symbolic increase, ie poor young fools who are fighting for an impossible thing. Dull, ahistorical, cheap and cheerful debris. O'Sullivan made a personal statement on the conflict that requires a serious political analysis.
