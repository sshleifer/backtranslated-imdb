this is definitely one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. I refused to watch it in an hour, and expressed regret at the moment a lot. acting terrible and almost no plot. I think that someone came up with the strange shape of the animal and began to make a story around it. borrowing some ideas from movies like Resident Evil and foreigners does not result in a movie, as they are. if it is a top Korean film, I'd rather not bother to even see a Korean movie trailer ... <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie is a good reason to believe that is not necessarily a high rating means that the film is promising. I think every Korean, there is no internet for online games rated this movie 8, although the notion of what it is.
