Based on the novel self-serving one-time friend and admirer of F. Scott Fitzgerald, the gossip columnist Sheila Graham wrote this rubbish story. Gregory Peck carries excess shameless Be-like force-be drunk or alcoholic damn; in contradiction with the gentle and soft spoken real Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on Hollywood writer Fitzgerald era, the end of his life, the author was honored, in fact, lives a quiet life and to effectively combat alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet known. Fitzgerald was not too proud to be recycling his flappers stories to support his wife (a psychiatric hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small apartment, and at the wheel of the second hand Chevrolet was his life 180 degrees different as portrayed in this film. <br /> <br /> Almost every Twentieth Century-Fox film shot during manual Daryll F. Zanuck, as well as almost every film directed by Henry King, was a work of perfection. Beloved Infidel was an exception.
