I saw this film the first in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes are simply censored Committee. But then, in Poland in 2000, I watched it in its entirety. So what? The plot is incredibly stupid - 2 people survive a genetic disaster and find ourselves on a planet full of feminist strong, direct and fundamentally serious ladies. Men are now trying to fight it, and then a whole bunch of very silly clich√© follow - sex drive, constant male desire for sex, the feminists, who are shown as complete idiots (you can agree with them or not, but the idiots, of course, they do not are), and so on. Performance even star Jerzy Stuhr is wooden and surprisingly bad - he just pulls unfunny person and repetitions to say phrases like "I'm in the elevator with a naked chick, and I did not do anything to her!". This was supposed to be a comedy, but instead turned out to be a meaningless farce, full of jokes predictable and below the waist innuendo. Do not waste your time on it - it's just bad.
