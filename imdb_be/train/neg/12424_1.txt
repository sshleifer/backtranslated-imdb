If you want to laugh like crazy, rent Cage. Cell about two war heroes, Billy and Scott, who are best friends. If Billy shot in Vietnam, he can not stand up for themselves, so that Scott takes it. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a movie with lots of fun references to the two main characters. Billy and Scott like "fight" and Scott tells Billy that he was "still sore from last night," among other things. <br /> <br /> The beautiful winged phrases like "Close w! T up »and« Ping Pang Pong, cut the sh! t "will keep you laughing for hours. Local American guys who should play Mexican gang member also at the highest level. As they say, it is "the party now. Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba ". I could go on forever, but just watching this movie and laugh in your $$ off. It was so funny, I went out and bought the DVD for $ 5.99
