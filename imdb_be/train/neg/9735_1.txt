I tried my best, I could sit all the way through this annoying mess, but I just could not do it. Dourif absolutely sucked as lead and all the supporting cast were only slightly worse. <br /> <br /> This is ridiculous, the terrible actions before FX on ridiculous silly story <br /> <br /> waste of time. do not bother. root canal therapy will be more enjoyable. Bamboo slivers under the fingernails are much nicer. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie by Uwe Boll will be just a little worse than that. Get the idea?
