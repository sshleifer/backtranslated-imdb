I tried to watch this movie without being able to pinpoint to sit through it, because at that time, as it should be "good" message; the problem lies in the fact that it is obviously made in accordance with one particular interpretation of Scripture. Interpretation, in my opinion, will mislead many people. Also, I'm a movie maniac and acting in this movie was totally unacceptable. I had never wanted a negative assessment to evaluate the film. Thus, if you want to be constantly announced those without power, then by all means, get this movie. This comment is also a warning for people who like or love the SciFi, because the name will deceive a lot of people as well. It was an unfortunate film because the basic idea had opportunities and these opportunities have been squandered. only repaid the quality of the film is the fact that he gave me to understand that the character in the «Time Machine», probably, would have to show a little more moral indignation at the strange behavior of those in his future.
