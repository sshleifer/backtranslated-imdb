Firstly, I would like to justify my bad english. <br /> <br /> I do not dorm-hardcore-fan, but I liked this film, yet. Buzz, however, sucked BIG TIME! I've never seen Gore-film with excellent acting, but hey, who is surprised? The current live ... well, not there! I've seen some commented that he had a school project or something. Okay, but not students in the media or acting school. It was not a class at all! And what about the story? Really sad rip-off at Hostel. And what about the gore? What about the psychopathic scenes of torture, which should make your guts twist and leave you cold sweats? This was the most disappointing of the hole movie! Short, fast and NO edges. More like a design, and not torture. Okay, where a bucket of blood, but she does not even look real. Slaughter and violence was more like a hostel than Braindead or any of the Saw-films. And Braindead was fun! Okay, I laughed at Live stream a couple of times, but it was more out of frustration than of pure pleasure! <br /> <br /> So, instead of spending 80 minutes watching the live feed, watch something else!
