Apparently injured people about the guy who roams the earth performing shows mutilation as a way to cope with his abusive childhood. I use the word "apparently" because, without listening to comments directed by Andy Kopp (which I was not available for me) or read on the film before watching, viewers have no idea what it is. <, Br /> <br /> Gorehounds and lovers of extreme films can be enticed to watch injured people with the promise of some violent scenes splatter and disturbing real-life shots, but if they do not like too pretentious, headache, induces experimental art-house cinema, they one will find it a real chore to sit through. <br /> <br /> 82 minutes of ugly images, accompanied by Dis-chordant sound scary music and incomprehensible dialogue, this mind-numbingly awful nonsense is the perfect way to challenge your mental health if you've still got all the balls, you You will switch on the garbage and watch something decent instead (I watched the whole thing, but I am well aware that I completely barking!).
