They really can not get stupider than this film deals with 3-losers who are trying to capture the spirit of the college during the annual spring break holidays in many of our schools of higher learning. The problem is that these losers trying to make it through 15 years after their student years, when one designed to keep track of her daughter female senator predicted to be the next vice-president. <br /> <br /> The problem is that her daughter is anything but popular, but, of course, it comes out of all this. Girls go through drunken rages, exotic dancing and another absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> It really can not get much worse than this terrible movie.
