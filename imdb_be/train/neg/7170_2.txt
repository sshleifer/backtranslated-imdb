Man made this film hit. Symbols were weak, weak story. I thought that it might not be too bad, because it has Walken, oops. He has to do it because he was bored and needed money. Symbols had to be Irish, but no one was Irish accent. I was desperately trying to find something good about it, I can not, except Walken did an excellent job with a wooden character. Find something to read, or to watch the opening, will never see this film.
