This is one of the most heinous and brutal films I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, I was tricked into sticking with it, because the presence of Donald Sutherland deceptively gave him some confidence. [This is the last time this happens.] Character <br /> <br /> Lesley Ann Warren was annoyingly whiny and as stupid as they come. Characters were intelligent than her, who were killed in the film. It is only one of many things in this movie that made me ask, "Where is the justice?Â» <br /> <br /> Why do late night cable so filled with sadistic trash, filled with morbid mayhem? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women, and seem to focus on them terrorize and kill. This film could be every bit as suspenseful without being sick and twisted in the process. All of this ultimately makes this transformation viewer stomach with his illness, and insulting the intelligence viewer. <br /> <br /> Throw deceptively good. I think they Torque Sutherland first, and used it to lure the other lemmings in this. <br /> <br /> I push myself for wasting time, giving this piece of garbage chance.
