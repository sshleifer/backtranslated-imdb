Jennifer Jason Leigh and Uinningaya good match drawing completely different brother and sister, but only Winningham can bring something convincing or significant its role. Leigh, play a bar-rock group and an alcoholic Sadie Flood, constantly relies on old sister Georgia, recognized folk singer in the mold Joni Mitchell. Perhaps because of its double duty as co-producer of the film, Lee seems to have boxed themselves into a corner: it is not credible as a singer and even if it is deliberately gives himself too much time on the screen microphone. Probably in the hope of a tour de force, Leigh wire depicted and nervous and uneven; However, we simply do not see any talent in this character (Leigh, obviously, is a solid actress, but she makes the decisions here that wall us from it). If Sadie had even the slightest charisma or appeal, we could buy into the concept that she gets (small) breaks, it does. As it is, the likelihood that she'd ever get up on stage fine. Director Grosbard crafts several intense dramatic sequences, and editing of the final bar compares the performance of Ghana Georgia sold-out arena shows - like singing the same song - and it's sad nuances of the moment ... but really, what is the mark? * 1/2 ****
