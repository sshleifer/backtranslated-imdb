I'm not particularly fond of remakes, or steal modern jargon "paraphrases", but this film really annoyed me. The original Prom Night, but not in my modest assessment masterpiece, still realized that it was ... awful. There are a few simple things to remember when creating a horror movie. Exciting is crucial to maintain audience interest. Sorry people, but the white bones of the film it was not! The repeller were cheap, and presaged terrible. (A good example of the fear that has been done to an excess of template now, a cat jumped out of the closet, and then shortly after, but at the moment the sudden appearance of the villain of the film) This film can successfully pull it off, as I would have expected that in order to comply with any of the other conventions of the horror film. There should be a nice hero or heroine. This film is not one. The person I most identified with was the chief detective. His calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the killers departure was the fact that more and more of this kind of film should have. Common sense approach to the events that occur. (If you are working from Ax wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Or do not run, and looking back ever three seconds, reconciliation progress killer, only to stumble every industry and inanimate object in its path.) If a friend disappears, you do not look for them alone. And if you suspect foul play you have to tell someone, but do not examine themselves. These clich√©s are tired and well outperform. The horror genre in general, and in this film, in particular.
