In fact, they are written in the credits of his brain, Sun BRIAN. <br /> <br /> Well, they do not have the budget for spell checking. All products are money went to great old cars. There are at least two Packards visible here. One of them is Darina Convertible. Good yellow convertible Packard. <br /> <br /> studio scenes shows that there have been some money spent on costumes and set decorations. Old cameras, external Siro's, signs and all that was needed to make a visually pleasing pattern was there. Poor writer and director. <br /> <br /> My DVD says it works for 104 minutes, approximately. It was more like 85 minutes. He came to an end without reaching a conclusion. It has been a collision and not output. The film just smashed against the loans. 99 cents for it. I paid 99 cents for it. I could buy 3 cans food for cats and watched the face of my cat when he emoted more excitement. <br /> <br /> In a matter of seconds in Ciro scene after Darren McGavin receives a phone call, it was like, maybe. .. this film will have an unexpected twist that would make for an interesting movie. Then he just sat there. <br /> <br /> The young Latin actor plays Steven Bauer (Tony Montoya) would have a much greater role in all that is happening here. This roll could make a good movie. <br /> <br /> I think if they cut off part of Brian and Steven Bauer to use in its place and modify the script and save Packard and lose the group and add Johnny Otis sound the same group, they got something. <br /> <br /> Here, kitty, kitty ... <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
