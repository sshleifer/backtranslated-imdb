Weak entry in the series Bulldog Drummond, John Howard in the role. Neutral funny banter and arbitrary, but not so much of the plot. Barrymore gets to do something, inspector, changing masks adhere to Drummond, Alzhi and Tenney wild geese (mostly in circles, perhaps, the budget was stronger than usual) to rescue the poor Phillies, held captive people want to lure Drummond to his death. For those keeping score, this, Drummond plans to ask the Phillies to marry him and Alzhi worried about the missing child's christening. It is interesting to see Alzhi and Tenney, dressed as a fisherman to blend leisure fishing, but little of this goes above silly.
