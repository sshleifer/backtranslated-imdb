... Or rather, so bad that you'll have the time of your life laughing my ass off, when you look at it! James Sbardellati in «Deathstalker" 1983 is definitely one of the worst industries Sword and Sorcery subgenre brought with him, but it is very funny. Actions scary story pure crap, and effects, and photos can not be more amateurish. But it's a bad game, bad effects, and a lot of mistakes, which makes this film so much fun <br /> <br /> -. Spoilers ahead - <br /> <br /> (Rick worthy of death Hill) is a very strong and experienced warrior once. , the good witch of the problem so that it combine the three forces of chaos and creation, a sword, an amulet and bowls for ka to liberate the country from the cruel ruler of the evil king and sorcerer Munkar. Getting the ball fairly easily, but the amulet and a glass in the possession of Munkar in. Fortunately, the evil king organized a tournament in which the most experienced warriors Sun County to fight each other to the death. The winner is the take the place of the king. Of course, the king does not want anyone to take his place, so he planned to kill the winner (instead of simply saying a word of the tournament in the first place). Deathstalker not only get the three forces of creation, but also to maintain an excellent daughter of good old King (Barbi Benton) from the clutches of the evil Munkar. Fortunately, he did not get tired on the way to the tournament, as he let the hump of a beautiful warrior Kairi (Lana Clarkson) at the same time ... <br /> <br /> There's a lot of wonderful, incredibly stupid and funny scenes. Some of my favorite scenes include: <br /> <br /> - Deathstalker decapitate the bad guy with his sword. The head, which falls down, however, not the head of this guy. Falling head has a red beard, while the man felled Deathstalker had dark hair and no beard <br /> <br /> -. If the female warrior Kairi (Lana Clarkson) character is entered, the first time she saw a black robe, hiding her face and body. Deathstalker traveling Oghris (Richard Brooker) struggles with her, and during the fight with her ball gown (by which she, of course, topless) is opened, exposing the breasts. Her chest first thing we see Lana Clarkson, before her face <br /> <br /> -. Last warrior Deathstalker must fight in the tournament, it's a giant guy with the human body and the head of a pig <br /> <br /> -. Munkar evil ugly little creature has closed chest. He feeds that little creature human eyeballs and fingers. <br /> <br /> ... There are many other unintentionally funny, fun, and great scene. Acting badly, but Barbi Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are candy, eyes, and even though I have described this film as "unintentionally funny", I sometimes have the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how bad film. There is a sufficient amount of gore and a lot of female nudity to keep the audience entertained. «Deathstalker» incredibly awful film, but I still highly recommend. People with a sense of humor, will have the time of their lives!
