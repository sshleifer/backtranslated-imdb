This film deserves praise for his original approach. It combines elements of theater, film and epic narrative. Unfortunately, it falls flat on all levels. Movies biggest weakness is the reluctance to accomplish something; it has a camp, morality and epic items never makes any of them. As for the story itself, Kretno de Troyes spinning in his grave at this terrible adaptation, which turns the cute, innocent Percival intolerable in most ungallant and rough is treacherous. <br /> <br /> Most of all, two types of people to see it, or Francophils Arthuriophiles. Speaking as one of the last, I found the movie unwatchable and incredibly broken, disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story.
