Well, a film festival crowd will probably love it. But the average, chew popcorn movie goer who scrape up Gether ten or fifteen bucks worth to see a movie these days, probably wonder why he or she made that choice. If this stamp «Copolla» is automatically great stuff, is not it? Wrong! This neat parody claims in filmdom. But it's terrible "in". I worry when filmmakers are more concerned with entertaining themselves, and not the public. I wonder how cinematic memento and a chuckle or two in it. But as soon as it has run its course in film and television, the dust will grow thick on the film cans and carton tape holding it. Hardly any landmark or epic!
