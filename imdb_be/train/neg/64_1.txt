This movie was terrible. The ending was absolutely awful. There was no plot in the movie at all. The only thing that was decent was the movie actor made Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were wonderful! The only problem was that the film did not do them any justice action performances. If the script would come close to capturing a halfway decent story, it would be worth watching. Instead, Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones performances fully spent for the god awful story ... or lack thereof. Not only do I have left on hold for the film that is going to happen to make the film .... well the actual movie ... not only utterless dialogue between characters, because ultimately without being absolutely no reason. It was not more than a regular dialogue, what would have happened even in this period of time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only feature as Robert Duvall reflected clumsy, old, drunk, man. Nothing decent does not occur throughout the film, including an end. When the movie ended, I was surprised ... surprised that I spent the whole movie waiting for something of interest happen to watch a movie worth it. It never happened! Characters suddenly rolling makes it obvious that the film really was finished, I realized that I had just wasted 2:00 of my life to watch a movie without a plot and absolutely no sense. It was not even a story. The entire film takes place in the value of the time of day. That's all. It was one day in the life (and death), some Southerners on the plantation. How many of the stories can happen in one day (except for the movie Training Day)? Acting performances the whole cast were great, but they were much to spend on such a disappointing movie ... if you can even call it a movie.
