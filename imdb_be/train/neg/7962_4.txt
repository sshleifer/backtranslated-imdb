For have a nasty habit of being frustrating, and the best credit I can give is that he says that the old traditions. These three tales, nothing is as good as any of the original Creepshow. <br /> <br /> By far the best of the trio includes a wooden idol, which comes to life to avenge the bandits who killed its owners. The second story is about a lake monster, which seems to be nothing more than a lot of floating slop, makes you wonder how anyone could be afraid of it. The third story includes a cameo by Stephen King as a truck driver, but other than that is pretty unmemorable story regarding a victim of a traffic accident, who returns from the dead to a man who knocked him down. <br /> <br /> See the original Creepshow instead, or if you've already done, you can be calm.
