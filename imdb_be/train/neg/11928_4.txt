Lives of the Saints begins with an atmospheric vision of London as a bustling city busy, winding streets and sunlight. I had hoped that it will maintain this atmosphere, but is linked to the history of which goes almost nowhere. <br /> <br /> Othello working for a large, fat grams Karva, his crime boss step-dad (at least I think that's what it should be, because he never really defined, but it does fall kittens in deep fat friers, so believe me, he is a moron) makes a scrappy little errands, and his girlfriend gives Skanky Pope manual work. One of his colleagues Runner, a black man, which is not always excellent from A to B. Until the day he comes across almost silent waif, who gives him his desire to be able to stop the work. Second place landfill boy lost in a plane Othello, where he immediately begins providing greater desire. Keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled, Karva boy is kidnapped. But he was not sure that would actually bring him happiness. Whether it's the innocence of being a child again, or is it the other hand job? In any case, I do not want to see the little boy to give him a second. <br /> <br /> It just takes ages to get going and have a lot of repetitive scenes. The ending is trying to be shocking, but since it is unlikely to invest in pre-history of any of these characters, it only serves as an outlet for the bored audience. <br /> <br /> The writer Tony Grisoni, Terry Gilliam's favorite, trying to fit in some religious allegory that ends up being pathetic as all hell, ironically. If he had given us something more affordable or, at least, had the best explanation of the characters suddenly effective all over the country, it would be more enjoyable film. As it is, we are introduced to a bunch of annoying barkers, which then miraculously appear, develop intelligence, faced with the mysterious boy. Who is the origin is never revealed. It's just annoying! <br /> <br /> In addition to sporadic moments of the atmosphere and moody score, this film has little to recommend it.
