This is a film that shows the mood of the music and the texture is not enough to make a good film. Of course, the audience was treated to many wonderful scenes of Los Angeles in the thirties - I particularly liked the look of the carriage close to the tunnel, and the tram climbs up the hill - but in some ways this is the perfect cinematography is doomed to failure, because it creates a mood that "something happens" - and does nothing. The script also keeps feinting to any plot or action, or injuries - and from time to time do not deliver. even delivery (I guess) the theme of the film, a significant discrepancy between the characters. Leading actors like too cute for their roles, do not transmit any repression or the agony, and the script does not call into us there. <br /> <br /> Now, Donald Sutherland? It's a different story. His character was so well-fashioned, so well played, I wanted the camera to follow him.
