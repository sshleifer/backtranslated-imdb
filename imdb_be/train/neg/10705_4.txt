Maverick CPC with family issues and fondness for the use of a gun ?? Check! Isolated location with a valuable object that is begging to be stolen ?? Check! Delicious looking love interest ?? Check! Different groups of stupid cardboard cannon fodder villains with bizarre European accents ?? Check! German-sounding bad guy played by English actor with a piece of boilerplate dialogue for each case ?? Check! Trite liners ?? Check! <br /> <br /> Deary me, makes this film take the wee wee or what? Clichés come as thick and fast, like an avalanche, and most of the actors just stand around gawping just how bad script! <br /> <br /> In outrageously cheap and cheerful right up to video rip off a nut set on the mountain (included with some hacked lines of the above) we have all the usual clichés of action step tick gradually as we go along with some good old-fashioned violence and nudity as a wake someone in the audience who may just have a nap. <br /> <br /> Jack Wild police in full John McClane mode here, which even manages to ancient times in ^ a bad guy with a gun used all his bullets gag at one point. <br /> <br /> in the midst of this disorder, there are several well-known cognitive entities, I can only assume that the necessary funds and / or just playing it for laughs right out of the senseless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot at all implausible to the final conclusion, complete with a ropey dialogue and even ropier EFFE CTS. <br /> <br /> After watching it three pounds from the deal Bin supermarket efforts on IMDb am surprised to find that it is hopeless spawned not one but two sequels, I have to find these gems on DVD! It seems that the first sequel to rip Under Siege 2 and the second sequel, and God only knows! One thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor who plays Jack varies with each film, and even the name of the character seems to change in the third game. <br /> <br /> However, the blind buying a cheap DVD just would not be the same as if the studio did not delay the trot from the material of bad quality !!
