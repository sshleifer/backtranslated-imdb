I've seen bad movies before, but this one takes the "worst film of a lifetime" award far !! Anthony Hopkins must be fully mentally ill have his name attached to it - anywhere! I never see another movie with him in it, directing it, etc. and so on! I can not believe that other actors & actresses, which I liked (in this picture), which is bent so low as to be part of this disaster! There must be some great medications out there! For those who do not hesitate to be a part of this film, for me! Save your money on it! HUGE FLOP from start to finish! Hopkins ashamed! In addition, the shame of the Christian Slater! I can not believe you put your reputation on the line for it!
