This British bank boiler has one thing going for it: young people are equally good looking. Older people arrogant, right Thatcherism whose behavior returns all the acrimony with the Reagan / Thatcher years. Young or old, however, morality in this three-part mini-series are universally suspect, and no one comes off particularly well. <br /> <br /> Note handsome young gay man fresh out of Oxford. It is not crucial to the story, but it has a very beautiful hair, which makes watching this nonsense much easier. Nick arrives in London with a friend, whose father Gerald rich conservative politician, and his sister Kate babysits while leprosy family in the south of France. They neglected to tell him that, if upset, Cat cuts himself with an assortment of knives and other kitchen tools. Nick mistake their selfish "thanks" for the love and moving in, were too late, as they despise and patronize it. Inexplicably, Nick lives in this house for four years, but as the plot depends on this point, it is best not to question it. <br /> <br /> While Nick the most pleasant to look at, it is unbearably ingratiating. Some of its submission to the wealthy fanatics I was soon climbing the walls. Deep locked except Cat (she guesses his big secret in mind), it is like a little anonymous sex just so that we know that he is actually gay. Although it is hardly possible, Nick takes lover who is more locked than he. <br /> <br /> arrogant Tories despise and insult the two blacks in the film, itself a poison that spews forth that sexual orientation Nicky is reported in the tabloid. Gerald, in the true Tory fashion, has become involved in several personal and financial scandals, so the revelation of Nice add to his embarrassment. This gives one last opportunity Gerald roundly scourged poor boy. <br /> <br /> for one brief moment the disturbance addition, Nick takes slander at him in silence and tacit consent. Denial, self-hatred, ignorance or naivety? You decide when you can manage to sit through the whole thing did not throw anything at the set.
