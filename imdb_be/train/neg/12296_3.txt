Really bad movie, with very few good things or qualities. <br /> <br /> It starts with a pregnant Linda Blair, who is running down hallways to escape, which may be monsters or people with a pitchfork, I'm not sure. She jumps through the window and wakes up, and we see that she is pregnant. The extent to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the film. <br /> <br /> She and irritable, and may lag a little boy, I thought that her son travel to an abandoned hotel on the island. Italian horror directors to find the most annoying little boy put in his movies! On the island already has David Hasselhoff and his German-virgin girlfriend (you know, as the Germans say, like Hasselhoff ...). It takes pictures, and transferring it an esoteric German book about witches, I think. <br /> <br /> In addition to the tour of the island is elderly couple who purchased it, and real estate agent, and a woman I thought was their daughter. Obviously, she was an architect, and Linda Blair and boy children are older couples. I believe that all of them have traveled to the island together, but it did seem to Linda and the boys were separated from the rest of them (perhaps they were filmed separately). <br /> <br /> The hotel seems neat, of course, from the exterior, but it is not used to any great effect. An old woman in a bad make-up and black cloak continue to appear on the boy and shouting something in German sometimes that he eventually recording his Sesame Street recorder. <br /> <br /> The people start getting killed, either in a dream or is sucked into hell or something. Some of these scenes of gore is normal, but not enough to recommend the film. Although I have seen a copy of the said that this director's on the cover of the box, the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been reduced. Most of the scenes footage shows the reaction of another character, since we do not see anything. Creepiest scene in which one person or a demon with a very dirty kind of sore mouth raped someone. He looked particularly disgusting. There's a very funny and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair get. I wish, when horror was going to throw it, they will do something original with their role, and let her leave her exorcist (with the exception of the annual horror conventions, except). <br /> <br /> In a country largely Italian cuisine, traditions maintain that a sequel to something unrelated to, it is also AKA La Casa 4 and Haunted House 2. That is, it is like a continuation of the Casa 3 - haunted House, La (1988) - is not (it is also better film than this one). La Casa 1 and two were Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - again, not related to the Witchery and La Casa 3 (and much better than). There's also Casa 5, La (1990) AKA Building 5, which seems to want to be a continuation of a fake La Casa lots and lots House House (1986) House II: The Second Story (1987), The Horror Show (1989) AKA House III and House IV (1992). As this house of horrors fit in there? This is not so, he argued that the continuation, therefore, requires a series of real-entry numbered themselves, to cause less (or more?) Confusion. Ironically, The Horror Show as AKA Horror House and La Casa 5 also AKA Horror House 2. Headache still?
