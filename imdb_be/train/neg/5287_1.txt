I have no idea why they did this version of "Persuasion", when they already had that fine mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I guess they wanted to make a feature-length version, but, of course, a lot had to be excluded; Unfortunately, that end up on the cutting room floor all the wonderful wit and humor, leaving a film that was just melodrama rather than a fun exhibition of English manners and customs of the countries. <br /> <br /> In addition, the characters were shallow and uninteresting. They were poor Anne chasing up and down the street after Captain Wentworth how stupid modern teenager (and if you have to read this nonsense modern teenager, let me tell you, run behind the man as a female in heat does not cool) ,. This is what well-bred woman Napoleonic era would not have done ever, and, of course, this is not a balanced character <br /> <br /> Some say that they found it funny antique; my reaction was not the laughter and indignation. The idea of ​​such damage Austen's work under the Contempt. <br /> <br /> It was awful.
