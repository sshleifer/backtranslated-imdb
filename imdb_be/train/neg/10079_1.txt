When I was 11, Grease 2 was like crack. It was a classless, shameful, euphoria, and powerfully addictive experience. My sister and I would watch it, rewind it and watch it again and again and again until you cut down or become too complicated and are hostile to each other. Thus, if you are a 11 year old girl, and you have considered this film as a "brilliant" or "fun" or "better than the original Grease," you have a teen hormones are born guilty, and you can be sure that this inflexible fixation with a full garbage will be held. <br /> <br /> However, if you're not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that the Grease 2 was nothing but a silly, simple, negligent embarrassment to all who participated in the production, distribution and / or consumption. <br /> <br /> for the sake of criticism, I will call the film now, explaining why he blows ?? <br /> <br /> 1. In a well-made musical, songs have to promote or develop the descriptive character. The Grease 2, with a few exceptions, controversial, music obscenely meaningless. Most of the songs, apparently refers gimped insinuations about sex in excessive and general terms ( "Number Tonight", "Recovery», «Do It for our country" and «Prowlin»), without making one specific application of any with characters or movie theme. In addition, all music uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast does not show even a rough similarity ability to sing or dance. <br /> <br /> 2. T bird must be burrs, and if not, at least some nice, but instead each of them is annoying wussy-dufus-loser. In the end, when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael sacred Jacket T-bird and initiates him into the gang, Michael has to push him to the ground, spit on him, and duck away fervently to clean any part of your body that has been affected by it, but, of course, he takes it as if it's gold, because, despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads, there is no greater honor than to be one of the T-birds. <br /> <br /> 3. Since Michael beautiful, smart, kind, smart, and above average in every respect (his musical impotence notwithstanding), it is possible that Stephanie eventually take it when he finds himself the people behind the mask. Stephanie, on the other hand, it is sloppy, slack-jawed, gum spanking, dirty sweatshirt to wear, improper rough and bad dingbat. So aside from the pretty (I think), it is not fraught with not nice characteristics, so the audience does not provide any justification for the depth of Michael's attraction to her. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I do not want to mention the gross inadequacy of his predecessor, as there seems to be so many freaks out there seem to think that such a comparison is unfair. I say this, though, for those of you who think that you want to return to this mess for old time's sake: Grease 2 is a similar experience to live your first kiss again. 32 Only you now kissing snot-nosed 13-year-old kid with acne and slobby brackets. The magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and alarmed. Trust me.
