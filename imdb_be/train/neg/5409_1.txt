Christmas Secret touted as a great movie, but I was really disappointed. They even sold VHS and DVD copies of the film, when it was finished, which makes me think that manufacturers are really proud of this project. As a screen actor myself, I felt most of the presentations called in, although the fact Bridges as Nick, had a moment or two. If I were Richard Thomas, I would not put this film in my otherwise fine resume. It was embarrassing. I have been a fan since his days Waltons, but found myself untempted watch any of his subsequent work, so poor was the proposal. <br /> <br /> The protection actors, direction was unnatural, mechanical, and thoroughly amateurish. <br /> <br /> I hope this review is not considered malicious and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic. I turned the film because it was a good shot, and I was ready to enjoy the film. However, I would challenge any one out there to see this movie and do not want their money back, even if it was on TV
