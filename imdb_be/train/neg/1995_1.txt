Well, I just paid a dollar for a DVD of the film, and it was not even worth it. It seems to be of poor print quality and is in the public domain, I believe, <br /> <br /> Neagle. - in spite of its fame, awards and reputation - is a cozy British gal who can not sing or dance or act. <br /> <br /> Some of the finest characters of old Hollywood actors on the screen here, must have thought that they were doing the classic. Directed by Herbert Wilcox (husband Neagle c) always I thought Anna was the most interesting and talented f on the screen. He was wrong. She was incredibly popular in Britain before and after the Second World War. Her "serious" role is even more absurd than her musical appearance here. <br /> <br /> Only a few of the well-known songs are included and none are well represented. Skip this one and find the one that stars Doris Day. At the very least, get a real comedy and professional style dancing!
