I was not a fan of gore 2005 festival hit "Hostel", and most of them lame ass knock-offs are just as bad or even worse - until the "Live Stream" managed to keep me somewhat entertained for about the first 30 minutes. We started with a lot of sex and sloppy settings, and then a few good scenes of death associated with Chinese organized crime squad and the 7-foot, leather apron butcher to ... What to put me out of the film was hard "hero" of the gun and the rage on the economy the next day ... I would call this film a mediocre, at best, as the room mostly involving young people hideous slaughter in a seedy porn theater, doubling as a haven for the mafia, contact me. If torture was prolonged enough to be fully effective, it is my assessment will be significantly different. Unfortunately, most of the gruesomeness heaped together in one scene, leaving the rest of the film to conclude the script type of revenge. Yes, in principle, it's just a low-budget "Hostel" rip-off with the redemptive use of gratuitous sex, nearly constant during the first half of the film ... In general, I would say not to bother with it.
