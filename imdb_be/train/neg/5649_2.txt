I do not think it's too bad about the show in the right conditions. I endured the first season. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a show about lawyers who are not actually lawyers. God forbid anyone actually go to law school on the basis of these shows that I heard was the case when I watched several interviews on the show. He just made me gag a little. <br /> <br /> That aside, Spader and Shatner to be stars of the show, the most annoying. While this may be a compliment in some situations, it is, of course, not here. They are constantly worried about the women on the show funny at first glance. But since this is what they are doing is literally all the time, I realized that it is as deep as the show is going to get. Trying to pour some serious, dramatic, and even tear-jerking moments in the middle of a mockery of the show can not compensate for the gradual loss of interest, I felt, trying to enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> "public service announcement" flowery and free of Alan Shore, where he spouts from his opinion are not impressive. Denny Crane is just annoying. I was embarrassed for him and for the authors of the show to speak Crane wearing colonial costume. <br /> <br /> I give two stars, because there are times when I thought that the show attempts to solve some of today's problems were made with caution. <br /> <br /> I think that the authors of the show, it became known that sexual harassment appears Denny and Alan got overbearing, even those who were more attractive of them from the very beginning. The fact is that I do not care if the treatment of sexual harassment in the show is done well, but I felt that the writer insulted me with artificially implanting sexual banters throughout the show in the hope that my libido will keep me coming back anymore. I'm not a teenager anymore, and I think it shows promise, if its purpose is not to satisfy the lowest common denominator to get ranked. <br /> <br /> Of course, I am writing this after I realized that it really is not going to get much better than this. It's a shame, because this is one of those shows that I would love.
