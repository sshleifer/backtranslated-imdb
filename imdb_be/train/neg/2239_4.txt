Planning permission has already been described by other experts, so I'll just add that my reason for wanting to see this movie was to see Gabrielle Drake in all its undoubted glory. <br /> <br /> Miss Drake has to be one of the sexiest, most beautiful examples of "chic TottyÂ» were perfect on celluloid. With its eras and one of them, just so exquisite Jane Asher approaching. What is it about actresses with musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those who love Me Gabriel grabbed her scenes in this film will not disappoint. She has a gorgeous figure and not one of them left in the imagination here. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very poor and be their time, very cheaply made. The song, which covers the opening credits, it seems, is forever and terrifying.
