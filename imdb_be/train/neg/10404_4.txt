This is a direct to video the death rattle of a series of tremors, has inspired sixty seconds (Sawblade: You'll know when you see it) and more melancholy and filler than you can shake a stick at. Tremors 4 were clearly captured on cripplingly low budget. This means that they only have enough special effects Charisma for three or four minutes of valuable worm-on-human violence, ladders. Dull, cliche has molded and beaten letter, make sure that the remaining one and a half hours with 4 Tremble experience feel for a long time, at least fifteen thousand years. Only hardcore fans tremor can sit, much less like this movie. If you are not among the most of do not disturb.
