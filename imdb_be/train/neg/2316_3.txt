After reading over the years that when I finally watched it about a year ago how great this movie was how he found Ruiz among French critics (especially pathetic Cahiers crowd), I found it quite disappointing (but then, I think my expectations were sky-high). Shot in a saturated black and white, this deliberately cerebral film (made for television, and mercifully, only one hour) narrated in the form of conversation between art connoisseur and narrator of the frame as they talk through a series of paintings (which are shown in the style of tableaux ) and try to find out if they have some clues about the hidden political crime. (Terrible Kate Beckinsale movie has uncovered a similar argument). Borgesian is a word that I read a lot of reviews about this film, but I would say almost every Borges story is more interesting than the movie.
