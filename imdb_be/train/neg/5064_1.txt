I do not believe that they made this film. It is not necessary. The first film was in order. But there was no need in the future, certainly not after the TV series, which has been a continuation of the first film. This film feels like a soap opera. Drawing up so bad, it's quite simple. Joke did not come across, the current flat, he shot like soap, it does not have any direction. The first film was a good emotional backbone behind it. Each character had a small arc. It was very simple back then, but somehow it worked, and I could see the merit of this film. But this time, there is a cohesive storyline. Symbols stupid stereotypes and nothing interesting is happening. One good thing: Brazilian boy who plays the son of Axel Daeselayr is fairly well matched. It was their one moment of creative success in this film. I heard that they had removed the second television series as a continuation of Â«Team Spirit 2", but to please God, do not let them make a third installment feature ...
