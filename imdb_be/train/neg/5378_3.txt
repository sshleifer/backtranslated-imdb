I watched this movie really was not expecting much, I got it in a pack of 5 films, all of which was quite scary in its own way for a fiver so I would have expected? and you know that I was right, they were all awful, this film has a few (and some of them is stretching it) interesting moments, sometimes kind of video camera is a nice touch, the drummer is very similar to a drummer, that is damn annoying and, but that in fact, the problem lies in the fact that its just so boring, that I can only assume that there was an attempt to build tension, a whole lot of nothing going on, and when it does it very tedious (I had a thumb button fast forward, ready to push The path is a big part of the film, but gave it a go) and is a serious lead singer of that great looking, so they do not half put, how beautiful it is a hell of a lot, I thought he looked a bit like a Meercat, all and I did not even mention the killer, I'm not even going to go into details, it is simply not worth explaining. In any case, as I understand it Star and London just about the only reason to watch this, and with the exception of London (which was actually quite funny), it was not because of their acting talent, of course, I've seen a lot worse, but I also saw a lot better. Best avoided if your bored watching paint dry.
