As I have already said that the book was pretty good, and it might have been a good film if Melissa Gilbert was not such a terrible and unbelievable in the lead roll. That emphasis was, suggesting that in any way? It sounded just like her terrible Russian accent in another film that I saw her. Every time she opened her mouth, I cringed. It took three attempts before I was able to watch the entire movie. Brad Johnson was good, the other lead. <br /> <br /> I really liked the beach scene locations. They added a much-needed brightness to take your mind of Melissa Gilberts poor image. I think they could use the views of San Francisco back in their favor, though. It looks like night scenes were actually SF, but I could be wrong. I do not remember the character of the book as it is depressing. <br /> <br /> Please keep Melissa Gilbert of upcoming films that require accent!
