Each of them is about 20 minutes duration. <br /> <br /> They did not tell us anything about the recall the statement made by General Lucas Rincón en JEFE Romero, inspector general of the army forces, which is a traditional supporter of Chavez, even now, in spite of his statement, that he is the Ministro de Justicia in the Interior. After the return of Chavez, he occuped Consumption Minister del Defensa (equal to the Minister of Defense in the United States). <br /> <br /> They are nothing of the orders Chávez did not talk about shooting people against pacifical concentration, which claimed the elections. <, Br /> <br /> They did the people in the concentration that killed Chavez Fans do not speak (or civil and military official powers). <br /> <br /> These are some of the facts in the wrong order, to lie. <br /> <br /> They are nothing of the Venezuelan civil society Thats not to say the complaint now in the elections to resolve the crisis and the actions of Chavez, to avoid elections. <br /> <br /> That's why I tell you ....
