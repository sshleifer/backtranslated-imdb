It was a blind buy a used DVD. It fills up a good buzz I'm going when I hit play. <br /> <br /> This bubble-headed comedy, but it's um. poky. Plot Danny! But the characters do things to each other, so that small and heavy and conveniently contrived I eventually found it depressing to watch. <br /> <br /> It may take me a box waiting for something more than the rough, stupid caper film. (I know, I know, quotes on the box and an Oscar nomination does not mean anything.)
