When I noticed that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroeder was in the same movie, I was like, score! I admit, I was ready to watch a movie. And I must say that the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgically on the road. Then he went all down hill. I did not expect that it will dump the politically correct civil rights fetish. They take all possible controversial topics and threw him into a stupid story. I was shocked that Noah was involved in anything like that, especially its role. None of the fully functional brain will not really take all that shit about the war in Vietnam. If someone really wants to know how communism was like, sit down and read a book on it. And not the one who praises it or against it, only cold hard facts. <br /> <br /> I only watched a few scenes here and there only because I wanted to see the body of Ricky, but that was all I was interested in everything else in this movie, I was irritated.
