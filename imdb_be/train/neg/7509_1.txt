«Why?» <br /> <br /> This simple question should be on the lips of every resident of New York for 12 months of terror, Berkowitz, created in 1976-77. The same word is sure to become the same confusing issue 22 summer after people exit theaters that show the banal and exploitative "Summer of Sam." <br /> <br /> Directed by Spike Lee tries to weave a story of a pack of thugs looking for the famous false psychopath - that paralyzed New York for a year - a harsh and graphical representation of the murder, the demons inside Berkowitz head in disappointment and vain NYPD sought. It is a hideous ensemble lost who hear their own "barking dog" as they live, live without love, honor and humanity - do not differ from Berkowitz. Or browbeats audience in almost every frame with "not one of us, that we seem to be." Often the criticism white establishment, Lee perpetuates the stereotype, including the scene where the World Sorvino playing wedding fraud her husband (John Leguizamo), hopes to have oral sex with a black man "in the back of a big black Cadillac." The Italian mafia says black detective that the famous Willie Mays is back in midfield catch was "lucky". Or even make sure to put the racist discourse one middle-aged black woman who declares "I zheniya plums, it is a white man kills all these white people, because if it were a black man, killing all the white people - it will be the biggest race riot in the history of New York "<br /> <br /> In addition to the fine. opening panning shot arrival at the disco (reminiscent of footage from Martin Scorsese in "Goodfellas" or Orson Welles's "the third man"), this film does not have a soul, purpose or passion. He walks the characters on the screen devoid of human decency. Although we do not know about the real victims of this terrible gulyanok, Spike Lee seems to say New York got what he deserved for this terrible, boiling in the summer more than two decades ago. <br /> <br /> "As someone who can do such devastation on his beloved city?" "How can someone show such hatred towards their loved ones?» <br /> <br /> A these relevant questions for Berkowitz or Lee? <br /> <br /> you decide.
