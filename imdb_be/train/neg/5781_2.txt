Any contribution he made in the film were made more than twenty years ago; his work is inconvenient, safe and / or dim (Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, the pirates). <br /> <br /> R The child must be meant the end of the institution at the time it came out. This suite of production and relatively high concept 1968 "horror" movie (never show the child). But this is only the juice horror error. All the arts to that storyline becomes hopelessly clear very early (Um, thank you for this final devastating title), and on a clear day you can see the twist ending comes in a few days. He could not stand my interest. I think that all this movie can be, it is completely off the rails in the version of 1960, which was feminine. Farrow such chronic distracted, helpless Homeless / housewife. Its fragility resell it ... annoying in the extreme. There's no real ideas in this ... I do not consider anything other than the mother of the devil. <br /> <br /> Dakota horrible little exploited potential for him.
