This movie is really sad. It was banned in the Chinese movie, and I can understand why. This is not because it is very important to the communist regime, but simply because the film of such poor quality. I would never want to pay money to look at it. I like films with Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, and I am disappointed by such poor film may pull out of China. It does seem to ignore the audience and the director seems to have made a film for you. Shots of a man standing there, doing nothing for one minute, funny, and there are many of them. Film and video quality is incredibly bad. I watched this movie on the web and it seems that people really like this movie. The only explanation I have for this is that some film buffs believe that if the film is not in English it is automatically good. I do not see any reason why people would want it. it's not a feature film, this waste of celluloid. (That's if they actually shot on film, they did not do)
