I would like to vote by zero or below. I loved the comment. This is the worst movie of all time and "intolerable" is the perfect word for it, if there's something worse than that Roger never thought. I am also at a loss to think of anything negative enough to accurately describe After Derek. The best thing you could say it is, it's consistent.
