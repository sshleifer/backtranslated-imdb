Doris Day never allow bad script to get it down. Even in the most difficult circumstances, the day gives 100% and usually comes out unscathed. This comedy, perhaps inspired by the real life New York black-out in 1965, but in fact borrowed from the late 50-ies of the French play by Claude Monnier, Doris gives little to do but to forge its own sweet way and, in the second half It is comical sedatives (that's funny, because spin gives day situation). There are some funny lines here, nevertheless entertainment material, obviously, has been moved from the play ... and instead of coming up with any funny incidents within the Big Apple, we get stuck in the suburbs. Doris co-stars (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse and Terry-Thomas) is not well suited for it, and neither shapeless hair they wear it. However, it is not scary, it has a few big laughs, and buff is a must-see day. ** from ****
