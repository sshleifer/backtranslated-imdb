You have to love movies cheesy low budget. This one comes with the bad effects, props and acting bad (very bad). In addition, every time I see, Mercedes McNab (sister), I keep thinking, "She's a vamp Beware!" - for those who know Buffy / Angel <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and want to spend money to make a movie, the little that has been spent, of course .. I do not know when I feel more sorry for the author or film producer, who did not make the money back. <br /> <br /> I would say that it is good for young children, in its simplicity, but I do not know if I want to expose your child to it ... <br /> <br /> mmm. .. 1/10, because it is the lowest it will go.
