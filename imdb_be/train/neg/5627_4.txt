When I watch this movie, it's interesting to see how much it marginalize black men. The film spends his time showing how powerless most prominent black man in it (except for the heroic moment). For most of the film, the other black men (and dark-skinned Black women) in the film path in the background, barely noticeable. Character <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams was a strong and responsive. The viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. There are also some pretty noticeable and three-dimensional supporting characters that light-skinned, and some white characters of some warmth and dignity. But 99% of black men in this film is nothing but invisible people. Deaf shadow in the background, it does not matter. Such a terrible disadvantage, but nothing unusual except in the media.
