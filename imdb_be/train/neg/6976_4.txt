Robert Altman pessimistic newfangled Western books of Edmund Naughton in "McCabe" was released at the time of its release, but received the following critical sterling in recent years. In addition it is a compelling scenario boom town, the characters here do not deserve special interest, and the picture is (intentionally) brackish and unattractive. Warren Beatty plays a bearded entrepreneur turn of the century, which settles in the fight community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps to organize the first brothel; when the income starts coming in Beatty, of course, threatened the city thugs who want part of the action. Altman creates a festive atmosphere, winter for the film, which gives the viewer a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this miserable little town is limited - a large part of the story is made up of vignettes - and walks Altman deliberately slow. There is hardly a statement of the case (just the opposite, in fact) and sluggish actors look at each other, not a lot on their minds. This is a pernicious pattern, and yet, in Altman-bizarre way, it is a defeat proudly. ** from ****
