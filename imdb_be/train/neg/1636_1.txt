This film will be a hit with those who enjoy sophomoronic, mindless, sheer bragging about sexual exploits and F ... in almost every sentence. Like a good story? As a comedy? As romance or other human values? Stay away from the whipping. It was so bad, I left about half an hour. I saw two children, slip into what looked to be about 10 - very bad - it deserves X.
