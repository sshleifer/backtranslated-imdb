The film has only one drawback, unfortunately, the lack of damage to the credibility of the whole. <br /> <br /> It starts with the condemnation of the Israeli occupation of the disputed territories. It does not address the cause of the Israelites there. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. That's why Israel «occupys» own land, because these countries have lost in the war they started. <br /> <br /> The film also argues that Israel dropped the call of the UN, not the implementation of Resolution 242. The problem is that, 242 was immediately rejected at its inception on ..... Palestinians, making it invalid. <br /> <br /> Many films put together well and can really show footage that changes consciousness, but remember that when watching anything, does not believe in what you hear and only half of what you see . <br /> <br /> All the participants in this film as well-known criticism of Israel, and some of them have done a lot of anti-Semitic comments from the public, removing any possible credibility to their words. <br /> <br /> All participants desperately need a lesson in the real history objectively, and not by some Palestinian sympathizers.
