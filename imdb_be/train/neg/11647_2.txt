Crime Boss sent Alberto De Martino; Italian crime drama partly filmed in Hamburg, Germany. It is easy to forget the movie. Even though a good car chase sequence, the film seems to rattle on about aimlessly. New Dawn takes on powerful Mafia family and manifests itself fighting for his life. Unwritten laws and ethics of the mafia codes make it difficult to trust anyone, especially when millions of dollars on the map. Cruelty and violence breeds of the same in return. It can not be put on the shelf with a real gangster epics. Only the appearance of the film brings back memories of the fare travel to the US. Even the popular American actor Savalas can not increase the size of this crime drama. Antonio Sabato also stars of Paolo Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti i Piero morgue.
