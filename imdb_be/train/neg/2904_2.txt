If in the first 10 minutes of this film, you do not understand that the main character, who writes a column life tips will have a constant-on-da reasonably chiseled and learn some valuable lessons of life itself, then there is probably something wrong with you. A lot of so predictable up to destroy the film, even if the rest of the film was good (it's not) <br /> <br /> There's almost no chemistry between the leads and the stalker-ish behavior Steve Carell uncomfortable, not funny. Hard to believe the character Binoche would have any interest in it. Then, in the end it all wrapped up so nice and everyone lives happily ever after. Is not it great to America!
