Bela Lugosi is evil botanist who sends poisonous orchid brides on their wedding day, kidnaps his body in a fake ambulance / hearse and takes him home to his midget assistant to get glandular juices to keep his wife Bella forever young. Some of the other actors rates play a detective trying to solve a terrible, terrible secret. Bela Lugosi ham is good, but you can tell he needs money. <br /> <br /> This movie is completely horrible, most actors would have to adhere to waiting tables better, but the plot is surprisingly funny. Tell someone what's going on in it, and they tend to laugh a lot, and need to see the movie. I got a DVD at a discount store 2 for Â£ 1, which I think is a pretty accurate assessment of who pays more than it would be with their mind.
