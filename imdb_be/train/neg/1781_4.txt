Author: Stephen King, but this treatment is not as strong as most of his stories about the film. Mother and son move to a small Indiana town with a secret. They Sleepwalkers, creatures such as cats, which feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus hints of incest. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige is outstanding, as a mother. Others appear to MÃ¤dchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look at very small role for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King has a cameo as the cemetery caretaker.
