In short, the film was a bit weak 1st act with some positive action and multiple disjointed rhythm and pacing a few decent Act 2, which managed to build some tension and intrigue, despite some inconsistent stimulation, and some humbly cast command performances and the third act ... there was virtually no third act! <br /> <br /> As for the third act, the film simply stops. There is no resolution and no way down from the climax of Act 2, so there was not much of a third act. Bad guys die, and that's it; the end credits roll. There's nothing to show what happens to the main character and secondary characters, and so on. The audience would have probably left the theater after the film, asking: "Is that all?" The real disappointment. <br /> <br /> The music was written by David Bell, who has worked adequately enough to serve as the film most of the time, but it is, of course, nothing outstanding. It's just functional, but achieves this by being the only ordinary and derivative. In addition, it is obvious that the assessment of very dated with timpani synthesized for some of the percussion. That is not less impressed me about the bill is that some moments of tension heralds the music cues sound like they have been ripped off by James Horner with "48 hours". and "Diversant", especially copper. <br /> <br /> In general, the film had potential as the main story itself is good, but the performance was lackluster with direct supervision, poor acting and a few contradictory stimulation. <, Br /> <br /> There was virtually no third act to end the story right, and this omission is a major and unforgivable, since it does not allow the film to end satisfactorily. This can be either the script or perhaps had to cut production of the shooting or editing the third act in the finished film because of budget constraints (but I speculate why there is no third act). Whatever the reason, the abrupt ending really hurt the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> It is good for the view, if you're interested, and you can get a movie for very cheap, as well as to find out the reason why you should have a third action (beginning, middle, end) if you writing scripts and making films. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you can not spend your time when you can not get the MST3K version, at least, to get a laugh out of it.
