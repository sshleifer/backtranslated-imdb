What else can I say? The action was, almost without exception, amateur. The guide and continuity were poor. Sceenplay was predicted until the very last stage and tedious dialogue. One of the features on the DVD was named «Gag Reel», but it might be a description of the viewer's response to most of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest things in the commentary on the DVD-director. According to him, with a straight face, that he intended to make a film with high production values ​​and the name of the throwing - and he succeeded. With nonsense like that it is easy to understand how the film was, as it were. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster. DarkWolf suit was modified monkey costume (in accordance with the "product" function on DVD) and it looked pretty. Mask and claws were a little better than on the shelves of jobs from any costume shop. CGI effects are painfully obvious and quality similar to an inexpensive video games.
