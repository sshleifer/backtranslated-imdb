This movie was crap with a capital "C" opening scene showed promise. But this "promise" was broken shortly after the audience know where the story is going. <br /> <br /> And the wooden statue, Mort, which was pretty awful in the original film, looks like an ordinary blunt this. It was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic suit. (And by the way, who else thinks "Mort" is one of the most terrible nya-names on the planet Earth? It ranks right up there with "Jimmy" or "Fred", when it comes to the value of terror. Or why not just name wooden status Henry-freakin'-Kissinger. Â«Run, is a Kissinger!" it would be about as scary as "Mort.) <br /> <br /> And there's a scene where" character "hits a tombstone with his father --- you can imagine "a sledgehammer?" - .. "? two by four "someone might dare No, he angrily hit the gravestone of his father twig --- Freakin 'rod, but even worse, when the characters go, tombstone actually and inexplicably, bleed. Oh, brother! <br /> <br /> There is also an Indian guy who lives with his grandmother and grandfather of the protagonist, but, apparently, does not do anything except Mort-maintenance. it perpetuates the terrible Mort-legend warns those who are bullied, and even fixes Mort hand, if it is damaged during the children's pranks. But for all his respect and affection towards the Mort Mort does give a rat hairy behind? No. <br /> <br /> The film drags on, and finally a few people die ways appropriate to their worst fears (sort of). This film is a real pit. Do not rent it.
