It is right on the video dupe another nail in the coffin of Rick Moranis career. Traditionally, Disney, quality is sacrificed for the sake of a quick cash-in; is lazy with Moranis new tire accidentally shrink himself and several relatives, so that they can repeat all the best scenes from the original film. Instantly dated visuals and dialogue have a lot of crummy in this cheesy lamer, who did nothing but make me miss the days of "The Incredible Shrinking Man", if this kind of thing has been done correctly. Surprisingly, this is aimed at the top cinematographer Dean of Kandy, which should either stick to the day job or pick up the best stuff next time.
