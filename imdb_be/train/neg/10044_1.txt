This is the biggest flop of 2008. I do not know what the director has his mind create such a big disaster. The songs have been added without situations, history has already been stretched to fill the gap 3:00 and the most disgusting tricks are the actions performed by the actors is, as are all who have superpowers they can work between fire bullets and nothing happen to them and one man fights with 100 people. Only the best performance was Anil Kapoor person he is constantly in his best playing the role of villain to comic act of speaking Hinglish ... Akki has also done a good job .... But movieee just forget.
