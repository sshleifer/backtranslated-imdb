Blonde and Blonder was unfunny.Basically, it was a rip-girl version of Dumb and Dumber, but less funny, and they used too much background noise and music.WAY too much background noise and music if you ask me !!!! it starts very sad, and FULLY inane.It Sun pick up the pace in any place in the near future, and I felt more disappointed, because this is nonsense carried on.Maybe, the only thing that saved me from giving this film 1 was the last 30 minutes .I found some entertaining and interesting as it neared the end, but it was the only part.Also, I could not help but like Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard character little.Even, although the film did not get a laugh from me, he I kept my attention.I would not say, to completely avoid this film, but there are thousands of better x movies for you to spend time and money than the blonde and blonde.
