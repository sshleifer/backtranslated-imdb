I usually try to build a fairly well-reasoned criticism of films, but I can not believe I took the script stage. Dialogue is appalling acting very quirky accents simply awful, and the direction and pacing is patchwork at best. <br /> <br /> I can not remember the last time I saw the movie at all is bad. Joseph Fiennes, beautiful as it is, might just kill his career as quickly as it started. <br /> <br /> The Island of Dr. Moreau was not worse than this garbage.
