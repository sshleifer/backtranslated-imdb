I love Anthony Hopkins, as an actor, so I was very interested to see how he would do as a writer / director. I could not be more disappointed by this movement. The film was so disjointed and cinematography so on done up to the point I wanted to pull the plug. The actors were very good, but it was such a waste of talent. Do not cut all the actors to become writers or directors and Hopkins clearly falls into this category. Of all the films I've ever seen in my 50 years, this is absolutely the worst movie ever. Please us all a favor and stick to Mr. Hopkins, since you perfectly, and leave a letter and send to those who are talented in these areas. If I could give a rating to this film is smaller than that of course I would.
