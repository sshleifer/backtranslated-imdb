The broken part of After Dark Horrorfest III. Nha slasher or filled with blood. A lot of broken glass and mirrors in this edgy thriller from France and writer / director Sean Ellis. Successful radiologist Gina McVay (Lena Headley) Intermediates strange world, her life seems to spiral out of control. During visits (Richard Jenkins), the date of birth of his father, guests are stunned when the mirror falls on the floor for no apparent reason. Things get really weird when she sees a woman who is the spitting image of themselves driving on the streets of London in a car identical to her own. Gina sneaks into her apartment and finds a double photograph of herself with her father. She drives off and is involved in head on collision. Then mysteriously her boyfriend is not the same; to be exact family and friends is not easy to trust her. Gina is beside himself? Whether it is in a parallel world? Her nightmares are becoming more terrible ... it is broken? <br /> <br /> Kudos, if you can figure it out ... it will not be easy. Editing could not be tougher. Lighting is doubtful. Other players: Melvil Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
