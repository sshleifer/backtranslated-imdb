I sat through this movie, and I must say that it was possible only to keep my attention. The film was a little stronger, if I should not look terrible CGI, for use in industry, if your going to use CGI to watch it so you know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this should be a graphic novel for the screen, but all I saw was a bad film, which bears no resemblance to the graphic novel at all. <br /> <br /> In general, the story is not as bad as CGI, I was very impressed with the actor's thought the casting was good and a little bit more about your character would be good as it could get a bit confusing to me about, but it not surprising, since, as I said, it's only kept my attention, but in all honestly I wish I gave this one a miss.
