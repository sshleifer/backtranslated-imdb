This is a really stupid movie in this typical 80s genre: action comedy. Conceptwise resembles rush hour, but completely missing the action, laughs, and the chemistry between the main characters of this film. Let it be known that I love Jay Leno as a worthwhile and as a talk show, but he just can not act. He's terrible when he tries to act tough - he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face, telling him jokes, which, incidentally, is not very funny. And seeing how he is running (even then) is not a pleasant sight. In addition, I have a feeling that Pat Morita - at least by today's standards - does not give a very politically correct impression of the Japanese. Do not even get me started about the story. I give him 2 to 10.
