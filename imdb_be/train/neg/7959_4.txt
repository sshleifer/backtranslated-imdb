Andy Lau stars in another undercover cop story. Daniel Wu plays Nick, who works for the cops, as well as close to the top drug gang (Lau). The film begins as we see how the police are trying to make a drug bust only to see it go to pieces. Then we are introduced to young drug addicts mother and her daughter, who live next to Nick and his close friends and police officers, and 45 minutes later I turned off the movie and put it on the news. Well acted and well look at it as uninvolving movie I've seen in a long time. Its not bad, its just like you do not really care. I mean, I really do not care at all. I actually started doing something else completely forgetting I was on the subtitle on movie, how would I do not care. I would have hated the film, but the film is so mean that he has made almost no impression on me (it is not even the fact that I could sleep it just something to be ignored). Come on the name of this Chinese Scarface, after which he died? This is one to avoid.
