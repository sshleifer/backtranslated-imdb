This film is so stupid, it just goes around the corner and it becomes ridiculous. I wanted to see "Darkness engulfed" in fact, and thought it was a movie. Boy, what a mistake! I quickly sent as much as I could, and so far I could not get rid of the sad moments. I just envy people who were paid to play or to work on this film. They were actually given money for this shit. Is not it amazing? I mean in this film people killed and chopped into wood-chipper for a little bloody pieces and a few minutes later the mother and child to speak quietly at the table, like nothing happened, and drinking coffee. Please! Come on! Who gives money for this shit movie? Oh, and the "tooth fairy" lame. Not scary at all, and it was obvious that it's boring stuntman wearing bad make-up.
