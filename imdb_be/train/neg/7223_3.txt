My first attempt to look it over after about telecast the scene, I could not cope in 8 minutes. It continued like this: <br /> <br /> Reporter 1: Hmm, there's a pyramid in our sky. Reporter 2: I think it's aliens. * Awkward silence * Reporter 1: In other news ... <br /> <br /> A few days later, I watched it till the end, and it was not as bad as I imagined, but there are serious problems with this . About half portion can be easily discarded. And the other half should be extended to explain the background story or something. <br /> <br /> What benefit detective Eugenic people and monsters that are utilized for a moment Gore? More amusing was the scene of a monopoly. "We are all powerful" Gods ", who lived eons, and of all the games in the multiverse we happen to play monopoly." Monopoly? Monopoly? Even Erich von Dainiken looks coherent, compared to this. <br /> <br /> The second half badly lacking. That our hero to do to get himself cryo-frozen? Why there was no big event, when it was released at the end? He had the unfortunate follower, remember? What happened to ordinary people? What's the deal with canned guy? How are the blue-haired girl? What's wrong with her vision? Etcetera, and so on. <br /> <br /> Visually, this is normal, more or less, if not to take into account the Egyptian gods, watching the excrement walking with rotweiller heads.
