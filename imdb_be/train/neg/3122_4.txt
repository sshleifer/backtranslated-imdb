I could not give this movie a bad rating or a bad review for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collette. The film has the potential to be a thriller, and there are some minor disturbing elements that tend to the psychological, which has been something of a film could focus a little further. Robin Williams plays Gabriel South, while speaking DJ night, which is experiencing personal problems: his beloved leaves and Gabrielle feels what seems to be a case of the narrator block. Once it receives and reads a story written by a dying 14-year-old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete talks about his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of their parents. He lives with his adoptive mother and social workers, Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel fascinated and begins a friendship with Pete, but it seems strange when Gabriel tries to meet him, and opens the possibility that Pete Boland may not even exist. I will not go into details, because I do not want to spoil the movie, but I'll tell you, it is quite predictable. Exciting atmosphere to tell the story and good performance from Robin Williams and Toni Collette, which I thought was a key character in the film. Collette, without a doubt, one of the most talented and beautiful actresses. Its ability to use the characters psyche and personality it reflects very badly, and I hope that I will see her win an Oscar (hell, I think she can pull off to get Best Supporting Actor nod for the plan, if the script was a bit better). The film begins as a psychological thriller, but it is predictable that. If you're curious to know the end and turns of the film, then watch a movie otherwise I would have to make another predictable thriller called "Dead Man's Bluff".
