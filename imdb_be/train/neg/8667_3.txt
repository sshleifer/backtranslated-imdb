It sports a nice, deep throw, but for best thriller deliver more names of actors and talk. The first third of the film, there was nothing but talk, talk, and more. Much of it was a bunch of women whine about everything together. <br /> <br /> The first five actors listed here as a woman, to check that it really is "chick flick" and little else. This is likely to play on the network lifetime. <br /> <br /> There was a murder scene quickly, and then more talk. At the halfway point, they have lost. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sally Field looked about 15 years here.
