This film deals with two former players who Fred Williamson (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey (Lenny), works as a private eye and meet all kinds of men and women with some poor backgrounds. Mack Derringer approaching his ex-wife vanity (Jennifer Derringer), working on sex phone conversations. Jennifer threatens one subscriber who wants to do terrible things, and she asks him to help with a few other houses. Mack & Lenny more time on their hands, and often go to Miami, Florida. golf or hang out at a sports bar, where all kinds of things go on cities. There is a lot of punches, murder and lots of double meaning of words that bring the film all the way down to a big zero. Do not waste your time, this movie cost me only 50 cents, and it was too much.
