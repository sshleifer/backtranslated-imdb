This film has a very simple, but as a very bad story. The whole movie is about a girl involved gateway to another dimension, and years later he received the newly opened witch while a group of friends (including the lead actor who is having trouble getting over his ex-girlfriend, who is one of the other campers together with his new partner ... another woman ... it's right they are lesbian, and there's some nudity, certainly for no particular reason). Unfortunately, the demon should now adult girl back through. Also, unfortunately, none of this has ever explained. Where exactly are they? Whence came the demon? How she survived as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who the hell trained on it and made it a kind of gladiator outfit? Actions terrible, I think, but it's hard to say, because writing is so bad, maybe it was not just nothing that they could do with it. I give it a three because the fighter was pretty good, and the consequences were quite fun, even if they were very cheap. I would not recommend it, it was not bad enough to be funny.
