If Mr. Cranky was appreciated it, I'd be tempted to just copy and paste it review here. But since he does not, I have to give it a go myself. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives this film 1 instead of 0, which is valid Malcolm McDowell beautiful. But even he can not save this film from disaster. The director must be really distracted when he worked on this, because it's just a jumble of scenes that were thrown together with very little continuity - reminiscent bad "70 movies. Even worse, the actors and the director seemed to be making it as they went along, which probably showed how bad the original scenario. <br /> <br /> It is not even worth discussing the plot, although it revolves around a futuristic corporation called proxate corporations, to put together a crew is not the right people to carry dangerous goods on an old container / slave ship in Nigeria. The computer is a child of this vessel is kept in a glass jar and a wire in one of the crew via a USB 12 or something. The company had called prostate Corporation as the entertainment value of the film at the same level with the consideration of the same name. <br /> <br /> I really can not find one scene, I could tell it was well made and made some real meaning in the context of the film. I just watched it to the end, like I had a touch of the bird flu and this film reminded me that there were people who were actually worse than me - Malcolm McDowell, in particular. I will not hold it against him, as he's a great actor and a great actor is entitled to a bad film in his career, and this is one doosie. <br /> <br /> So, if this is not the only film your store if you are losing a man and you are a doctor does prostate exam this week, and somehow you believe that it is bad, then give it a really avoided unless, of course, if you're really a community of like-minded, buy a copy to support Malcolm, and then use it as a drink coaster.
