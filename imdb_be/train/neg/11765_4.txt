You know what you get when you buy a Hallmark card. Juicy, downed verse, and it will be $ 3.99, thank you very much. You get the same thing with the film Hallmark. Here we get ninety Ernie Borgnine comes out of retirement to tell us that, in fact, he is not dead as we thought. Poor Ernie, he is a poor fellow that married Ethel newt few years ago, and the marriage lasted for several weeks. In this movie, Ernie jumping in feet first and reflects grandfather, who connects with his long-lost grandkid. We have seen this before. You can enjoy this movie, but please do not say you were not warned.
