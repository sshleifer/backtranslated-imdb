Well, what can I say about this movie. I was speechless. I could about how stupid this movie forever, but the one thing that really pi * sed me was the music. And to top it all someone has commented on how much they enjoyed it. To them all I have to say that it has been cut off from one of the best martial arts movies of all time Fistsof rage starring Bruce Lee. If he was still alive, and ever faced with this film, he would have been horrified. the rest of the film is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of tape. I say the tape because the film so he could not possibly have been shot on film.I now feel more stupid to waste 30 minutes of your life watching it. The only reason why I even saw it was because my roommate downloaded it from the morbid curiosity. What is the world coming to.
