Recently, I decided to return omen trilogy, only to discover that {insert} demonic music here there is a fourth. I did not expect much from him, and in this respect, certainly lived up to my expectations. If you are watching the bad movie for laughs, it might just be the movie for you. Oh, where do we start? <br /> <br /> From the outset, the "TV" look and feel of the film was clear. Music is often out of place in conformity with what is happening in the film, and therefore (at best) a distraction. The script was all suspense with an 8-year-old works of fiction. But one thing I must say that is not enough the script was very well combined with a horrible action. Many scenes left me contemplating whether it was acting or the script, which was a source of absurdity. <br /> <br /> The story itself is quite thin, centering on all the crazy antics of the daughter of Damien Thorn, took a wrong-doing and nuns acted badly. There is the usual lot of mysterious and puzzling deaths that personally made me yawn as "drama" extensive and regular third-party researcher whole thing. Later, with the help of some health effects, Damien Thorn Jnr born. And it's pretty much the plot turns. All this is done pretty bad from the beginning to the lack of suspense the film a monotonous and / or funny scene after another. <br /> <br /> There have been numerous WTF?!? points also to provide relief unintentional comedy. For example, that the Major's reaction at the beginning of the movie when the child scratches the mother's cheek ?? Almost 360 degrees rotation head on the wall. I also laughed at the overreaction in baptism. The baby cries, and everything looks very concerned. Frustrated mother ran out of the church and the priest left looking very alarmed, and were baptized. And? Then there's the new-age nanny that appears to have a carte blanche to autopsy 8 years for all kinds of alternative spiritualism. I laughed when a nurse suggested to bring the troubled Delia's psychic fairs hippies meet the nurse and mother's friend simply shrug their shoulders and allows it. "Yes, it's groovy, fill my troubled 8 years old daughter's head with all that mystic stuff. It's cool. I do not need to be there. "Of course, it would be expected from a mother who allows her daughter to take a fully-grown Rottweiler they face on the street, who can bite the little girl's head as a snack. The whole scene in the psychic fair quite comical farce in a kind way, from the frightened reactionary views psychics to Delia, walked to hell. <br /> <br /> I laughed too, they are considered the death of a nun A "accident". Here we have a religious fanatic (which is described as part of the cult), who fanatically preaching in a pit full of rattlesnakes to prove how the glory of God will protect them. It counteracts the snakes in their processing and otherwise it was bitten several times. It is hardly an accident. More like a successful suicide attempt. <br /> <br /> serpent against the nun scene not only comic death. There is a slow speed car accident as a result of decapitation in the school parking lot. Then there is the slow demolition ball went straight to the detective. I suppose I could have gone and made coffee when only started to slow return to see even wear a ball headed straight for the "interested" detective. Then there is the quintessence of one shot that cliche death, where the gun away, and both act as if they were shot in a few seconds in the exchange of views with horror. Then someone comes tumbling down the stairs, which reveals who was the real victim. In addition, the priest's death early in the film, it seemed a little strange and pointless to me. He runs around looking at the architecture of the church. Obviously, finding it very upsetting, it eventually falls, clutching his chest and dies. Apparently something demonic, what's going on, because that's what music is offered. Mmmm. GOOD. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that others have considered this film is positive and, in particular, as "a worthy sequel." It's hard not to notice, not a script, used meaningless unrealistic actions and ridiculous music. In the film, there is no suspense, leaning heavily on a "demonic look" Delia, to provide a sense of horror, which becomes quite annoying after a short time. <br /> <br /> The result: It's a bad movie for the sole mitigating be it inadvertent potential to be a comedy.
