That let you down! It began with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters. However, he was moving along at a snail, but I still captured and kept watching. <br /> <br /> David Morrissey always good value, and it is sulfur Jones had good conclusions. Muslim aspects were very interesting. We were tantalised with possible terrorist connections. <br /> <br /> But the nature of Morrissey was killed, and all the air went out of the balloon. The last episode was boring, boring, boring. All this was very small beer and isolation was incredibly weak. <br /> <br /> The five hours of my life for it? My advice is to watch paint dry instead.
