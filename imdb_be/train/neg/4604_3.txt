I should pat yourself on the back for watching this movie all the way through, because it really hurt. The inability of the artist becomes quite able to hit people? This film was rife with absurdities of which, when I mentioned them all, I would distribute the film. Norm Peterson aka George Wendt has to be exactly on track to have agreed to do this film. Action was boring, and the story was even worse. The sane-minded and rational person, I could not understand where the writer came from nor where he was going with this film. There was a smile on everyone's protagonist, has a string of accidents and absurd events, the film ended. One after another absurd act of dialogue does not make the film, it just makes Communicative train wreck.
