This is one of the worst movies ever. I like cheese movies, but this is just awful. Where the images in the movie that are on the field? I think that more money was spent on the DVD box-like illustrations than in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Why will release a DVD, the cover is so misleading? I feel like an idiot for rent this film, based solely on the field. As far as I explore IMDb I had to do some research and compiled a list before attending my local video store. I have no one to blame but yourself. I want my money and time back. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Even if curiosity motivates you, stick with cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead. It will be much more enjoyable. You have been warned!
