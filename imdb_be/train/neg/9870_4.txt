I had a few problems with the movie: <br /> <br /> (1) The scenario - in particular, the voice of Kim Basinger: Movies sun books; they * have * to show action, not to have a voice over * tell us what is happening. Sometimes I find the film with a voice through which the works, but here it seemed more lazy way of writing a script. In fact, it sounded to me as if it were almost reads passages from the novel in her voice anymore. <br /> <br /> (2) I did not feel any emotion in the relationship between Jesse and his brother, Thomas, and I think that Alex Carter's action was very bad. This is a significant setback for me in determining the characters of Jesse and Thomas - with no connection between them, it seemed to me that she just wanted to pin, and that this was a matter to be deprived of sex for him. If it was done properly, the relationship between them would have given much more context history. <br /> <br /> (3) With this book, I realized Jesse mid-life crisis. In the movie, it was more like just out of boredom. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I do not think the movie was so bad for me to turn off the TV. ,, Although this idea really crossed my mind.
