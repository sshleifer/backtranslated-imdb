The boy sees his mother is killed and his father hanged himself. 20 years later, he gets a bunch of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself so that he does not, like his father. All roles on the spot: cute couple; "Funny" guy; hard (but sensitive) hood; intelligent girl (she wears glasses - this is how we know); botanist and two blondes nya-face. All of this involves some silly wooden statue that comes to life (do not ask) and kills people. I knew I was in trouble when after the great opening scene, we jump up to 20 years later - all the bad horror movies make it <br /> <br /> The dialogue brutal, bad acting (except for Betsy Palmer - why Betsy ) and the murder of stupid and / or prose. My favorite scene is when two people, presumably, sex and the statue of a guy knocks the bed to show that he was fully clothed! Real bad, stupid incoherent horror film. Avoid at all costs.
