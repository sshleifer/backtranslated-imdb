I imagine when Hitchcock scholars and experts are together, we are not talking about big Masters films as "North by Northwest" or "Strangers on a Train", but less well-known efforts like this in 1931, fuzzy and serious shortcomings, showing a great director in the form of the young. <br /> <br /> Emily and Fred Hill (Joan Barry and Harry Kendall) is an average London a couple of scrimping class to stay ahead. He begrudges them a lot; she takes it. Changes occur in the form of a letter from his uncle, saying he will set them so that they could enjoy life omnipresent luxury. They make a world cruise plans. But their problems have just begun. <br /> <br /> Just ask Richard Hanna, Roger O. Thornhill, or Marion Crane. Well, Marion unhealthy at the moment, but you get the idea. Hitchcock and travel go together like a butterfly and a candle, setting one of the risky journey at best. This is perhaps the earliest foray Hitchcock in this topic, and not the most successful or memorable. Hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element, in this case of domestic drama, but not unknown, but the two do not adhere, at least, not here. <br /> <br /> Hills blunt, flat couple without chemistry or identity. When they are at the Folies Bergere, a crosscut with shots that looks ten years older than the rest of the film, they became angry female singers outfits. "The curtain is gone too soon!" Gasps Emily. "They are not dressed." <br /> <br /> If the hills move away from each other on the ocean cruise it seems mercy killing more than a tragic thing, even if the people they are dripping off partner too. Man Emily Gordon (Percy Marmont) carries around pictures of himself sitting next to empty chairs, which he offers to fill Emily. Fred's girl "Princess" (Betty Amann) my eyes and Clara Bow in the five o'clock shadow Wallace Beery Art. There's also an unpleasant companion, tasteless maiden which Hitchcock always enter with cartoon horny kiey. Subtlety was yet to come. <br /> <br /> All filmed in the abrupt manner, with intricate locks and intense dialogue. Hitchcock is trying to some early comedy with Fred and his umbrella, which does not come off, and Kendall seem goals for a laugh while playing for Berry tears. If Fred and Emily stop, they saw him pushed into pairs wedged-together rickshaws, one of the many clumsy attempts at symbolism. <br /> <br /> Emily's only remotely sympathetic character, partly because she really cares about her husband and suffers because of her affair with Gordon, but mostly because it is among the first of many magnetic Hitchcock blondes, her platinum hair whipping around her face like Botticelli on board the open deck of the Chinese junk near the film's conclusion. <, Br /> <br /> Questions to enter into a dangerous situation for the televised portion of the protagonist get to grips with, and are likely to rebuild their relationship. Only they are not active participants in the settlement, and for the fate of the friendly cats, with the exception of the final statement resonates entirely. <br /> <br /> At least you get some nice views of London in the early 1930s, and the chance to see Hitchcock, when he was still working in the food. "Rich and Strange" is Hitchcock to pay dues, and learning his trade, one of the scientists, but not casual moviegoers.
