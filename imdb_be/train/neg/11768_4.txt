This reboot both processed food McDonald's compared with Ang Lee is very good, but very underrated 2003 «The Incredible Hulk». <br /> <br /> Ang Lee "Hulk" comic book movie is for the thinking man. Hulk takes some time to appear (approximately 40 minutes), but when he does, we see the conflict at the core of our hero. He is doing everything possible in order not to lose control, but, as he admits, when he succumbed to his rage, he loves it. <br /> <br /> Now compare this turn, Edward Norton, where there is no display of the conflict in his personality, and he turns into the Hulk when he becomes excited, and his heart rate was 200 beats per minute (not 183, instead of 197, namely 200). For this reviewer, it felt like the introduction of midi-chlorians in The Phantom Menace, who say how strong "power" is one, as it were mystical abilities can be assessed by a blood test. In the film, in 2008, all of Ed Norton, Bruce Banner has to do is to keep his heart rate to 200 as controlled by the device strapped to his wrist. And for the record, it is extremely difficult to get your heart rate up to 200 even after a very exciting prospect, especially for a physically fit person. <br /> <br /> Emotions drive Hulk Eric Bana in. He suppressed the memory of his mother's death and father's role in his early life. On the surface, he is calm, but down below there is a considerable anger, rage enough to nourish the Hulk when he unleashed. But Hulk never intentionally kills even those who attacked. Basically, he just wants to get away or close to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). It paralyzes its shooters in one critical scene, keeps him from pursuing fighter collision. <br /> <br /> In the 2003 film, visual effects, but as necessary. Scenes (and there are many of them), which are necessary for the story, as opposed to the 2008 film where the action is inserted for the sake of action. <br /> <br /> In an effort to turn it into a "Fugitive" story, Ed Norton loses focus on how Bruce Banner Hulk feels. According to him, Hulk dangerous side effect of the experiment gone awry. And Louis Leterrier, the director picking team Ed Norton can not add any emotional dimension of relations banners-Hulk. History may be expressed as: Banner pursued and Hulk legs example, Banner and pursed hulk kick butt. Repeat as necessary. <br /> <br /> The only thing that went against the 2003 film of the year is that it may not be so true comics like the 2008 version. However, as I am a fan of comics, I would prefer a movie that is not so true comic FanBoy like a dream, but my heart is over-loyal comics, but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any day. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, Ang Lee had to read more comics. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic book roots and has a heart.
