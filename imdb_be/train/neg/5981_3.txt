I just saw this movie (mostly because Corbet in it), and I must say that I was not satisfied. <br /> <br /> Of course, computer graphics was strange, but the story needs a little retouching. In addition, I think that this film would have done much better, with a lot of curses and blood, as well as if it was rated PG-thirteenth <br /> <br /> It will surely attract more people to see it -> teenagers. That would also attract more adolescents (especially adolescent girls), it would be a close-up of Brady Corbet on the poster Thunderbirds! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film was to the point, I have seen so far, and thought it was good!
