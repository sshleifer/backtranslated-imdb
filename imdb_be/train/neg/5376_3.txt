Choke (aka AX in the UK) is a slasher production, presumably as a movie straight-to-DVD. I say "supposedly" because the title of the film does not have "V" in brackets to indicate that it was made for DVD movie (even if it has the appearance of one). <br /> <br /> The plot is simple ?? group holds a concert in a former meat-processing plant, and they are dying one after another. <br /> <br /> I think most would agree that the film would never be a masterpiece, but it does not justify a mistake here. Even straight-to-DVD movies, such as the Bachelor MASSACRE (which has a very low rating IMDb) have many redeeming qualities, and sometimes come off as one of the so-called "so bad they're good" movies. However, the choke significantly behind as serious slasher (e.g., HALLOWEEN) or be "as bad is good" movie (e.g., nail GUN MASSACRE). <br /> <br /> The film really start well with a character is killed using a drill. blood effects were very cheesy, but it is clear, given the very low budget. But from there on, it's downhill all the way. <br /> <br /> There are so many errors in the throttle, I could spend all day talking about them. However, some obvious of them is, and I will go to them. <br /> <br /> The above gig that the band has, it seems to start with about 50 people there, but once the music stops, there seems to be only about 8 people were (and still they are designed for locked in!). <br /> <br /> characters in this film are not pretty at all. Most group members are aggressive swear morons or just downright strange. No one cares about what happens to them, and even their supposed friends forget about them when they were sent. The climax of the film is the presence of a homeless man, who seems to think meat processing plant as a kind of church (seriously!). He spewed some really funny lines for no apparent reason. But, unfortunately, even his presence could not save the film. <br /> <br /> There are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any performance. About 65 minutes of the film is carried out to watch the characters go to talk. Characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation. As in other films straight to DVD, such as crocodile and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time cursing alone aggressively without any provocation whatsoever. There are many over-the-top outbreaks (mainly of male characters) and one almost leads to a full-blown fight. In fact, the format, it can be said, in the following order: the characters go - murder occurs - walking characters - murder occurs. You get the idea. <br /> <br /> Dialogue scary, and it seems that a few lines say not to use the f-word. Perhaps it should have been funny, but it just comes off as boring. And more to the point, we've all seen it done a thousand times before (as a rule, much greater effect). <br /> <br /> The film is completely devoid of any suspense at all. Corpses are designed to provide only a sign that the signs are at risk. Maniac running around loose, and yet the characters just act like complete idiots. They make a few attempts to get out of the plant or find weapons to defend themselves. And most of the time, they do not even pretend to be scared. <br /> <br /> In the same vein as the DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the killer did not see at the time of the murder committed (with the exception of the final murder when the murderer's face is revealed). Random weapons appear out of nowhere to kill the victim in question. There's no one saw annoying characters at any time. The DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, it served to make the movie funny (unintentionally, of course), but here it's not funny. <br /> <br /> And, as another reviewer mentioned, the soundtrack includes music, it's very bad, even for those who love punk rock. Extras look uncomfortable to dance with him. Cost (after all, there is no music in the beginning!) Consists of a strip Sugarbabe imitators singing some very bad song that has nothing to do with the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, the point made in this review. This reviewer likes bad movies (for example, a nail and a bachelor GUN MASSACRE MASSACRE) as much as the classics (such as HALLOWEEN and Friday 13th). But it seems that the throttle trying too hard to fit into one of these categories, do not fit. Even the straight to DVD movies go, this poor effort. <br /> <br /> On a positive note, the film does contain some pretty good bloody murder scene. But when the surviving characters are not taking the situation seriously, these scenes play out quickly as they provide the intensity fades into oblivion. <br /> <br /> Lovers of the traditional 1980s B-movie slashers should take measures to avoid this movie. And fans of the classics, such as HALLOWEEN and Friday the 13th should be doing everything in their power to avoid it!
