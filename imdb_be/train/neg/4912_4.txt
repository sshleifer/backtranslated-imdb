Having not read the novel, I can not say how true this film. The history of a typical material mystery killer targets the young; female researcher falls in love with your partner and with a diagnosis of a fatal disease. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera, and that's exactly the way he plays. The first 2/3 of the blunt, with the exception of murder, and the last 1/3 makes a partial return, as it picks up speed in the direction of its tortuous imprisonment. <br /> <br /> duty due south of the nominal value, although it is difficult to blame the actor alone: ​​the script is atrocious. During the last 1/3 you stop to notice, because the movie really gets interesting, but it's only the last 1/3. Director Mulcahy very much in his element, but only so that he can do with the budget and the TV network censors on his back. He is largely limited to fast cutting and lens distortion, although he managed to squeeze in a couple "under the floor" during the boom in the club toilet murder. Unfortunately, as is done for television, cool Composite parts he uses so well with a wider way nowhere to be found. Note to producers: to give that person a reasonable budget and anamorphic lens, if you hire him <br /> <br /> In summary :. This movie is a bad movie standards and mediocre television standards (see CSI, as well). If you're in the mood for a movie like this, I have some great deals: pick up a copy of Dario Argento «Deep Red» (in my highest recommendation, a great movie), "Opera", or even "Tenebre". They are stronger in each category.
