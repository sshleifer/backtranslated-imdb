Wow. Who said Edward D. Wood Jr. never affect anyone? This steaming pile donkey excrement is a perfect example; this makes «The Violent Years» look like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" also makes the worst memories of Keith Richards look like my first nocturnal emission. I had nightmares, you know, awake and sweating bullets, that will never be close to the visceral horror that Santa Claus is excavated with a seemingly pure soil of my own creatures. However, I can think of some parties, where this film can actually passing well. In addition, if you are looking for an ideal example of the dichotomy Santa Satan on videotape, look no further. Nha check this film, as I was informed MST3K version is now available. Move over Satan's "Santa Claus".
