I noticed all the other reviews of this film is referred to as "useful" and "entertainment" is. These people need to get out of the house more often. I do not know why they're shilling for it boring, tasteless, witless piece of fluff. Pat Boone has absolutely no acting talent at all, and his smile is exceeded only by the fact that his role Pamela Austin, a former model (another reason to prevent the insidious practice of inflicting mediocre models on an unsuspecting public moveiegoing nothing, disgusting habit that unfortunately, persists to this day). Good supporting cast (Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortyon, among others) tries his best to make some sense out of this, but to no avail. I did not notice that the two directors general credit, though "credit" is not the word I would use (neither "Director"). As for the "wholesome entertainment," there are a lot of those types of movies available without the torment of their loved ones, forcing them to sit through it. Find one of these films, and skip this one.
