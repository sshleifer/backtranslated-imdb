I can hardly believe what I saw this time last night, after more than 25 years ... <br /> <br /> Some time ago, I was watching the 6-fu movies in a row ... Boris Karloff, and all 5 Chris Fox. The last 2 Fox and directed (and I use that word loosely) Jess Franco, hateful. At that time, I missed this, bearing in mind that, in some ways, it was even worse. <br /> <br /> Well, I watched it. Never again. You know what's worse is that filthy movie? Really well-made piece of S ***. And this is what a diabolical plot there. This is a very beautiful film. GREAT staging, sets, costumes, music, photography, editing, mostly good throw some decent action ... <br /> <br /> ... and absolutely, positively, one of the worst in the history of movie scripts !! !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of the film is so deceiving ... might confuse it for a decent movie. And then they begin to sing "Happy Birthday Fu ..." and he goes down. With Burt Kwak (of which its owner says, "Your face-- sign.") Incidentally pour elixir vitae Fu to extinguish the fire, as a result he was condemned to torture, burial, and having one of his ears cut off, it was closer just a funny they were. It was like someone decided that they wanted to make a "campyÂ» film-- was so funny to be funny. It's funny, it's ... FUNNY ... it is not. Everyone. <br /> <br /> It's sad, because it is clear in the first few minutes that someone has done a lot of research in a series of Fu Manchu, to get as this "right". On the other script-- a really funny one, or dead serious, they may have-- could have-- MUST have-- been a classic on their hands. The film, which could make one forget the horror of the atrocities, Jess Franco ... instead one wants to unearth them as masterpieces in comparison. <br /> <br /> There was a time in the late '70s, when the whole kill those classic 30's characters were revived in films that were universally awful. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, The Lone Ranger, Charlie Chan, even Doc Savage. I'm not sure this one may be the worst of the lot. It took great self-control to not fast forward through the whole of this section, especially any scenes containing Sid Caesar (FBI chief, who was also cousin-- Al Capone, you see what I mean?). It is not just that the ideas in the movie is not funny ... they often do not make any sense. For example, if they "bugged" by police officers in order to impersonate the king and queen, and we see people start up "wiretapping" dance hall procedures, such as singing, dancing, and riding a unicycle. How many drugs have been the authors of this thing should take for any of this to make sense to them? <br /> <br /> As I said, a real shame ... and all this waste of talent that Peter Sellers including (who played both Fu and Nayland Smith), Bert Kwak (which would have been Chris Li Fu the film at the time), Helen Mirren (police woman, falls in love with the villain shocking and almost steals the last half hour of the film!). I'm beginning to wonder if anyone would EVER do the "right" Fu Manchu film, or if the fans will have to settle Karloff be almost the only one?
