TV movie about the ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20th year, while filming the first version DeMille of the 10 commandments, and who wakes up when DeMille sets are found in the desert. <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> question was serious or joking filmmakers when they made this movie? If this is seriously its ridiculously bad movie and a great film, to select its disrepair. If it is a comedy of her less well, but funny all wrong reasons.You will laugh long and hard this film, probably more than many other "comedies" Hollywood.
