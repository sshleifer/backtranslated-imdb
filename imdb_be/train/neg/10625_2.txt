I am a 11-grader in my high school. In my current class World Affairs child in my class I was offered this video and see. So we did. I firmly believe that we have gone to the moon, that my father was working at NASA. Although I think that this film is the biggest piece of crap I've ever watched, the guy who created it have some serious balls. First of all, it should show JFK getting hit? And how dare he use all these biblical quotations. The only good thing about this film, he ignites a debate, which is good b / c in my class has a weekly debate. This film did not do anything to change your mind. I think he and Michael Moore have to work together and make another movie. Michael Moore's next film could be called "curiosity Happened on Spetember 11," or "A funny thing happened on the way to the White House."
