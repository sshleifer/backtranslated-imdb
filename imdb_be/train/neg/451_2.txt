I do not care how many nominations this stuff was for the best, and that is, this movie stunk. I do not know whether to turn off the set, or to sue a lawyer O.J. for wrongful damage to my mental health. I rarely had this sad; call this litter is a slap in the face of entertainment every movie-goer on the planet. The whole story was silly, action was uninspired, the "drama" was insensitive. I am thankful that I do not have to pay for it unfulfilling experience.
