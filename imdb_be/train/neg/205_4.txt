I jumped at the opportunity to see this film Uncut and smoothly, remembering Rahs and raves for it. But where it seemed to slip to be truly scary, and it seemed to go somewhere else. That the water drips all over the house, a black rain, prophetic dreams, taking a wrong turn into raw sewage were discharged before they could work to a shout. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. almost impenetrable mask Chamberlain individuals offered little but a vague distrust, something I found, reflecting, as the movie wore on. instead, that would be a terrible Aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were a cacophony of seemingly designed to strike fear into the head. The idea that modern humans may represent ancient god that natives believe haired white people were the first priests, and many other features are transmitted along a shopping list than a hint of another dimension (dream time). <, Br /> <br /> [SPOILER] in the final scene, it was not clear to me that the director is trying to say. There is a big wave? So what? How big? Tsunami? Yes, all right. This is devastating, but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world? From the waves? The last wave? It would have to be a hell of a big wave. Why? Was the world that a bad place? It did not seem so bad in this film. In fact, I do not think that the wave is gone, because the shadow left face Burton, who was thrown wave. Was it only the apocalypse Burton? Heck, that happens every day to people who lose it. It had no interest in, when it was just him. <br /> <br /> The most frightening scene, and one that gives a better idea of ​​the potential of Weir, I was in Charlie's apartment, where Barton went to confront the old man to scare the wife of Burton. Charlie continued to ask him, "Who are you?" And it gets really disturbing after a while. Unfortunately, the film did not do the same.
