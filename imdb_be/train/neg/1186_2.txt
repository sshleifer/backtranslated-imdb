Walerian Borowczyks La Bete (1975), obviously, was different: some were shocked, some were shocked others applauded the courage. I, however, I completely intact, boring and not stop asking myself why the display incoherent, inconsistent images that clearly orbit around the central themes are considered an intelligent way. <br /> <br /> What this movie really about? Which is a sexy woman? I have seen great movies on the subject, but this is not one of them. How can I try to portray sexuality growing girl without at least trying to characterize it as a man, not only as a narrative device to sleep (in the nude) animals. Where there are no signs, no character study. Woman chased the beast is not the teenager, girl sex with black butler (he is also described as an animal?) Has really grown up attitude to sexuality, so where is the consistency? This is a film about religion? If so, we would have a little more thematic material than a priest without a function, character and charisma, but with a strong desire to two young boy. <br /> <br /> it's about bestiality? The metaphorical sense of the film prevents any realistic consideration of bestiality, especially realistic examination requires realistic characters. So no real bestiality here. Some mythical beast, two priests said to one another about the sin of bestiality. Enough for a college essay? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This is about sex? It's about something? I do not know. I only know that the show fired the gun does not make the film a war movie. Working with the theme must mean something more than reflecting their own associations with the theme. <br /> <br /> So look through contradiction. It does not scare bestiality, poverty, ejaculation, masturbation and more. I do not. Look at it as you are looking at some other stories, and you may find that it is poorly done, poorly edited, acted badly, really badly written (well, some pictures are pretty good, and the protagonist is very good looking girl ) cerebral masturbation director who thinks that treading in a hypnotic slow way to make history intelligent. It does not. This makes it boring.
