I wondered why John Wood plays the Falken doctor, until I saw the movie. BAD plot, bad science, bad acting, and generally a bad film. Please do not watch this movie. Rent the original «War Games», if you feel nostalgic. <br /> <br /> I did not want to bend the plot to beat the terrorist threat to the very idea of ​​anything. In the first film W.O.P.R was built, because in the 1000s Russian warheads pointed at the U.S.A. In this film, the idea of ​​the computer was to kill the terrorist in training before they pose a threat. Politics aside, one of the nice things about the first film was illuminated, even the stupid computer can understand the idea of ​​the senselessness of the war in the end. There is no such enlightenment is offered in this film.
