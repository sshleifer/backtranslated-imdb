I have not seen anyone Slate this film and I think I may be the first. <br /> <br /> It was awful. I actually did not watch the end. It was like a sad soap or really good (all soap shit). Actors were poor and the plot was bad. A man who appreciated his no 10/10 idea that he is on about. The script was terrible. 2 people was malicious talk with the participation of the threat and you expect a nice guy, to say a few things really well and beat the crap out of him, but no. He says, "If you do this ... I'm going to hurt youÂ» Hahahahaha. If comedy is your thing, look away. Please do not see this film because ... this shit !!! <br /> <br /> BRIEF DESCRIPTION :. Poor acting, bad fights, bad script <br /> <br /> I do not watch! Of course, this in my opinion.
