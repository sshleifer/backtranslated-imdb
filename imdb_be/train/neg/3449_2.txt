Fortunately, there is a video of this wannabe western that sit on the floating car Big Frank at the time when his career was hanging. History of grace, who lives on the reputation of his older brother who gets the gun and run away from the bad guys just go back to the rally townfolks with new found courage had written backroom writer. In general, this show stinks. The story is mostly sad, ill-conceived and so naive that it may offend your intelligence. I have to go in sets another reviewer, who found that "... underrated ..." criticism closed it at the time, and deservedly so. You have to catch it at the last show, if you are late and having a bout of insomnia. But if you can sit through it, you have more fortitude than most of my friends movie lovers.
