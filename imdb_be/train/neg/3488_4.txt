Question: how bourgeois director of treatment of a subject like immigration? A:., Turning it into an existential alienation parable <br /> <br /> Yes, we are still in the early '90s, just after the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the subsequent flooding of immigrants in the European Union, the best way to deal with the subject, you make a movie about existentially alienated middle-class journalist, existential estrangement top class politician, his existential estrangement rich wife, and so on. <br /> <br /> against the background of immigrants seeking asylum in an unnamed village near the Greek borders. I think that the way Angelopoulos can show a social consciousness, while dealing with existential muddy upper classes. I mean, to be honest, the scene where a high-ranking army officer cursed his fate because he sent his daughter to study in London are enough to make you puke. <br /> <br /> In any case, it can not be that bad, Angelopoulos is a master of cinematic art in the end, is not it? Wrong. It was at this moment when his manner of starting to become too artificial, such as how to filter the image in Photoshop. His usual tricks to show: is blurred windows, blurred lights, strange wedding, walk along the river-shore, and people with yellow coat with water. Mastroianni also opens up new horizons for the majority of sleepwalking performance ever. Avoid accurately. Go to his earlier films.
