This film should never have been made. <br /> <br /> What a shame budget. <br /> <br /> Please hire a convincing actors, and make the right movie. Very thin and flimsy story line. Almost cheerful, and it is a shame for militants .... <br /> <br /> Of course, not worth watching. <br /> <br /> They keep replaying the same "shot" Stealth aircraft flew away. You've seen those, and that it is not necessary to re-run 3 or 4 times. <br /> <br /> It's time to get away from Steven Seagal movie making. <br /> <br /> His films are worser every time. <br /> <br /> Black Dawn, and shipped already bad, but this film is even worse.
