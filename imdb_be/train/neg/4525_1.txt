Some nice scenery, but the story itself - in which the self-proclaimed Egyptologist (Lesley-Anne Down) is visiting Egypt, and in the course of things in the most Egyptologist nya-Egyptologistic ways (for example, a flash in the graves !, Processing of old parchment, etc. .), open the black market turf war and any way (in two days, no less) it becomes that the war in overalls wearing epicenter - no more mysterious than any riddle of the sphinx ever created Down just awful, visiting British scientist (she does not seem to know ab yutna nothing about the culture of Egypt and even less about ancient times through the fault of the authors, of course, but that she was annoying as all get out her wine in full) and other actors, including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, seems like quite confused proceedings like me. In short, not what you would expect from Schaffner (Planet of the Apes, Patton) and co. <br /> <br /> If you look at a ridiculously dated a scene in which down rails against all men scientists, accusing them of its failure as a scientist, while bathed Hollywood could muster under the soft light. To top it off, she spends the next hour of the film screaming and harried and running into the arms of any guy she can find. Wow, talk about your creative irony <br /> <br /> * Note to potential Egyptologists: take a year or two of the Arabic language in grad school. This will really help in the long run ...
