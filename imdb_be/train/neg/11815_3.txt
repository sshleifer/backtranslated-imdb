In under a minute, he is packed off to Morrocco, where he lives a double life as a Red Shadow; leader of the Arab tribe that wanted to sing than fight. <br /> <br /> Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare have excellent operetta voice (with a bit of acting ability) and has a decent bass there as well, but the acting is so random scenes are so poorly prepared, you get the feeling they do things, as they go along. <br /> <br /> This is a two reel was part of a major stage of production, in which six authors are listed. With plenty of room to forge and trill show, we may have had some entertainment value, but it rushed cursory little more than an insult to the audience, waiting for an artistic representation.
