This is one of the worst films I have ever seen it is very sad with a lot of boring dialogue and has some very annoying and ridiculous character that looks like a creature. The only reason why I watched this piece of garbage, because it is in this set of 8 CDs horror I got. The plot is absurd and utterly stupid as final. No blood, so ever, except for a few traces of blood on the creature, and a pair of bloody gunshot wounds. Acting HORRIBLE !!. Richard Cardella terrible sheriff, and it was pretty funny, plus his character is annoying. Glen Roberts is a comic and not funny. Marc Siegel is very annoying and also not FUNNY!. Bob Hyman is a decent, but not much more than that. Richard Harrison annoying and there was no chemistry with Casey Cobb, what so ever. Kacey Cobb so well here, and there was no chemistry with Richard. In general, avoid this piece of garbage at all costs! Bomb 5.
