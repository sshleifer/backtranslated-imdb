Gruner completely unknown to me. My friend showed me this movie, because he saw Gruner in what he described as a pretty good science fiction movie, Nemesis. So we watched it, we discovered, fastforwarding through the drama of the BS to get to the incredible sequence of actions. Gruner likes to kick and punch and kick. And kick! huh <br /> <br /> Gruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in the ghetto, beside the fact that he grew up. He finds himself watching the boy, who lives with him, because he really wants to join in the Mexican gangs that keeps tormenting his family. Instead of joining up, Gruner says the boy, to fight (against gang? Too crazy). Gruner plays the typical character of Van Damme, who kills everyone (or maim them rather badly) and is working to take his block these gangmembers. <br /> <br /> The plot was very cheesy and easily come up with. Gruner, probably not very well known in his script-selected when this film is something to compare options with. This ghetto hell, and I enjoyed seeing the colorful character to pass through it as if they have a chance against nature in Gruner. Music was a typical action music (piano and drums beating, swelling guitar), which is not really as bad as I make it sound. The director is really necessary to keep the action going, instead of taking a break every 5 minutes of intense family time. <br /> <br /> In the end, I gave it a 4/10 because actually trying to be an average fighter for Gruner star in, but the overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more closure on what you have just they saw.
