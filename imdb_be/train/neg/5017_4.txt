Just finished this film ... I saw it on video shelves and being a fan of Nick Stahl, I just had to rent it. Frankly, it probably should have stayed on the shelf. The concept was interesting and there were some pretty clever twists and turns, but once I realized, almost all of them, before they came together. And the film just went a little too far in the end, in my opinion ... if you have to suffer through watching this you will see what I mean! <br /> <br /> On a positive note, Nick Stahl acting was great (especially considering that it should work). Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good, but he always plays the same type of character ... too many Paul Finch from "American Pie," which runs through my taste. <br /> <br /> And finally, the worst thing of this film should be indifferent performance January Jones ... I believe that a beautiful face is really all that matters in Hollywood.
