I bought the DVD of this film for my friend who shares the same name as the ghost of a girl in this movie and loves films about paranormal phenomena. The film was shot entirely on video, so it has an external appearance PBS special about it. Special Effects false appearance, but in fact some strange moments in the film that got us jump in our seats. There is a particularly effective fright with the statue of the Virgin Mary. <br /> <br /> However, the acting is bad, "plot" scenes are long and very sad, and I'll tell you that I have no idea what happened in the end. If you get a movie, rent it if you buy it, please make sure that you pay less than $ 5.
