Above, it seemed much more appropriate name, when I and my suicidal attendants decided to see this masterpiece of modern garbage <br /> <br /> Erotic, Scary, tense, thoughtful, all these things, this movie can not be. <br /> <br /> This, however, is incredibly funny, slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to it to make one of the greatest comedies I've seen in recent years. And yet, this film does not try to be funny, and it's one of the movies, the grand achievements, it is a comedy without even trying to cheer. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the old guy who looks remarkably like Santa Claus goes around the plowing of the zombies and vampire crashing into the ground. It made me not believe the film's title, if Vampires vs. Zombies why vampires and zombies do not fight? Well, whatever, moreover, were more disadvantages of the lease than the title. Such as this one; there was a virus sweeping through the creation of zombies America as beings who go around acting a lot like your average tourist. And yet, there are only four zombies in the whole film. Another problem is, except for one shop everywhere deserted. Of course, you would have seen the zombies wandering around in the woods or in the background a little. In fact, I think they just went in a circle of the forest again and again, because they do not have a high enough budget for a film in a larger place as the director does not want to waste your precious time on the shoot in different parts of the forest, he was busy sitting in the trailer jerked to bother with such trifles. <br /> <br /> actually the director had so much fun doing it that he did not have enough time to hire a big enough roll or editor. He said eight cast members dress up as different people and try not to act inconspicuous, while I believe that he has changed his name and became randomly cut off in the film reel "editing is not difficult to work one way or another is not it?" the only reason why this "film" found it's way into our bag was because somehow we got it confused with Freddy vs. Jason, it's amazing how these things are going wrong. And the only way that we did it, though the night was strapping gas masks, and bolted them, our skull, to avoid the stench of this sickening mess. <br /> <br /> Oh, we do not laugh at the end, but I'm sure that one does that a lot, when he lost his mind .................. .
