* The review may contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a TV-movie feel to it. the idea of ​​the UN as taken over Satan interesting twist to the end of the world according to the Bible. premise is interesting, but it excution Waaaay falls short. if you want to convert people to Christianity with a film like this, at least make it a quality one! I was seriously checked his watch, watching this part of dreck. I can not say more about this film, because I've seen it more than a year ago, and there is not really much to say about this movie, except ..... miss it!
