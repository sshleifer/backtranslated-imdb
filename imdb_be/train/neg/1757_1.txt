Do not get me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great skater. If there was one guy who deserved the gold medal at the Olympics he was given. <br /> <br /> But how can it be possible that Bill Corcoran made a bad movie about the incredible history of Dan Jansen, because the real Dan Jansen Story is really incredible! Especially when you look at the film through the eyes of an athlete, it's not as Kislar and other actors ride their advice, size Speedskating oval, it's all wrong! <br /> <br /> ashamed, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves better, much better! <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
