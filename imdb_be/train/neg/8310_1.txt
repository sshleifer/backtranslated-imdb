Another wide conspiracy film that tries to blame the US government and the armed forces (especially the military) for each disaster since the Great Flood. Anyone who has ever served time in the US Army can see how bogus this film. Uniforms, equipment, accessories and mannerisms all wrong. (And, of course, all senior officials or corrupt criminals or idiots.) Sincere propaganda Do not attempt to objectivity. Most of the theories presented has been challenged over the last few years. It uses all the clich√©s, "hearing, and Urban Legend from the Gulf, they are presented in the Gospel. (However, no one knows for sure why some vets GW patients and other healthy as a horse.) PS This is not new. War is not fun, and I know the Second World War, the Korean and Vietnam vets with some pretty serious diseases too. (The government is responsible to take care of all of them.) The sensational film like this does not solve the problem!
