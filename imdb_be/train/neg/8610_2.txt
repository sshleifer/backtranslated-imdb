As much as I love Rodney Dangerfield, it was a terrible movie. The site was a holistic view of a rip off from different movies, but, unfortunately, they forgot to foil any good jokes. In addition, it was annoying and boring, and this is his race. If you are looking for a good laugh, make a copy of Private Parts.
