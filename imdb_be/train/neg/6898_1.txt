Avoid this crap any price. Bad script, bad directing, bad acting, bad editing, bad sound and bad music. Get the idea? This film tries to be a western-flavored, it is not. It tries to be a hard core of violent, it is not. He is trying to take a fresh look at an old genre, it is not. Actors trying there best, and my heart goes out to them. But with such a meaningless material to work with it is difficult to make something shine. For me, it has all the views of the "Fresh Outta film school is going to set the world on fire" on the first try. Freshmen filmmakers often bite off more than they, or their budget, can chew. The best thing they can do is take a few steps back, reconsider what is possible, and to work within their limited budget for the next timeout.
