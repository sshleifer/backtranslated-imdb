I bought this DVD, because it has a crust in it and MPAA ratings said; «Rated R for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language» <br /> <br /> which is correct, IMO, should be stated. «Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language." <br /> <br /> word "sexuality" should come after "comma" instead of "and" because of the huge difference in meaning to do so. I think a lot of people who have seen the movie, you will agree with me that sexuality and nudity of the virtually non-existent. My first impression when I look at the MPAA rating was that I watch something like "bright" movie. so I felt cheated. Story-wise, it was so, after all who really cares about the history, when the crust was great in it. I know that there is. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is just my opinion. <br /> <br /> Joseph
