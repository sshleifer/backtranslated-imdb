Just as in recent years the event WWE New Years Revolution 2006 was headlined by a match Elimination Chamber. The difference between previous years and this year the match, however, was the entertainment value. In fact, only three people stood a chance leaving the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York, with the championship WWE. These people were the reigning champion John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. There was no way, Vinnie Mac would put a belt on any of the recruits; Carlito and Chris Masters. A Kane? Kane was the last time the WWE Championship was held in June 1998, and it was only for one night. It was obvious that he was not going to be one either. In recent years, the match was a thrilling affair with six of the best WWE had to offer. 2006 was a predictable and frustrating business, but still of the night match today. <br /> <br /> The only surprise of the evening came after the bell to work for the main event. Since he walked Vince McMahon and asked them to pick up the camera. It was then announced that the Region was profiting from his money in the championship match jars right there and then. Not having time to prepare, and in close proximity to the back of winning the Elimination Chamber Match John Cena could not stand a chance and dropped the title after the spear to one of the most interesting of heels in the WWE. It was the only piece of entertainment activities happened all night. <br /> <br /> On the undercard, as well as last year, it was really brutal. Triple H and The Big Show put on snoring festival that made me go all out to stay away. HHH took the win, but it was never in any real doubt about it? Any per-view, which has both Jerry Lawler and internal struggle on one card will never have any chance of becoming successful in fact it does. King pinned Helms (who books this stuff?) And Big Vis taste defeat against unused Shelton Benjamin with a little help from his mom. <br /> <br /> The women in the WWE was also busy at night. Diva was the usual nonsense from the Gauntlet match bra and panties Ashley won the women's championship, and was also on the line. In the game, I thought that would be left to cook until WrestleMania 22 Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good match. Trichet has won the competition, but it was evident that this will continue for the foreseeable future. <br /> <br /> The contest pits opening night will soon be WWE Champion edge against the champion Intercontinental, Ric Flair. It might be better, but it was broken and bloody The Flair, which remains after the finish of the disqualification. Edge obviously had bigger fish to fry. <br /> <br /> So New Year's Revolution began in 2006 payment for a calendar view in a catastrophic way. The only good thing from knowing that wrestling is the only way up. They are not much worse than that.
