I saw this movie at the Film Festival in New York City Gay & Lesbian Film and thought it was very bad. The first and most distracting was the way a lot of it was shot; that is, a lot of slow motion and overly artistic close-ups that did not seem to make any sense - story of the wise and aesthetically pleasing - but to show the skills of cinematographer (who I believe was also the director). This film, it seemed that a pretentious student film will come up. Lead actor (Sam Levine) was certainly very nice, but was a mediocre actor at best; and the rest of the cast ranged from so-so bad. The story itself was basically annoyingly predictable. I must admit that most of the audience seemed to enjoy the film; laughing and sighing constantly, but I did not like it very much.
