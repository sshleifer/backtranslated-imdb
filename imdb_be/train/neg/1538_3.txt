What a shame, really competent director, Andre de Toth, who specializes in the slippery, shifting alliances not to profit by this concept first. It could help to identify the real potential, especially with interesting character played by William Bishop. As can be seen the film, it's pretty much clutter (as claimed by the reviewer Chipe). The main problems with the direction, cheap budget, and a bad scenario. The strength of the cast is excellent and interesting general concept-- characters are pulling in different directions of conflicting forces. It was necessary to someone with enough vision to bring together the positive elements by alteration of the scenario in some coherent whole, rather than sprawling, clumsy mess that (try to find out the motives and the interaction, if you can). In addition, a larger budget could coincide contrasting location and studio shooting, and gained seats, while spending all too apparent around Los Angeles. The real shame is a great waste of cast-- Hayden, Taylor (to his teeth were limited), Diener, Reeves, with Millican James and William Bishop shortly before their untimely death. Few films illustrate the importance of the vision of a filmmaker-to-baser inarticulate West, which, in the right hands, could be much more.
