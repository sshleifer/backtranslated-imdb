Two years ago, he wrote, and "Arthur", Steve Gordon had a minor hit with his script for this abnormal comedy vehicle for Henry Winkler, then TV «The Fonz». Tragedians 1950s college (and all-around jerk) looks after co-ed and marries without any employment prospects on the horizon; to make ends meet, he turns into a bright world of the struggle, in the end, it becomes «Gorgeous George» -like celebrity. The transformation of the pretty disgusting Winkler in Loha-off, probably sounds like a great idea at the time (and a sure way to separate it from the television alter-ego), but the joke and the situation is often wrong and mean, put a rather sloppy director Carl Reiner. Especially crude is grimacing a bit with Erwan Vilsheza (from "Fantasy Island") by putting stroke on Polly Holliday (FLO with "Alice"). Henry beloved, Kim Darby looks a little out of her element - particularly when surrounded by all these television hams - rendering romance aspect nonessential scenario. * 1/2 ****
