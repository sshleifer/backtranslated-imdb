CQ incredibly slow and I'm a fan of David Mamet. The film is worth around a young film director who makes very Barbarella-esque film. After the movie started to lose me. Deeper and deeper? Not really. The film "Dragonfly" made in the CQ has a problem, who do not have the ending. This greatly parallels CQ, which also lacks the ending (in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I was lucky enough to catch this film at the festival SxSW film. I have pretty high expectations, just looked Y Tu Mamá También and several other big films. I am also looking forward to the performances of Jason Schwartzman. But it was not an easy film to get. If you are not in the '60s sci-fi movie or slow, which is not going no where, skip it. <br /> <br /> CQ feels like a student film. If you want the recent sci-fi-esque indie film Donnie Darko rent, he will not put you to sleep.
