It may very well be the worst film I'll see if I live to be 100. I think that the group of first-graders could come up with the best story lines, as a class project than that. I am dumber for having watched it, and God will have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film. <br /> <br /> And when I finally turned it off, I actually had a desire to vomit. <, Br /> <br /> No one had a clue about photography when he made it. Nobody had a clue about the action. No one had a clue about anything. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that the F / X shows this crap about. The only time I saw it on one of the Starz! Channels - not even the main one. And this was at about 3:00 am in this.
