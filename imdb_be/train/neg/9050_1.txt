I saw this film in its entirety in the 1960s and 70s, but it's disgusting, and may be the ancestor of the series "Faces of Death" popular in the 80s and 90s. Given the state of the so-called "driver training" these days, this one is worth watching for all demand training to learn to drive. If you see a violent death in all its horror and blood baked, of course you (if you have are any or sensibility in general) get the perspective of the true liability for the safe management than an instant thoughtlessness or carelessness behind the wheel can do. I worked at Bell Telephone in the 70s and 80s, and at some point was assigned to safety class . I found the fi LM in the company library, said at the session, the number of people physically sick and had to leave the room incredible, but most of them later said, "I am never knew that a traffic accident can be so scary," This film and the other, "RED asphalt" is certainly true in the graphical form. I will never forget, I just wish I could find a copy, when my children were Treating "edited driver" in high school!
