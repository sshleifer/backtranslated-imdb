I totally agree with other viewers of this wretched film. The only reason why I did not evaluate its 1 for awful was due to the great talent of Carmen Miranda. The beginning and end are better parents because of her talented singing and dancing. <br /> <br /> The problem with the rest of the picture. Alice Faye comes off pretty flame. Don Ameche has a great singing voice, but with a pathetic writing material, it comes off so terribly banal. <br /> <br /> The story real hard here Ameche judging two parts as a song and dance man, and the Baron is not happily married to Faye. <br /> <br /> I think that playing a song and dance man, marriage Ameche gets a second change to ignite again. Some silly nonsense about Baron in order to clarify the matter and to be away allows him to play two parts. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakal is given little to do here, and so his comic gifts are not given the opportunity to express themselves. The same applies to J. Carrol Naish, which actually turns out to be uncomfortable in his role. <br /> <br /> This chica chica boom bomb movie.
