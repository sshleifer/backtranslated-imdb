I'm getting a little tired of people misusing God's name, to perpetuate their own fanatical view of the world. Well, I do not reject the idea of ​​Armageddon, or the coming of the Antichrist, I reject the idea that only a few people who live a really good life (they seem to be mostly white Christian children) will go to heaven, while the rest of the we have to suffer through the Millennium hell on earth, just because we were not good enough. God can be the judge, but I do not think he's going to measure every level of kindness. Give some credit Creator.
