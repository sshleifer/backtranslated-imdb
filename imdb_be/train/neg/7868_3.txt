I have seen many Maddin films and liked most of them, but this one literally gave me a headache. editing by John Gurdebeke is too obsessed, and also the sequence of the tour de force, showing a line head snapping to look at one object, do nothing but hinder the ability of actors to communicate with the audience. <br /> <br /> Another thing I liked about this movie was that it seemed to be more rigid than earlier work in Maddin - though his films have always been dark elements, sympathy characters give the movie primary sense of humanity . This one was more like being rude for the sake of rigor. <br /> <br /> How do I add a few lines of text before the IMDb take my review, I will mention that the actor playing "Maddin" makes managing ape his face pretty good.
