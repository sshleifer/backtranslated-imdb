It is 1919 and one thousand nine hundred thirty-three Germany looks unlikely, after the Second World War, the Czech capital. Oh sorry, this is the Czech capital, and this 2003 as the ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies of the history in the recent past. Rem is a head higher than Adolf and looks so damn good, Goering looks like 40 when he was just 23 and "FÃ¼hrer" always seem like 56. And the building, people, even buildings were young, sometimes. Especially in 1919 there were many houses in Germany almost new (World War I does not reach the German cities!). Many crumbling plaster! Then Reichstagsbuilding. There has never been urban canyons around this building, ever. And it may seem to you all as a miracle: this year 1933 the fire brigade Greater Berlin has a lot of cars with engines, some even with a rotating platform stairs, but not with a hand pump <br /> <br /> One. And finally: What PLAYMOBIL Castle was in this final sequence? For me it was a kind of "Adventures in Wonderland Adolf"
