I rented this movie tonight, because it looked like a fun movie. I thought that you really can not go wrong with the concept of Ex Girlfriend with superpowers. <br /> <br /> ... but the film was confused and meaningless ... <br /> <br /> it seemed that every step of the writer continued to throw garbage. Also, the writer continued to throw in too much toilet humor and sexual situations that you may love only a teenager. <br /> <br /> it seems that it could be so simple to make history with Fatal Attraction super hero .. but I do not think so. <br /> <br /> This is not a fun romantic comedy was advertised to be. You could not take the baby to see it, and you would be embarrassed to see his date. <br /> <br /> If a writer could make a major story about the high concept and clean it - the film may have a chance. <br /> <br /> A serious waste of time. <br /> <br /> In
