I have a `guts to tell you, please stay away from` Dahmer", a biographical film based on the true story of a serial killer grotesque. `Taps Dahmer" is more in relation to the mentality of its focused subject. Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed more than 15 young men and ate some of their body parts, probably the most ridiculous serial killer of our generation. However, the real people who are sick are the filmmakers of this terrible spectacle, which should have their heads examined before the green light this terrible project `DahmÂ». This is not an easy film to digest, but Jeffrey could easily digested his snack of some fiery `brainsadillas' or even any real zhizni` Mr. Potato skins. * Disclaimer
