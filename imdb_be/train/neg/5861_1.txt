I saw this film when it first came out in 1978, when I was a sophomore in high school. I took a date to view it. I do not "get some," it goes without saying, because the movie was so bad! Career Joan Rivers' never tanked as much as he deserved after making this horrible shit laughing. In fact, not serious enough unfunny term: this film ANTI-FUNNY! You leave feeling like any laughter that might have occurred beaten out of you before this could happen. It is not worth watching out of curiosity, or because of any feelings that be "that bad-is-good." I do not gang MST3K could make it worth a look! The fact that the career of Billy Crystal has survived this early attempt suicide miracle.
