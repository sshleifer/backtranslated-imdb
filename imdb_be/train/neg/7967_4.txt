I could not be a huge fan of the original «Creepshow», but his stuff continued doing this ontology to look perfect! And to think that I was going into this expecting to like it more than one. Five years later, after his predecessor, George Romero is back on board EC Comic style trail and picnic on this pen the script for three stories of Stephen King. Although the direction is transmitted from Michael Gornick. The film largely varies in this aspect with rough brushes on Gornick. But much of the blame will have to go to the static and terribly unbearable crawl the script Romero (especially in those dialogues, penetrating through the first and the last story). Moralistic messages (which came from the mostly acidic heap characters) just took black humor. Oh, it hurt, and the same can be said about the living rotten score that accompanies the picture. Loosely connect the three tales of (Old Chief fool raft and hitchhiking) with mildly curious and effective history of the wrapping done in nostalgia (80), the form of animation. I rather liked the segment and joker Creep character was illuminated with light. <br /> <br /> # The first story, "Old fool head" sees two elderly owners (George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour) from a shared repository in the dying native community, Dead River. Robbed and eventually killed a couple of punks die to live in Hollywood. In front of the store there is a wooden statue of an Indian chief, who comes to live to avenge their deaths. <br /> <br /> Listen, George Kennedy waffles .. and assure for 10 minutes about how he tends to its "big" society. What a nice touchy feely time. Well, just as we Kennedy is one monotonous and colorless exaggerated element that never makes good thin premise. Imperious scenario simply senseless and performance accordingly so. These two factors really added to my headache. If the Indian come to life and becomes an avenger, the thugs respond very quickly (though horrible) death properly. The effects were done commendable, but what about that free-flowing hair. How Hollywood could knock on that strand of hair back? Ugh! <br /> <br /> # The second story, "The Raft" is a group of spinning smoke and Yahoo teenagers heading to the isolated lake. After swimming on a raft in the middle of the lake, they fall into a trap on the platform because that looks sinister creature lurking in the water. <br /> <br /> -Now it's much better, much better. What begins as a launch your basic teen broke mysteriously turns into a terrible setting, full of yearning and claustrophobic tension. And it's not even a cop flashes of nudity or hardcore splatter. It is very painful and it should be for his sense of humor, too. Surprisingly ironic end has excellent touch thereto. Presentation of insignificance are acceptable without making a huge mark. Gornick direction to adhere to the opposite side and rather sticky. At that time, disturbing music score on this occasion pressed the right chords. The sludge-like creature in the lake (as many have already mentioned) looks unsightly black tarp (yes you read that right!) That float on the water. <br /> <br /> # Finally, number three ends "Hitchhiking". Rich but not enough sexy woman on her way home after her male gigolo, but she works late. I am thinking about some of the ideas to explain its delay, if necessary, she slips off the road and hit it accidentally hitchhiking. Instead, to check or to get help, she leaves hoping to get home before her husband. Quite quickly it terrorizes the mutilated corpse of a dead companion. <br /> <br /> cent awful, but I do not really get into this ridiculously absurd exercise at all. Compared with the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to tickle the funny bone instead. Chiles was well in the lead role, but the constant uveesya and small conversation she has with him began to plaintively just tired and aggravated. Bright make-up effects are well displayed and dripping with vision. If she hit hitchhiking is that when he gets restless, cheese and over-the-top in his performance. From there on, we hear endlessly our supposedly dead Hitchhiker repeat and repeat ?? and repeat the line, "Thank you for a trip lady!" It happens every time she decides to run away with him. There is little affection for the dead road. <br /> <br /> In general, the second novel "The Raft" and unpleasant, well-designed effects is that it raises the extremely inferior sequel.
