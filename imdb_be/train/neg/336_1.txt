Why is it that when a star reaches the top of the chain of stars, they destroy all the good work by making a bad film? Burt Reynolds was at its peak, and then began to do terrible Hal Needham car chase clicks. Arnold Schwarzenegger became the hottest property in Hollywood, only invite ridicule over the terrible Last Action Hero. And here, talkative Eddie Murphy erases the memories of trading places and 48 hours with this "family" adventure, which is an incredibly tedious, child and all the usual horrible misfire in which the chance to see a great big chest of Charlotte Lewis in a tight blouse most attractive aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> stories purely philistine. This applies to social workers Murphy, linked to the mysterious types, and said that he has been elected. Chosen for what, I hear you ask. His job is to save the Tibetan boy with mystical powers of the race of demons who want to rule the world. As the chief demon, cool actor Charles Dance looks terrible shame to be in the movie, but hey, I'm sure he was well paid for donating their talents. All of Murphy's films, this is easily the worst. I've read some reviews that suggest that it is good to see Murphy in atypical roles, not a template as a film, and while both terms loosely there is no truth to forgive the fact that the film - but not atypical, and it may be a template - it's an absolute load of rubbish <br /> <br />.
