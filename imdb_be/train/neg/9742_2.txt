This is a rather dull film about the scientist who creates a teleportation device and gets horribly disfigured, if he uses the machine to transport themselves. Simple plot is made earlier in the process and others. Not only that, it gets mangled, but it can also be an electric current with a touch people. What really dumb about this film is that we have to believe the place is this guy running against him. He could probably make millions for the institution that he is working on, but the head of an institution trying to sabotage its teleport in every step of the way. At the end of the projected person electrocutes three people for no reason, it is necessary for those who have wronged him.
