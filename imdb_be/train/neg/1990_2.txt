This can be a strong candidate for «The Worst Flick Ever». Perhaps without the presence of John Hurt, this can be tolerated, like a kid movie. But the tragedy of all this activity is the fact that John Hurt, one of the greatest screen actor, belittle yourself in this .... I gave him two points only because Mr. Hurt showed up ... I'm taking 8 points, because he did not run away fast enough. As for the other actors, they're just awful. Janine Turner, as good as it could have been, can not act to save his soul. And the leading actor, for all intents and purposes, HORRIBLE. If you can save yourself the embarrassment, please do so. It's so bad it's almost painful.
