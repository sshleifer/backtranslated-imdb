This is the only the worst movie I have ever seen. I can not express how bad it is. I honestly wanted to kill himself several times through this horrible experience just to have an end to the pain. I recommend that instead of seeing this film, you bathe in acid, then you at least know the proportion of pain without any scarring. <br /> <br /> I had such high hopes when I read the back of the DVD case, and if at the beginning he said that Jesus went to them, I was so excited ... then in the end, I I wanted to kill himself. I mean, twenty-three minute introduction to the most annoying characters in film history ... just sick! Monkeys could do a better job of editing this collection. At least, they would throw feces and smeared some of the debris. This would make a better, if not seen a horror. <br /> <br /> It was not that I did not get the joke, is that they are not only not funny, they repeated as twenty times. Apparently, that is not funny if you do not see it like a million times. <br /> <br /> Or, under any circumstances, not to see. People appreciated Â«Manos the hands of fate" as the worlds worst film. I saw that too, and I agree that it is bad ... but alas, it is only the second worst. "Thick passing bus" is much worse. <br /> <br /> It deserves such a harsh language, but I can not write, it's so easy to think that I swore a whole bunch.
