not ashamed of it. There are many things wrong with this film. This clichéd all the way, is not very funny, predictable and illogical. Let's start from the beginning: the characters. There's a long-winded, the hapless man - giving Stiller another notch in his sad, hapless guy belts - supposedly wild, but really just a fairly ordinary, the love interest - whom Aniston plays well, but do not really need any effort to do it - fat, jovial one, and then the range of clichés: irritating Australian daredevil guy, I'm sure the guy Spanish, etc. storyline: the beginning of a bit unusual, but then goes into any standard movie-style, with every plot turn in your average predictable knock-knock joke. The biggest problem is that the "development" character Stiller really seemed out of nothing - as well as high school games, the authors know where it started and where it ended, but did not put enough reserves to right to say middle bit. Finally, the supposed "joke" was nothing but a very diluted version of the standard gross-out humor; regulation were chunder scene sweaty fat men, etc. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the simple fact about this film is that the study of the meaning of the word «Shart» was the only good thing. Hamburg is really a concave dog lunch here, and sugar coating of Stiller and Aniston may have lured the audience, but left at the end tasted like rancid <br /> <br /> One last note :. This film could have been awful, but Aniston still better to chose between girlfriends seasons Kudrow film than in the notorious "Marci X.»
