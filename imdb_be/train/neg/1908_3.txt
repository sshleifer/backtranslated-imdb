Another insult and slap in the face for gays worldwide. This is a lame attempt at comedy has nothing to recommend it. Once again we have an attractive "direct" character who supposedly can not get any woman to be interested in him. Yeah, right! And we are also represented in "pretty attractive" gay friend who is actually a fat, bald, ugly old, whose leader should find attractive. Even I did not find him attractive, and I'm fat, ugly old gay (but, fortunately, not balding)! Regardless of acting talent can be here was thrown at bad script, and really terrible direction. Mr. Sneedeker filmdom should be banned, but it is no different than the countless other oddities that work in Hollyweed.
