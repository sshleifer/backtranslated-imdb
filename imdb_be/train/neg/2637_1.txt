It's like someone gave the budget dollar bazillion autistic third grader and said, "Make me a movie about the Secret Service Edit funny, film was random at best, each dialogue style was very backward and direction ... well, there was even a director there. ? Everything was just so pointless and lame and pointless ... and random .... and lame <br /> <br /> Here are spoiler for you. this movie is stupid thing you ever see. < br /> <br /> However, if you liked this piece, you will use; Deterrance, dark blue, and h stkovaya frontal lobotomy.
