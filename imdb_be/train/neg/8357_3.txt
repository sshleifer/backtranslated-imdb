Man on man! What part of lousy filmmaking! But it's a guilty pleasure from my childhood, although I hate to admit it. They showed that this film on my main cable system constantly. Where I grew up in San Jose, California (right on the border of Cupertino) we had this thing called The G Channel on our cable system. And they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again. Wanda Nevada was one of those movies. I fell in lust and love with a young Brooke Shields and loved her lingering adventure in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s. The script makes almost no sense, the direction of the poor, a few highlights is that Henry Fonda pretends a lot of dialogue, which is so bad it's good and nice Carole King song plays on the end credits. Maybe you have to be stoned to really enjoy this flick. And hey, everybody knows, there is no gold in the Grand Canyon!
