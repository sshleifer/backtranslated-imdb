On the back burner for years (it was reported) is television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in the history of comedy I started badly - and went straight down there. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend, Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) meet in New York after a long estrangement and catch up with each other's lives. What a new concept! But boring is not put anything worth talking about (not to mention making a film about) was one of them in the coming years. Thus, instead of the contents of the script itself with throwing a hoary old plot device after another (most having to do with adult women in the workplace), while completely missing brisk charm and elegance that have made the original show winner. The supporting cast instantly forgettable, humor does not exist, and chemistry, which once went with Moore and Harper. Moore reportedly stalled the project for years, waiting for "just the right script" before committing yourself. If it was one she considered to be "right", what on earth were those that she turned down, how? This is not the age of the characters, which makes it (for the time inevitably marches), but the almost complete lack of imagination, coupled with an open disregard for the elements that have made the series work. At the time, it was conceived as a pilot, but obviously failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors. Or on the issue, including potential audience. Quickly and mercifully forgotten, the film is a travesty and an insult to the classic.
