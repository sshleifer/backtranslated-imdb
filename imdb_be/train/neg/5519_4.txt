Thus, the previews for this film says only that the rebellious young girl goes to live with her grandmother for the summer to correct. It is actually not so! It is about a young rebellious 17-year-old girl who reveals a secret and it is to her mother to believe if she is telling the truth or not. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I really enjoyed the concept of this film. They had a very good story and a good theme love / hate relationship between mother and daughter. I, however, enjoyed watching the acting Lindsay Lohan. Actually, this movie would be very nice if they had someone else might have a better actress. Character Rachel (Lohan) is a very sexually aggressive person, and it kind of reminds us of the real Lindsay, so it takes a lot of film. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that if you put Lindsay aside, you will enjoy this film. The ending is quite large (and boring).
