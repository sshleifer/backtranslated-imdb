This movie was terrible in the worst way: you just do not care. You do not care what happened in the story; You do not care about the characters. Each was stripped of the heart. In the end I left about 45 minutes, because I just do not want to expose your mind to it more. There is too much sex in the film. Sex may be in order; it may even make the film (hence Sutra Feed), but the communication here was not beautiful or sexy. It was just ugly. Do not see this movie.
