I bet you are Gene Simmons and Pastor Vincent discussed in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear. Not too far-fetched for Gene, to go to the ladies team, and then jump on his sword? And Big Pussy? What the hell is that "look at me, I'm a rat!" The double episode of shit? All that stamp mafia banter- COME ON! Big names vote for only what happened, have already received money for charity and was tailor-made for the exit. Hmm ... This is not the reality, but staged drama! another show Mark Burnett, «Survivor» also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay stages of his departure, when he was clearly only a short time before his baby is due. <br /> <br /> Yuk!
