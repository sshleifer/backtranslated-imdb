We loved the school Rocco and Jack Black. We could not wait to go and see this movie. It was the only time the movie was so bad in my life that I wanted to leave. My husband hated it too. Only funny parts were in trailers. My husband and I would like to stand outside in the theater and tell people to save their money. Drafting was awful. He had all the horrible stereotype Hispanic people who need to be completely offended. The film was not so long, but it seemed like an eternity to us. The people in the theater were so restless and quiet it was like watching paint dry. I made my husband stay, because I was sure that maybe some redeeming part, but there was not. Save money and time.
