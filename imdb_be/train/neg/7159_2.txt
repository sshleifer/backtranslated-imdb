I thought I was never going to find a horror movie as bad as "The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre," but this film to compete with him. <br /> <br /> I'm not a person who obtained when asleep watching a movie, but I made it through 15 minutes after the start of Trance. I woke up and started watching it agian. Why do I deserve this? All the cinema was torture, I have to use fast-forward to see its completion. <br /> <br /> I can not stand, why one of my favorite actors of all time (MR. Walken) can do this thing. I have to think that he did the director's mercy, or whether it was in fact in need of money, because the film after the film he does, he destroys himself; and so fast ... <br /> <br /> What about the film? winked not terrible, stupid story, the characters are awful (but I really liked the one played by Jared Harris), the effects are very poor, lack of blood and death, etc .; in three words, he has nothing. And I mean it. I can not stand how the director can make a film like this. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when I became more disappointed when I saw the cover of the video, the film was presented "by Stephen King," I think he never could imagine this shit, no? (I shot it in Argentina). I do not recommend it for millions of years. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this film with a 2 out of 10. (As I mentioned in my "Return of the Texas chainsaw massacre," the review will always be worse movie, why he do not deserve 1 out of 10)
