If I was forced to look at it for reasons of work, I would have never made it past the first 10 minutes. And even then, I admit that I quickly crossed the part. '63 version of the film was significantly higher in all respects. Yes, I read it one more faithful to the original game, but the fact that it was a wise thing for a writer to modify the script in '63! It's long, it pulls the songs in this version, rather than the version of the film is boring and prosaic. Version «Kids» in version '63 was very funny and true classic parental sarcastic humor. In this version too old Kim, Conrad * * see quite horrible (if someone tore off his shirt, I'm disgusted ... shutters director of this version does not have the slightest idea that sexuality is.). This Conrad can not dance, can not sing (he can not even stay in tune) and just off-putting. If Elvis Presley was really like that, his career would have been over before it began. As for the other actors, and I kept waiting for the hanging of Alexander to fall off as he danced and Daly was completely above it acts as a mom. See Stapleton performance in the film version, to see the same role properly made by someone who understands the comic time. This TV version is not nothing but a complete waste of someone's time.
