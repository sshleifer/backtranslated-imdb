I recently saw a revival of the Broadway "Blithe Spirit" starring Angela Lansbury, Rupert Everett, Ebersole and Jayne Atkinson. This is an incredible production, and demonstrates that good actors can do with the game, which is less than perfect. Angela Lansbury very funny, as Madame Arcati. <br /> <br /> Probably, it was a mistake, then, to see the film version of the play starring Rex Harrison. The film has no power, or laughing a good stage production. <br /> <br /> «Blithe Spirit" is probably one of those games that works best with a live gypsum, in the auditorium full of people who have come to laugh. Actors can improvise to give the finishing touches and nuances of their performance and delivery lines, and engage the audience on a personal level, that you can not get in a movie theater, or DVD-show, where the audience is separated from the story of the "fourth wall". History: Charles Condomine (Rex Harrison), a successful writer, lives with his wife Ruth (Constance Cummings) in a house in the English countryside. Seeking information for my next book, a book case with the supernatural, Charles invites Madame Arcati (Margaret Rutherford, the sequel to her role from the original one thousand nine hundred forty-one London production), the local spiritual environment, to his house to spend the session. Charles said that spiritualism is fictitious, but hopes to take "trade wisdom." But Madame Arcati ghost returns Elvira (Kay Hammond), the first wife of Charles, who died of pneumonia seven years ago. Elvira refuses to leave, and develops a rivalry with trochanteric Route of Charles (complicated by the fact that only Charles can see or hear Elvira). <br /> <br /> On the stage, the actors can give an idea of ​​attracting laughs in this situation. But on the screen, the actors in "Blithe Spirit" tear through the line, as if they do not know that someone is listening. They mutter lines that were designed to get laughs on the scene. Submissions on Harrison, Cummings, and even Kaye Hammond are flat and lifeless. Just think Margaret Rutherford, kept its spark and humor, as Madame Arcati <br /> <br /> Oscar-winning visual effects in the film is impressive. - not only by today's standards, but by the standards of 1946! They consist mainly of whom Hammond walk in the green fluorescent clothes and makeup, photographed in a special lighting to make it look like a glowing ghost. <br /> <br /> filmmaker deserves credit for creative lighting. But compare the dull visuals "Blithe Spirit" in order to truly innovative effects of Disney "Song of the South" - which has the right to receive remuneration in the same year. In the "South" people and animated characters to share the screen smoothly in a matter of minutes, at the time. Compared with the "South" Oscar that "Blithe Spirit" received for special effects was completely undeserved. <br /> <br /> In any case, I can only encourage you to catch this Broadway play with Angela Lansbury, before it closes. As for the film with Rex Harrison, skip it.
