And, not bad, but not so great heist movie. Kirk Douglas was recently released from prison a safe cracker who, after turning down an offer from the Mob, decides to get the job itself. He enlists the circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Mayhem stands. Douglas and Gemma soon themselves persecuted mafia Goon Roman Popes, as well as entangled in a really stupid love triangle with his girlfriend infinitely patient Douglas (Balkan). Director Michelle Lupo which keeps the pace moving quickly and there's at least one creative and car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma. Although the Italian products, most of the images seem to have been made in Germany. Douglas is excellent, not only slum it in a substandard Giallo. Amazing Balkan gives amazing performance. Ennio Morricone music and cinema great Della Colli, who was able to work with everyone in Italy (on Wertmuller Fellini and Pasolini and to Leone).
