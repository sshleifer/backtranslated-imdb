I can not think of anything to say about this film. <br /> <br /> It was a terrible movie ... I can not even tell you what made me decide to view it. It was so little life-saving qualities that I do not even know where to start. <br /> <br /> The story moved from improbable quite absurd. My whole body was tense throughout the film, because I could not wait for a terrible thing to be over. By the end of the movie, I found that the feeling of relief. <br /> <br /> Editing was bad, the action was subpar, and the plot was weak. Francoise Robinson was cast as a Native American, despite the fact that she does not even closely resembles someone from the Indian heritage. <br /> <br /> If the movie is this idiocy, it is to be a clown silly - at least. It was not. It was just miserable.
