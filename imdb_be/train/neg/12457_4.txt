It seems that Salvatore could not decide what to do with this film: some of them are very weak thriller (and I'm talking very, very weak), some of which is an attempt to explore the relationship between the main characters. Both were tested in the psychological thriller, but in this case, the film can not keep things together, because of the bad, superficial script, bad acting, and too dark, too dumb cinema. I would say that Salvatore made it better in other genres and other places, where he was free to look at the characters, not to think about the story. In general, B-movie, it is hardly worth your money ... Rate: 4/10
