I saw it recently and I have to say I was moved by the actual basis for the story. Nevertheless, "Holly," as the film does not quite work. However, I look forward to watching the documentary, which made manufacturers, who organized this project because I think it would be much more convincing than the work of this film. <br /> <br /> The international cast was drawn from B- class actors, but their action was necessary, and I have to give any special for the young actress, who plays Holly. It was her first role in a movie, and she did a pretty good job, considering it is the most difficult part. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was adequate but bland, like Patrick, an American whose quest to "save" Holly, but Chris Penn was good at this, his latest role. Unfortunately, despite my generally favorable opinion of the Ledoyen and Udo Kier, both actors were very forgettable and do not do their best work in this film. <br /> <br /> I believe that the message of the film and intentions, but I have to be fair, so I appreciate the "Holly" 3 stars on the basis of their deficiencies, like in the movies. But I think that the subject deserves serious attention, and I am glad that the people behind this film is a documentary, and I hope, will have its debut at the BBC and other television networks.
