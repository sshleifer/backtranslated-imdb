I got a book on Kazaam version for my 8th birthday, and people always say that the version of the book is always better than the movie, but this time they were wrong. At least, with the film, it will be over soon. <br /> <br /> The acting in this awful, what I expected from a movie with Shaq, who plays magic rapping genie who comes out of the old ghetto blaster (which was probably a good reason why he was trapped there). The child in the film, who plays Max whiny and a terrible actor. He mocks the neighborhood children, I do not blame them because it is a little douche bag. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and very silly clich√©. About a boy who's father is always working and never around who finds a new friend, which makes his life better and ultimately helps him reconnect with his father. <br /> <br /> Even in the 8 years I thought it was a stupid idea, it's a surprise any of the people who worked on this film was a career after wards, because it is embarrassing and should never It was made. I could ramble on more about how this film sucks, but you should already know just by reading the story.
