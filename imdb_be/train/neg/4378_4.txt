Given the name and the amazing art of the box, I was ready for just about anything. Perhaps my expectations were forced to just a little bit to high, because it left me a little dry. <br /> <br /> crew working on the film with a soft core sex to end up in someone else's home when they get lost in the fog and choose the best way to spend the evening in order to have sex. Where this is not set used before? The difference here is the uber-perverse nature of sex. It is not allowed to show all goods (groin shots have been banned in Japan for a long time, as shown fogged out) film tries as hard as it can show the audience how unnatural sex can be. <br /> <br /> Among all the goings on curly, dirt monster (the origin of which I can not understand) shows up and begins to kill the men and raped women ... then kill them. Some of the attractions are too many, especially the woman who had her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman, spitting out a mouthful of ... things, but otherwise pretty standard blood. <br /> <br /> in the end the film is pulled down his own projects; this is too overly sexy to be strait-horror picture is too horrible to work as a sex film. The media may work, but there must be a balance. <br /> <br /> 4/10
