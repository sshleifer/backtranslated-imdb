Depending solely on his personal state of mind when viewing this "Christmas Evil" can either be to become ambitious and innovative psychological thriller and one of the most touching and annoying lame slashers holiday theme ever made. I, personally, I am tempted to make a choice in favor of the latter, because I did not do any research at all and was just waiting for the cheese and unpretentious in the early 80's slasher with psycho in Santa Clause costume slaughterhouse people. Wrong! The movie actually manages about a guy named Harry Stadling; who is obsessed with Christmas works in the trash in a toy factory, and believes that it is his duty to determine, on Christmas Eve, which deserves the gifts and who deserves to be punished. questions, Harry began when he witnessed the Santa ?? his dad in a suit, apparently ?? caressing his bare legs in mom's gentle young age. After that, it just became a rogue state, much to the annoyance of his younger brother, who is connected to snap one (Holi) day. I fully understand why some fans appreciate it a bit eccentric horror film, but it really must be so boring? There are a few debts and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens. I can forgive shortness of gore and bloodshed blatant, but this film does not even benefit from the disturbing atmosphere or unexpected plot twists dementia (with the notable exception of the final, I must admit). Also, I would have taken the concept more seriously, when a mad hero will focus on deadly punished naughty child! He does not only kill adult unwell. How should you take wannabe controversial and original thriller serious Christmas when Santa did not even make one unhappy child murder? What would make "Christmas Evil" classic, but now it is simply forgotten, miserable piece of junk.
