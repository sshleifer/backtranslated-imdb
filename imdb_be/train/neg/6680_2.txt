Wow, what a snoozer. Definitely one of the worst films of Bacon. Bad actions, combined with formulatic, if not suspicious, the script will make me miss the time I wasted on viewing this on cable television back. Not much I can say about it, basketball scout gets too attached to a person, he gained, which happens to be a member of the tribe, which happens on the brink of war, which happens to be made (spoiler) basketball game. Evaluation: F +
