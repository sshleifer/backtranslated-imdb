For the life of me I can not understand why anyone would make a movie like this. The plot is tired, RMS voltage, the language consistently foul, and sometimes the use of a word «F», it seemed, as the lack of dialogue has been extended so that the "let's throw in another couple for good measure" F in "is what the American public wants to hear. Gossett particularly foul and he seemed to enjoy his part. Forget this c__p, rental "Shrek" and laugh.
