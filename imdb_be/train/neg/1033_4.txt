I grew up with Scooby-Doo, where are you, and I still love it. This is one of my favorite cartoons with Darkwing Duck, Miracles on bends, Peter Pan and the Pirates and Tom and Jerry. This show, although it is good for children, good voice (Don Messick Casey Kasem perfect as Scooby and Shaggy), the theme tune tolerant and has good animation. However, it is rather disappointing. I usually do not mind patchy, but if it seems like the main character, it gets annoying fast. Included with the phrase Puppy power, Scrappy few more annoying than usual. Also, there are no gangs half after the first year, somehow it did not feel like Scooby-Doo. And jokes and storylines were all lame and unoriginal, very little coinage monsters or expose the villain. All in all, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get a Clue, but this show disappointing. 4/10 for the animation, voice, music themes, and the fact that it is good for children. Bethany Cox
