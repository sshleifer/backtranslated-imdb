CI me and a friend rented it a few days ago, because we want to keep track of bi-movies, as we are doing it themselves. In any case, the lid contains blood and weird looking girl with bare fangs and other ... and Tom Savini! There's just no way this film can not succeed! Right? wrong !! It just seems like such a waste! There really was no story, the dialogue was awful (anyone there? Ã— 1000 !!!), the characters were .. well, they really did not have any kind of a person ... The consequences were terrible .. and that this ambitious long boom frightened people running around doing nothing .. with an extreme close-up of eyes and other things? We sat the whole movie waiting for something ... something happens ... but no ... "Oh, that's nymphs! Great! Oh .. they kiss ... again ... and now the violence! The OK ... nothing happens ... again ... oh, now they run ... and his eyes plans ... again ... oh, Heres Savinykh! Oh ... he died ... right ... Well, maybe now something cool or interesting to be .. no .. oh! cool! severed head! end ... oh shit .. "And finally, as I am full of myself .. I'll tell you! Give me a van, six actors, a strange looking house, Tom Savini, a couple of naked girls with fangs and a bucket of blood, and I could make the coolest movie you've ever seen ... I've made films with a zero budget for two days to have the best effects, the best action and best-case scenario, what is ... what is this guy doing Johannes ?? Create cool movies easily! It might be so great ... I am very upset !!
