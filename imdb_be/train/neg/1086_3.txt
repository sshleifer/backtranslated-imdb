Despite the impressive cast and crew pedigree bun crumbled early and often. The plot is unrealistic confused, actors and sports bad accents participation amounts director Robert Altman to collect the check. Once again he assembled a great cast (Woody Allen, everyone wants to work with Altman), this time to the letter miscast. But this is only part of the problem. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh Rick Magruder Georgia high power attorney who in heavy handed opening scenes of the film manage to get myself hopelessly seduced by a mysterious waitress power company, convinces him she is in grave danger from the ex-husband and crazy dad. With red flags everywhere astute lawyer plods, even managing to get their child in harm's way. Gun fights and fist follow along with the requisite car chase, and if that's not enough, there is a hurricane threw in a ridiculous finale. <br /> <br /> Branagh plays MacGruder powdery and unconvincing Southern accent. Running in a raincoat in all kinds of weather, he is blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going. Hipster Bob Downey Jr. every bit as bad as PI but with a little more emphasis on bad accent. Robert Duvall as an old Boo Radely all growed to own crazier than a bed bug protruding several thick slices of ham, but at least, it is plausible to strum. Women wires (Davidtz, Daryl Hannah, Famkhee Jansen) poor leggy and unemotive. Even well-known lawyers make cameos (Vernon Jordan) wood with a few throw line they have. <br /> <br /> In the annex to the paying little attention to the actor, directing Altman own scenes dripping with Spanish moss murky and shapeless, his comics scene. It lacks its extraordinary risks and follow-up (it does inform the viewer that the stars and bars still waving in Georgia) who are doing well done Altman unique. Unfortunately, Gingerbread Man Altman at its worst case, even if the pay is the same.
