Evil Breed very odd slasher film, which, unfortunately, is not good.The beginning of the film seems promising, but overall it is a dialogue disaster.The pretty bad, but not as bad as acting.The actions are cruel and unbearable.Most with symbols to put TAM awful, and even if it's on purpose method does not work, because the characters are annoying.Some of the killings are innovative, but it took too much time to get to them.After about half an hour through the movie we get the first death (except in the beginning), then almost every character smoked for n astupnyh five minutes.The film is then turned into a parody of its kind with a ridiculous looking character, karate surreal, like a fight, and a scene in which a person gets his guts pulled out and * sscrack.None this is just ridiculous ridiculous.The film, it becomes ultra gory and ultra pointless.Most of clich√©d characters even for the chopper standards and strong, but as the ter left on the counter for 5 breed days.Evil not ridiculously bad so it is not his main task.Watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre, shortly before dawn sees no evil for real slasher.
