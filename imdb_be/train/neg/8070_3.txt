It's not a very good movie, but it's not a bitch. This is a very confusing and too long, so rent it at your own risk <br /> <br /> My GF and I realized that this film is (we think), so here it is :. <br /> <br /> * ** MAJOR SPOILERS below *** <br /> <br /> First of all, this film is actually quite simple, after removing all trash tangled unconscious sleep state (95% of the film. ) <br /> <br /> not paying attention to the garbage, what actually happened is: a group of high school friends to go to a rave one night. They leave, and get into a car accident, where all but Cassie and Sean die. It's just a stripped-down version. (That's right, I said, Sean, bear with me) <br /> <br /> Immediately after the accident, Cassie is in the hospital did not linger between life and death, right up until the very end of the film. This is where the start of the dream. <br /> <br /> The film is called Soul Survivors, right? mind and soul performs Cassie after the accident, the interaction with other souls (Annie, Matt, crows, 2 eccentrics and Judah) together with images coined its mind (Sean, schools, and rest around it). Souls continue to do what they have been identified as: Annie rave going chick, 2-Weirdo-killer (from the opening scene), the father of Jude still helping people, etc. <br /> <br /> We were then taken on a very long journey showed a lot of images (many of whom are my GF and I still can not link), but it all boils down to the fact that not being the time Cassie to die . <br /> <br /> In the end, Cassie wake up in the hospital after being "dead" for a while. Her family and Sean there. This is the reality again. She's fine. <br /> <br /> Then the director adds a little extra spice, trying to confuse us again, showing a small fragment of the dream of her in a wheelchair crushed. But this part is really just a nightmare, and she wakes up next to Sean, obviously still has to deal with her traumatic experience. <br /> <br /> Because of space limitations, we do not cover every detail, but do not hesitate to send us an e-mail if you want. <br /> <br />
