Rich Harvard dude falls on poor Radcliffe chick to the consternation of his strict father (Ray Milland). <br /> <br /> syrupy, sugary, and most of all, a juicy story about the battle of "classes" when the rich-kid Ryan O'Neal brings home Homeless librarian for his pathetic father to ridicule. Ali McGraw is a social outcast with a dirty mouth, and John Marley plays her devout Catholic father, but no one in the film is not annoying than the whining of his image as a champion of yuppies O'Neill Harvard. <br /> <br /> Circles 8 (!) years later, "Oliver's Story."
