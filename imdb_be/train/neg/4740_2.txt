I was so insulted this film, it's not even funny ... And I thought, "mule" was incredible! However low my expectations Disney began, I never thought that they were doing something else so stereotypical away. There is no respect here for any true Chinese culture, a Hollywood tradition random martial arts. <br /> <br /> I understand that they were trying to make Wendy's normal teenage girl ... But, fortunately, most normal teenage girls - especially Asian teenage girls - far less obsessed with these small aspects of life. And from a cultural stand point, it is almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are wrapped in pop and fashion, but they are quite rare. And even those who are still fairly decent scientists. Another stereotype, perhaps, but pretty accurate one. Because, as Chinese parents work. Here is how the Chinese work values. If they wanted to go for authenticity, they would have made Wendy ironic girl with glasses and a love-hate relationship with her family. <br /> <br /> This only adds to my frustration with American films. Asian culture is not about meditation and vague, natural-oriented phrases that sound wise. We do not walk around mysteriously smiles all the time and we do not know what kind of martial arts. We are the people, and I would be grateful if someone would write Asian side, which does not reflect us as a kind of sad caricature.
