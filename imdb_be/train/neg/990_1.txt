Do not waste your time and money on this film. My roommate for rent, because she thought that it was another movie called Descent (Flick about some travelers who are trapped in a cave). Thus, we decided to see it anyway thinking that it can not be that bad. It was. I can not believe that this film was actually put out of production and the public. It was so awful, it was almost like the scene where you want to look away, but you just can not do yourself. I sincerely believe emotionally scarred. He has gone from budget film-floor low, in which college girl gets attacked a boy she dated all of the porn film. And in fact, it is not good. I went from someone who hates women rapist almost felt bad for him. Almost. In general, a terrible movie that's definitely NC-17 rating for a reason. Do not waste your money. And do not let your children watch.
