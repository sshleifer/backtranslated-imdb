This film was a hit for me. I think that little girls should strive to be nothing more than a swimsuit model, domestic manufacturers or mistresses, so it seems they are ever portrayed in any way. It's really sad to see the work and the artist's life be so unfair misinterpretated. Inconcievably (or maybe it's to be expected), the whole character of Artemisia and all that it stands for, has been reduced to the standard Hollywood female character; miserable, physically perfect, helpless little creature, not showing any of the traits that actually got her a place in history, which was mutilated here. even sadder, it was to see that most of the audience was too poorly educated in the field to understand the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film and reality. In order to display the artist as a man in love with her rapist real life, someone to whom she actually accused of rape, even if under torture, just pisses me off. If the director does not have anything more substantial to say that it should refrain from basing its story on a real person.
