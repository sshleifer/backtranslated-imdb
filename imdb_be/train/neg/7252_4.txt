The decoy is one of those independent productions, made apparent by beginners, but it's not all the usual disadvantages which settle most of these films. It has a certain history, he has enough action, the pictures are very good, and the bad guy is a hero two formidable men, and the background music is not exaggerated. This DVD new release, so that people will look here to see if it is appropriate. I do not know where all the 10's came, as there is no way this movie is that good --- even if you are the mother of filmmakers. <br /> <br /> In the last film, we saw in the theater was the trashing of Warner J K Rawlings beloved and remarkable book, The Order of the Phoenix. When comparing devices from Phoenix, believes PHOENIX (as done by Warners) had no history, of course, is not acting entirely permissible director, photography was terrible, and the wall-to-sound overbearing score was just a mess. I'm rating the Phoenix "1", because the scale does not go below. The decoy is 4 times better. - in every way <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to give a chance to the bait. Remember, this is not "bait 3 - Shootout" or any such nonsense. This is the original. If your expectations are not unreasonable to fan "10" points here, you can just enjoy the film on its own terms.
