It might be gay analogue of Gone With The Wind, given its epic fangs, but instead of that it satisfies itself, being a huge chain of empty scenes in which there is absolutely nothing. Characters one-dimensional and have no other development in history (there's really no story, too) than to look for each other and kissed. It's a shame that interesting aesthetic judgment, but that is almost completely lost the dialogue in the film, what makes no effort to study the psychology of his characters with the dignity and the achievement of a genuine emotional resonance. In addition, it claims to be "art" film, using the worst naïve clichés of cinematic snobbery. But in any case, if someone can identify with his heavy banality, I believe that it is good.
