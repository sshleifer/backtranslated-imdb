<br /> <br /> Worse. Movie. Ever. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of shooting this remake (except for turning it in 90 minutes to the soundtrack of a short promotional film TV movie)? Zombies, Run * that * ??? I do not think the director did not watch the original "Dead" films, which show the hard limbs (from stupor) creatures shuffling / Shambling to live prey. <br /> <br /> And, in fact, did the survivors to know what boats in the harbor belonged to the recently deceased Steve? <br /> <br /> 1/10
