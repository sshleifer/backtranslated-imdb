I'm glad I read so many negative comments about Tritter story. Everyone I talk to says the same thing. They are rude character of House and his intelligence, but really do not like this for revenge plot. He bumps into the real nature of the history of the hospital and makes everyone angry at the police authority. It should have a caring nature instead of vengeance to every hospital. In addition, there seems to be many dubious legal aspects that Tritter really does. He alone can not freeze the accounts and has the right to stop the doctor from writing prescriptions for patients. Many vindictiveness it shows also harm very sick patient in hospital and a good story to reflect. I voted episode badly not because of the story, but if you put a piece of Trittor he turns me and the rest of the area will suffer from it, people say that they hate to look more storylines. Please change it. Get Tritter out.
