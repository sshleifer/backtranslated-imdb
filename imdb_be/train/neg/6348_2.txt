Thoroughly pretentious nonsense. The material is boring, boring, boring, and most of the cast did not even make doubles in earlier films Allen. And to listen to unfunny Will Ferrell do his imitation of Woody Allen makes me hate a secondary (though mysteriously popular) Ferrell even more. . It turns out that sullen 70-year-old Allen had knocked off work when the clock rang in the new century <br /> <br /> I really tried to take part in the film, but it was impossible; It has snyapses could not fire, slowly. So, instead of dozing off and kill an afternoon nap in a vertical position, I got up, left his wife and daughter in the theater, and went out to the car, where I had a very good book to read (large TOME George Bailey 30 years ago, "the Germans . ") The next day did not work quite well in the end, not because of Woody.
