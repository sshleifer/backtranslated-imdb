This is not the worst film I've seen Peter Greenaway, but it's close. It's a shame there is an even worse Pillow Book. films of this director with the 3 I have seen, I find them all to be miserable. How to Cook ..., whatever positive cinematic flourishes, he shows quite outstanding on the incompatibility of his material, and overall presentation.
