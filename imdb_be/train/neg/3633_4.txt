Of the ten actors portraying Philo Vance in the series, Edmund Lowe seemed most representative, but in this scenario, the audience is way ahead of the famous detective. In the end, if the jockey, Douglas Walton, stares blankly into space, apparently hypnotized, and says something like "I have to go and be killed," I felt that it was stupid, that nobody took him after he killed. The police thought it was a suicide, because he said he would do it! Once the owner of the horse hated Gene Lockhart gets shot Ineskort does the same thing, saying that she was going to kill him, and then jumps to death off the bus. I laughed when Lowe finally yells, "I got it," as if it was a revelation. I'm sorry, but skillfully concealed and there was no significant uncertainty generated when the party starts to hypnotize Lowe, to make him jump from the roof.
