Frankly, at the time I first heard about this show I though it might be a bad idea to make a show that makes Muslims use racial jokes on himself, but it is the exact opposite. I realized that the show makes that can help people to understand that if a Muslim uses the S word, as in real life, it does not mean that it is a terrorist thing. It also shows how people give Muslims a bad name because they are playing on their stereotype, watching the show ordinary people understand that although things may be bad Muslims does not mean that we are bad, we just try to live one day while as how difficult it was for Amair, to board the plane, and he used words like "blow" or Yaser speaking, we blow away the competition, and people took it the wrong way. As a Muslim, I know that things like this do not usually happen, but they do, and many people think that bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq, it's not the right thing is not so. people will see how we are difficult to treat, watching the show, and it may make them think about how to act. I am glad that the show, as it happened in the air. There are many shows that Peter Muslim population as terrorists, many people find them funny my opioion it is OK to do it now and then due Prety much to ridicule, we have to say that you can not make fun of it is unfair but it is done often and really gives people a bad name muslin.
