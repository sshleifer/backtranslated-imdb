I'm not familiar with the trilogy, but came upon this film last night on Showtime. The film looks very well made with scenery and cinematography, but the script was stilted and wooden. Action was pretty bad- believed that the two female leads were intact. You never felt anything supporting actors, while talking. Were stereotypes- bible-thumping Rev. no hint of nuance, authoritative captain, quick-tempered warrior, etc. I'm sorry to say that based on these shortcomings, I clocked it at once, as a Canadian, not knowing that it would be such a telefilm Canada end credits gave it. I know I'm a terrible person. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something at the beginning, but hostility toward girls is never explained. Here they are being besieged in the fortress of werewolves and people spend time and energy strictly two young women for no reason. FOCUS people. There's a little more oppressive situation outside your walls than whether or not this woman, a lesbian is just my outlet for hostility towards them. If they can be directed and shoot a gun, you can also do well with them. The question of their "immortal soul" can be settled later. <br /> <br /> In addition, I believe it has to do with the rest of the trilogy, these girls should be the main actors? One of them was killed by Indian guy at the end, which saved one of their lives. I believe that only one victim of her condition, which can not necessarily be blamed for their actions, and the second a killer who does not deserve her happy ending.
