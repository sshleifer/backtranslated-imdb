This film was one of the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It is a combination of police drama and a comedy about two detectives Hollywood, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, investigating shooting in a hip-hop club. <br /> <br /> The plot is contrived, and there are too many side issues occur. Ford hustling real estate on the side (Martin Landau, one of his clients), Hartnett working yoga school, where his concern for chicks in their spare time, the two are under investigation of Internal Affairs, the Ford screwing ex-girlfriend (Lena Olin) researcher IA, and it is the psychic who has a radio show, the man who set up the murder in the club dirty ex-cop who shot his father a year ago Hartnett. <br /> <br /> Toss in the obligatory car chases and some unsuccessful attempts of humor, and it is the essence of this turkey.
