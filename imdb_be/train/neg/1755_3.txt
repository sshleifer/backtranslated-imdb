This film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of heat, but ultimately this effort too vain and too much focused on potential customers. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with all of her screen time, but it takes too much attention from the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Another problem is overloading the script with clich√©s. Daughter who secretly drops out of college, older woman find it difficult to get a good job (and the first ends with a rather humiliating work), untidy network executive with their executive toys, going on shine in fact, a journalist who sticks out for their beliefs and g .d. There's nothing really wrong with any of them, that is all they are firmly rooted in reality, but in combination they are just too much, and leave us too much deja vu and too little surprises.
