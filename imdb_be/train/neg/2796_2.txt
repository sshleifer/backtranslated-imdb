for the most part, on demand provide some pretty horrible horror movies, and offers only other horror movies have all seen, and already have an opinion on. It was either that or Invinicible (I like Mark Wahlberg movies) that I have not seen, and I was actually in the movie watching mood, which is not often anymore, because I've watched all the movies I've got a million times and it's a lot of movies, and I have no particular interest in the new film, and boy, this film made me regret. I'm not going to put any spoilers, I just want to tell you that only a few of the very few actors in this film, halfway decent. I think that the main girl, dead, which kills all very annoying kind, but clearly; I would take her psycho bitch Anyday, so it suited her roll, although limping. Blood is not so great, only a few of the killings, or I can say "" in the wounds in order, but you do not see that much, and there is no body of the props in the film to make the injury look more convincing. Toward the end of the movie I begged her friend to turn it off, and, as a member of the group, in the "write" part was not anything very interesting, but what really happened would happen if there is a record. I have finished, if you want to look at it, put on.
