Complaints are valid for me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is for women too. I'm fine with it at night time soaps like Gray's Anatomy and Ugly Betty, and The West Wing, because there are stories that are interesting, even taking into account the fact that they will never end. However, if the idea parallels daytime soaps designed to simply put hunky men (Taye Diggs, Tim Delhi, and Chris Lowell) in sexual tension and noisy games, as well as many ridiculous complicated situation in the so-called small hospital, it seems, General Hospital .. . or the female counterpart of Malibu. It was what people wanted and they had it, so if that's what women want so be it, but the idea that this is a high brow show (or something people will look) is unrealistic.
