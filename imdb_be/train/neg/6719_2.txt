This is a great idea for a movie, but, unfortunately, not be able to be a great movie. What begins as a sweet and almost boundless romantic comedy about a leavening agent in love with his Fluffee spirals out of control in a bizarre combination of genres and this corner sections, with liberal borrowing from Nights Boogie, Thelma and Louise, actresses, FRISK, and even curious "shooting gallery" 400 beats thrown in the end. (At least the director did my research!) The result is not necessarily sad, but in the end, is a slick, well-made film is not completely made up to anything. However, the actors all make the game work with the material, and have a few good laughs at the backstage world of gay porn. <br /> <br />
