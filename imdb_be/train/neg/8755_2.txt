This movie was terrible to say the least. I was hoping for a lot better after watching the «High School Musical». The whole entire movie was a complete rip off with «The Simple Life», only it was not a reality show. <br /> <br /> action is not appropriate. Amanda Michalka were moments when she was not that terrible. On the other hand Alyson Michalka was bad all the way through. Chris Gallinger, who played the love interest of Amanda played the French guy, but it was a terrible accent. One good thing about this film was entirely favorite Michael Trevino, who played the love interest in ALYSON. Just something to keep in mind if this film was shown in front of «High School Musical», probably would not be so bad. But it was not and can not be compared. <br /> <br /> All in all I give it a 2.
