If you want to spend almost 2 hours of your life watching it depends how you like horror movies. If you like them so god damn awful they are hysterical, looking to the side. Puzzle, without doubt, the worst movie I've seen in my life (and I've seen «Long Time Dead»), and I say this as a fan of low-budget horror / genre baked blood and seeing good enough to compare it. I will not even go into the details of what makes this film was bad, as it is the only good thing about this is so awful, so this is one of the funniest things I've seen in years. If you can find it for rent cheap it is certainly worth a look if you have been involved in the creation of this - shame on you. : O) IMDb need to enter the 0/10 rating for this film, he thoroughly deserves.
