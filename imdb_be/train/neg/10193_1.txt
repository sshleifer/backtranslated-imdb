With this film, Buñuel manipulates the viewer with all the strength of the film, as clearly stated in the film that his work is one of the "objectivity". Obviously, this is not the case. For one reason, "blow by chance", many scenes are obvious setting (despite the fact that the poor goat accidentally "falling off a cliff, you can see the smoke gun on the right side of the screen!). On the other hand, make it invisible one important information:.. Hurdes people were as they had been for a reason, which just hinted in the film This means goiter, a disease caused by iodine deficiency (salt) This is the cause of goiter and cretinism they had Buñuel only took the time to to do his research (hell, when he checked the "Cretu ism "in the medical dictionary he found a" goiter "), he may end up telling the truth about these people (still in disbelief). Instead, with his film, he judges them constantly refer to them as" nerds ", over and over dramatize the effect, adjustment of the stage to create a performance, all this is very unacceptable to the documentary, which claims to be working on the almighty objectivity. Buñuel always says in this film, without giving a single word to the people he filming. He talks about them and even try them. This part is deficient in its roots, to an ideology, and it is a real shame, it is considered a great film.
