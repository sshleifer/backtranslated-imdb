I caught this movie on FX last night, and as I sat there watching it, it occurred to me that this may quite possibly the worst movie ever. Bad action, bad movies, bad sound, absolutely incredible fight sequences, silly characters. All of them have made it to be the most ridiculously bad film I have ever seen. It was so bad, I was delighted with his complete lack of anything-competent floor, I had to keep watching ... and they made a sequel!
