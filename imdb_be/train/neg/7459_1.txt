Please, save your money and go see something else. this film was such a piece of shit. I did not want to go, but I had to so I thought that I laugh at least once, NOPE. no laughter, it was horrible! Chris Katie never get a good comedy role after that and "Night at the Roxbury." this film obviously has no intellectual humor at all, and simply repeats over and over again. Hear me, and step back away from the film as you possibly can!
