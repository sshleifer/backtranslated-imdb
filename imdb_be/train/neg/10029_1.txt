I had no idea that the film is about, before I saw it because it was the only Tashan teaser trailer while it is moving. So I asked my friends if they knew nothing about it, and they said, "This is the directorial debut of Vijay Krishna Acharya, who wrote the script for Dhoom 1 and 2, and son Saif Ali Khan Ibrahim makes his debut in the film is his child in his memories. " <br /> <br /> After watching, I realized why they had not been a proper trailer, because there was nothing in the film to show. The story was very thoughts, and even 10-year-old child can come up with a better storyline. It was hardly act, and the camera is shaken at every possible angle is, and it's hard to understand that someone who kills. In addition, action was abnormal and unrealistic, for example, 1 man with a gun could kill about 100 people with guns <br /> <br /> While I was watching Tashan it reminded me of the 3 films :. <br /> <br /> Sin City: During the opening credits. <br /> <br /> Koyla: Anil Kapoor terrible English as Amrish Puri <br /> love without words <br /> Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: .. in the outrageously funny jokes that are not funny iota <br /> <br /> I've heard, a budget of 40 crores, which is the same as Dhoom 2 and I do not know where all the money went to. In any case, if you do not like Dhoom 2, then there is absolutely no chance that you will like Tashan. The race was hot on his heels, and a million times better. <br /> <br /> Only 2 good songs Dili Haar & Challiya and both songs filmed in Greece in good locations, but the benefit from it in the trash movie? Even Anil Kapoor terrible English can not keep this embarrassment.
