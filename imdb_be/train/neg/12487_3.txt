This film was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> I take the opposite view of critics. This is not the case of a material that is not to the level of actors; Here the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) is simply not up to the level of the material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert was as big as Davis and Cagney, and see how it happened one night, turned out to be - all-time classic. With a very similar story, Davis argues that she has no talent for comedy (a good thing for her, it's only a single comedy she had ever attempted!) Speech on one note Davis exudes irritability, but none of the nuances of acting Colbert in It Happened One Night. Cagney, who was a great comedian, but it seems out of sync with his Costar, Davis. The script provides some decent lines and fun, but the delivery seems to be best suited for drama than comedy. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the soundtrack, which, like the delivery of Davis and Cagney, seems more suitable for light drama than comedy. <br /> <br /> Jack Carson, who played a similar role throughout his career, more skillfully handled very similar material. In a fairly typical supporting role Eugene Palette provides respectable performance. In a slightly different role relic of the old west, Harry Davenport, very good. But in one of his speeches, poor William Frawley is very irritable. Constant references to his character in the fictional cop are poor efforts at irony. <br /> <br /> I really love every one of these artists, and it's a shame that, as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and a better result than the bride came COD
