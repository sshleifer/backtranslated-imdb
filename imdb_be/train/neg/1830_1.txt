this is the worst movie I have ever seen. I'm not kidding. the next time we are talking about, I just keep working head into the wall. I would be pleased to sit in the emergency room, the doctor trying to explain why my brain swells, than to try to make it through this movie again. <br /> <br /> I hope that Black and Stiller never work with a project that bad again. they are both good comedians, so I was shocked it was so uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> When they had to do it all over again, I'm sure that they have decided not to do so. people, facade of money, apparently, lost a ton. Sun really-, because special effects (all 2 of them) were awful.
