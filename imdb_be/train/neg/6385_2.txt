Gaia-nigga from the distant cosmos largely summed up by its name. Running only 27 minutes long, it describes the spacecraft blacks gays who come to Earth to free the men from the women. While I see little value for the plot, but really illogical. Of course, it's meant to be a comedy / parody of the society and science fiction. I found myself laughing a few times, so it is a success there. <br /> <br /> The special effects are terrible. If a spaceship floating above the Earth, you can see the stars on the scale for no apparent reason. Asteroids are shown at the beginning of a fake watch, the equipment on board is illogical, there are a few typos in the text, the actors are not convincing, messed up the characters; in general, all that does not take itself seriously. If you go through all the aspects that make it a bad film, it's very affordable and easy to see through. Some of the fun. But in general, the only thing you have to recall that it was one of the most ridiculous ideas ever. <br /> <br /> Seeing that his short film, and has some amusing aspects, it is not the worst thing to see, but it illogical and has little long-term significance. I can not recommend it; if you look, do it for the unique concept, not the quality.
