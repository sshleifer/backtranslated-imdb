This is a terrible remake of the marginal, but well liked, the movie from the beginning of the 70s. I have seen the original, at least 6 times. 1997 Version 20 minute film is "killed" in 2 hours or independently from the execution environment. Cheesy plot, which, incidentally, is completely different from the original. Main government involvement was far-fetched. There is no flow from one scene to another. In the original, you can go get a beer or get into the bathroom and still keep up. <br /> <br /> It took a little time hours of film to change the oil pan on the car. It takes many times more than in real life. guys notice this stuff car. In addition, the fool or the fool who decided to dust in 1968 charger and abuse 1970 Challenger should be shot in the heel with a blunt bullet. The fact that they are not "car people" painfully apparent, and their adoption will not be upset. <br /> <br /> actors had no emotions, it was all cut and dried. One step above a monotone. Barmitzvah more fun and energetic. <br /> <br /> And last but certainly not least, DJ radio made a statement that got bulldozers Challenger 180 or 185 (??). That is the general trash. Can you say, aerodynamic, or lack thereof ?? Hahaha !! This film is a joke. Do not waste your time watching this.
