Do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> He's trying to be a parody of SciFi / thriller movies of the 1950s and 1960s, but it succedes do you want to really bad that you saw one of them, not him. <br /> <br /> This is very inaccurate. Spoof should have some aspect that has a quality higher than normal thereto. This film does not have this aspect. <br /> <br /> Save yourself. It's too late for me, but ... just do not look.
