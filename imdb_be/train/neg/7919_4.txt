I was very caught up in the film, at least in the beginning, and any credit I give this film is Lacey Chabert, it was fantastic !! But here's where it ends. I seem to be very good to find out who the killer is, and I like it when the film is capable of fully baffel me, but I felt lied to and they are constantly they will lead you in one direction, and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction in the end, they did not allow hit on it at all, it is not misleading, that is very bad writing and planning, someone does not think at all! <br /> <br /> I felt the film would have been much better if they stuck to the story that will take you on, they seemed to have no answer why Jane (Mary) will burn the house. <br /> <br /> His professors are very sorry as I felt that it began as a relatively good movie.
