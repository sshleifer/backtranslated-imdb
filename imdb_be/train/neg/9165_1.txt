There are no spoilers in this review, because everything has already been shown in the trailer of the film. I try to be balanced in my review because I strongly support local films, but I can not help but maintain a backlash against the film. This is slow, boring and borders meaningless. Even "almost beautiful and believable moments" were immediately undercut painful clich√©s and bad acting. Vernetti Lopez and Wong Li Ling, which I usually like, was passable only in the film. He felt, as a director trying to make a melodramatic TV soap, and then became interested and decided to put it on the big screen. Leap years have come up with a rating of RA (rating awful), but it did not change my faith in local films. Even good movies will be coming until more movies, they do not get done.
