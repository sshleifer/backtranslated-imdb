This may be one of the worst movies ever make it into production, ever. <br /> <br /> 1. The most exciting part is the beginning where the guy is going ... and going ... and walking (spoiler). There is about 15 minutes easy walk. How? <br /> <br /> 2. Not to mention there are many problems with the lighting, and it's almost like they even shoot night scenes during the day. <br /> <br /> 3. The acting was terrible. It looks like they found amateur theater (in Mexico) ... and then took the people who have turned away. <br /> <br /> Please, for God's sake, Sun rent this film. If you know someone who owns it, apologize to them. The director shall be punished by a war crimes tribunal to impose it in public.
