This is the story of two men who have found a copy of the «Funky Monkey». Identify it seemed strange at the time, considering that there are still posters for the film at the local Cineplex Odeon. After watching such classics as "scattered But Loose" and «Project X", these two guys figured movies with monkeys are awesome. <br /> <br /> These guys were in for a long ride, as they watched the film. Which it was a monkey, which was replaced by stuntmen when required sequence of actions. It was obvious that the monkey was not trained in the school of Shakespeare's actions. Perhaps instead of a monkey with Ben Affleck may have helped the guys thought. <br /> <br /> It may be strong to help the bosom like Jackie Chan or hell, maybe even Hulk Hogan. Fortunately, this film was a strange martial arts master Jet Li and look-alike, Matthew Modine. While some may argue that Matthew Modine Sun come close to Jet Li, the focus of cameras to prove that he is just as good. When it becomes apparent that an untrained chimpanzee can not cope with the movie, the movie is based on Matthew Modine ~ d to be a real star. <br /> <br /> I have already said that there is some stupid kid who develops a relationship with Modina and a monkey? Is it likely that the child learns trust and even picks up the girl in this film? Even Matthew Modine must be jealous of this (because using a pick-up line, "I'm second fiddle monkey" does not seem to work with the ladies.) <br /> <br /> Shortly after watching the film a couple of guys got a phone call from Matthew Modine, saying to them, "Seven days."
