If you are a fan of really bad movies, and you think that's funny, you will be more effective from the Shack. First delivery of professional players in the film almost never works. Shaq was with the actor was the worst I've ever seen next to Dennis Rodman, who also made a few bad movies. Well, in any way, this film is also bad because of the poor child. I would give it a zero, but it is impossible.
