Frankly, I was disappointed in the "expiry date." Super cleverly named and an interesting premise, but I do not think he comes. What is it about? The desire of the protagonist, to be reunited with his indigenous roots? Or rather, it was his need to overcome their fear of death. But it was not created as a man who lived his life in fear - it seems as if his life is going well, but since the end of the world is approaching now he has to start worrying. I did not buy it. Meanwhile, recurring characters in the movie do not seem to have needs that are mixed in the cover story. They're just doing their job, working in parallel with the main character. In addition, it was seen as a "curse" was more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? And finally, why he just does not plan to stay in his apartment all day on his birthday? These are my criticisms, but I love Seattle shots cinematography was beautiful, the action was good in those days it was not great.
