You know that the film is bad, if the highlight of this is the ability to see the short time «Jeopardy!». <br /> <br /> the bitter white men can not jump that he had great potential. For several years I have lived in the area quite as portrayed in this film; Racial tensions were high, and basketball meant everything for everyone. The film is about the members of this "basketball culture" could be very interesting, but a mediocre action and a bad script in White Men Can Sun Job poor. <br /> <br /> film sequence of events is cyclical. First, Billy either wins or loses money by playing basketball. Then he returned to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend; and the process repeats. Most of the stories build to the climax of its kind, but the "Climax" I saw was just another in this sequence is repeated (this case is the "Beat either wins or loses money playing basketball"). <br /> <br /> to conspiracy to development, some of the dilemmas must be addressed; and this dilemma should be interesting if the film will be interesting as well. Apparently the authors of the white men can not jump forgotten this rule, as the plot can be summarized as "Billy has to pay the bills," I appreciate the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies, but -. I'm sorry - it was just awful. I could care less if Billy has the money to pay the rent for my apartment. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, the white men can not jump successful film. Obviously, some diehard sports fans fired awful letter for a few scenes with basketball in them. The other, I am sure, has attracted big names that play a major role. It leaves me to wonder if the roll was replaced completely with a previously unknown actor, and basketball theme was replaced lacrosse, who are tired of watching this movie? I really do not think so <br /> <br /> I will give this film two stars out of ten. additional star on «Jeopardy!» scenes that kept me awake for a few minutes. Thank you, Trebek.
