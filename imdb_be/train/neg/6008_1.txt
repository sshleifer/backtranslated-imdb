If you make a mistake movie before reading the book, please, do not give up on the series. I bought my first copy of any of the books in May of this year, and already I'm almost finished with the book 10. I dare say that the film is a piece of junk that does not make this series even sniff justice. While «Left Behind: the film" only vaguely follows the story of «Left Behind» (book), the characters even close to accurate <br /> <br /> A few examples :. Rayford had no effect on his feelings for Hattie (he was going when he was informed of the disappearance); Buck Williams blonde hair, magazine writer, not a television reporter; Chloe at Stanford, and many book Rayford detail wondering if she "survived"; Buck and Chloe did not meet much later, at a meeting in New York, established homes; Irene and Raymie had "the book", but simply thought Rayford retrospective in; road so jam packed with sunken after ecstasy that Rayford and Hetts should helicopter back to the suburbs ... etc, etc, etc ... <br /> <br /> This only from the first film; they are going to release the third. Please, even if you do not like a movie, give a chance to the series of books.
