This show was ridiculously bad. Drafting sucked, sucks dialogue. The guy who played Craig could not act his way out of a paper bag. As it was a Thursday night, it was determined to look cool with a small amount of beer. Cool music, bad acting, bad writing, all come together for my entertainment. <br /> <br /> It was a drama / comedy unintentional. I do not care what happened to any of the characters, all of them were boring and stupid. The first five episodes were worse because they could not find out who was the victim, they had to write a dialogue around it, that was scary. I mean, a eulogy at the funeral was funny. In fact, all the scenes that took place was absolutely horrible at the moment. <br /> <br /> So let's review. Everything that happens now sucked. Retrospective scene, only letters, dialogue and action Craig sucks. Music rules though.
