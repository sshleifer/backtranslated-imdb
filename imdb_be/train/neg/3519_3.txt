There is some Stallone movies I like, but the film does not meet my expectations low. I found the film hard to believe. For example, a bunch of terrorists to crash land in the desert, ready to survive for at least two days. In addition, in all of this desert Stallone and the company continues to work through the bridges and stairs that provide convenient short-cuts or plot devices. In addition, the Treasury Police did not give up, nothing to local coordinates rescue people. In addition, the bad guys, who could not hit the side of a barn with a really high-tech looking automatic weapons. <br /> <br /> I loved the villain John Lithgow in the original, but the nature of such a complete psychopath, he doesn "t care at all about any of his own bad guys, whether all of them are killed. In the end, I just could not believe the character. <br /> <br /> Not worth the price of rent is not even worth taking the time to look.
