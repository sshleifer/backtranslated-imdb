This movie was terrible. Well, my favorite film "The Wicker Man" (1973), so I always had to be a little biased. <br /> <br /> The story wanders along, throwing enough to make the key elements of the original term "remake" is highly questionable. (It was not a virgin, but an allergy to bee. WOW!) So many things that make no sense and inexplicable that I fear that Mr. LaBute Sun horror movies do. (As the two men, we have clearly seen, exploded in the car at the start are alive and well at the end of the movie?) Cage looks haggard and confused throughout, and his character is prone to shouting "Rowan?" At the slightest noise. The "bow" to the original annoying as they come off as tacky and not as an intellectual respect. For example, some cases reflect the original (girl fall out of the closet, pretending to be dead when the Woodward / Cage is looking for the island) and a few lines of dialogue rip directly from an original script by Anthony Schaffers and push in. <br /> <br /> I'm sure others will provide more and more detailed analysis than that, I really can not be bothered to write more about this film. It lacks any substance. Throw it in the dustbin with all other remakes that tarnished the good names of films they were "based" on (in this case, very little).
