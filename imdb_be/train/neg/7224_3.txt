The film remains in gray too long. Very little gets to explain how the film is progressing, with as a consequence, a lot of weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning, but because of the way the narrative they are just strange, and it is not clear to watch. It's kind of forces you to watch the movie again, but not like I'm not going to do that. This is what I watched this movie in the morning, I'm sure that if I watched this movie I fell asleep in the evening. For me, the film was like a poor man's "Blade Runner." <br /> <br /> The film leaves too many questions and improbability. This makes the film leave meaningless and lasting impression. <br /> <br /> In addition, the strange look of the film is not very helpful. Film Halve CGI / halve the real life, but this is not done Halve like a good, spectacular, exciting and creative, such as will be the case in later films such as "Sin City" and "300". They even created Halve the characters in the film with the help of a computer, which seemed like a very pointless- and odd choice, as well as considering that the character animation is not too impressive to watch. Of course, a futuristic environment still looks good, and the film was clearly not cheap to make, but his style over substance, and in this case, that in fact is not a positive thing to say. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines are also absolutely awful and uninteresting. The chief god of the film keeps saying lines such as; "I'm going to do it, but it's none of your business why I want to do it. What just nothing at all i Horus say it is annoying and very simple thing to put in the movie, if you do not care to explain anything about the plot . in addition, the deeper issues and the meaning of the film is confused in absurdity of the film and its script. <br /> <br /> The actors still did their best. they seemed to be that they believed in the project and were convinced that what they would have done something special. So I can not do anything bad to say about them. <br /> <br /> the history and ilm is far from the original. It's a rip-off from the great classical and semi-classical, mostly modern, sci-fi films. This, perhaps, is the reason why the film made a very excessive impression on me. <br /> < br /> A failed and uninteresting film experiment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
