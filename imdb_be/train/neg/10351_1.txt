This film was hardly the storyline of the film. All of the fun moments in the book does not even exist in the film. They eventually turn it into a cheesy "twin" the Disney film "crush" the story between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad it had to be Hilary Duff plays a role, or one of these. This film was nothing more than an insult to the intellect and the mysticism of the book. I can not believe that Disney might even get away with hands making a cheap, basic execution. If you ever read the book, I think you will agree that it can be easily converted into a film "Lord of the Rings" equivalence. This film should never have been able to use the name of the crease in time. Poorly done.
