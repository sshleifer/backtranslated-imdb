Thanks to some infamous home video distributor, which led to the so-called German independent series of four to Venice is not only terrible, but really awful. So badly that I had to discharge a second hand shop of goods for extra cash. <br /> <br /> Nick and Charlotte married couple, have reached an agreement about sex only on Tuesday because of their hectic schedule of their profession. Eva and Luis vapor couple who lives from hand to mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Luis, the painter. Nick indirectly causing Eve to lose his job as a waitress. Louis and Charlotte was having an affair on the back of Eve and Nick. Luis cheated Eve lying on it, he will fly to London to do something related to his works of art, but the fact that he is flying to Venice with Charlotte vacation adultery. Eva kidnapped Nick and pulled her 2 children together in Venice for the confrontation. A trip to Venice in the end, as Nick and Eva are falling one by one. <br /> <br /> In the presentation of the journey from Germany to Venice between none and Eve noted the failure of the comedy. This does not only look pointless but draggy. In the film, Nick tries to help a number of ways, but it is inconclusive. This is either the strangers around him, which acts like idiots, or they are simply stupid. <br /> <br /> The comedy also had a tendency to add unnecessary scenes to extend the story. While some of the problems that can be solved with common sense, no one in the film does not use common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go through a big circle, to solve this problem. <br /> <br /> It can not be so bad, that even the beautiful scenery in Venice you can not pull up the reputation of the film.
