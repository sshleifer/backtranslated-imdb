There was one positive to this film? Critics, who knew nothing of video games may find mistakes made games. No loss with damage clearly visible in the direction of the start be a prime example. <br /> <br /> And maybe missed something, but was not Super Mario Bros. 3 is suppose to be a game that had never played before? Well, if this is so, and I did not miss anything ... like a character Fred Savage, and even a girl, so much is already known about the game? We say that some people do not know about them second or third play-through. <br /> <br /> In addition to the actual game and the error is a general low quality of the film itself. Nothing here is honestly very memorable. The child was not even that good at playing video games in the footage they showed. Many of the children I had known at the time were much more experienced. Besides all this action and the plot just mediocre in their strengths. Symbols are soft and very uninteresting, the "Master" (the youngest child) is very quiet, completely dry the child's cliche a little child, who almost never speaks because of an injury. It's not that it's impossible to have is the fact that he had to be cast in the movie is actually even begin to form a plot that will exceed even 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the only value that can be found here for nostalgic. If you grew up in this film you're going to love it, whether it was good or not. It was the children who play video games, and in that time, you've seen that you probably had an obsession with the NES, as well. But if you did not like him as a child there is simply nothing that will keep you interested, and very little that will not let you turn it off. <br /> <br /> No, sir, I did not like,
