I do not think this movie is worth nothing bad script, bad game for Janine Turner, not fancy, stupid story, dumb-ass husband and unfair divorce settings except. If you've never seen this movie before you even do not bother, it's not worth it at all. The only thing that was good about it was that Janine Turner, did a good acting job. husband Terry is delayed smart-ass lawyer who won a lot of cases, and even dishonest guility killers away. He thinks he's so smart, but he's really just a nut. Her best friend is dealing with her husband and gives it. Lovely girl case. Yes, she's a real peach, no. It is not a day at the beach, too.
