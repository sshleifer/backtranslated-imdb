The original show was much better. They were to leave on a good note. This film has killed the whole idea. It was sad, too dramatic, and funny parts were too far away to between slack. This film really seemed that she was trying too hard to be serious, and it's definitely not what I wanted from this sequel. Not to mention the fact that for a long time, it was just depressing about the same thing over and over again. Yes, I'm sorry, Tyler Perry, but try again next time. This movie is simply fun boring and not funny either. Sorry. 4/10 Stars it. <br /> <br /> Jay Addison
