Scary movie. If there is one Turkish film you do not see in 2006 that there should be Banyo. What a waste of time. But a couple of cheap laughs this film has achieved anything, we must, zilch, zero. Dialogue cheap, and sexual clich√©s over it. The director should watch more films, before forwarding it on their own. Red-headed woman show examples of what an actress should not do. If you are interested in how not to act is a fine example of bad acting. The only good thing I can say about the movie, wait, wait, there is nothing good I can say about it. I must have really liked him to write about it a lot. Jeez!
