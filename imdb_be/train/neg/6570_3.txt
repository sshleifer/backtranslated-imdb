I never found Charley Chase is very funny, despite the fact that his on-screen character sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, which I think is very funny. (Charley Chase also reminds me of gowky Hen Brun from comic book pages Scotland «Sunday Post».) The best films of Chase, I'm inclined to admire his professionalism, not ridicule him. I'll give Chase credit that his best films - such as "powerful as elk" and "His Wooden Wedding" - inspired by fandom who are fiercely loyal to him ... but I am sure that even the most die-hard fan Chase, you see, that the very early and very raw "married to order" just not funny <br /> <br /> Chase. - an eager, clumsy, unlucky, unfashionable - a young shepherd hoping the court just Rose. Oliver Hardy gives the best performance in this film as her blowhard father, who despises the Chase as "rag". Leo White, who made more prominent work as a foil for Chaplin Essanay, arm here as a competitor. <br /> <br /> There's some action, providing Ingersoll hours. I was intrigued that the brand name is mentioned in the named dialog box: this is an early example of product placement? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the main flaw in the "married to order" is casting Rosemary Täby like Rose: it is meant to be the standard-issue ingénue but Theby - flat-chested, hawk face - - physically wrong for this role . Theby (wife of Harry Myers) made a successful career as a screen actress, but never had a plausible ingenue. Film historian William K. Everson worked with her very prenebrezhitelen in one of his books, films. <br /> <br /> I'm going to vote for "Married to order" only 3 out of 10 and I have charity ... because I continue to suspect that Charley Chase was something that everyone else gets, but I do not missing.
