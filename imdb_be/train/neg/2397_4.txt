Nicolas Roeg? He directed the classic supernatural thriller don `t look now, he does not byl`? Oddly enough above the film was not shown on BBC television at the weekend that he did tonight`s screening cold sky does not promote what so ever. <br /> <br /> you see `s impossible not to compare with COLD SKY nadevayut` t LOOK NOW, as they both have the same director and the same structure as in the first third of the cold sky, I thought that they also We had the same story, except for the dead husband has been replaced instead of a dead child, in fact, my mind was set on the film revolves around a heartbroken widow's grief, seeing her late husband ran Venice wearing a red jacket. It doesn`t occur, but about one-third of the way through the working tam` massive twist and, despite the significant turnaround syuzhetu` nd not explained in any great depth. In fact, very few are explained in the cold sky, which destroys the film <br /> <br /> The man mentioned rather poor production values ​​cold sky and it`s impossible not to notice them. If I was not 'entirely different, I would have thought that this TVM, since ono` s got made-for-TV feel to it up to a large white letters in the title sequence. Rogue is also trying to bring art house through the claims saying the thought processes, but again this doesn`t help the movie at all. One feels bad feelings Rogue assistance should make every effort in the plot twists and turns that are completely discharged on the screen <br /> <br /> Cheap production values, selfless direction and really strange room and a script to make a bad movie
