Well, I'm not going to criticize this film in depth. I note a lot of the reviews beforehand elogious me, and as I generally like Medeiros, I no longer dare to make a disparaging comment - and thus almost a year. But every time I see the DVD on my shelf, I feel an inner groan. In any case, let elogious votes to override me! . But for the other moviegoers, I - beware <br /> <br /> Expressed in simple terms and softness, that's my position: <br /> <br /> political upheaval and overthrow the background software for the film and served as a background for a particular period of my life - through the newspaper I read every day in the local average of the European pub. At that time, I went for newsreports, but never fully realized that the bracket has been traced. Journalists tend to report any non-party to the conditions, or conservatism, which is frowned upon any group of breach of the peace or inciting rebellion against the establishment. These were times when other wind unrest swirled through Paris, Berlin, Prague, and various places in the United States, in which all the questions that I clearly understand it at the time - but the dictatorship or not, my papers, as a rule, are govermentment Portugal simply institution - not as well concretized "evil empire", to use a light-hearted as possible Star wars <br /> <br /> so, week after week, I read a violation, but could not find a reasonable editorial that can provide. history behind them, and evaluate practice and socio-economic consequences of the dictatorship, etc. <br /> <br /> So, when you buy this movie, I, at least, two hopes: to finally understand the details, leading to social unrest, and enjoy a well-conceived drama. This film gave me none. <br /> <br /> The film suggests that the audience already have enough knowledge and deep emotions on the historical facts. And drama - well, as I said, I want to encourage the film industry and Medeiros Português, but. - is banal and shallow <br /> <br /> I got my copy of the DVD from France - "Official selection Cannes 2000 -. Un Certain Regard» window shows the smiling clean-shaven actor, host gives the victory sign in a fashion that reminds me more . Playboy bunny After viewing the works, I wonder what the French would think about it - although how shallow part of the "cinema Verite" »with a sizeable ethnic content, I can understand their natural inclination to praise him for his" honesty ", but .. . <br /> <br /> Look at the back of the box: "Un Regard chaleuruex sur is Revolution" - it is warm suv communication? Try that describes the deposed Allende and murder with "warm" connection! Try to Czechoslovakia in 1968! Try and overthrows civilian uprising with the entire queue <br /> <br /> Another tip :. Medeiros renoue »avec son to pay, the son of Enfance et al son Histoire» Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish on the! at least for me. <br /> <br /> I love Portugal. In all of Europe, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favorite city. But my love for the city and the country does not specify empty film. I will hang my old VHS tapes Capas Negras and A Cancao de Lisboa - this time, I'm stuck with a zone 2 of the above title, which may also go in the garbage.
