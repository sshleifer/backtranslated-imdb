I do not know about you, but what I like the Tom and Jerry cartoon is (often violent) the interaction between these two characters. Mouse in Manhattan to see Jerry leaving Tom behind to adventure in New York, and as far as I am concerned, this one is definitely suffering from a lack of a cat! <br /> <br /> As magical as the study with Jerry "Big AppleÂ» may be for other fans of T & J, who commented here on IMDb, I could not wait for this self-indulgent rubbish to the end, so that I could look the following cartoon on my DVD. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only part of the whole episode that I really enjoyed was when Jerry almost "bought the farm" hanging precariously from the end of broken candles, hundreds of feet above the bustling expensive.
