What incomprehensible mess of a movie. Something about a cop who removes the bullet from himself after he gets shot and keeps them in a glass jar in the bathroom (and on the jar size he was shot about fifty times now) and top secret tank guarded five or six incompetent soldiers who for some due to travel to Mexico. whether they were sent there on purpose or just really really lost is never clear. And you'll never hear another scenario has the word «butthorn» either. Gary Busey attempts role of Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon" and while Busey is serviceable actor scenario damns the whole movie to mediocrity. William Smith takes another turn as a Russian soldier, the same character he played in "Red dawn" a few years ago. After the game Heavies biker for most of the 70s, it was kind of nice to see him expand his range by playing communist heavyweights. Unfortunately, it will probably always be remembered best as the man who Clint Eastwood whupped in «Every Which Way You Can».
