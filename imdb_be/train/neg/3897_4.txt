The difficulty of comedy has I.R.S. Agent Tony Randall investigation eccentric family farm in Maryland, which never paid taxes; Debbie Reynolds, daughter of a farmer's Tomboy, which puts the squeeze on the not so selfless person taxes. Debbie, of course, made their share of lower theatrical comedies in this period - and this one is no better or worse than others. The picture starts bright, but the flags in the middle, becoming possessed by a demon and brainless. Randall is not a bad match for Reynolds, but the vehicle itself defeat chemistry. On the basis of Â«The Darling buds of May" of the novel EP Bates, with poor sound mix, causing all the actors sound as if they are stuck in the echo chamber. ** from ****
