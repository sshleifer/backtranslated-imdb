Recently, I have been subjected to both the film and the «King Arthur», on a DVD-ROM, other favorites for the evening "entertainment", and together they will achieve nothing more than the bearing with the growing notion I have that modern film-watching public is completely non-discrimination, and the content as long as they get the "action". Both the film was complete rubbish. <br /> <br /> No matter what happens with the development of your character? Whatever happens, a constructive dialogue? Whatever happened to the ACT? And watching that vague claims to be "historic", no matter what happens with an attempt to seize some degree of accuracy, some realistic idea of ​​"political map" of time, even a slight aroma of the era, especially in its social attitudes. Why do they have to reflect the set value of the 21st century in America? I read on message boards that disclaimer, "little was known" dark ages. This is not the case. Significant amounts are known, with great scholar scholarship on the era, but these jokers just could not be bothered to do homework. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to vote 0/10
