I thought that the film, which boasted a cast including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrews, it may be worth a look. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Pretentious complete nonsense from beginning to end with both O'Toole and York overacting wildly. I watched it twice and still have not the slightest idea of ​​what is about. I feel O'Toole plays Laird Scottish castle, which has a problem with alcohol and love experiencing the children's games with his sister (NY). He also barking mad. But other than that, your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> The film is not a mitigating whatsoever. I can only assume, the actors and the director blackmailed into making this sad, deprived of representation, unnatural bad manners. Obviously, the waste of time of talented actors and the director. Risible.
