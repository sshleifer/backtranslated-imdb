Each new line of fall up the show deserves, at least, my "3 strikes and you're out" policy. I give comedy 3 chances to make me laugh, that is 3 full episodes. After Episode 1, I actually said "TV canceled tomorrow." It was bad. Now I watched the first 4 episodes «Cavemen» and still could not even smile. Nha giggles And laughter, giggling, as a matter of fact, no movement of persons in general. I will continue to punish yourself by watching every episode of the future, because I am convinced that I obviously do not have something in this show. I just do not "get", but I believe that comedy on a major network television in prime time, just to be funny; but no laughs from me for now. There's just no way that ABC put on the least funny comedy of all time at 8:00 pm I know I need to be an inside joke, that just is not jiving with my brain. I have read all of the previous comments, I "get" the social aspect, but WHERE jokes ???? I will continue suffering for at least 30 minutes a week, while I have the time, the lamp lights and popping in my head, shouting "Eureka".
