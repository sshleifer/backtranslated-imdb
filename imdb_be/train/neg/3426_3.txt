As an advocate of the manga and anime Go Nagai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE JACK, etc.), I'm looking forward to it. I've seen a mango, or anime, so I had no preconceived keep. Good thing, too. What we have here is a series of stupid movies erotic type, which is used to turn on with frightening regularity on cable channels late at night. While the hand compared to what gets rammed down the throat of regular cable viewers (the naughty bits of our hero or tasteful harvested for strategically glued scarf or decorated with funny sunburst effect), have extended scenes of bondage and torture, to lend the proceedings only enough smarminess, making it unsuitable for children. While I have nothing against naked female characters, I dislike unprofessionally made movies (there are at least four in this series). On the positive side, there is at least one stunningly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes I have ever seen. This is not surprising, egg BOY Leg never made it ...
