This is at least the third remake of the film, so that if during his view, there is a sense of deja vu, do not be surprised. All they did was to change the history setting, and say it in different ways, but these differences are not significant. And it's not getting better, because the plot spoiled to begin with. It never works. And like its predecessors, the current mediocre. <br /> <br /> The plot has a unique finish that will surprise anyone who has never seen it before, but the ending is not entered into history. If this film ended ten minutes before it would work and it was very nice, and I would have thought it more appropriate. But here's a spoiler and that in the end the crime does pay, because the perpetrator has not been caught. I do not like this post as a result of the film.
