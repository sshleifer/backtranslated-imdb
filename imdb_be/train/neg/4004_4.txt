As a huge fan or a series Cracker, I waited 7 years for subsequent addition. This episode, I'm afraid, just do not live up to the legend. <br /> <br /> Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years for his daughter's wedding and gets involved in the investigation of the murder of a soldier who suffered flash backs of his life in North Irland, goes on killing spree. <br /> <br /> what I did not like about this episode is an extremely convenient way of all this put Fitz and fed to the killer. This is all the fat far-fetched. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some good scenes in flash backs from North Irland, who shot high.
