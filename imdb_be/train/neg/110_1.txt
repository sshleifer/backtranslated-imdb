I've got this film from the library right now, and I did not finish it. It's so bad, I'm at a loss. Audrey Hepburn has completely lost his talent, although it is pretty much finished with him in "Robin and Marian". That's the worst thing about this terribly stupid movie. It is really only of interest because it was her last feature film, and because of the appearance of Dorothy Stratten, shortly before her murder. <br /> <br /> There's nothing but idiocy between Gazzara and his minions. Small signals and small bows and nods to real screwball comedy which is turbid, a pale shadow. <br /> <br /> Who could believe that even some of the same Manhattan neighborhoods that inhabitable Hepburn as MAGIC and even mythically in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" twenty years ago? The soundtrack of Sinatra's old songs and songs by Gershwin, from which it takes its name too loudly and clearly - you sure do not need to wait for credits to find out that something is subtly woven into the cine-picture Musique know when a song thrown at you. <br /> <br /> Â«Reverting to type" means to go back, and go back down, I think. In this case, elegant European lady Audrey Hepburn everything you see someone who used to be a time actress and always a star. Here, she even lost her talent as a star. If someone whose talent continues to grow during the period, as well as Ann-Margret, played a role, it would be some life in it, even with the incredibly bad stuff and Mongoloid level situations. <br /> <br /> Hepburn was a great man, of course, more than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful film actors. After this terrible speech, she continued to do the brutal TV movie with Robert Wagner called 'Love Among Thieves. In "They all laughed," it's as if she's still playing the ingenue in her 50s. Even many Weiner and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted on this as Lana Turner were much more effective than Hepburn. Turner took acting seriously, even if it was bad. Hepburn is not taking it seriously at all, can not be messing with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. Her last really good job in "Two for the Road", perhaps its most perfect, if possible, it is not the best in many ways. <br /> <br /> And the girl who plays country music singer just sickening. John Ritter awful, there is simply nothing to recommend this film, but to see Dorothy Stratten, which was really pretty. Otherwise, critic David Thomson often used the phrase "to lose his / her talent," it has never been more meaningful. <br /> <br /> Ben Gazarra lost all sex appeal as long, so we have 2 movie Gazarra and Hepburn --who could ask for anything less? Finally, miserable film Sandra Yes "Lost" from 2 years later, the low-budget and nothing was more than that. At least Mrs. Dee said in his own voice; by 1981, Audrey Hepburn accent just sounds silly; it will go on to make "peace gardens with Audrey Hepburn" FBS and there it somewhat annoying accent work as she walks through the formal gardens with aristocrats or waxes excitedly about "what I like most, when the flowers back to nature! 'How to naturalized Narcissa, but in real fictional film, it sounds ridiculous. <br /> <br /> To think that "Breakfast at Tiffany's" was so light poetic depth view things with Audrey Hepburn, one of the most beautiful women in the world - it was undoubtedly one of the most beautiful screen presences in "My Fair lady", matching Garbo a few things and Seyrig in "last year at Marienbad." And then this! And her final brief role as an angel "Hap" in the film Spielberg's "Always" was only a lady of things - a banal, brainless and stuffy <br /> <br /> I went to her funeral on Fifth. Avenue Presbyterian Church, excellent service, which included the chorus sings anthem Shaker "for boys Simple Gifts. The only thing that is not mentioned in the program has been a sudden the game singing Hepburn" Moon River "on the fire escape in" Breakfast at Tiffany's "and it caused a lot of emotions and some real tears in the meeting. <br /> <br /> a large woman who was once a good actress (as in "the nun's story") and one of the largest and most beautiful movie star in many films 50s and 60s years, which were really bad -. it's not all that common and, perhaps, it's just a great person, who, in the creation of things like film performance trivial, however, is the width of mind to want to have shortcomings showed mercilessly - that her whole end of the movie work is contained in abundance most of the talking about miscasting Hepburn on '. my Fair lady. "But the one who was supposed to have the original actress was not in it," wait until dark, "which starred Lee Remick on Broadway. Never as marked as Hepburn, she was the best actress in many respects (Hepburn was completely unable to play anything really miserable), while Hepburn was at least adequate enough in this part. After that, all its actions have gone down.
