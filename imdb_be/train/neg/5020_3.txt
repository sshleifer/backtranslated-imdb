This is the most messed up recording on IMDb, I have not yet come across. All the previous reviewers act like this movie. This is not a movie. Most likely, it's just a short film that is extra on the DVD of the film «The One» It is also far from being 90 minutes, it is listed here. In fact, it is a little more than 13 minutes, how cool can make Jet Li martial arts. and his thoughts about the film. So yes this entry IMDb very little FUBAR. Do not listen to any of the other reviews as they are all wrong. You can trust me, because I will never feed you, dear reader, BS. <br /> <br /> and it's true. I think one can say that I "Single" reviewer that matters.
