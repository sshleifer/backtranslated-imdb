The full title of this film is a "station: Race Against TimeÂ». It's a race, no one can ever win, but you can, of course, reduce the supply of money-losing without losing their precious "Station" on this bakvaas. This film was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made K3G look honest. He strained credulity too far. It was ridiculously stupid in its storyline, and deserves to be ridiculed him. <br /> <br /> it's not quite as bad as Baghban or black, but this film has nothing to recommend it. Silly, pointless, with a ridiculously OTT performance Amitji. Central "plot" is another bad example of roughly manipulative propaganda, a parasite so many "family" the BW films. If my father, who raised me and who I love dearly, treated me like Big B did Akshay, I would have shot him myself. Not to mention the trivializing of terminal illness.
