This film does not have much in common with its predecessor «Robot Jox». This should also be the cause of its most common name «Robot Wars», rather than an alternative name «Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars». <br /> <br /> «Robot Jox» was basically a fun movie to watch because it was a good prerequisite for the giant robots battling each other in the near future. This concept was abandoned for this film, and instead it has a very dull story, which is also not very original and cleverly written. Too bad he was trying to be so much different from its predecessor on the fact, for another it could possibly have more fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Also, it's just not very good as the «Robot Jox» is a B-movie, but like a big difference. Perhaps it should also be the fact that the «Robot Jox» was achieved during the 80s, when the B-movies still had a certain charm and a bit of class on it, despite the fact that the film was released in 1990 was it really can not be said about this film. It's just lame, did poorly, poor appearance and not exciting enough. It also has an ending that leaves you thinking, "Is this it? Is that all? ". <br /> <br /> The fact that the film is his story lacks well understood the basic plot line actually. Maybe a good villain would be a good idea, and some other things, such as the actual point in history, some action, or cute main characters. <br /> <br /> Seriously, what were they thinking when they chose the actors for this film. All of them are just not cute in his role, and especially Don Michael Paul annoying as chief hero who behaves as if he is God's gift to women and Mr. Perfect, who can compete with anyone. Do not have yang even just able to get the actors from the first film? <br /> <br /> For this futuristic film with the concept of a large droid in it, this movie is certainly not enough to his action. If they are more and more any the action in the movie, the film, at least, was more interesting to watch. Instead, we now have a film that does not fail to impress in the main everyone frets. <br /> <br /> you can better look "Mighty Morphin 'Power Rangers »episode for some action and likability. <br /> <br /> 3/10
