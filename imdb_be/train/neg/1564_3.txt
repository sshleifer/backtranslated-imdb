... it was so that I could, in good conscience, tell everyone how awful this movie. I only made it through twenty minutes before I started to think to myself.. "Wow, that's too bad," And, frankly, I would give this movie 1 star if it were not for Esai Morales (although he had very little time on the screen). It is only good film acting role, which is a shame because I really like Bellows ... or at least I thought I did. <br /> <br /> while watching this, I began to think back to the turn in "The Shawshank Redemption" and realized that it was not as good as I thought it was. The problem: his prison house / tough guy act it seems that this is just an act; his dialogue sound like it makes a very bad impression. Did he ever met someone who tells how his character was? I doubt it, but maybe he should have. <br /> <br /> And, to make matters worse, they were able to bring a little prison-house philosophy and make it not seem to be something other far-fetched, especially if we consider that the rhetoric is now flooded to "stretch" one accent was so strong that seemed unnatural. <br /> <br /> I do not usually slam a movie like this, but when I saw the movie it was pretty favorable review. I felt that I had been deceived and lied to, and I thought I should try to save someone suffering from being able to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I say BOOOOOOOO.
