In the name of Pinter, every knee shall bow - especially after the speech of the Nobel Literature Prize, which did little more than throw canned by-the-numbers, a sixth form of anti-Americanism. But it is even worse; not only is a tour-de-force talentlessness, a perfect example of how to get away with coasting on your long-standing reputation, but it is also a massacre at the highest part. The original detective was a masterpiece of its kind. Yes, it was a theatrical confection, and it's easy to see how this central plot device will work better on stage than on the screen, but it still worked terribly well. This pride is a piece of Michael Caine, but let's face it, Kane Sun Olivier. Not only that, it does not fill the shoes of Larry, he could not even fill his bath slippers. Appropriately named Caine, after all, precisely the average actor, whose only real recommendation, as well as many British actors, their longevity in the business. He was a good, Harry Palmer, beautiful in Get Carter, but that's yer lot, buddy! Give it a very wide berth and stick to the original beauty. This is more than half of Pinter.
