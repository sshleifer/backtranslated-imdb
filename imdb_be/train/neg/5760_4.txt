Well ... I was going to wait until it came out on video to see it, and I wish that I was, I actually caught a scary movie 2 by cable the next day, and it made me miss more of the same, I GOT plane was on CRACK ... I mean, if you like aircraft or any other vehicles, Leslie Nielsen, you are probably in the heavens, but if your used to the usual Wayans comedy, then you will be disappointed there was a lot more eye candy in it, which will keep the young hormone raging teenage boys are happy that in ragodna why it was a box office hit in the first week it came out. I enjoyed Scary Movie 2 ten times, then this food, and some once in 5 more. Strangely enough, it is better to 3 is part of the 2, but then again I always loved Halloween 2 is better than the original as well..maybe its just me. The funniest part of the film has to be an Alien Say Goodbye. But it was not worth the $ 11 I spent to catch the matinee this with my fiance. Save yourself the cash and catch part 2 again on the cable until it is released on video tape, and then rent it, do not buy it.
