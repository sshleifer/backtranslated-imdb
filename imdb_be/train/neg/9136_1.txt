When the movie started, I was shocked when I saw it was shot with an inexpensive video camera! In fact, the camera is shaking and looks worse than the average home movie. Even the straight to DVD movies must have production values ​​better than this! Heck, a large percentage of home videos uploaded to YouTube have better production values! Too often, film seriously, it seems, made sticking the camera on a tripod and turn it on - without a human camera! Closeups and nothing like the camera work is absent in some scenes, where they could work in the other too much or poorly framed plan. Yecch! <br /> <br /> The film is about two gay men who want to be married. times certainly have changed - their only option was married in Vermont as though it was made almost a decade ago. However, the recent adoption by same-sex marriage can in no way be attributed to this film - if anything, he established gay marriage supporters back in place to help as a movie stinks and never tries to solve the problem seriously. According to the film, one-dimensional religious people idiots who are EVERYWHERE Bible and shoot people, and a wife who have homosexual spouses minded, when they find their spouses are living a lie - go figure. I'm sure glad that it gives a fair chance to both sides of this issue! <br /> <br /> The bottom line - shows no professionalism at all, and I'm even embarrassed to call this film is nothing about the film. It's more like a home video and not even worthy of listing on the IMDb or even the inclusion in the list of 100 Bottom IMDB about the worst rated movies of all time. Actions terrible, terrible writing, direction (even if it is) terribly, camera-work is awful and terrible story. This is the home cinema !! There's nothing positive I can say about it in any way, except that which makes the films of Ed Wood, it seems like Oscar contenders in comparison, and I am sure that the ghost of Mr. Wood smiles every time someone is watching for this mess! <br /> <br /> I do not care if you are gay or straight - this movie is not worth your time, and I do not know how they managed to create DVD-drives it. I believe that one of the actors, burns them on your home computer in their spare time! Seriously, it gives new meaning to the word "bad"! <br /> <br /> By the way, when one lady in the film was a real lawyer, not being able to read is an important condition? I'm just saying. <br /> <br /> We can not last, same-sex marriage was such a serious and important issue, to have a film that is better than this, that fixes the problem? This one, unfortunately, only invites laughter.
