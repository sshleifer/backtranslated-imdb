This film is a good example of how to destroy a book in 109 minutes. In addition to names of characters the film is very similar to the book. The book is full of strong Latin characters, and they are, for the most part, non-Hispanics. There's no character development in the movie, and we have no reason to love or hate the character. And remove the complete generation unforgivable. Isabel Allende has written a powerful book, and a book that should be read!
