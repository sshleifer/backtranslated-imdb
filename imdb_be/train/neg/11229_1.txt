They forced me to watch it at school and it was awful. The film is obsolete. Episodes are misleading because the fact is combined with fiction, to make the story more interesting.The teacher talked about this as a delicacy, but in fact it was excruciatingly boring experience.I read that very few people who are in the cast but most of them do what they do in the movies in real life.This falls cheese very often. In addition, very often the story gets a little challenging and far-fetched. I do not like how some of the lines were written, and it is a pity that they were more important to them. Although it was written educational, funny, suspenseful, and thigh, it ended up being a boring, dry, far-fetched, and the old. I hope that no one takes a long time to see this movie, because you would be just fine without seeing it.
