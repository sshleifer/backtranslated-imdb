I was pretty much convinced to write this review for several reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen 2) If it does not get more reviews will not be listed in the list is constantly while the worst films - that he deserves to be 3) I was kind of lucky - I paid five pounds for it. I've seen it in stores for 15 pounds. Do not pay that much for this film! You will be very angry 4) There are many movies out there in the horror genre, which did not give a fair assessment (in my opinion), and gives the film a higher rating than their criminal <br /> <br /> The short story: A guy without friends meet drifter who promises the world - well, the magic ability to appear to everyone else as someone else. Our hero insidiously transformed into a teenage girl and joins them gang - sitting on a swing, babysitting. He kills them one by one, until it will not be tracked and found by the police. <br /> <br /> Why is this so bad? For the start of the VERY VERY bad. Someone compared it to the production of school. No, this is worse than any action I've seen on the school stage. <br /> <br /> I bought a number of previously banned films with vipco DVD company and was not as disappointed as I was in it. good, bad acting, but the film can not deliver in any other sense. What's the point in making this movie, even when there is no blood! Well, no gore. What more could a film like this offer? Breats? No, not even some kind of tickling! <br /> <br /> it's true, this film may have a certain charm in its unique naffness but any potential buyer / observer of the film should be fairly said that the film, in the best case, it is worth only one in ten.
