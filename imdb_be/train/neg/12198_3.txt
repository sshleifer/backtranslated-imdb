Growing up with transformers Beast Wars, I was not familiar with the original Transformers, and now, when I saw a strange movie, and now, when I saw an old cartoon on which it is based, I must say that I like the original cartoon and film live actions more than Beast Wars. <br /> <br /> not that I do not like BW characters, I just think that characters like Optimus Prime is better than Optimus Primal. <br /> <br /> I mean, "Autobots transformations and roll!" sounds much better than "the Maximals MAXIMIZE!" The voice of the original Optimus Prime still makes me a strong believer that he is a true leader, more than Optimus Primal . <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Powermaster Optimus Prime is much more powerful than Optimal Optimus. Just take a look on the website! <br /> <br /> Megatron in the nature of BW was more like a humorous version of the more wicked version of it in the original series. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is steeper, changes in animal robots or robot changes to vehicles and spaceships? Give me the original transformers any day of Beast Wars!
