I do not often give star ratings, but the computer will not allow me to make negative numbers. <br /> <br /> The opening titles tell us that we are in deep water already. Despite the fact that this low-budget exploitation film has 17 credited producers. No. No. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story abusive husband Kenneth comes home to his family in the prestigious gated community. The house is a pigsty. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger) gave the children run amok all day. <br /> <br /> OK. We are already in deep water. Ms. Basinger was 55 years old when the film was released. Well, those of her children or grandchildren? It's Christmas. Della enters a mall, a long scene that could be reduced. To hitting home idea eeeeeeevil rampant male aggression in the universe she passes by players in the full form of the game in the pouring rain on Christmas Eve. Of course. For a bonus, she sees a car with murderous deer tied to it. <br /> <br /> We get some virtually unknown in the driving scenes, though. The rain and the traffic is bad. First we see Della try to go and smoke at the same time. Later Della trying to drive and talk on your cell phone at the same time, at one point turning all the way around to check bustle back seat charger for the phone device. <br /> <br /> She wanders the mall, see a college old friend, tries to buy things, but her credit card declined- Gosh, maybe her husband was grumpy because he goes all-in, but it is too difficult for the script to follow. <br /> <br /> parked much it goes against the most absurd gang in the history of cinema. One white boy (Lukas Hass watching his career go to the toilet), one black, one Asian and one Latin American. Imagine a company who went to the bad, and you'll have an idea. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that they have a gun, it gives them attitude. Police Shopping Center came to investigate the noise, and they shot him in the head, firing several times. Parking crowded as it may be, people all over the world, and no one notices. <br /> <br /> Della escapes in his car, and instead choose a police station or a well-lit safe area, she goes to the construction site, where it kills all four bad boys in one of the simple tools (literally ) on hand. <br /> <br /> MAJOR spoiler ahead. <br /> <br /> She drives back home. Poops car so that it passes through the pouring rain. Checks on children goes down, and when her husband asked, offended that she got it at the mall shows him a gun and shoots him at point blank range. <br /> <br /> Experience with four punks should have been as a result of personal opportunities for Dell. Instead, we know that her children will probably spend Christmas in a foster home or a group home because the state will collect them while she answers the charges of murder. Four punks can be classified as justifiable homicide in self-defense. Husband, another story. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad that I saw it on cable. If I had seen him in the theater (it get any release?) I was furious. As I sad seeing talents like Ms. Besinzher and Mr. Haas to spend yourself on junk like this. <br /> <br /> One very good thing, though. It was written and directed by Susan Montford. Ms. Montford not yet received a letter or ordering the loan from the date of transmission of this excrement. There is justice in the world.
