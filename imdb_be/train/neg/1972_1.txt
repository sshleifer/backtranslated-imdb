It really does not do justice blues. It starts badly with from the Voyager probe images and Blind Willie McTell (or was it a Blind Lemon Jefferson? Who is blind anyway) appears, telling of outer space (?) And told us stories about the life of a variety of blues musicians. Trite as it is, it can be visually the most interesting part of this documentary. After that, the only thing to see is actors incompetent mud classic tunes, shot in the 20th fake black and white inset with like Beck and Shemkiya Copland raping the same songs after. This is a good tool to show us why the old blues great were really so great, but it does not make for compelling viewing. There is almost nothing here that would justify making it a film, not a radio play. No one should be forced to see it re-enactment of poorly done. It's a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially the blues. Avoid at all costs.
