"Son of John Hughes wrote the high school drama! Wow! "I thought as I checked the information you click here on IMDb, late on a Saturday night to find himself watching the opening credits on BBC2. <br /> <br /> I just finished watching, and, unfortunately, it was worse there. Perhaps you can not spoil the film, the poor, but I'll leave spoilers in this review ... <br /> <br /> There's an awful lot of style for very little substance: unfortunately, the style is not on too good for eight years since its release. As to the merits, the film tries to put an interesting perspective on the nature of governance in the society through the microcosm of school life; but under the shiny veneer, vaguely large or the corresponding argument is not justified. Characters are drawn in children, in broad strokes, getting a generic stereotypes writer father tried to raise the issue in the Breakfast Club. <br /> <br /> The director Kyle Cooper does a decent job of keeping up the pace (perhaps relying too much on the installation information that soon becomes tedious device, but at least pushes the story along), but his efforts did not enough to detract from a bad script and bizarre casting (someone, presumably in the direction of a "Maddox" when Blake Shields gurns and indignation his way through the part, I just can not understand it), not to mention the numerous disclosed plot holes (I for creative license, but if the "bad guys" know names of the "good guys" that makes their life in pain, but did not take any action to stop them, you really have to wonder why this scenario has not undergone several re-designs to the production - even the Pope even read) <br /> <br /> I'm sure that the young audience can get a kick out of this film (and all power to them ?.), but they are in fact better to stick with high-performance Hughes-school senior, and if the idea of ​​school time is a riot that appeals to Reall 1968 classic "If ..." is a significant more satisfying of the matter.
