This film is a kind of let me down. It seemed very much like the movie Jaws when Hopper told the mayor to close the park was when Roy Schieder said the mayor to close the beaches. They both said no way to it in the summer! But the box says Hopper is to enter into the mind of the killer to think like one. But it's really nothing too interesting or exciting to do. I'm not even a little confident that he and his partner have any experience doing police work, if they are in the office wondering how they're going to solve this case. They simply say, allow us to police work, and we will solve it. And what's going on with all of the old sticks. I did not even think they were mob bosses. And then the guy who wondered black guy chose to handle to find the killer. With its one hundred dollar haircut and he thinks that his Di @ K is the size of a school bus. Well, what Cruddy line. I thought he was going to hit him with a baseball bat, as well as in other films. I got this film, which is used and will not be buying a new one. I suggest you skip this movie. Yes, and it was interesting to see the microphone above the stage, where a funnel is going to get a coffee.
