Real swollen film literally. This British film made sick. <br /> <br /> What a fascinating story! A suicide bomb contains a train. How could the writers and producers of the bitch to turn it into such a stupid story? <br /> <br /> Glenn Ford as an expert called to defuse the bomb, are horrible written material to work with. Naturally, just as he called his wife, Anne Vernon, he is going to leave him. It is not surprising that we have never heard of Miss Vernon. After this film, it would be enough to end his career. <br /> <br /> This is an older man who loved trains and our version of senile dementia interferes 1953. I thought it was very disappointing to show the man, even at the end.
