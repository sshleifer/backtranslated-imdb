I watched the whole movie, to wait and wait for something really happened. Maybe it's my fault, waiting for the evil and horror, not psychology? It's amazing retelling of the myth of Oedipus: I want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him? I do not understand why some elements of the plot were to imagine why the construction of the top, why there is a large staircase with the perfect place for someone to fall to their death, when no one was actually going to do so, why the scene at all with his father at work why such a good kitchen, if you are just going to eat mined, why the boy wanted to be baptized, and parents will be the ones to resist, and not vice versa. I see a lot of good reviews for this film ... was my taste was damaged by going to '70s B-movies and old Sci Fi movie?
