With all the contempt of this George Stevens Sr. "epic" with miscastings and misreadings, I can only wonder what James Dean "legend" might survive this trip, I would argue that while the studio bows cashier training bank "giants" came framing its own «gigantismoses». It was not Rock and Liz that much better. Let's just say that TV show "Dallas" was a true "heir", even if Contemp (tuous) last days "Texans" as Lay and wait, not to mention our imaginary "president" of these here Yewbenighted States Amurrika, perform one upsmanship with nefarious global proportions. I have never read the original Edna Ferber, but will lay odds that's head and shoulders above what is on the screen in this document. And all those well-paid, I would imagine, "supporting" the actor notes and celebrities, though, "Giant", in my opinion, at least, the dwarf poor advantages, not to mention the promotional campaign.
