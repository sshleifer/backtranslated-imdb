I just saw this movie tonight, and I must say that this is a mess. I love Vince Vaughn, but he ends up being more annoyed that funny here and the film more than the less crappy remake of the 80's classic "Santa Claus film", but from camp or poor Sheena Easton song at the end. .The history of your commonplace black sheep in the family, who returns to face his family for the holidays kind of things, but with the North Pole at its setting. Of course, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is a family spinning, who comes home after a series of set backs, which include his girlfriend (Rachel Weisz in a cameo), dumping him, so that he comes home to face his parents and more successful brother Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti) and silly hairpin turns going with a little bit of rivalry and related anarky, and that poses a threat to all Christmas. Now, when you think that you know the ending of this movie, I think you would be right, because it is predictable on the mound. As for the action, Vince Vaughn plays the same lovable loser, he always plays, but this time he comes to be more annoying than nice, Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus, but the role is larger than the smaller one note, Elizabeth Banks Santa helper playing, but it's not a big part of the character at all except neurotic and bad jokes Kevin Spacey ends mostly played by one and the same person that he plays in the film Â«Glengarry Glen Ross," but a little more anal. Only two actors who come out of the film with their dignity intact is Paul Giamatti, who brings a real sincerity and warmed to his role of Santa Claus, but he looks a little embarrassing to be in the movie, and you can not blame him Rachel Weisz, who manages to do so much more with a very small role, than most of the major actors make of them, which is a shame, because as Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserve much better than what the script given them. <br /> <br /> To put it in a nutshell, the main disappointment.
