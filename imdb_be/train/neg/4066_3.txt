The director Eric Stanze years «ISOYC, IPOYG», the three men are being tortured in the hands of women, they are all sexual violence. The first victim is forced to eat his own shit before axed to death. The next guy ends up with a bullet in the perineum after giving anal sex with the corpse of the first guy. But it is the third person who gets it the worst :. He must follow the heavily tattooed "star" Emily Joaquim undress and masturbate with a broom (Oh, he also gets a pen shoved the butt, too) <br /> <br /> And, unfortunately, so that we (get to see her masturbate, that is ?? not get a broom our butts!). <br /> <br /> Yes, «ISOYC, IPOYG» is a harsh experience of view, not because of his ruthless violence, but because Joaquim, who is obviously under the misconception that it has the body of a goddess (as opposed to the fact that with the road for Metallica) constantly receives dollar naked for the camera. It's not very nice. <br /> <br /> In addition to the non-stop with nudity ennobled up Joaquim, viewers can also see the terrible direction from the Stanze (who thinks that the endless shots of tombstones and trees is entertaining material), some really bad game, and the penis . <br /> <br /> fat guy oddly enough, I give «ISOYC, IPOYG» rating of 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than its current 2.9 average. That's one point for dirty attacks axes (which, as Gore-Hound, I actually enjoyed); one point for a bit, where the fat guy gets his face pressed chocolate mousse under the guise of feces (paddle); and one point for the sheer nerve to suggest that this film could be somehow continued high operating Meir Zarkhi classic I Spit On Your Grave.
