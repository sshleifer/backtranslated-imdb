This is the most disturbing film I've ever seen. This makes the "Requiem for a Dream" looking like a Disney movie. Although, technically, it is quite well done, acting, cinematography, music, direction, etc., are good. Nevertheless, the final gang rape scene is the most terrible and cruel that I've ever seen, and I'm really sorry that I have not seen him. I'm afraid that it will haunt me the rest of my life. Although I think that anyone will find extremely disturbing film, my wife and some of her friends were victims of a very similar way, and I really do not need an explicit reminder of the horror that they experienced. I saw the film at SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas, and none of the actors or crew members were not present. I would like to have the opportunity to defend the violence in their film, which I felt was excessive, gratuitous and unnecessary. Earlier stage successfully passed the mood they seem to strive for, but do not rub your face in the extreme and obvious sexual violence. This film should have a large warning sticker on it. For these reasons, I would not recommend anyone to see it. You have been warned.
