This film has to be the worst I've ever seen. The name of the film brings the audience into thinking that maybe hope. The storyline of the film ridiculous, at best, poor acting so you just have to crawl. The name «Zombie Nation» implies zombie hoard, when in fact there are six in total. It can not be classified as a horror film in connection with the introduction of 80-cheesy musicians as "attack" zombies. Zombies actually speak and act like human beings in the film, with the only difference is the makeup that looks like something out of A La Roux video. If you ever get the chance to buy the film, then do so, then burn a copy.
