I saw this movie at the premiere in London, and I have to say - I was not expecting much, but I was expecting something that was at least mildly entertaining <br /> <br /> The original "Basic Instinct" was not . a great film, and even something of the "golovnh classics", but it was interesting. I can recall countless times, flipping through the channels on TV late on a Friday or Saturday night having come across a movie and find yourself starting to actually pay attention to it. <br /> <br /> However, this lame brain, waaay- belated sequel has nothing to do. Is Sharon Stone is still great? Well, let's so - to 47-year-old, she's pretty hot. She is as beautiful as it was in the original? No, it is too obviously plastic surgery on her face and her hair in this movie a few unattractive. It does not look like a soft, real or innocent, as she did in the original. - something the whole point of being evil seductress, and whatnot <br /> <br /> The rest of the performances range from horribly bad - and Michael Caton-Jones (typically safer director - someone who does not always do a great job, but it is possible make decent films) officially unveiled its first real turkey; a film so bad people laughed at certain points that have been assigned to be serious. <br /> <br /> I heard that the film has gone through several editing sessions, and it is very clear from the outset. Nothing has no special meaning. The whole plot cosmic disorder and the end - oh! Talk about a silly and unbelievable. (. However predictable, though) I saw "Gigli" I saw the "Son of the Mask" - and although I'm not looking for a "smear" the film, I can say from my own power (which you should not agree with the general notice ) I prefer both of these films during this debacle. <br /> <br /> By the way, Stone left five minutes before the movie started, and people in the theater started to throw things at the screen is particularly outrageous and offensive orgy scene in the type of night club <br /> <br /> Â«main instinct 2 ". - basically, this is no good, too.
