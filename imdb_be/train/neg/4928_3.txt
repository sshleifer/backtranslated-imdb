This is a romantic adventure, it must have seemed a shockingly subversive day. A wealthy upper-class English woman charts, graphs and manipulates everyone around her for her own pleasure. It uses its privileged position to proceed with the secret activities decisively against a social nature. There's a clever twist as her sex-role activities prove it more bold and daring than most male characters. But, of course, there is a tall, dark and handsome stranger, to keep up with the love interest, and this evil lady is not back in coming forward when she meets the right person. <br /> <br /> obscure weaknesses and trusting each character makes the story unconvincing in the extreme, but those who crave Romance miss it.
