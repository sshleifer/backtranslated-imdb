OK, first of all, the video looks like it was filmed in the 80 years I was shocked to find out it was released in 2001. Second, the story was all over the place, as soon as the story is confusing. If there was some kind of a short prologue or introduction of stories already it would have been better. Also, I appreciate the imagination, but the film was too much. It was strange and poorly filmed. Scenes do not flow smoothly and the characters were amazing. It was difficult to follow, and maybe it was the translation, but it was even difficult to understand. I love Chinese epic film, but if you are looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film I would recommend Promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development) is not that movie. Beware you will be disappointed.
