Why do I keep doing this to yourself? I mean, really, it's just in the title - "The Incredible Melting Man." What else to expect? I must admit that I'm a sucker for just about everything that I stumbled on Monsters HD channel, but only a softening of this picture is that really grotesque makeup job legendary Rick Baker. As for the worst, I'll give the nod to this horny old codger vapor sucking on lemons just before lights out. Now they were really scared. <br /> <br /> Something I could never understand why the monster horror films of the victim is not just simply run away when faced with virtual annihilation. Like a chicken in the cabin. You know, there was a door completely visible in the kitchen, she could run directly from at any time. Incredible Steve-O can not collect more than brisk walking, so why not just blow right by him? I do not know, maybe I have something missing. <br /> <br /> This movie had some sense of "Tales from the Crypt" episode, but "Tales" as a rule, have a cool or grotesque twist that often times you do not see coming. It was a picture that you might not fully get a handle on the coming or going. For example, at the beginning of the scene, you can clearly see that the human eye Melting apple fell out of his head, as he was able to get around to the rest of the story? I think we should not be asking. <br /> <br /> In the eighty-four Minutes, the painting was about a half hour too long. When it was over, I was ready to take on Perry General on him earlier proposal - "I could really use a drink about now."
