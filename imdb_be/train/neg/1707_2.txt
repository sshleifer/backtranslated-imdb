You can tell from the first frame to the last, he did not care one bit about the movie or the story of continuity, he was just happy to be making a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> The fact that the end result shows a lazy filmmaker who loves zombie movies. It would be great if he was just out of this care. The final result is an infinite zoom to other poorly done gore, and even worse produce metal playing over it. <br /> <br /> What happens when you combine high hopes, big dreams, a decent budget, hard work, and one idiot behind the camera.
