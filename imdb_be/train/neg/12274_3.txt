I'm usually not one to say that the film is not worth watching, but it is certainly a mitigating circumstance. The only true growth potential in this film Cornelia Sharpe, looks pretty good, and the fact that this film is really short. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is incredibly boring and goes almost anywhere throughout the film. None of the characters are not even remotely interesting, and there is no reason to care about anyone. I do not know why on earth, Sean Connery has agreed to do this film, but he would have definitely passed on it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could see to see this movie if you are die-hard fan Sean Connery and just wants to see what he did. Save it in the end though. <br /> <br /> Well if you somehow miraculously end up seeing it, despite my review (or any of the other reviews on this site), I hope you enjoy it more than I did . Thanks for reading.
