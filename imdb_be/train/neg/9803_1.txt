Rangers power is definitely the worst TV shows and did funny plastic toy line in the United States history. <br /> <br /> There's absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining about it quite awful TV show. <br /> <br /> This is just the worst show ever made, with terrible actors dressing up in colorful costumes spandex, which look absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The owners of this show should be ashamed of yourself, as there are entirely merit in this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Children today do not have to try to see the best show in the movie Toy Story instead of garbage.
