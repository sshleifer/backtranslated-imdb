This film is mediocre at best. Angie Harmon, as funny as hammers bag. Her evil behavior from "Law & Order" is transferred to an unsuccessful attempt to comedy. Charlie Sheen is the only one to get away with this terrible anti-comedy. The only positive thing to come out of this mess and Charlie married Denise. It is hoped that the effort gives the best results.
