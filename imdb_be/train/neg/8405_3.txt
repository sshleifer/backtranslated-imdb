Before seeing this film, I was expecting a fictional drama based loosely on the idea of ​​the book; instead, it is a book that was interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating different "disease." It does not bother me much, but it interferes with my enjoyment of the film. One story, or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed through the film would have been preferable, in my opinion. If you are going to build a film on the text of psychology, you should find a more interesting (and preferably exactly) the text than this. The film drags in parts where it's a little more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century sexual psychology, and it would be quite unbearable if it were not of a sexual nature (because "sex = interesting" for most of us, even me). Fortunately, there are a few stories with factual developments that pull us. <br /> <br /> But, disappointing, the theory of Krafft-Ebing in sexuality went unchallenged for the most part. I was hoping that he would use stories to show how imperfect his archaic view of psychology, which is still held by many to this day. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, what do you have? A detailed catalog of several fetishes and orientations, with some moderately interesting stories, showing the trials and tribulations of a number of "sexual perverts", before they are cured. For most of the film, the film moves at a speed of crawling (and mood) at the funeral. And, obviously, a low budget film, cinematography and action is not quite the top tier. Although I * was * happy with the music, costumes and interior design. <br /> <br /> I felt the subject of this film was right up my alley, and I still feel that this is lower than the average movie. He deserves 3/10; 4/10, if I was feeling very generous. I can not imagine anyone enjoying it when they do not already have an interest in sexual fetishism.
