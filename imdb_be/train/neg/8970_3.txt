The first cube film was the feature film. He created a world in which were represented all the major archetypes of humanity, and showed how they are struggling to understand the hostile world, that they could not understand. It was, on the non-literal level, and "man against the tough nature of the" story, where a man who represented innocence and kindness came through in the end, celebrating the encounter with a new, uncertain world of petty quarrel man; a world where there was no more fighting but of the world. I am ranking Kubik 10 of 10, and a film that was never meant to have any extensions. <br /> <br /> The second film, Hypercube was a massive disappointment. Some ideas were like cool, but in the context of the original film and history, and the installation does not make sense and there was no sense . However, for what is quite interesting, I rated it 5 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The third film, Cube Zero, while ignoring the second, playing as much inferior to a commercial B-movie rehash of . first, no symbols there "tribute" or "tribute" here, only tear same plot, with some elements idiot modified (as with letters instead of simple integers between the cubes - idea, which shows more clearly than anything else. it's a rip-off with absolutely no originality, and have nothing to say). <, Br /> <br /> what we are seeing something of a "behind the scenes" does not mean anything, because observers are only part of the Big Bad of the experiment, the architects of which we do not hear anything. And in this film, those who get through to the output (for example, Kazan made at the end of the first film) just killed - where the * bleep * is the sense in that? It's just silly to Flippin. I'm glad I did not pay to see it. <br /> <br /> In the production values ​​and acting in a cube Zero is not so bad, but the story and the idea is so completely devoid of any inspiration that this film can only get from me is rated 3 out of 10.
