Take the SciFi original movie and mix in a small alternative / revisionist history, and you will receive «Aztec Rex.» Perhaps Hernand Cortes, before the conquest of the Aztec empire, was the first to conquer the Tyrannosaurus Rex and her partner. This is the thrust of this film. Considering the story he could really suck; the fact that this is the only kind of sucked the tip of the cap to the writers. There are a few problems. To begin with, Cortes plays Ziering. Even with a black wig, Ziering, Cortes is about as convincing as Axl Rose plays Gandhi. Although Cortez conquering indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztecs here seem to play an all-Hawaiian ensemble. Casting aside, T-Rex (s) look quite good, although every time one of them gets shot is just oozing CGI. They die too easily; I suppose, if T-Rex have been around in real life they are likely to be cut, or at least wounded some pretty rudimentary, 16th-century weapons. But it takes something from the movie. There are also some graphic T-Rex-swallowing-human scene, which is surprising, but in this context, I thought that they were working normally. There's plenty of action, and the whole angle of colonization spread around, but do not overload the angle of the dinosaur, unlike another recent SciFi original dinosaur movie «Warbirds.» In general, a mediocre (but decent on the SciFi original standard) movie, the stakes are modest 4.
