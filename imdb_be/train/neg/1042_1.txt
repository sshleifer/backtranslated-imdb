First of all, write a script on a napkin. Who needs more than that? In the end we are not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Then you get amateur actors. It will be good for the advertising festival. After all, who needs people who have spent years honing their skills? Then hire a filmmaker who does not know how to light. You see, if it's well lit, it will not look like a "real" festival and people did not like it. Who should have the professional level photos anyway? Then hire a ten-year-old, who has never held a camera to be your operator. This will give the film that completely amateur bar that festival rumble would be a mistake to "reality" and to ensure that even if you have to empty the place of real people, critics and a small piece of the audience, which will be more or intellectualize scream "genius" because they do not believe that it was just a complete amateur hour. <br /> <br /> Once you have done so, buy a ticket to the festival of bad movies aka Sundance. <br /> <br /> What's sad waste.
