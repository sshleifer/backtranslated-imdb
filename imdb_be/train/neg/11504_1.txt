AKA: Mondays In The Sun <br /> <br /> I have no idea what I just watched. Three men aimlessly and drink, to grumble about everything and everything in its path. This must be a drama, but the fact that it is a total waste of a film, without a redemptive quality. <br /> <br /> I read the reviews touting appearances here as "excellent," "beautiful," and "heroic." I'm afraid I can not agree that these people were not supposed to come off as the most stupid ignorant proto-humans who ever went to. <br /> <br /> All in all? this is not a film. He wanders around and lose all but the spectators. I watched it three times, but not for the life of me see what someone sees this litter There's nothing deep here, all this crap <br /> <br /> He fare ZERO / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> hostile...:.
