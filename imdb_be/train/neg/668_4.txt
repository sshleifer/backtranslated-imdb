So, Prom Night was supposed to be a horror film and a thriller movie. I'm a big wimp and was scared to see this film in the beginning, but after seeing it, it is neither a horror or thriller. <br /> <br /> I was mainly ridicule the film in place, because it was so predictable. It is possible to predict what will happen next. Young actors play well on his character, but I must say that the killer was definitely at the top of the game - is acting wise <br /> <br /> Yes, I'll give props for the scene, because. It is good, but it's not as exciting or scary. It has been almost zero "jump in your chair" scene. So, do not spend ten dollars, seeing it in theaters, wait until it comes to DVD.
