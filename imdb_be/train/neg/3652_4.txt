I watched this movie in the DVD format. My copy of which may be affected, but I was disappointed by the lack of a DVD menu screen. I will say that my primary reason for watching this movie was Claire Forlani. While fun to watch, I feel that it does not live up to my expectations, I still found on his other films. I actually was equally glad to see Arkin wrapped in a humorous performance. Two other actors, I was not familiar with so I can not compare their performance, but they were very pleasant and. Valid only endearing quality of this film, in my opinion. The storyline, while some might say a little convincing, lacked direction. I believe that the main problem stems from the script, but not the direction of the film. If you like any of these actors in a fair degree, I recommend this film, but otherwise leave it alone.
