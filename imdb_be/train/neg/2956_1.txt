What was she thinking? File: Whoopi Goldberg plays a cop in the future, which has teamed up with the dinosaur says to the case of crime, which leads to a madman who wants to start a new ice age (!). Straight-tape strangeness awkward and funny, high concept in search of themselves. Perhaps, it was a labor of love for him, written and directed by Jonathan Betuel (who also served as one of the producers); Unfortunately, the end of anemia, be compassionate. The mere presence of Goldberg on the screen can often spark of good will and laughter, no matter how poor the script, but here she is drowning, and you can see unfunny results. star is not from ****
