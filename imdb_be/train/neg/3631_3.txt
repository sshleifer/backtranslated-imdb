However, Sun Parsifal opera that can appeal to everyone, but this is my favorite, Knappertsbusch, 1951 in particular. Syberberg whole approach is so static. Each time, when the music suddenly begins to swell ... Syberberg keeps throwing that moves at the same pace. It takes Amfortas and Klingsor endless. Whatever happens in the film editing? As a result of physically tiring to watch. The viewer never spiritually transported. Your impulse to rush home and play the record again to confirm that Wagner got it right, Syberberg got it wrong. And this set of jewelry from the "smart" reminders Wagner's anti-Semitism - will there ever be a spectator of this film without prior knowledge of Wagner?
