Another film with an interesting premise and some amazing special effects, who falls right in the trash side. <br /> <br /> Sadly direction and performance (with the exception of the beautiful Annabel Schofield, which is much more attractive as a brunette, and probably deserves better material, and ever seriously Charlton Heston), make the rating a real stinker. <br /> <br /> strange to see Heston perform up to their usual pairs and to show how really bad this film. He even played in the sub-plot that kept me interested just to see how it is tied back to the main line of the film. How they will eventually solve was that they did not. It just falls off the end. <br /> <br /> In fact. Do not waste your time on this.
