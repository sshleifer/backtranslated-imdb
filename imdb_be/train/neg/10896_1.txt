I know that you've read that before, countless other films, no doubt, when you read the comments here but bait Academy still stands as the absolute worst film I was able to track down. there is no doubt that the really bad is not even available for purchase, or watch on TV, but even so, I feel that it is fair to mention that I'm not just some dumb tenant who chose poorly. <br /> <br /> I "saw two-thirds of the lower ranked 100 films here on IMDB, and I left ticking with every chance. most of them stand head and shoulders above this ... excersize in absolute monotony. <br /> <br /> I would like to evaluate the really bad movies (they have no humor, even how bad they are), how many people you have to watch it with, to make it all the way through . if you can see it for yourself, it's not so bad. If you can watch it with one another ... it's bad, but it could be much worse. <br /> <br /> It took five of us to make it all the way through bait Academy. and not even the usually funny moments to watch bad movies (spotting boom microphone, for example, 3 times in this, if I am not mistaken) can pick up the dry taste in the mouth. Yes, I would look, but I would have made 4 of my friends to watch it with me to achieve this goal. <br /> <br /> I hope and pray, we saw the director cut ... to think that there may be a variant with more than 20 minutes the large eyebrowed tips with the child of the sebaceous glands of the body rub just strikes me. so much of the film centers around it. <br /> <br /> I really applaud De Coto control to lens the film for two days on a short budget, just as I applaud him to persuade people to pay him to do that, without a doubt, a ' a celluloid version of some of his fetishes. but it is not a good film. the original horror shop was filmed in the same period of time on the comparative amount of money (inflation-adjusted) and was a complete gem. that is no excuse for how bad this kid. <br /> <br /> spoilers ahead ... <br /> <br /> It is not even necessary to choose apart formulaic plot holes or know it all the symbols of the hero ... Shagan film nya ... crazy ... anything ... interesting for the length of time decoteau devotes himself massaging the breast. no matter what your alignment or rubbing the floor ... just can not stand this kind of screen time. <br /> <br /> acting entirely cheese ... but not too amateur ... I've seen a lot worse than better movies ... but somehow this semi competent delivery of some of the worst lines you'll ever hear in a movie that really warps. <br /> <br /> rent it when, like me, you have a fascination with the worst of the worst, and only if you intend to watch it with a group of people who are willing to work to get through it. it does not ha-ha-ha many things dangling. this is a test of endurance you'll probably want to skip. <br /> <br /> I'm sure what's worse ... but I would not be surprised if he has a name on it decoteau.
