This is a feature film, which was either made in 1969 or 1972 (National Film preservation Assistance Foundation says the 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date of the film, of course, seems to be highly indicative of the total period of time - with some camera-work and Pop Art style that are clean late '60s-early' 70s <br /> <br /> The film is. of three simple images distorted using various strange the foci of the camera. These distorted images accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialogue or plot of any kind. It was obviously designed almost as a form of performance art, and, like most of the performing arts, it is interesting at first, but quickly becomes tiresome. The film, put more bluntly, it is a common hole and would appeal to either, but perhaps those who made this film, their families and friends, and perhaps some people are just too hip and "with it" should be understand us mortals.
