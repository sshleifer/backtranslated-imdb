One of the "majority" of films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for children. This film does not have one. This poor excuse for a body double fun Christel blunt Eric Brown. To top it off, the film or stupid or silly when he tries to be funny, sexy or dramatic. Laugh embarrassed, as we must believe that the teenager will go alone to bury the dead woman in his backyard. Think about why a woman known for vigorously Emmanuelle needs backup. As the film went on and on, I began to imagine a hybrid of private lessons and Little Miss Millions who were Kristel seduce Jennifer Love Hewitt as Howard Hesseman makes us nostalgic for WKRP. Watch this to laugh at the stupidity of others, or for the perfect fulfillment of Ed Begley, Jr., or wonder what Kristel will look with Jennifer Love Hewitt. But I can give you an idea of ​​the lesson, keep away from the goggle film Kristel, not Emmanuel.
