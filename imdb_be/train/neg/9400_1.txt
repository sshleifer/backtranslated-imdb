It is very sad when a film such as this is done. A lot of work and money have been invested in the film, which is amateur at best. <br /> <br /> Editing drags on, there are obvious mistakes that could easily be corrected in the second take, and the soundtrack is prosaic. So much more could be done with this video of the movie. I believe that they did not have enough time, or videotape. <br /> <br /> Hand boom have an excellent amateur feel to them.
