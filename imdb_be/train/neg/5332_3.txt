OK, the stereotypical "Indians" image in this story is just wrong. I agree that Elvis looks pretty good here, but the way his skin color seems to change throughout the film. I thought, well ... he's never so much sun in real life. These are some of the most explicit brown "Indian" makeup, which I have ever seen. It's just as bad as "Indians" in the «F-Troop» and old Hollywood westerns, who played the Jewish and Italian American actors, not real Native Americans! <br /> <br /> This film is good, but, as a rule, is lame story and mediocre songs, as in all subsequent films of Elvis. He just did it, because Colonel Parker tied his long-term contact of the film to squeeze as much money out of Elvis as possible! I keep thinking, "Thank God," which Elvis stopped making movies permanently not long after this film was released. It's great to see a character actor Joan Blondel, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in the film, though. <br /> <br /> «Indian» makeup Burgess Meredith absolutely HORRIBLE. This is the worst of the bunch for sure. Which have been the filmmakers were thinking? Was Mr. Meredith is doing it once for the money, or what? I like some Elvis movies, though. For example: 'Love Me Tender »,« Jailhouse Rock »,« Viva Las Vegas'. I can even watch his film with the future of TV co-star Mary Tyler Moore and Asner, «Change Of Habit», where Elvis played the inner-city doctor. <br /> <br /> Well, at least, Elvis made some good films, but mediocre and poor overload decent and kind. <br /> <br /> I will always love ELVIS! Thank you, thank you!
