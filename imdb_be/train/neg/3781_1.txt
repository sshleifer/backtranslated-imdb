(Some possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that Dreamworks was thinking when they decided to plunk down $ 80 million on this extremely tired and chrome animated film. They probably thought that spectacular animation will be more than enough to bring the audience (mostly family) to see it in droves. Well, it seemed to work on the weekend, it was $ 26 million., About, and totaled $ 38.1 million. Total (estimate for this weekend). But I think that the audience who came to the weekend saw a lot of the same thing that I did when I saw, and they spread the word. This is one important lame film, except the animation and everything else, basically the script seems to be done three years ago. <br /> <br /> The film is only about 80 minutes. long, but it feels like three o'clock epic. Several sticking points for me, well, annoying narration of them, and it is so obvious it is written. At some point, he escapes from some kidnappers and even if you can see the horse clearly frightened, vanity narrator (the voice of the talented Matt Damon), to clear any misconceptions (which will only occur in very simple mentality. <, Br /> <br /> another constant dad with Bryan Adams songs, now I'm a supporter of his music, I think he's good, but come on Dreamworks really think that viewers will be able to handle 8-9 not one of his songs in such a short film, I, Of course, he could not. and finally, and this is spo the Euler, the horse gets a shot at close range a member of Calvary, at least, it (the horse), and then falls into the raging river spirit (of the film focus) tries to save her, but they both go through the waterfall, which must have at least a drop of 50 feet, and later in the film, towards the end, we see that this horse is alive and well. Now I know that this is a film children, but even this small amount of realism is unacceptable. <br /> <br /> in summary, it is really lame, it may vie, I am not saying that children will not use it, but someone else will check my watch just akayuts this scar to the end. Definitely in my Top 10 list of the worst this year. -. ** 4 Star <br /> <br />
