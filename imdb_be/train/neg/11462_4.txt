I love monster movies, as a rule. Even if they are far-fetched and silly. But it is hard to like this movie, if it so implausible and stupid and trying to take yourself seriously all at the same time. As in really chic sort of way. <br /> <br /> While the idea of ​​a few actual as killer whales are known for killing great white sharks, it is very difficult to find it scary, I can not help but just see an angry killer whale destroying things. Especially because one of the scenes where some buildings demolished causes Orca-x to do ... and while it will explode, dealing jumps out of the water, and felt like I was watching a show at Sea World fireworks. In addition, they are killing a lot of scary moments, before they even hinted that they are going to happen. In addition, it takes several jabs at JAWS. Its like, "Hey, look, we have actual and we can think of a good reason why killer whales attacking." <br /> <br /> Yes, you're not paying attention to your egregious **** ups in logic, of course ,, but JAWS was one thing your movie does not. Its scary. Yes it implausible. Yes it somewhat provocatively. But to be honest, real or no, the killer shark is not close to being as bad as Great White. And the poor attempt at character development and writing just sick anymore. Even JAWS revenge worse than that.
