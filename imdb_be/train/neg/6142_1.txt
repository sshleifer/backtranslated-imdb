Gimkat without a doubt one of the worst movies ever. But not the bad kind of bad films. This one so terribly fun to watch and laugh. Kurt Thomas is clearly not a lucrative career in acting. He should go back to the gym. But who can forget such memorable scenes as the bar with chalk, stone con or five minutes of chase scene through the village lunatics in slow motion. I do not think it should have been a bad thing, but who can say. This is not art, but if you want something lightweight and fluffy, making a good conversation, gymakta rent. It makes for a fun evening.
