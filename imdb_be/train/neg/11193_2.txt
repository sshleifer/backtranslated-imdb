Well, I did not have high hopes, but this film went deep, I could not imagine. <br /> <br /> The story, as it was attended by a priest of unknown member of the order of 2 investigates the death of the founder of the order using the Sin Eater. Sin Eater allows Catholics to attain salvation outside the Church authorities and is another immortal in the film with loads of apathy. Nevermind, it does not make sense, because then a Baptist can give you salvation .... we'll move on <br /> <br /> I plot the layout without giving a lot of information :. The priest went to Rome with his friend in investogate. He brings with him a mental patient (I'm not making this up) who took it during excorism and who loves him (not a single lick of this explains BTW), a drunken Irish priest and Peter Weller, as Cardinal. They get to Rome, to find some horrible child who does not do anything in the film, meet the anti-Pope, a drunk Irish guy knows with bondage gear S & M (not explained) and giving information by killing people (oh, by the way , he is a bad guy so that he has an industrial / techno soundtrack), and then ... um, seriously, I'm not sure. plot meanders on. You are shivering with the Sin Eater, is flying to New York from Sin Eater for Overnighter, and then some other things happen, and then (all from the camera), the anti-pope falls, and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> About 1:00 in the film is very interesting one, if something happened. Until the end, something happened, but you can not be sure that all that matters, and since most of the drama takes place either before or outside movei scren you really feel cheated.
