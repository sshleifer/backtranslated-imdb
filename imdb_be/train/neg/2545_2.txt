There are laughs in this film, that is for sure. Michael Keaton talent, and he used to be funny (before he decided that he was a serious actor). However, what bothers me so much about this film as unpleasant almost all the characters are. In addition to two main conclusions, each jerk. I mean, these small city lost approximately as uncouth as you can get. You just watch and think, man, these losers have to be unemployed. In addition, US factory portrayed as lazy and ungrateful slob. It made me wonder if this film was made by Japanese nationalists. Yes, of course, in the end, they all come together as one, but I just did not enjoy the trip to get there.
