Nightmare Weekend evidence that some people are so desperate to be "in the movies" they are ready to do whatever you want. <br /> <br /> I do not mean the countless women who seem quite happy to appear completely mad in this awful piece of garbage (in the end, naked female form is a beautiful thing, and nothing to be ashamed of). No ... I'm talking about those who are more than willing to cooperate with the stars made bad hand puppet named George. Now it's awkward !!! <br /> <br /> The bio-electronic, which is created by a brilliant scientist Edward Brake (Wellington Mef fert), George (who looks like a crazy clown with a green felt coat hair) is an artificial intelligence interface for an advanced computer system, which operates a revolutionary device (silver sphere the size of a golf ball), which, when ingested, can completely change the nature of the disorder. <br /> <br /> Edward's face changes in the experiments was successful in laboratory animals, but the cautious scientist does not want to be tested on humans for fear that there may still be side effects. His evil assistant Julie (Debbie Laster), however, has no such hesitation, and continues to use the three beautiful young women as guinea pigs. Inevitably, they are transformed into hideous mutants assassins. <br /> <br /> With discounted special effects, casting totally devoid of talent, and a story that is almost impossible to follow (I wrote as I watched the movie, and even then I'm not sure that my summary exact), Nightmare Weekend with 'complete and absolute disaster that even a few soft core sex scenes and a touch of dried blood can save. <br /> <br /> This film also has one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a horror movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), A Walkman wearing idiot who BOPS off crap 80s music in a manner that makes I look like Justin Timberlake in comparison.
