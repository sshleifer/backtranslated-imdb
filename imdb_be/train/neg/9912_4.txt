I totally agree with the other reviewer here who was pleased with «For The Birds» won an Oscar in 2002 for "Best Animated Short" is not sick stuff, pretentious at best and turning to someone, of course, who does not have belief in heaven or hell. <br /> <br /> animation was good, but so many animated shorts. And, by the way, I love black humor, but it just was unattractive from the start <br /> <br /> What the history here :. guy walking around and surrounded by nothing but gray (symbolism here) told the TV (which has 'Is every few hundred yards), that he is in any heaven, hell or purgatory. Every time he puts a gun to his head and shoots himself when he heard the news. I think that would be funny, in two of the three cases.
