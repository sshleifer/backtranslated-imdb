This film has a lot of potential - a strong cast, reasonably strong and clear idea of ​​decent budget. I'm not sure where it all went wrong, but each of these elements has been wasted. History did not go anywhere, the characters were hollow, to say the least, and the result was very sad, pointless waste of film. I hated it. Judging by the other voices, I in the minority here and there must be some kind of freak. However, I thought that this movie was terrible. I had high hopes but was very disappointed. Of particular disappointment was the character of Jodie Foster. Very cheeky "fixer," a kind of doing a good idea. Jody was confident and sexy, but the character did nothing and went nowhere. Denzel Washington played the same character he always plays - nice, but nothing new.
