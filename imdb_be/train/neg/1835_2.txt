Start with the script. I have seen cartoons with more depth than the "Envy". At any time, the characters do not tire of repeating what you have seen, and it was not funny the first time, the film is in deep trouble, "Envy" is certainly there. The film, which is based on a joke better to go somewhere with him. Here we have a film that does not go absolutely nowhere. Christopher Walken would particularly like to forget that the bomb, because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller was in some pretty good black comedy "Flirting with Disaster», and «Duplex», immediately comes to mind. Be sure that the "Envy" is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings, just nonsense. "Envy" deserves this low rating, because, as a subject, it stinks. - MERK
