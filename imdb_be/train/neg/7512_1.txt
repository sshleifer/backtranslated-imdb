I had to get out of the theater. An hour later, all I saw were people cheat on their wives, schtupping like dogs in a rut, and using the f-word, as diabetic using equal. <br /> <br /> No, thank you. <br /> <br /> This was especially frustrating because the film could have done a lot. Any one of the characters would be very interesting if they were given to do more than fornicate, talk about it, and swearing at each other. <br /> <br /> A few times it looked as if they were going to be some character development, all that happened is another sex scene. Development of the site at 1 can be summarized as 1) several murders occur, 2) Vinnie to see the murder scene 3) Vinnie stares sullenly across the Atlantic / East / Hudson 4) Vinnie Cheats on his wife, and 5) Joy (the most sympathetic character in the show) He gets kicked out of his parents' home. Moreover, I did not wait to see. <br /> <br /> Taking Pictures and interaction between the characters are wonderful, but there was nothing for them to do. Flooding sex and vulgarity hardly expect another hour for something to happen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Spike. Take a few lessons from Notting Hill, and The Shawshank Redemption. Or one best study in the society and interpersonal relations.
