never watch this movie ... this is the biggest pile of sh * te I have ever met in my life. and that was saying something. acting, story and filming were absolutely boring is the worst movie in the world !!! seriously do not even give you a hit, seeing as it costs 99p from my Sainsburys and it was done only in 2005? hahaha this film as the film cheapest college you can even see the camera in the corner .... although if really want to watch it you must follow the "scary shark scene" ... possibly the best piece of acting I've seen in my life .. . haha. I mean seriously this is the biggest waste of 2 1/2 hours EVER !!
