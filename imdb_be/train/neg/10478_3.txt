I truly believe this film as another bad effort Dominican film industry. The first 30 minutes of the film a little funny, but then when they switch their roles in society (men do what women usually do, and women are doing what people usually do) the film falls. Become sad and funny. They allow a lot of things without explanation, and the end of the film is predictable. I do not like the way how Roberto Angel played his character and his little something. I went to a movie theater in the hope of seeing a good job, but I left very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
