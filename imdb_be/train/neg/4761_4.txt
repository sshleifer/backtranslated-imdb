Harold Pinter rewrites the classic play by Anthony Shaffer's about a man going to visit her husband and his lover having it all go sideways. The original film starred Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. Caine plays the role of Olivier in this version, and it is paired with Jude Law. Here, a film directed by Kenneth Branaugh. <br /> <br /> The action is exciting. Both Caine and Law are quite well in their roles. I really love chemistry and personality disharmony. It's fine, and plenty of reasons to watch, when the direction of the script fails. <br /> <br /> Harold Pinter's dialogue is crisp and sharp, and often very witty, and I understand why he was chosen to rewrite the game (which is updated to use surveillance cameras, etc.) has to offer the problem is that the script moves the characters around awful. Michale Caine law goes through it odd modern house with sliding doors and panel for not very good reason. Conversations happen several times in different places. I know that Pinter did that in his plays, but in this case it becomes tedious. Why should we have a couple to go again and again, and due to the fact that the law is sleeping with the wife of Kane? It would be nice if at some point the law said enough that we did it, but he does not act as if every time the first time. The script also does not move Caine through his manipulation of the law all that well. To begin with, that he blindly angry to start so that he has no chance to turn around and scare us. (Nothing revelation late in the game that makes you wonder why it worked) In the original, we never knew what was up. here we do, and while it has the advantage of it is also somehow feels false, because it is so clear that we have to wonder why Milo Lowe does not see that he was being set up. There are several other examples, but to say more would give away too much. <br /> <br /> Thinking about the film in retrospect, I think it's a film of missed opportunities and failures. Opportunities are squandered a chance to have the best fireworks between Caine and Law. Shortcomings in that the selection situation shouts and odd shift in the plot of consuming tensioning and believable thriller. Instead, we get some clever dialogues and excellent performances in a film that does not allow them to be real. <br /> <br /> despite some great performances and witty dialogue is only 4 out of 10, because the rest of the script simply does not work
