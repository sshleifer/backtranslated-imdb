Medellin is a fabulous place to live, work, study. I've been there twice, and I never heard anything about the Partisan activity, paramilitary taking tourists hostage, or anything like that. There are "invisible police," but this system * nya * Big Brother. There are just enough police to be visible in everyday life, but they do not hassle anyone without a good reason. <br /> <br /> La Sierra interesting documentary is that it reflects the youth in the film mainly becomes his characters. Director of the film carefully cut storylines among the daily activities of residents La Sierra, and when the "character" dies, there is a real enthusiasm. It is hard to imagine, however, that three guys are all members of the Bloque Metro, a gang that used to terrorize La Sierra to the Colombian government began to rebuild the country. <br /> <br /> La Sierra entirely accurate depiction of life in Colombia; Of course there are things to be cautious, such as petty crime, but when one considers pickpocketing occurs in the "modern" cities such as London, New York or Tokyo, Colombia does not seem that different after all. Colombians are eagerly awaiting his chance to show the world that the once war-torn country is now flourishing more than ever.
