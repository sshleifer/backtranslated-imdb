Friendly movie about Sonia Horowitz (Renee Zellweger), a pious wife Talmud Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). who are deeply unhappy. Sender brother Mendel (Christopher Eccleston) sees this and hires her to work in the field in which it is already an expert ?? jewelry. In addition, he starts an affair with her, and then, when she spends time with the Puerto Rican artist, he throws it and gives it to the family, which closes it. There's a scene in which the deceased's brother Sonny is talking to her, and apparently takes the form of a magic poor, but why is not clear. Much is not clear, unfortunately, including what happens with Sonia, why she says the rabbi there is a fire inside of her, and maybe it is not from God, but what does it mean, and what magic beggar says it means. To some extent, this story concerns the plight of women in the ultra-Orthodox community, and in the same Sonja is not entirely exempt. Nor is the concept of redemption, love a person of another race very well thought out. The name derives from the Biblical definition of the value of a good woman ?? and yet it is a bastard Sender, which quoted him as Sonia. Zellweger struggles with fractions; it must be a Jew from the middle of the west, and sometimes even her accent is flat, and sometimes it's taken on a distinctive sound of Brooklyn. She's in her best if she is fierce and to take responsibility, but ultimately the film is a mess.
