Absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. Terrible acts funny "action" (of course, that the cars go slow), a brutal scenario, outrageously incompetent and unsatisfactory ending trend to make a hash of the movie. We know that Reinhold is a great actor, but he should be ashamed of this rubble. There's no big voltage in the car and if the characters come across moments of hope, they laugh like a banshee meaningless for some reason, even "high five-ing" when they see the bridge lowered! <br /> <br /> In addition, the chain of events that led these people the same machine straining confidence. Apparently it based on a true story, though? If this is so, however, seems stranger than fiction! Unfortunate that it has been portrayed in such a clumsy way.
