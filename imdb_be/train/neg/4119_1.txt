I thank God, I did not go to the cinema to this film. I would be very sorry for the money that I gave. I saw it on TV, and I could not believe my eyes. I wonder if any film could be worse than this. They have spent millions of dollars on this film for anything. awful and terrible action script. I think that other people who have written comments are people who work with this film company;) is a very big bummer! in 2000, they can still laugh at this kind of film? ... uncomfortable
