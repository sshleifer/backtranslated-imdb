God, what a horrible thing! Oliver Stone will probably want to experiment or something (see the use of terrible music and photos here), but what really? All this for "Natural Born Killers", seems to be "smart" look at how Medias can turn into complete garbage, but unfortunately, the film itself turns into garbage. Please, Mr. Stone, the next time you want to criticize fascism TV shows with violence to get the highest bid does not do the same with the movie! Michael Haneke said quite cleverly about this film, he was denounced by the media of fascism with fascist cinematic ways. How true ... But he forgot to tell us about the massive headache you get after sitting through this too long a load of crap!
