So they hyped the violence, and it was labeled as sick. Well, violence is the best bit, I'm afraid, but, unfortunately, the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they are on them (quite predictable) excitement. This film is really a terrible scenario. We never get a chance to meet with Robert and his actions at the end are just pathetic. Act is not much better either, the worst of them TV chef and a school teacher. Direction clumsy, it is sufficient pace to send you to sleep. And what on earth all film school project? Comment on the possible movie? Using newsreel during the climactic killing clown. These guys seem to think they are intellectuals, but hopelessly out of their depth. How on earth they got a great Giorgos Arvanitis to light it, I'll never know. And they got the money to do it in the first place, it is still a big mystery. Absolutely horrible beyond comprehension.
