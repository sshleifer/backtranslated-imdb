Nothing will ruin the film for as long as the combination of poor script and poor direction. This is the case with "The Mummy's Tomb". <br /> <br /> In the script, the remaining ideas from older, more universal horrors like "Dracula" and "Frankenstein." Direction trite and stale. Acting mediocre. Harris Even Cheney is weak in comparison with the Institute of Tom Tyler's "The Mummy's Hand", and manufacturers are foolish enough to add frames with better prequel Christie Boar and point to the weakness of his own movie! <br /> <br /> Universal realized how bad this movie was, and is, in fact rebuilt from scratch two years as "The Mummy's Ghost" with a much better script and best director. The result is probably the best film in which four film "Mummy" series, although never as good as the original 1932 Carlo Freund. <br /> <br /> frames Cabanne raises the film to 3. "new" material is a 2 at best. Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably glad to see that their characters are faced with so they do not need to appear in dreck like this anymore!
