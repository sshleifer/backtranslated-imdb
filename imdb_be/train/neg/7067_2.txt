Five passengers on the bus station tell each other their nightmares waiting to be caught. But there are more of these nightmares, than meets the eye? <br /> <br /> I was lucky, five bad movies for the price of one! Each segment is equipped with the worst in action, special effects, makeup and music. And they were supposed to be scared? Hmm .. I think I was still in shock at the time of Teletubbies episode. I swear, you're sitting there, I was bored to tears, waiting in vain for something interesting to happen. Do not disturb. He never does. In fact, I even stopped fast forwarding of advertising, as they were much more interesting than the main feature. And the ending is the ultimate excuse. Yes, it all actually happened. If only the same could be said for the day, I can set the VCR to record the cobbler .. 2/10
