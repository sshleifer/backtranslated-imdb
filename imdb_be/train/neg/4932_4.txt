Silent Night, Deadly Night 5 is the latest in a series, and as a part of 4, it is not associated with the first three except the name and the fact that it is Christmas-themed horror film. <br /> <br /> With the exception of not paying attention, there are some obvious things that happen here ... Mickey Rooney plays a toymaker named Joe Petto and the name of his son's name is terrible Ping. Ring a bell, anyone? Now, a little boy named Derek heard a knock on the door one evening, and opened it to find a gift on the doorstep for him. Despite what I said, "Do not open until Christmas," he begins to open it anyway, but stopped his father, who scolds him and sends him to bed, and opens the gift itself. Inside the little red ball that grows Sant hand and head, and proceeds to kill his father. Unfortunately, maybe he should have left well enough alone. Of course, Derek then traumatized by the incident, as he watched him down the stairs, but he did not grow up some killer Santa, he simply stops talking. <br /> <br /> There's a mysterious stranger lurking around, which seems Xia, very interested in toys that Joe Petto does. We even see him buy a bunch, when Derek's mother takes him to the store to find a gift for him, to take him out of his injury. And what is this guy doing? Well, we not sure, but it seems to be taking these toys to see what makes them tick. he really keeps the owner from evicting him, promising to pay him in cash the next day and submit it with a toy "Larry larvae» for your baby, but, of course, "Larry" is not very good toy, and out of the box in the ma bus, and, of course, well, it's not much. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in the end, what happens to Joe Petto and Pinot, of course, show and as the old story, Pino is not a "real boy". Pino, probably even more excited and naughty because he is suffering from «Kenitalia» (smooth plastic crotch), so that might explain his evil ways. And personality is hidden is revealed to strangers as well, and there is even a sort of happy ending labor. Whee. <br /> <br /> Step 4 from the part, but not much of one. Again, Yuzno involved and Fist Mad George, so some decent special effects, but not enough to make it great. A few remnants of Part 4 of hanging around too, like Clint Howard and Nate Hunter, but really does not matter. Anyway, I now see a whole series of my system. Now that I could get some of them with my brain. 4 out of 5.
