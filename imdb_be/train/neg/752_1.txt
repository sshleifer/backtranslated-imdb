You can give the film NOT STARS? I do not think so. However, many stars IMDb reflects this only seems to zero, and you get my drift. Director and photographer Timothy Hines had most of the budget compared to the heroic efforts of Spielberg with the same material (according to rumors, the most expensive film ever made), but it should not be an insurmountable obstacle. I have seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring ( "Soldiers and Saints" a recent example). With hard work, integrity and, above all, the talent is, of course, possible to implement precise execution Wells novel - and at a fraction of what was spent on the Dreamworks his "War of the Worlds." Unfortunately, it failed Hines in all these departments. Even if it was a budget Spielberg and Tom Cruise has signed up for his leadership film it would stink as bad as this animal threshing floor he imposed on us. <br /> <br /> First of all, Hines, do not seem to tell the story. Thanks to digital video it can record images and sound, but it shows little ability to assemble descriptive with what he writes. The guy goes down the path of the country, a lot. He speaks bad English Entered imitated to some other guy. Then he goes in the same lane, only filmed from the back, this time to show that he was coming back - clever, eh? Walking and talking for almost an hour, that's all that happens. Well, I will do what one extended excursion of the house of the hero to the place of impact on Horsell Common, to show that it is a considerable distance from one place to another can be useful (student film of the first year can storyboard a more economical and more aesthetic sequencing, than this, by the way), but half a dozen times? Back and forth, back and forth, and so on and so forth with some yakkity-yak between them. Remarkable. The only explanation of this surfeit of redundancy, except for the total lack of talent artistic desire to inflate thirty minutes pathetic amateur CG works that can be offered as a full-length movie. Finally Martian war machines are and gait and speech becomes run and say squeal. Later we get a staggering and shouting for dessert <br /> <br /> Fortunately, much of the dialogue is lifted directly from the text H.G. Wells. otherwise we would not have the slightest idea what is happening. But this is not the whole point of the movie to highlight the text to understand that words alone can not convey? If the movie is based on a dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or feel, why? Why not do on the radio? Orson Welles made him a household name to do just that. However, Hines said that he directed, so he was pleased with the words of my mouth and swallows sense. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Hines was able to buy some kind of CG effects for his film, but he has no idea how to use them. Now, I for one do not have an insatiable sweet eye candy. I believe that good science fiction movie is not in need of dazzling technical effects. A really powerful Sci-Fi has flourished virtually non-existent. But the "War of the Worlds", as the film requires some basic efforts. Wells says that hinges on the things you can see and hear and even smell it. These effects do not have to be complicated; they may even raw (eg, combat vehicles on the wires to slide over the tiny streets, as seen in the version of George Pal / Heskin 1953) to be, but they need to be handled well. Unfortunately, Hines effects' are rough and incompetent ?? tripod fighting machines is higher than the cathedral spire stomp around making noise as a bad stick bouncing around on the linoleum ?? Martian squidoids even oppress four times the gravity of their home world of bustle and flit about without noticeable effort ?? skeletons completely denuded of flesh and muscles writhing and screaming - the same damn horse and gods greenscreens his way through the fore many times (inverted left to right, sometimes in the hope that we would not notice) ?? and ad nauseam. Crude machines forgivable. Thus, you have the CG fire effect, which is less than compelling? Well, we can work around it. Just do not use it too often, and show only a glimpse of it. This woman stomped sequence looks like a crushed plum? Throw. This is not necessarily. You say that your Martian flyer looks like a toy on a string? If you need to use it, go ahead, but please do not show it twice! But no, Hines will not listen. We get the worst looking material that is used over and over again. Should get those 180 minutes once, boy. <br /> <br /> Next, we act rather too much action. Regardless of whether in the spoken role or simply pay to die on the order of everything in this film acts his little heart. Obviously, Hines said that he gets the deal - More fleeing in terror there! You are trembling for that tree, let a real fit of hysteria to accept it. You name it writhing in agony? Nonsense, my grandmother can writhe better - however, the cast as a whole and individually to stink. They're not even good amateurs. But this should not prove to be fatal. Many good movie was made with rancid action. That's what directors for. And editors. Which brings up another point ?? Who the hell let Tim Hines edit this cheese factory? If America's butchers were skilled in meat cutting as Haynes in the film sharp your next burger is all thumbs and no beef. Although the next three hours of time, there are many things that are not present in this film - not the sequence, but the individual frames, creating a herky-jerky effect that sick look. Maybe, Hines plans was to simulate the effect of hand-cranked film camera of the 1890s. If he was, I can say that he does not know how to do it.
