Anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start with the basics. Everyone says, STAR WARS and Star Trek the best science fiction films to get started on what is good, but the truth is, the terminator and this film, Soylent Green, a much better choice than the series. Soylent, probably sf «s best kept secret. It remains one of the biggest, but most forgotten film, but the impact of its installation becomes a reality every day. Charlton Heston overdramatizes its role, but it works. Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, makes the most of it in the Soylent GREEN more than anyone else, and his touching final scene. <br /> <br /> This Manhattan in 2022, the world is full of incredible power and status (small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150). Large executive for the company Soylent killed and a police detective Thorn is on the case. <br /> <br /> The secret of Soylent Green is not a secret, if you are doing research on the movie. Soylent is nice to look at, but the entire scenario of a joke. It's just as cheap as the entire production. Script and over scenic actors from the film, but it was totally fun. Everything seems to be an idiot, and no one knows the rules, namely the police Thorne, who only likes to waltz in a flat deputies, browse around and shamelessly steal everything he wants. Interaction «s characters retains their attention to the movie, but you know what Soylent GREEN sucks. Nice piece, if you have the time, but nothing else is waiting.
