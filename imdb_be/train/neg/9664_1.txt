This book is based on the film's really horrible and very disappointing. We've been waiting for this step within a month. Many reviewers of the film were hopes for him. In addition, in the newspapers and on television, he made a lot of sense. When April 29 comes, many people have noted with regret that the film is really awful. Why? First of all, the story was so monotonous. What's going on it was a lot of uncertain scenes, sometimes it is difficult to understand. Actresses Hul Avsar, were not consistent with their roles, especially Vildanov Atasever. It works best in comedy films, this film, like his drama, she could not throw her former role. Finally, the film is too short, only 66 minutes.
