Someone here really compare this film in some ways to the High Noon. Now it's a real stretch! I'm a big fan of Sinatra, including some of his acting roles, but perhaps the only person who could play this role would be Don Knotts. First, as someone pointed out, Sinatra did not just build for Western bad guy wannabe. He's just too "easy" at this point in his life. Maybe it was about the same height, as they say, Audie Murphy, but Murphy was a pretty solid build. Sinatra comes across as a great conversation a little kid that no one should take lightly. <br /> <br /> The story strains, and indeed can not be trusted. I do not want to spoil it, but I think that the ending and how citizens react to this story makes no sense. Another thing is that these people are constantly allow themselves to be completely abused by some "bad guy." It's just a small town, so I do not get the attraction and I do not understand why people would let themselves be dominated so. <br /> <br /> There is a "love interest" in this story, and when I went to get it right, she was upset when the protagonist refused to recognize who he was some other bad guy does not kill. Now there is a real love for you. "Stand up for yourself! Tell him your name, so that he will kill you! LOL. Stop, you're killing me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic premise of the film is not good enough, and no matter how they tried, this story had a logical way to go except in the trash, you want to know why it's not on the video, and have never shown on TV? Critics have apparently made it in 1956, and they were right - this film is very bad. I would almost bet Sinatra paid someone to deep-six the thing as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see a good Western, where the city is opposed to the bad guy? Try Tensions Rock the table, or on the fly - two really good westerns with this theme. Johnny Concho Johnny screwy. Frank, you're the greatest singer ever - but you do not belong in a movie like this.
