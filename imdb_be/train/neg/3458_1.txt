I do not usually motivated to write reviews. But this film was so excruciatingly painful, I feel I must. I cringed at the horribly predictable plot, lame action and laughed at those moments that should have been strained. In fact, most of the audience seemed rather dull and talkative, even in the "most intense" of the film. Ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in the tortured production. Even a "turn" in the end it was not. I heard that the film does not take itself seriously; but I could not find confirmation of the fact that in the film. <br /> <br /> Cut had left on the floor of the room. Do yourself a favor and spend their time and money on something else!
