In short: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee apparently has a lot in his head. He thinks about racism measurable color, the media and the hegemony of consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, "hetero-sexism," the policy of drug war, etc. etc. ... <br /> <br /> In the level of consciousness is its own large. I think it is good that more and more people choose to critically examine the main aspects of our daily lives; silent and invisible forces that govern our society. However, just because Lee makes controversial movies does not make him a good director. <br /> <br /> What comes in "Jungle Fever" is a superficial understanding of the social and political forces. This is largely the result of two major setbacks: <br /> <br /> In the first place, or just trying too hard. It seems he is desperately trying to accommodate all the political / social statement that he can think of in 90mins. And as such, the end result seems to be confused and indecisive, he does not allow himself time to develop a character that can fully embody the ideas that he hopes to present. And so he runs out of the stereotypes, and we are left with a very rushed indications and loaded with dialogue. The end result is very staged and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Secondly, trying to make a statement about such a wide variety of social functions, it seems, do not have any specific or original interpretation of social / political issues presented. What comes across is a puddle of spit-nya sense. You feel that he bought the elementary level sociology text books and throws all 500 pages. <br /> <br /> This is very problematic, as especially feature films killing and work becomes a speaker for voice director's voice. He is unable to distance themselves from the work, and allow it to speak for itself. <br /> <br /> It does not operate either as a work of art, a sound political argument. <br /> <br /> While I still appreciate Lee bringing these important issues, I have to say: <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
