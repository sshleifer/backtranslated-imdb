The Case of the call "House of the Dead," the worst movie of all time is that it's actually not. There are worse movies out there. I watch a lot of movies Ninja Hong Kong, which are mainly the result of an unfinished Japanese police drama, which has staff Ninja inserted at the end to create something that could be called technically "film". <br /> <br /> House of dead, but one of the worst films I have ever seen in theaters. Leaving halfway through, I actually felt like I was a little dumber for having planted after 45 minutes this piece of garbage.
