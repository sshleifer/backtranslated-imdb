The film features two of my favorite actors Kilmer and Downey. It also boasts an always pleasant Larry Miller in too small pieces. Despite this, I found it almost unwatchable. Michelle Monaghan can be pretty, but it is almost free of charisma and character Downey causes obsession with its own character, it is not clear from the information point of view, whether the film is the way it is portrayed. The ending seems pretentious and although the intention, it seems that the audience should start with a nod and a wink film, failing to lead us on the side of its main characters leaves us unwilling or unable to do so. <br /> <br /> Supporters of the film say that those who do not agree just "do not get it." I do not think so. The plot was not complex or beyond comprehension. It was just uninvolving and clumsily and obviously made. Clear. "I just do not like it. Paddy Bretnch" I went, "and Guy Ritchie's" Snatch "and" Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels "are much better implemented examples of such film-director Shane Black that can not be achieved. <br /> <br /> I share a birthday with Shane Black, but look at his credit (mostly as a screenwriter) makes me want to dissociate themselves from any other connection.
