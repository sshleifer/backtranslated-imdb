This movie was a waste of time, even rented a DVD. If a super-fast camera shooting to get faster than this, we would also have to pay twenty dollars to get the laundry, get the popcorn and watching a centrifuge. Jet Li is much better than that. One can only hope that it will not conclude the deal in the near future to make another movie cliché-ridden as The One. <br /> <br /> If there is one film you should avoid it «The One».
