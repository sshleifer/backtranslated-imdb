I'm not inclined to artistic individuality. I am a science person, and I felt that this film was, perhaps, one of those artsy types mannered films on a budget. I watched part of it with my fiance and my future stepdaughter. We tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest. My fiance and his daughter have voted it, and we went to Ocean's 13, but that's another story. Not to be deterred, I woke up the next morning and gave the film one more shot. Again, I started to watch this movie seriously. I just do not understand, I thought that I would get it.I thought funny part was flush from the ashes and urns to place the fireplace is used as a vase for what seemed dead flowers. Interestingly, and still it was a dead thing inside. It was a strange and bizarre movie. Maybe that's what they're after, but I will not be fooled for a second time!
