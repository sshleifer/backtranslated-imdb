It is amazing to me that passes for entertainment today. maybe I'm a dinosaur out of fifty, and I cut off the current generation of a film, and apparently is the case in respect of the film, since so many people loved him. I have found that it is a foul and vulgar. I did not say that about many movies in my life, but this one fits the bill. Humor babble and crude. I am not politically correct person and even I found a gay joke, it is not only not funny, but very offensive (I'm not gay). The main character in the film is not even a nice person, a pity. When the film was finally ended, I heard many people comment on how they were disappointed that they only get paid good money to see.
