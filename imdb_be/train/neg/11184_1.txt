It really is a terrible film. <br /> <br /> I'm only writing this so that some people somewhere scares his watch. When I stopped one person from having to spend part of his precious life to watch this movie, I'd die happy. <br /> <br /> unspeakably boring, though, since it plays Al Pacino I was misled, thinking that at any moment something interesting would happen. Then, titles, and I realized that I was completely deceived in watching this incredible nonsense. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that this film achieved the highest score, as it has in the IMDb (5 stars, when I last saw the vote). And you people who vote ironically? <br /> <br /> Please, please, please, do not watch this movie!
