This should be one of the worst films I have ever seen. DVD was given to me free of charge with an order I placed on the website for non-DVD items. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that they have been given, of course, no one could not bear to part with money for this nonsense. <br /> <br /> as some observers might say that they found it fun to believe the person who turns it into five worst movies ever got it on the spot. <br /> <br /> How talented actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman could participate in this incredible stuff. Basically, toilet humor and poorly done that. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to be entertained should avoid this at all costs.
