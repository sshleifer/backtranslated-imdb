The action in this film beats Sunny Bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar has superpowers Leonidus 300, Neo Matrix with Spiderman and Superman. It's fun. for a typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy But I do not see anything positive in this film. History looks like the writer told his son to write 10YR. The film is so unreal that Anil Kapoor long range shooting with a gun is the least most error director. for directors of Tashan, to make this film except there is no other Tashan. I'm sorry to spend money on this film, and I would not recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is the least I can give at IMDb or I would give it a zero.
