I'm not saying that Twisters Night was terrible, but it was far from great. Run at best. I think, however, that every time one type of film is released, the second should be approximately at the same time. (Think about Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's Peak) Twisters Night really only Twister except worse and worldly special effects. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the actors who starred in it, even if they were not great, it was the film, direction, special effects, the whole story was too strange to interpret. A series of tornadoes hit the city and basically a film about people who are trying to find family and friends and to deal with the damage. <br /> <br /> I do not know why it seems as if the duplicate disaster movies are released almost simultaneously with each other, but that one would be better off with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
