Yes, definitely better than my view Death Tunnel. In fact, some of the deaths were quite original and blood was decent. It was kind of like Wrong Turn is found in the hills have eyes <br /> <br /> BUT:.? 1) If "children" (high school or college) discuss the horror in the kitchen, all the W says, almost an exact quote from the Creek (1996). Case of large breasts girls, etc. <br /> <br /> 2.) Steve was NOT bootlegs Randy Creek? 3) Besides the fact that it took place in October, what the hell, the film has to do with Samhain? Quite unnecessary if you ask me. I find it humorous when I see these horror movies of the '80s, due to the free ends, pointing to the Druids or pentagram. <br /> <br /> 4.) Both of them made reference to Sam Raimi !!! 5.) Why did Gary and his sister in the film? They are heroes had nothing to do with anything. And hes so mental that he could not even see his own death? 6.) When Harry was killed in the bathroom (at that time, death was just Troma-Licious), she could hear the screams when she was at the bottom, but they do not hear, as she stood behind the door? 7.) Harry's sister commented Haggis- the first Scottish dish, Sun Irishman. <br /> <br /> 8.) So the lesson, if you like, and Shae does not have any pleasure or crack a smile throughout the film, you live alone? 9.) The mutants were pretty cool, but they looked like walking dishes chili con carne. <br /> <br /> 10.) When they brought the sister of Gary, they forget that Steve was tied there and wondering where he went? 11.) Was there more than one killer? Chez beat that one, but I never came across any more of them. <br /> <br /> 12.) What was a flashback to those other people? Half of them Shae not know if they were alive or dead, so it was with this? 13.) Why did not they kill Harry and his sister before? 14.) Why is it no one ever call the police? And, apparently, everyone knew that these people were living in the woods, why they never organize a raid? 15.) As far as I know, they were not zombies or vampires- as it could "become" one in the end? I'm with everyone on the Giants' yes? "At the end. <br /> <br /> The Way better than the death of the tunnel, but still pretty sloppy. I still do not understand why they even put him in Ireland, given Samhain was close to nothing to do with the plot.
