It is a sad film about this woman who thought her ex that she loved so much, probably dead, but in fact his scientist dad just fascinated him, to turn it into a very cute shark guy. Kind of like Beauty and the Beast. This can probably use ballroom dance scene and maybe some singing candlesticks, but there are some pretty tough plants instead. They do this one girl really itch, so that it allows itself to be eaten by sharks guy, not to scratch through the whole movie. Scientist man a good father who tries to unite his dull shark son with a woman he did that, he even arranges for them to have a private time for sex, and a woman in a very shallow snob thinks shark- guy ugly, reverse Monster and does not want to have anything to do with him. She refused to love! Just because he was a shark! I thought it was pretty boring as all that she had to do, to kiss him, and he is back to normal, and they live happily ever after, but this does not mean that such a film.
