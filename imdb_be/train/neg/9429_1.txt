I bought this movie for $ 5 a CD shop, and I kind of regret it. To begin with, I'm a big fan of cheesy horror movies. They provide a terribly tacky cheap entertainment. This film entertained during the first half an hour, because it was so bad that it could be ridiculed pretty easy MST3K-style manner. Then he got bored. <br /> <br /> Effective scariest part of the film. While a lot of action should not be expected that it is ridiculously bad, and to be honest, if all the entertainment, which was was not to be. This is the plus side of the film. If the film really varies entertainment is writing, lighting, and editing. <br /> <br /> This film gives too much "What @ #% $ is going on?" moments. There are many things, such as a mother who has a strange seizures for lunch, and then, not having absolutely no consequences in the film. Along the lunch line, someone decided that it was free it was interesting to watch as people eat delicious food for five minutes straight without dialogue, each time the food was served. During meals and other unsuitable moments, the scene cuts to a clean dark outside. Then trims. And speaking of the dark in the street, one of the funniest parts of the movie is the climate, which, apparently, is not the night, if it does not rain. And speaking of the dark, a big problem with the film is that it is so poorly lit, you can not see what's going on half the time, which is more frustration than anything. In one of the climactic scenes, you can not even say that you have to see that this is so shocking. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to the climax scenes Upset contains one of the worst. I've seen people say, "Wow, that surprised me, and it's good." I can say that the biggest surprise finds made me, because I did not see it coming. The reason why I did not see it coming, because it is not made absolutely no sense. I will not spoil it for you, but I tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes to rewind to different parts of the film to find something that would have proven that at all, and everything that we found were more things to mention that it was not possible. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is actually better when you watch it with commentary tracks, who make fun of him. I love shit horror movies, but it was too much.
