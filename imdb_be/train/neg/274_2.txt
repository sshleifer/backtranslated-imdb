There seems to be little middle ground in the path where the Rhine watches concerned. One or loves him very much applaud his honesty, liberal views and fine acting, or despise it clear propaganda mediocre dialogue, cardboard characters and the overall bias. I fall very much into the latter category, and found the movie and the game - on the activities of European refugees in Washington during the war - complete bore, worth mainly for the action, and even then only occasionally. This author Lillian Hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant. Her plays have been written for people who shared his point of view, and it is rare to explore ideas that are not already held by the author and the audience except to show how badly the "other side" is. Even if I'm in one hundred percent identical to what she has to say - as in the Rhine - I still can not stand the way she speaks. Her characters are not real, and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain object to the way people speak, it does not possess any real brilliance or originality. She really did not have anything new to say. I fully agree with the long overdue dismantling of the late Mary McCarthy's reputation Hellman some years ago. For those who believe that the theater is dead, or at least, and yearn for the good old days, I urge to look at the clock on the Rhine, so bad in its own way as Angels in America, which just goes to show that the theater had one foot in the grave of sixty years ago.
