... with the exception of Jon Heder. This guy is the whole film the tank. <br /> <br /> The plot sounds interesting. 29-year-old slacker son (Heder) still lives with his widowed mother (Keaton), who happens to meet a new love (Daniels). Slacker son jealous and tries to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. He also meets a girl (Faris). <br /> <br /> I really liked the performance of Daniels and especially Faris, but those who cast Hader would be better to sell hot dogs on the beach. Header productivity annoying that it would be good because it plays an annoying guy, the problem is that he is a bad actor to lose this act makes this cute guy in the finals. In the end, you still want to, you can personally hit a guy in the face, and you are upset end. In the future, every movie with this guy will not go for me!
