What features in your mind? This movie sucks! Every minute I was getting more and more tired. I tried to look up to the end, because I hope that some, at least, will finally happen! But instead, I was surprised at how lackluster treated end of ... What is the story of the bloody "scarecrow"? he did not die as a coming? He's a fucking human being, please! A simple boy who killed his silly sister 15 years ago. Then what? His stay in the psychiatric hospital made him immortal? This film is fascinating stupid ... This is to stupidity. I'm going to sell it right now to some stupid guy, who will understand this stupid movie.
