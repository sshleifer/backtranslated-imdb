I bought this DVD set, sight unseen, and wish I had not. The script needs some serious rewriting, as it seems to be completely devoid of any sense and pales in comparison with the book. Lighting the opposite, very non-polished, but if it was just that I could not see it. The script does not focus enough on the characters ... hardly the introduction of different characters, which makes it a bit difficult to distinguish who is who (especially in the planes - not knowing who dies when). <br /> <br /> I have long felt that the key to a good film in getting the audience to care about the characters; If you do not, you do not have anything. There was not the slightest attention to the characters at all - you never have to know them - who they are, what they liked..what made them do what they do. Episode 5 hours in length and divided into 6 parts ... I'm sure you are wondering what they have done with all this time, if the characters are not in detail --- they put a lot of filler in it .... I will speak, at least an hour spent watching them take off and land in their airplanes LOL (I mean really, we have to see that again and again ???). I would give it a much higher rating if they only improved our knowledge of the characters.
