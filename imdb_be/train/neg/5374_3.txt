Crimson Rivers is one of the more directed, over-the-top, over all the mess I've ever seen come out of France. There's nothing worse than a French production, trying to outdo the films made in Hollywood and CR is an excellent example of this wannabe horror / action / Friend Flicka. I almost stopped him halfway, because I knew that it would not mean anything other than French guys, who are trying to boast. <br /> <br /> The film begins promisingly, as a kind of expansive horror film, but quickly shifts genres, from horror to action for the type of x-files for each flick that eventually, CR is not all that, and none of them. It is so full of clich√©s that at some point I thought that it was all a comedy. Painful dialogue and the silent pause, with fade outs and fade Institute only correct expositionary moments made me groan. I thought that the only films made in Hollywood have used this banal technique. <br /> <br /> chase scene, with Vincent Cassel work after the killer, so the more focused and overly done, it is almost a thing of beauty. The culmination of the on top of the mountain, with a silly discovery of the killer (s) from Kassel and Reno to play "buddy" as Nolte and Murphy in 48 hours, was completely gone with the rails, there is little confidence in the film was at the time. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that the director of Crimson cancer also aims Gothic, which, although they have had their share of problems, do not even come close to this terrible overbaked, confusing movie.
