*** spoilers *** *** SPOILERS *** When I saw the preview of this movie, I thought it would be at least slightly different story. But, like most superstation original films I left disappointed. This trustful family completes management through a "desert" the city take the brakes and find this camera, showing these people are doing everything they donig and know they will eventually disappear, the family goes through all the stages of these mysterious and never know or indicate that the bracket is pursuing them. They are more gaps than I can count, and they have everything that happens as something that does not explain. It ends when the family gets into a car accident and get posest or brains or something (which is never explained). The next thing you know ur hoping that they somehow know how it happened, but she ends up leaving you totally confused.
