It was "cute" the first film, it then became too rich and showed mediocre songs at best. <br /> <br /> There are too many King James English spoken with are not only annoying in the modern world, but it is not always easy to interpret. Can you imagine young people today are trying to listen to this film? Forget about it. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has some good lines here and cute like "Hank Martin." Rhonda Fleming ( «La Alisande Carteloise») was also annexed thereto and beautiful appearance, long red hair. <br /> <br /> This is a good film with good health finals, and I can not knock it. Maybe it's worthy of rent, for the sake of history, or if you are a big fan of Crosby, but in general, it's not much.
