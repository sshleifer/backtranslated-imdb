I made this film in fact, that showed the trailer, and, of course, Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> If Pollock teamed up with David Lynch, and Timothy Leary to make a film, it would be the end result. I do not think I've seen a film like that made LSD trip looks like an episode of Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> It's a lot a lot of parts where the characters flit in and out of reality, or the different realities, and the film does not contain complete in anything until the last 5 minutes, if all of a sudden it makes sense. I wrote a scathing review on my blog review of the film, which essentially gives everything away, and I will not do it here. It is well acted piece of film, and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me just say, if there is one softening for this film, it's the music. It is perfect. Some of the dialogue is incredibly well and incredibly bad all at the same time. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed parts of this movie, I really did, and as soon as you reach the end, you'll actually find out what is really going on. It is unfortunate that you have to wade through 2:00 crazy to get to the point of performance, which minimizes the effect of the film. <br /> <br /> I give it 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this film is not action, that's all.
