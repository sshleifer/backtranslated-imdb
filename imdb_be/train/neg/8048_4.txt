Suppose you were on a desert island for the past ten years. I never heard of screams and left when Halloween Part 1 went to the movies. Then this film would be an explosion, and a completely new vision of the scene of horror. <br /> <br /> At this point, 2.7 rating on IMDb, and does not deserve this low score. Cutting all the way, like "I do not know what you've done", and who has it, that at getting to the end convinced me, someone-and why. <br /> <br /> There is a big surprise, just a good movie to watch with cola, popcorn and do not desire to get a complex plot, deeper characters. If you rent a video from the best names, you can take it without risk, but do not expect blockbusters. I've seen a lot worse.
