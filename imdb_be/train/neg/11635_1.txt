Well it's gona be a short and sweet review ... Something the film had taken in practice ina nd made his life is shorter and sweeter than it was. <br /> <br /> This film @ $ ^%. There's a good reason was a petition with over 40,000 signatures demanding + ALL Uwe Boll to stop making films with franchise people liked. Blood Rayne being Biggie there. <br /> <br /> The jokes are good ... if you've never heard them a thousand times. It acts descent, but can really only blame for this scenario. I'm even a few moments, wondering if they are even using a script. <br /> <br /> The film has little to nothing to do with the original game. Hi, If you've played the game and I know the protagonist has no real motivation is death calls as mass murder, because he paid off his socks or doubles. There is too much history for that stupid movie. As I have already said. I would not even steal the film. And for the person who says it is Â«Funniest Film of 2007" .......... it is necessary to look around, the news is better than that.
