I just read a review of this film protects, because it was a low budget, and now I look at things. <br /> <br /> CGI monsters were reasonably well animated, but it has been implemented in the worst form. The fight scenes were not even a fight, he was just one shot of the actor, the one monster shot from the interaction at all. If the monster interacted it looked like it was done in PaintShop Pro. In my opinion, if you have a low budget, you should use the models and dolls. They may not look fancy, but at least they interact with each other, just look at Peter Jacksons early films. <br /> <br /> As for the current Beowulf did work descent, but the rest of the actors were either tried, or they forget where they are. <br /> <br /> scenario seemed confused me. One minute, they would say, as if it were a modern day setting the following you will get the drama club Shakespeare speech. I'm not saying that everything should be "you" and "that it will be," but you have to find a cohesive balance of the line sound like they come from the same person. <br /> <br /> I noticed one of the closer to the top when Beowulf quoted the Old Testament, which would be a godsend if not spent the rest of the movie talking about gods and omens. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is very little polished turd, but not less than all.
