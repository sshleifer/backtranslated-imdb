Yesterday I saw the movie Flyboys, and my friend told me that it was the worst movie she had ever seen ... Since then, I thought it was pretty scary, but it got me thinking - what film was the worst film I ever seen, and it was the only film that came to mind. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's been a couple years since I've seen it, but I remember, terribly miscast Dean Cain as a daring military (handsome Cain does not cocky very good). The strange thing with CGI-helicopter, when it is likely to take a helicopter flight is cheaper than hiring a CGI-guys to do it, but I think they found the helicopter as a free sample for a CGI program, or the son of the producer liked to play with him new computer. And it looks like ?? Awful. And if the dragon charges through the corridors of the complex is then re-use the same images over and over again - looks very cheap <br /> <br /> To avoid this movie. - this is really terrible ...
