This movie was slated to be a blockbuster, and it really is. This type of film, which is made to eat popcorn and watch the flashy graphics. With this in mind, the film delivers, perhaps not as well as ultra flashy Iron Man, but good enough. Outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects, the film falls off the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote. <br /> <br /> Many viewers, including me, will complain, as most characters were significantly altered, but it only makes a bad film adaptation, not a bad movie. This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons. The creators focused more on the fact that appealing to the eye than they did in the mind. Symbols that have been long-awaited and advocated reduced to Kama 4-scene. The main characters Wolverine, Victor Creed (SABERTOOTH never called in the film), and Colonel Stryker well developed. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance in Schreiber. The remaining characters are thrown by the wayside to make room for the all-important eye candy. Ross character is fully developed after the 30th minute as the Sabertooth, although Victor does pull off a few surprises at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Â«final boss," the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets no development to show why he is the way he is. The filmmakers clearly felt that all they really had to do was to create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted, and slapped on behalf of a popular character. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing ...
