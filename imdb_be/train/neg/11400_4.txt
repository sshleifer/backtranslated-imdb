Hazing confused fetish who wants so hard to be Evil Dead that even references Campbell several times Bruce. The problem is that just not in the same league as this stunning film. This film is not as far as the original. The site was used previously, Kevin Tenney in the Night of the Demons, and it was much more fun. Flick it wastes too much time with complex exposures to produce children in a terrible house and from demonic events. <br /> <br /> Dourif, as usual, did not give a lot to do, but when he is on the screen, he puts in another over-the-top performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous. As for the effect on the children, it is not passable, but by no means good. Shaky camera work more annoying than smart or atmospheric. There are a few good moments, when the first guy gets thrown around and get some mortals liners while dispatching his victims, but it's never been scared in a second. Gusset level of the middle class low, but the director is trying to compensate for this by showing actresses topless several times. In general, a good thing if you have 87 minutes to spend.
