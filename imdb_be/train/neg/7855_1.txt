I could not believe my eyes when I watched this movie. There's no sense in it neither then blood and violence. Unlike other scary films that had Gore and the meaning of it, this film is just the blood, blood, and killing one another. This film is not interesting at all, has no significant plot or storyline, and has no intelligence in it. Blood looks very fake and the film as a whole, does not make sense. Do not even waste your time with him. It's just an hour or two of senseless violence. She has a lot of bloody scenes, which is not terrible, but it is simply outrageous. This is probably the worst horror movie I've ever watched of all the horror films I've ever seen.
