I was so excited and hyped about watching this film, when the first promo was released in November! It looked strange and song! I was very disappointed when I went to see it! This is a film that weaves together 6 pairs. It has a multi-cast of 12 people! A huge number of stars have worked on this film. I think that the director, Nikhil Advani, not handled the situation well and was not supposed to be a lot of people in this film, as it was with made it easier for him. Compared with the directorial debut of Nikhil in "Kal Ho Naa Ho", "Lard-e-Ishq" provides quite behind. I think that Nikhil has to have a smaller star cast. I think the odds of this movie song! The song perfectly, and I think that all the songs are awesome, Shankaresanloi did an excellent job and have done an excellent job over the years. I think that the ratings of this film can go for great songs! One thing I was disappointed that the director should not include nudity in this film, which is produced Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. I found it very rude to watch it with my family! While some may find this nude as a comedy, it's not what you want to watch with their parents! I think that the best action has been performed Salman and Priyanka Overall, I think it's in the film right!
