I confess to have a rather unpleasant feeling of a movie about ghosts, and while I sometimes like the genre, when it comes to horror, but when it comes to comedy, they actually have to be crazy to be funny. «Over Her Dead Body», it seems to take the afterlife a bit too seriously, and I think I can almost think of any aspect. History is absolutely incredible, of course, failed to convince me, like a comic or sentimental register. Selection of the main actresses was awful. While Paul Rudd, at least beautiful and looks like a nice guy, his taste in character house, it seems, needs serious improvement, Eva Longoria looks too aged (sorry) for him, and Lake Bell seems too unattractive (sorry again). Romantic story without enough valid reasons for romance due to failure from the beginning. Biggs and Lindsay Sloane were actually better, but they had only a supporting role. Rest uninteresting and uninspired with flat film and cheap gags borrowed from disadvantaged television comedies. Nothing really worth watching, I do not remember anything.
