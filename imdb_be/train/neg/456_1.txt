Add to List of cartoons: Western preacher and "flock" torch singer (? Sophie Tucker), Dancing Chorus, and the Mills Brothers - it just makes it worse <br /> <br /> despised burlesque. performers "Negro", which are themselves often appear in the film, which will parody themselves and their race. Although the Â«Negro comedy" might have been adopted in the day, it is very offensive today, and I doubt it ever funny. While I would not take offense, I do not think I would have laughed at the weak attempt at humor. As 11-year-old white boy, however, I would not understand some of them.
