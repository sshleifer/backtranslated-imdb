I remember the days when Kim Basinger was nothing more than a pretty face that adorned films with distinctive characters of Blondie dumb, romantic interest or a girl for danger.But, everything changed when she received an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for her role in the film excellent film LA Confidential, and I think that I was not the only one who was impressed by her hard performance.However, after that point, her career did not follow the ideal path.Sure, prestige she received due to the fact that the film did its part moderately exclusive films (e.g., l Dei, which I know or door in the floor), but we never saw her at a considerable character.The film until she was not doing anything to be put to this situation; and it's not just that her character is not very tasty, but also about what the film is really crappy.The script of this film can not be more than a hollow and basic.However, Basinger brings some credibility of her character, and that makes this poor film to win a few points.This film full of clich√©s and the ordinary villains.The work directed by Susan Montford really disastrous for many reasons, but mainly because the film never gets a good rhythm and tone.The from the end of the film is extremely ridiculous .I do not recommend long as it was not on film all.This zdyay -border capital sin of being boring.
