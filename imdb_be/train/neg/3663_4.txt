Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy stars in this, one of his weakest werewolf movies ... but bear with me for a moment. Most people are familiar with it in its most common name TV fury MAN WOLF, and there was a lot of home video version of it for many years. If you want to be serious about giving it a fair shot, though, the most workable edition I have seen it is called The Wolf Man never sleeps, and it is unedited and complete European version, which restores a couple of disturbing scenes and contains the original bare shots that were missing from the print Fury. It is also from the bottom. <br /> <br /> Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky, returning home from a trip to Tibet, only to find that he was infected with the werewolf curse, and that his wife was having an affair. He cares for her and her lover while in animal form, but then becomes a guinea pig for sexual female doctor and her assistant. Apparently, the document tries to "tame" the werewolf, and there is a very strange sado-masochistic love scene between her and hairy and fanged Daninsky, which is under her trance, at least in its original version. In the end, we get two for the price of one werewolf in wolf Daninsky battles! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the film is that the director (of the formula in Naschy) is often drunk, and the results are really quite unintelligible. When viewing Wolfman never SLEEPS copies, it is not so difficult to understand what is happening, but editing is disgusting stained. The worst part is sometimes mismatched frames hungry werewolf Naschy in the backhand straight out of another previous film (LA MARK DEL HOMBRE LOBO, also known as the "Sign of the werewolf") and mixed at the same time without a reasonable reason! The clothes change Wolf with a black shirt with white and back again, as it makes its behavior; one moment the wolf walks listlessly in a hypnotic trance with rage, then he growls and runs from the barbaric reign of terror is really strange..
