That Ireland ever do to film distributors that they strive to represent the country in such a humiliating way? The film begins as a primer for film students on Irish cinema cliché: unctuous priests, spitting before the handshake, the urban area of ​​livestock marts, cycling country meadows on background painkiller folk music. Soon, however, it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is a big daddy-O Irish cliche - religous hostility. This refers to a Protestant woman who wants to decide where its Catholic-adopted child is brought up, which seems to be smart enough desire, though not in the 50 County Wexford villagers she has to live. Rather than send them to a Catholic school, and she decides to go to Belfast, then Scotland, where a few clichés reguritated. While she was there, her father (who looks awfully like George Lucas) and family at home are subjected to a boycott, which is very unpleasant. I'm not going to give away the ending, not because I think people should go see this movie, but because it is not very interesting. One problem with the film is the central character: we must sympathize with her, but in the end, instead of urging her to get a life. Villagers presented as bigots whose prejudices have to be confronted, but traumatize your children seems innappropriate ways about it. In addition, he takes on the burden that he igniminiously reeling under when he tries to draw an analogy with the current peace process in Northern Ireland: a woman told her lawyer that she "should make preconditions" for her return. The film is allegedly based on a true story, but it's topics, which were considered much more creatively and with less recourse to hackneyed clichés of the past.
