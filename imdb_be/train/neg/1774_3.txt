Well, I first saw this film as at 9:00 on Cinemax few weeks ago and thought it will be marked by numerous awards, boy was I in this 180D. This film is a big bite. I mean, the mother monster shows its true form only at the end of the film. I'm going, "That's it? Why it does not show a little more briefly at the beginning of the movie. "The plot to be a mother and son feast on the blood of young women. Would not it be better if they just went on, you know, the killing spree killing, like a pair of young women each, and then with the sheriff or the police know and get into trying to find a way to kill the monster, save the young woman / woman, and have a 1 2 or more people are killed in the process? I think it would be a heck of a lot better. It also sucks because the son of the main character, and he gets killed first. Why not get rid of the mother in the first place? In addition, as it is, that the power at the end of the film, when it begins to kill people? She said it herself she was too weak. What the devil happened to Stefan at this time? I can never, ever di≈ü working on any movie in any actor, after all, they are trying their best. If it was not a good action, I would give this film 1/10. 3/10.
