Life in the Middle East (Israel), I was excited when I bought my ticket for Syriana. After seeing the trailer, and the future thriller lover, I expected to see first rapid movement, breath catching a movie that wisely dips in global politics and the relationship between oil, power and corruption, a new angle. Well, I almost left out of the movie in the middle. The pace was excruciatingly slow, almost all the characters are stereotypical, weave editing made understanding the logic is very difficult, but as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review in the end, you do not care. Save your money, save time, select a different movie. <br /> <br /> Robbie Chernitskii
