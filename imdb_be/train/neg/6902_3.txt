Despite rave reviews, the film has collected in New Zealand, all the hype surrounding the production, unfortunately undeservedly. Besides cliché only the plot, the film is brought a weak acting, accents, and a general lack of tension. <br /> <br /> While having a general view of a large budget (for New Zealand), the feeling is obviously a small-town kiwi ... <br /> <br /> who have not seen the brothers ?? (Http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) Those who will choose the similarity postponing .... I have heard comments that scene as the boys playing basketball, etc. were shot to mock clichéd «boys talking shit", but comes across as forced ... <br /> <br /> I believe that Oscar Keightley see themselves as deeply ironic, but again his delivery always seems only dimly conscious itself. <br /> <br /> Those who left no doubt at all that the Samoan-living-in-NZ culture was deeply hopefully not permanently affected by the American language, culture, and everything in between will, of course their minds are made at the end of this film. <br /> <br /> Robbie Magasiva always looks good on the screen, but it summed up script .. <br /> <br /> He always rubs me the wrong way when the "comedy" has scenes that are set up such an obvious way, you're left feeling like having a good moan at the clichéd pointe - see want to be a white boy. .. <br /> <br /> I know that someone who has found the MOVI e hilarious -however, that a person has the brains of tadpoles, and will fight to spell his name, when he offered a million dollars .... < br /> <br /> this kind of sums up the mentality of this flick, but OK not great fun, but not funny ..... Wake up NZ - this is not a movie star 5, nyagled standing on all the glowing (middle class white wine ?? :-)) reviews .... <br /> <br /> My advice? If you look at it, the first drink !!!
