This thing is really awfull. There's sun charachter with weight, they're not all the floats in the BG's. Motion Capture fine toy, but this film demostrates, what you really need people who know the animation to make an animated film. ALL GOOD MACHINE may itself. If you see it as a quirky film, where you can have fun finding continuity errors ... In 3D MOVIE !!! Winked funny to watch princess move as a thing of Diferent Physics. We need an animator and 3D-animator, not data entry, which are known 3D program. Note joints like elbows, they have lost volume and deformed. The man who made charachter (very good) design sufered probably, if he / she is watching how they move, 'cos you can not say that they come to life.
