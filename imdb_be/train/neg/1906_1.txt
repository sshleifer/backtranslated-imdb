They played it on July 4th Dark Zone marathon, and this is hands down, the worst episode of Twilight Zone, I have ever seen. It is fully synchronized with the rest of the series in its tone. Although the area is quite grim series of uneven and many episodes eventually groaningly predictable, this one was totally out of place. Compare this legendary episodes as "stop in Willoughby» or «Midnight Sun», and you realize that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton did what he could with such terrible material, and, frankly, I am surprised that any of its historical growth comedy will stoop to the level of this episode. Despite the fact that he seemed to be giving him some effort, it should be need the money ... there's no other explanation.
