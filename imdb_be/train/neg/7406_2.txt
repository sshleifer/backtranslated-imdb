Well, how am I suppose to know that it's "in" dumb ass advertising «Lordi Motion Picture»? I mean, I realized that, when the suit "dinosaur" was showed and by the time the lead singer made his appearance, I sang «Hard Rock Hallelujah» for myself ... although I hate this song. "Dark Floors" is about a young autistic girl who is in the process slipped out of the hospital by her parents on a safety, when they and the rest of the people in this particular elevator, are at a moment in a trap ... When they arrive at their floor, it is a full a surprise to discover that there is no one around. The hospital is empty ... for a variety of monsters that seem to pursue them without any reason at all, except ... they pass through the corridors and stairwells, meeting every member of heavy metal band in their strange costumes -Rock shock .. . Nothing really memorable here except for the lousy action, the lack of gore / nudity, and absolutely shameless advertising edge that reminds me a lot of "KISS Meet the Phantom of the park." So, remember that a dud? It is a pity that I did not ... I just recommend that you avoid all this ghost movie house like a fungus and not listening to Lordi, as they are a rip-off band Gwar!
