This confused and incoherent mess of endless scenes boring dialogues and monologues. It is no exaggeration :. You have to make a huge effort to even try to participate with him <br /> <br /> I sincerely thought that Fassbinder would do something interesting to say why Erwin / Elvira suicide at the end, but instead, in every scene someone tries explained: "when he was young, it happened ..." and "he had just returned from Casablanca and ordered to cut all there ..." etc. <, Br /> <br /> Coming soon to the cinema, Erwin / Elvira massacre talking with another prostitute (of course, carnage is the best place for a nice chat), and telling her life story of Elvira, Fassbinder shows the killing of a cow after another . It is difficult to choose between paying attention to the disturbing images or transvestite says. Of course, we come to a very forced and rough symbolism "I suffered a lot in my life, and I'm dying." <br /> <br /> In one of the rare moments when in fact something happens, Erwin / Elvira meets a former lover that only after an extremely funny choreography with two other guys (like going to the desired level of homosexuality) with ' it is that it recognizes Elvira. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting shots and ideas, I have to admit (for example, if the nun tells the story of a young Erwin), but in the film is lost due to the self-indulgence of Fassbinder.
