Ah, Channel 5 local Mexican TV Every day, at 2:00 am, they air horror movies from the 70's to the early 2000s. It was "The Return of the cabin By The Lake» the film, which was shown yesterday. I'm sorry for his watch. <br /> <br /> original "Cabin By The Lake» was regularly Budgeter popular low and it was well accepted. The problem lies in the fact that it continued awful not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Ugh. The plot is really stupid in every sense of the word. <br /> <br /> The film is in some places looks like a soap opera because of its absurd dialogues, cinematography and direction. <br /> <br /> My advice: avoid this one at all costs. This is a film that does not need to look at anyone. not even for fans of mediocre movies. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
