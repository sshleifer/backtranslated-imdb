This type of story does have a lot of potential, but he was butchered here. Honestly, I felt an element of the cheese in the beginning, but I think it will be better after the grotesque birth. Wow, I was wrong! So crazy scientist making monster wants to show off his old cronies, before he kills them, but of course, they run away. After that, it's very bad. I have calculated the time of the rubber shark mask looked out of some leaves, but I probably would have lost count. <br /> <br /> Lord to the blood dripping-with-cut legs to show us how the shark-man is a man. I hate to be spoon-fed every aspect of a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, and after nearly died from a mutated shark-man and drag around jungles esqe island, nothing is more fun than reading Shakespeare amongst -aged man ... <br / > <br /> is one where you'll find yourself rooting for the monster ... if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for Flick.
