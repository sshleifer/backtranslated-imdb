Former actor brat pack and all the stars of the round hunk Rob Lowe in the film is set in an American high-security prison. I'm feeling inside his character will be popular for all the wrong reasons, as Tobias in the first series OZ, but proximity ISN `this kind of film,` s more like the movie "The people on the run", as a fugitive. It also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice, with James Coburn put in a cameo role as a representative of the Justice for the pressure groups of victims, but any rational discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored, as the film degenerates into a tired old clich√© shoot outs and car chases
