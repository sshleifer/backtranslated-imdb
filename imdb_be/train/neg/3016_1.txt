I, like many of them, a supporter of Tony Scott's films. When this movie came out, I had high hopes that it would be like «Man On Fire». In order to see what the film is the furthest thing from it! The history of marking time with the get-go, and the choice of Mickey Rourke was not such a good idea. And all «arm'scene was too gratuitous! <br /> <br /> The film is centered around Kira Kinghtly, and this film shows that it will never become a movie star! The film brought some of the worst acts ever. <br /> <br /> I like the direction of Tony Scott n all, but it takes a whole damn cake! Unfortunately Ton, 1 out of 10!
