During the first two seasons, I thought that the apprentice was very interesting and exciting show. The combination between reality shows and 16 weeks of interviews was innovative, and the show's producers managed to keep the show relevant and not too "out there". <br /> <br /> The new season 6 is not more than a big joke, and it has absolutely nothing to do with the business - at all. In the old days, they used to put a lot more focus on business problems related to - at the moment the focus is mainly in the conference room, where the participants have to do everything to keep them on the show (it means lying, trash-talking, infidelity, etc.). meeting room can be fun to watch, but it's fun at it lowest point - Sometimes you wonder if you're watching a repeat of an old episode of Jerry Springer. Tasks on the show are, at best, sad, and mostly a showcase for companies who are stupid enough to pay NBC for advertising. And what is the case about half of the participants live in tents in the season 6? It's just stupid and has nothing to do with the business in real life. <br /> <br /> I have absolutely no respect for any of the contenders this season, they all seem to be idiots to me. In previous seasons, at least some of the participants had some integrity, it now appears that the rivals would kill his own mother, to keep them on the show. In addition, it seems that massive ego of Donald Trump is becoming more and more for every season that pass by and, to be honest, I can not understand why anyone with common sense would like to work on it. His rationality in the conference room in the main does not make sense, and sometimes it seems that he just wanted to destroy the people for what it's worth. <br /> <br /> R.I.P Apprentice. Please, NBC, for God's sake, get the show off the air as quickly as possible. It's just too embarrassing to watch. Apprentice was once a great TV show, but now it's just a big fat joke.
