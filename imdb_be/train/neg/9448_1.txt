A lot of redemptive features, this film is not trash. His joke starts to be funny. Humor for kids miserable, and an attempt to appeal to adults just add sticky smuttishness the whole miserable package. Browsing through it with your children, just made me uncomfortable that may be next. I could not enjoy the movie at all. Although my child for whom you bought the DVD enjoyed the fact that it does not belong to a new DVD, neither she nor her sister expressed great interest to him again, unlike Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo, The Jungle Book, Lion King, etc., all of which get frequent requests for repetition.
