It's a bad film, but I have to give it a leading role in this one .... Francine Forbes. She seems to be valid, at least, and I personally thought it was cute. It is a pity that it is only in one other film in the database. In addition, the film is filled with ridiculous baked fakey blood and scenes of death. People get the knife, and they gush 2 liters of blood! But, if you enjoy watching bad horror movies, I recommend this highly.
