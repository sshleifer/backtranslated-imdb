Why is it that any movie about Cleopatra, the last phaoroh brings the worst in making the film? Whatever the appeal of a woman was for the greatest Roman of them all, Julius Caesar and his successor, Marc Anthony, never seems to come across on the screen as a sexual antics except seniors. Despite the lavish sets and costumes, this film is just as bad as any Italian "sandal and toga" extravaganza 50s. It should be recognized that this kind of spectacular relies on the big screen, so "Gladiator" went well, but the "Gladiator" was not all the romance of a new sex. <br /> <br /> Miss Varela is how little acting talent, like Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has talent to spare. Too bad some of them do not wash off in the other.
