I kinda liked the film despite this frantic pace. BUT, I did not appreciate the comment that Canada is referred to as the North Montana. This is definitely NOT Montana North and never will be. Americans wonder why they are seen as vain in the rest of the world, and this is one of the reasons why. Stop teaching the children of the United States to think that they have planets. Such a centrist view of the world does not become one of the world's great nations. Even as a joke. I would never treat the United States as "Alberta South." Walt would never put us down, so why start now. In addition, the film was pretty stupid, better luck next time.
