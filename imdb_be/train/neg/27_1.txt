Scary movie. Nuff Said. <br /> <br /> These lines are just Filler. The film was bad. Why should I expand, I do not know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. Acting sucks and writing simply idiotic. Poor in all respects. The only good thing about the film is breast Deniz Akkaya in. Even what has been destroyed, but a terrible and unnecessary scene of the rape. The film is poorly contrived and utterly incredible piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> Well, now I just want to rag on IMDb for this stupid rule 10 lines a minimum of text. First, I spend my time watching it waste. Then, feeling compelled to warn others to create an account with IMDb only to discover that I have to write an essay about the film friggen just to express how bad I think it is. It is not necessary.
