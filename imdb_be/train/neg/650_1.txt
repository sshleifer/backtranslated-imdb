Why does Hollywood feel the need to remake films that were so brilliant prime (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes), but it is much worse why Hollywood feels the need to alter these horror movies that were not brilliant to start with (Prom Night , the Amityville Horror) Just like the originals, these remakes failed in creating an atmosphere, nature or any real scares at all. Prom is so flat and uninteresting, it is difficult to see, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> It has acted badly, massively uninteresting and eventually faded tour, which not all of its developed. This is clearly Hollywood Horror is dead. This even The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise failed to destroy them in the style of a bucket of blood, and a decent plot. Prom night is almost bloodless, and I'm not even going to say how bad the plot. His inability to seal the killer determine makes it less disturbing horror film, as ERM ... original. <br /> <br /> One of the most famous horror films of the 1980s returns to terrorize moviegoers with this alteration, that just proves how monstrous dance of secondary school may be for real. Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) has survived a terrible tragedy, but now it's time to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style. <br /> <br /> When the big night finally arrived, Dona and her best friends are ready to enjoy their last big blowout high school living it up and partying till dawn. But while Donna wants to look past her nightmares and to a brighter future, a man she thought she had escaped forever returned for one last dance. Possessed by a killer is on the loose, and he will kill anyone who tries to prevent him from reaching his single Donna. <br /> <br /> Who will survive to see the graduation day, and that will make Donna when she forced to confront her greatest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup, Dana Davis and one of the main roles in the remake of the slasher, which will have a tuxedo-clad teenagers everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out to the dance floor. The site, which is likely to put you off going to see it. Witch, if you ask me, it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> Without a lot of work, McCormick boldly trying to milk the tension of the most banal situations. At some point the girl back from the lamp (bulb!) And McCormick tries to pump it into the jump-scares moment. Desperate times call for desperate measures indeed. There was not that many shots since the last cabinet IKEA catalog. <br /> <br /> In the era of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and catch a predator, there is probably a bizarre, scary movie extracted from the products in the glamor and creepy obsession with a young society beauty. This is not that movie. <br /> <br /> My final verdict? Avoid at all costs. Nobody wanted to Prom Night, it is even disappointing thoses, which usually are remakes of hack-work. Given its absolute lack of blood or fear. At night you will forget in a hurry.
