This absurdity of the new Doris Day COLLECTION really should not be included, as it is only in the film for less than 30 minutes. What she does, however, this shine when she is on the screen. Near the site of at least the film is just an excuse to show some of the Warner contract player per day. JANCIE RULE shows promise, and it's a shame that it does not become a big star. Ruth Roman handles the role of "go-getter" with aplomb. It is better if it was in color. In Travis air bases place with a rear projection works well. What's better about the film some lovely musical interludes. If you liked THANK his lucky star, and Hollywood DINING you enjoy it.
