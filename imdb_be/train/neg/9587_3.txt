Recovery in 1950 (London) and Soho pushy people. Based on the cult novel. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple video director. No more, no less. Give him $ 15 million, and it will make you pop video $ 15 million. Here he forgets that for two minutes with the people who can not really act - this one, and two-time? What is he thinking. Besides, who is the audience? Who cares about a book that is well remembered the way-back when. Usual London story takes him to adjudicate on the validity of the rule of law chance. <br /> <br /> What can really drag this film even further? Oh, I know, the third course of the songs that sound like they were made on the spot. David Bowie's old title of the film over and over again several times, and that is the highlight. The soundtrack album, clay pigeon stuff. <br /> <br /> There is one good thing, though. Good value Soho period. Shame they could not think of anything put in front of him.
