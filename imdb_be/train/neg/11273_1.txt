As you can gather the respectable cast of young British actors and come up with a bunch of cinematic manure? Horrible scenario irritatingly restless camera, badly edited, and abominably badly acted. Only Rhys Ifans trying to fill his role to life. Another painful proof that "different" is sometimes "dreck". Why is the money people do not read the script in advance? Do yourself a favor: do not feel sorry for yourself and do something else - like a hammer blow to his knees. This is less sick and more fun than the movie!
