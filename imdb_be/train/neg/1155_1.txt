ever film drove me to write a review, but it was only dire.i stuck with it, trying to find what it was about this film, which is made to pry take her as his first serious role, but to be honest , was poor choice.maybe did a good book, but it certainly does not work for me as film.i found it extremely lacking atmosphere and I found that many of the scenes of ugly stilted.a musical maestro, it can be but serious actor pry ain't.the acting Dylan McDermott and Rose Byrne was passable, but not enough to carry a weak plot with impotent dialogue. maybe I just completely missed the point, but I do not fit into any genre, it did not cause any sympathy with the characters and does not create any uncertainty, in fact, I found that praying for the end, and suppressing a deep desire to slap all three main hero !
