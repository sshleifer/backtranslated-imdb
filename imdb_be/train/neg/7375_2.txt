The film was heavily overshadowed by the presence of Steven Seagal. Or how should I say, Stephen is so sad! As before Seagal either too good or too stupid to re-dub my own lines, leaving someone to impersonate the voice for shots where the sound is necessary to go in cycles. Several films before this, he did it, but I do not think so much! To be honest the film looks pretty good, the script could use some work, but part of this movie look like a real movie! Of course, they all say that this film is very bad. <br /> <br /> It would be much better off without Segal, who became a cartoon of yourself. Do not disturb. All that is spent for this for too much! I honestly think this is the last time for me and the film Segal. What took me so long to figure it out?
