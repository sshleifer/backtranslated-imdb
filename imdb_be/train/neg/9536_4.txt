Best of the Best 4, better than 3, but only slightly. Basically, I'm saying this because part 4 does not contradict part 1/2 (3 does), (ie. They do not have a reference to Tommy Lee, with brothers and sisters). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked the Russian storyline of the story, especially the bit part, Sven-Ole Thorsen, Boris. In addition, although a few action scenes, the film is nothing special. Limited budget and very noticeable (especially in an airplane bloated scene). <br /> <br /> In addition, part 4 actually have no moral or say anything, as part 3 did have a couple of more better-known actors (Hudson, Thorsen) in Part 4, but unfortunately nothing of the kind in beginning of the series (and even the characters have a very small role). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems, is the best of the best. Rhee show, and to be truthful, it can not carry the film <br /> <br /> chainsaw tape, Rating: 4
