What did I just watch? I spent 90 minutes of my precious life, watching one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. The concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite scary seeing a lot of people who are afraid of clowns .... but having it would be 300 lb Tales saying the killer clown satirizes the genre. I still wonder how the character Mark could not escape from clown ... he's 300 pounds, he must be tired after all. All end forced me to stand up and literally say out loud: "What did I just watch?" Perhaps Brandon's cousin Denise .... and they got it closer to the middle of the film means that he had sex with his cousin to ..... this is that people want to see as * shudders *. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found funny silly introductory scene where the clown stabs woman, and she said: "What have you done?" Well Bytch you think he just did? The last thing was silly funny was one second protagonist was The Hitchhiker clapping and calling her ac * nt, and then 5 minutes later saying the violence else fails .... did writer gives the line for that guy? None of this film does not make sense anyway. <br /> <br /> The film was more or less mute low-budget porn that I received was involved in the purchase (all 3.99) and did not get entertainment out of it, except for the sex scenes. I am surprised that a fat clown did not join the orgy, would have the right fit. I was hoping that the film will have some entertainment value, as well as other movies B could, but I was wrong. This stupid piece of junk that is not even worth watching. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
