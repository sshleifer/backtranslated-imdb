If there is a hell, it contains a screening room where GRAND CANYON plays again and again in an eternal cycle. One would hope that the presence of so many wonderful actors - Danny Glover, Alfre Woodard, Kevin Kline, Mary-Louise Parker - to help replenish the presence of Mary McDonnell (whose penance to watch your own movies for all eternity) ... But no. Apparently, they injected these other subjects with serum made from McDonnell. All business pretentious, exaggerated, insulting (if you are deaf or know someone who is, be ready for your blood to boil in a funny scene TDD). GRAND CANYON filled with nasty, confident participation of people, but never gives us reason to like / understand / empathize or even stand them. With rare exceptions, they are unbearable lost that gene pool would be better off without. There is no plot to speak or character development (these people will never develop), not to take performance and most entirely arch writing you will ever come across in the film. The best thing about GRAND CANYON? Its name. It's one big hole in the film.
