I was very surprised at how bad this movie was. Good cinematography and beautiful scenery can be taken only movie so far. I was hoping for a rerun of the Hero, but it's much, much worse. <br /> <br /> This is why the film Kung Fu movies have gotten a bad reputation in the first place. Many plausible characters (even in a cartoon kung fu movie world, these characters are ridiculous), virtually no plot, and the absurd plot twists. <br /> <br /> This movie is so boring and so worried, because it reminds you of trying to play the game of pretending to be a child. Every time you think your stupid fight makes some sense, they invent another funny twist that makes no sense ( "Ah-ha, you just think that I have with your superpowers and 10,000 beam guns, but I eating vitamins is permeated with plutonium and Teflon, so that your ray guns do not work, and I'm immune to your superpowers .... Tap Tap any trade does not support infinity plus one. ") Children can continue with this madness, because they actually if someone does not care about listening to, because they have fun n ravestsi time. However, for the audience, especially an adult audience, the long film is worse than fighting with bad gas. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD Note to filmmakers kung fu, (a) if you have a knife in back hurts when you are not on the PCP, in this case, your kung fu is not strong, (b) if you repeatedly fall back, having a knife in it, it will hurt more and more damage, if it is not a fake support (c) if you get stabbed in the heart with a knife, you will die, especially in ancient China, where there is a Kaiser Permanente entirely around the corner, (g) kung fu fighting in the last Sun for several hours while the 3 feet of snow falls, and (e) is sometimes necessary to explain your characters and their motivations. <br /> <br /> In any case, go back to look Hero, because at least in my own little world, this is understandable.
