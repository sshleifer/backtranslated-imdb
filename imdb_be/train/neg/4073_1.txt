NO SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> I like horror movies, but it should be very poor attempt to make one ever. Call this "movie" is also stretched. This "random clips from obviously-fake and tacky violence and en-ugly- woman trying to act sexually-edit-bad together" is not worth watching. <br /> <br /> watching it about as interesting to see how some random family holiday photos, and it has about the same quality as you would expect if you send ten years his son in the forest with a new camera videoplastinoy and tell him to make a film. <br /> <br /> Grozny.
