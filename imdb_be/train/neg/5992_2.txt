Most embarrassing moment in the film when Corbet says, "You blossomed," near the end of the film. I almost died. I'm still not quite sure why the writers put that line in there. Was it supposed to create romance? Because almost made me sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was almost as bad. <br /> <br /> I never liked the original Thunderbirds, but the film Thunderbirds had the potential to do so much. This film does not. If it was not a big handout card brand Thunderbirds, he would have been shafted directly to a TV or preserved in post-production. Maybe even earlier. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about this film, when titles, and they play a song burst in "Thunderbirds is a go. I can not believe I spent $ 7 to watch this through pay per viewing.
