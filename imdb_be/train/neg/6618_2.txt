Overall FEATURES: - Finally, long awaited AAG hits the screens. Unfortunately, we could not set fire to a progressive audience. The first is best to talk about the film adaptations powerful idea Sholay. Warmia and made a good choice changes in the general background of the film. When he repeated the same Ramghad background, people again said that there is nothing new in this. Other background grateful, but, as he presented it is not worthy. From the very beginning of his career with Shiva in Telugu, he used the same type of lighting and background. I seriously do not know this guy Warmia thinks about lighting or not, maybe he has no other way of lighting, but to Gordon Willis GODFATHER. It's all Dutch Dutch Dutch Dutch. Why are some bodies use so much of Dutch angles and extreme close-up of shots !!!!!!! Separation of inaccurate shots. Characters that can not be emotions, ideas not their labels, Narration worse Background indeed very scary <br /> <br /> Babban: -. Amitabhz was a priority in their work. VARMA made great villains like Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai but this time he failed in the thread is constantly the best character of Hindi cinema. There is no comparison with Gabbar Babban. Babban is more crazy, not a villain, he still has a soft corner for his brother (This is present in the film). Amitabhz performance not to its brand. The very sight of his miserable. The scar on his nose, symbolizes the forgotten bastard black and white film. That they would work on Babban failed. Babban any comparison with Gabbar <br /> <br /> Narasimha -. The first best thing that this character does not put the audience in suspense on their hands. If Warmia did it, it would be like ABCD training to the holder of a bachelor's degree. Itz well he discovered the secret sooner. But the memory is a pity. Warmia could not use a great actor like Mohanlal to sign it <br /> <br /> Durga: -. The only character with improvement. This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and used in accordance with the history <br /> <br /> Heroo, Raj Ghunguroo: -. No body does not stick, or at least considers this character. Complete failure of the film begins when the director can not work on the close friendship between our heroz. These symbols do not carry anything of this film <br /> <br /> RAMGOPALVARMA: -. Its quality is degraded is reduced. AAG may well be regarded as a film class C. Sholay fire place, the problem of the city, that is, for true friendship and appreciated the trouble and fun to Dharmendra. AAG never carried the emotion with his characters. The narrative is too weak that he could not make the audience feel sympathy for the characters. Do not compare with AAG Sholay, still do not like it. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this movie. You'll be burned alive in RAMGOPAL Warmia KI AAG
