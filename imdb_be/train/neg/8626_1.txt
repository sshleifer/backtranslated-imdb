Looking through the other comments, I am surprised that there are not any warnings of potential viewers what they have to look forward to when renting this garbage. First, I took this thing with the understanding that it was a well-rendered Indiana Jones knock-off. What I got was one of the most disgusting movie I can remember trying to sit, made all the more shocking by relatively high production values ​​of the film. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's a spoiler, but if so, then keep in mind ... <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​fun is watching Bimbo getting raped behind Fearsome Tribal Chief, at the while she was looking at her dead eyes pretty cut off the head of another, by all means, make this film. If not, then I would advise you to look elsewhere for entertainment. <br /> <br /> Come to think of it, that scene so succinctly sums up the film that there's nothing else, I really need to say about it.
