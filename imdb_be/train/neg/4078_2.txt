Jessica: ghosts STORY as its name implies, a ghost story. The theme is meant to be a horror, but comes closer to comedy! <br /> <br /> A woman came who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead. This is what this movie is trying to give the plot. There's really nothing more to it. The film consists of a series of loosely connected scenes with a guy who had an affair with this woman to her death. <br /> <br /> Right from the opening scenes, this film has the appearance of "just for -DVD» efforts. Unlike gemstones, such as job 2, the film has no sense of direction or creativity and, of course, gives a "once on DVD» movies a bad name! Direction poor, as can be the complete absence of tension or stress deters. Even the dramatic elements hopelessly processed and represent something sadder than even worse than a soap opera you may have had the misfortune of enduring. <br /> <br /> action in all areas are absolutely terrible with no one actor is involved not being able to show even the slightest potential of a successful acting career. <br /> <br /> Many of the individual scenes are incredibly long, very long pauses between dialogue exchanges. I'm not exaggerating! <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this film rating 2 instead of 1, because some of the poorest, acting in conjunction with the even worse dialogue made some unintentional laughter. I emphasize the word "some" in this sentence. This is not a common one of the "so-bad-is-good 'films like CAMP BLOOD or nail GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, watching these films. If you want to see the right horror ghost watch Legend of Hell House, Changeling, Ringu, eyes (the original Korean version), Discontent, one missed call or by phone. <br /> <br /> I advise anyone who was lucky enough to avoid seeing Jessica: the ghosts of the STORY, to keep up the good work! Just forget this movie exists. Do not think about it!
