This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen (yes, it's even worse than Dungeons & Dragons, and any film starring Kevin Costner.) <br /> <br /> Chris Rock looked very uncomfortable for the film and its supporting actors do not even seem that they are trying to operate. Chris Rock a great comedian, but he simply can not convey his talent to this film, which probably has only two strained laughter throughout the film. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie yet, avoid it like the plague. Go do something constructive and more interesting as watching the weather channel or watching paint dry on a brick wall. <br /> <br /> For the efforts of Chris, I give it a 2/10! <br /> <br />
