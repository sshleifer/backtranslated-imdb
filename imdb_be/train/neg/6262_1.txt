I agree with the reviews that I read here, and I have no words to define such a turkey like this, but, in spite of everything, I can still find the cause of such films as it exists. How do you remenber those happy days, when videos were a booming business, and a lot of movies have been made for the sole reason of the filling shelves video stores? this film is from this period, and I can imagine that was the only reason for which it was produced, and the same thing happened to many, many, many other types of ugly. You remember "Rambo" fakes? and so many grinding with Z class? I still feel nostalgia that period.About this film, I can say that I did not waste my time watching it, because I pressed the fast-forward button after the first fifteen minutes, only to find very funny scene where the guy was pushing the ax against the executives who blew up, because, as you well notice that they were made of plastic. As for the end, well, it was so bad shot, I could not understand what had happened. That's the same thing I did not follow a non-existent plot at all. But the boy, the video age has been a great age, in spite of the movies like this.
