Really need a movie with characters who are so sympathetic that I really do not care who will fare the best (or is that the aim of the film to reflect some smooth talking heartless city people of New York?) A lot of romance here, no comedy either. Responsibilities are very flat and very predictable plot. What annoys me most is the constant joking with quotations from classic films. Man, can not you see that the more you quote, the less important it becomes your own movie? Try to be original for yourself! A small budget is no excuse at all, the first time the director has neither. Crappy, bad, dirty. Not surprisingly, that only cost me one dollar ...
