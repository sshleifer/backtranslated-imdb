I saw it in the theater when it came out, and just yesterday I saw him again on the cables. This I was able reacquainted himself with a sense of how repugnant this film. A whole bunch of characters egocentric narcisstic preeners. The worst thing is that it amplifies every negative stereotype about 20-something love, even as she wants to celebrate people "find themselves." Nice guys finish last, convulsive guys are doing great, that jerkiest guys do best. Girls all boy toys pushovers. Only one character ( "Wendy") see to do anything remotely useful for society, and it cost her a long time kept his virginity at the idle one-night stand with the thugs in the great scene that we have to think is romantic. The fact that this is actually the concept of Hollywood young America: permissive, detached, promiscuous, vain.
