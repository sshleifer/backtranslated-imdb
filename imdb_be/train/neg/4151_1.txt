This is probably the best horror film since Ed Wood did die. <br /> <br /> I can not spoil the ending, because I have no idea about what happened. I'll try my best, though. There is some lesbian vampire, but they keep swapping the body, so that any character may or may not be a character you have to think that it is, or it may be a lesbian vampire. <br /> <br /> Sound confusing? It's not as complicated as you might think, since none of the characters does not make sense to start with. There's no plot, no character development, and random people show up, say a few lines, and then disappear, never heard of. There is also a zombie, which * might * vampire enemies, but there is also a sleep-in-December type of sequence in a psychiatric hospital, so maybe it's actually happened, and it's all a hallucination of the protagonist, <br /> <br /> The advantages? The two leading girls take their shirts short. The special effects are stunning (I particularly liked the incredibly slow, clumsy fight sequences). Everyone has really stupid Canadian accent, which adds to the overall level of fun. <br /> <br /> Well worth the price of rent. We laughed until we cried.
