Terrible movie! It must be against some types of real ugly to be nominated for a Golden Globe. They made the story of the first known female artist of the Renaissance and distorted beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they liberties with the facts; when the story was good, that would be great. But this is just amazing - seems to be the true story of the artist would make for a much better movie, so why did they come up with this dishwater-dull screenplay? I believe that was not enough nudity in the actual version. He hastily capped off in the end with a summary of the artist's life - we could have saved yourself a couple of hours, if they were in favor of the rest of the movie with the same brevity.
