It is difficult to praise this film a lot. CGI for the dragon was well done, but not enough for a proper simulation of light and shadow. In addition, the same frames are used indefinitely dragon stomping through the corridors, which are becoming a little tedious. <br /> <br /> I was amazed to see "Marcus Aurelius" in acting credits, wondering what the former emperor of Roman Empire does acting in this film! As "Whoopi Goldberg", he must be an alias, and one can accuse him of using one, if it is in this bitch. <br /> <br /> stories may be interesting, but the acting is flat, and the direction of tedious, you should see this movie, go around the house of your friend and get drunk, making it so - it will be a pleasant one.
