The child did not watch films for several years, so I missed «Here Come the Tigers" when it first came out. (I've never seen even "Bad News Bears," although in the 70 years I worked for the boys and girls who arranged financing for the film, "Warriors," "The Man Who Would Be King" and "Rocky Horror Picture Show" among others.) Now I would like to check out the old or small movies, and find people who have gone to great career, even though less than a great movie early. Only I could not minutes in this film more and jumped in the credits to see if there was a young actor in this film, which went on to bigger and better things - at least in watching his / her appearance would have created some interest as the plot and action did the job. And here, I spied the name Wes Craven is credited as an electric lamp. He has already made two or three of his early Shockers, but have not created or made Freddy Krueger «Scream» movies. Maybe he should benefit and help in this picture. Even more surprising was Fred J. Lincoln cast uncredited as "Aesop" stupid character in the film. F.J. Lincoln, from 70 to just a few years ago appeared and made adult films. He was associated with adult parody «The Ozporns», and only the name funnier than all the "Tigers" attempted humor combined. Let the fact that the adult actor was placed in a children's movie be a sign of how people are making this film was supposed to be asleep at the wheel.
