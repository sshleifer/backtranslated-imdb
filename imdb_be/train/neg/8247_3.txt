Another British romantic comedy that audiences all over the world seem to have an insatiable appetite. It is the intention of unintentional parody of the genre - all classic clich√©d scene here from ridiculously complicated misunderstandings run after the train, to declare his love. Characters one-dimensional caricatures except Love Hewitt, who manages to bring some cohesion to the film. What threatens to spiral out of control in the Department of credibility, as the film progresses; Our good-natured suspension of belief, finally comes crashing down during a ridiculous ending. If you are looking for Bridget Jones, Notting Hill kind of experience, you will not find it here.
