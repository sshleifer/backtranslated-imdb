The main fault in this film that you can not trust any of these people ever be cast in a professional production of Macbeth. Hearing the quiet voice of David Lansbury struggling laboriously to known "Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow" it made it impossible to believe that anyone would consider him for the role. I continued to believe in such a way that he did not get the role, because he was a lousy actor; not because the longer they were available. Then, when we see fragments of the play in rehearsal, it's hard to believe that the director does not parodying things hopelessly miscast, misdirected travesty of actors who can not articulate or even understand the lyrics and the director, who see the game through their own interpretation of the cranks. Sometimes directors because I would like to make their films (and writers think they have the ability to direct their work) that they settle less. It seems that such an example.
