SMALL **** SPOILERS *** How bad movie connoisseurs I should have viewed hundreds of bad movies and still "Hobgoblins" stands apart from all others in its own unique way. Classic villains such as "creeping terrorism", "Powerful Gorga" and "Manos" uniformly bad from start to finish. "Hobgoblins" on the other hand, starts bad and getting worse and worse as it goes. During my first view of the notorious battle scene river, I thought it was a really bad movie. I was blissfully unaware that I had just seen the best that this film had to offer. The film takes its most massive collapse in girl hell during the painfully inept sequence «Club Scum», which is a continuous string of unfunny joke after another. With just this one film, directed by Rick Sloane proves that he deserves to be mentioned along with the likes of Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane, as one of the worst director of all time. How bad can a bad movie be? Attentive "houses" and interesting, no longer exists.
