I admire "Kissing on the MouthÂ» for his sincerity ?? pubic hair clippers and masturbation, especially from the master / director Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to show the truth of the everyday "private" entry. Unfortunately, the film falls within the scope in "The Brown Bunny", albeit with a little more developed plot of jealousy. Yes, it reflects "Bunny" with a lot of nothing going on, or too much focus cinematic frames (or genuinely focused) on absolutely nothing ?? feet, hands or genitals. Again, unfortunately, I can understand why this film was released, and why people rent real life sex scene and full frontal (equally both male and female) nudity. In addition, it was a waste of time. We will soon find out the post-college male / female cohabitant couples in which the man has obvious feelings for a female who sees him only as a friend, constantly having sex with her ex-boyfriend. In addition, we are exposed to daily events of his boring life: she works for their parents; it works on a very uninteresting project of sexual consciousness on his computer. To do this all works, the dialogue should be interesting and valid reality. No work, and it is as sad as watching someone goes for an hour, that is "The Brown Bunny." The only actor who stands Kate Winterich, and even she makes some questionable actions. (DVD-Extra with her before the microphone is actually worth watching / listening to.) Again, I admire filmmakers, especially Svanberg, for baring it all and are not afraid to expose themselves or shower habit, but in general, the film falls flat. It has a narrative that does not fit into the scenes, too many sad everyday events and unconvincing acting that you wonder, except the soft porn factor why you rented it.
