I thought that this film seemed like a case study in how not to make a film for the most part. Since I am a film director, I give it a 2 for consistency. <br /> <br /> The problems remain from the beginning to the end of the plot is very predictable with scraps of most, if not all, previous successful military history, computer generated schedule was too similar to watching a video of the game in points and seemed there were no attempts directed to add the realistic quality of the story. I was interested in the budget to get an idea of ​​what he was supposed to work, but did not find the information. <br /> <br /> It seems that this project pushes the boundaries of the film budget is too low as a result of production that takes the audience along with the story without doing presentation. The actors were not bad, but the story needs more innovation.
