I do not usually write a review online, but this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Not only that, it is removed as well as a series of soap ( "young and restless" actually filmed by professionals compared to this), but it also has the terrible cuts. It does not have any action. It is full of useless garbage <br /> <br /> Here is an example :. The guy wants to kill the main character, he was fired because of it. Yes (after loads of crap), here they are: the guy puts the knife into his throat and says something like, "Now you're dead," Then the protagonist says. "If you kill me you're dead, I told the police that you are threatening me." . Thus, (killer) guy goes by (about to cry): "Oh, no ... the cops on me ... !! Oh my God !?Â» <br /> <br /> Note :. This is just an example . I really can not believe that this film actually exists so:. If you want to see the worst movie ever ... going forward, I recommend :)
