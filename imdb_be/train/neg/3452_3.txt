I decided to watch a movie at the recent Festival of Dubai Film, since he was elected to the prestigious competition section of the Cannes Film Festival. I was surprised that Cannes can be so off the mark in assessing the quality of <br /> <br /> The film, some reviewers have noted not too many shots. - but the inherent violence is repulsive. Imagine killing your opponent / competitor in front of your young son..or forcing someone to have a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. There are some hints of contrasting sons in Corleone Copolla in "The Godfather," which seems to be reborn here, in this Chinese / Hong Kong film, but the quality of the two so very different as chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> This film is recommended only for violence junkies..there no big movie here. At best, it can be considered better than conventional production Run Run Shaw for production values.
