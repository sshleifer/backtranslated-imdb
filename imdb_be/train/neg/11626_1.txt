This may be the worst show I have ever seen. Besides the presence of bad taste sitcom about Hitler, it's just not funny or entertaining in any way. This is very similar to the 1950 sitcom in its cornball humor and contrived situations, but while it can be done well, as in I Love Lucy, it's just not funny here. I think the show was based around innovation "look, it's Hitler as awkward sitcom figure", but he just fell in all respects. The guy plays Hitler is so unnatural that it is difficult to sit through it alone. I wonder what could possibly make the network think it was a good idea to air. I thought that America had some tasteless show, but the British had to beat us this time. America would never be aired a sitcom about Hitler, even though we had a show about controlled Lincoln, The Secret Diary Desmond Pfeiffer. Most likely, you'll probably never see this show, as only broadcast one episode and probably never will be released on DVD.
