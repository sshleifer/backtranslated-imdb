I finally saw an incubus after waiting for 20 something odd years to see it well, it is certainly not worth waiting all this time to see him. Incubus strictly at the number of horror: an invisible killer / monster is raping and killing women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The film is as follows: the film opens with the murder; then bla; bla more; something else killing; more blah blah blah; continuing blah blah blah; another murder (weird, huh?); blah blah blah, etc ... <br /> <br /> The film is entirely predictable from start to finish. Even silly "big" red-herring is used throughout the film does not convince a 5-year-old. And I knew the secret identity of incubus when I saw the character, so when "shocking" surprise ending arrived, I was not shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that I kept laughing days after I saw the movie. This is so stupid! <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie as a buy-an amount that the sequence of "rock band" is one of the few moments of standing in this sad Flick. It released the scene is not necessarily because it is good, but because it's so funny and meaningless: the film plays on the big screen shows a rock-video as the moment a woman in red leather pants to get it obviously fake cut long hair, it all edited with scenes of a girl who is attacked in the toilet theater way incubus. The best thing I could say about this film is the film, which I really liked. But apart from that, there is almost nothing worth mentioning about the incubus, except that it inadvertently paddle.
