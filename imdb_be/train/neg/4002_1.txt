Social commentary was way overblown and the mystery itself is constructed and solved through a series of unlikely coincidences that were absolutely unbelievable. Nothing has changed in my personal life Fitz in the last decade, making it remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> I even difficult to understand why he complained about his stay in Australia, compared with the possibilities to solve the mysteries that he has in England. He can not wriggle in the Australian police? It looks like a very artificial plot to get him involved in the investigation of crimes. <br /> <br /> In the last episodes of the original series it was pretty melodramatic and improbable, sometimes bordering on stupidity, and this one raises the mantle rather than returning to the series of focus one. Garden.
