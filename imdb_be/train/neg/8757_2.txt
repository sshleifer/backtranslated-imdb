Ostensibly a film that predicts future trends in British pop music, it's not on many fronts, it's funny. Tommy Quickly? Honeycomb? The film does include a song by Spencer Davis, two animals, and one attached to the film live Beatles make their live version of Twist and Shout (all 1:20). But in general, awkward display of British music around 1964. Oh, and Herman the hermit.
