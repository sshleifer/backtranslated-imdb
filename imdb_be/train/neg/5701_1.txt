And so much rewriting of history continues to Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> It was pointless funny garbage. <br /> <br /> It shocks me that such an amazing amount of money you can spend to produce something that is very far-fetched, badly acted inaccurate film I've ever seen. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> short flirtation Nic Cage's a serious actor, it seems to have ended. I can only assume that the Leaving Las Vegas was a glitch in the otherwise nightmarish litany of movies. <br /> <br /> Diane Kruger proves that her performance in Troy was not an accident, she really can not act. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel should be ashamed to work on such a scar. <br /> <br /> is only recommended for those who are either recovering from a recent lobotomy or the people of the opinion that America invented the world.
