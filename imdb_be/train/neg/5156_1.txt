"Laughter is a state of mind," says the tag, and it is difficult to comment on Barry Levinson. What could he be thinking during the filming of "toys"? When he watched footage he saw successful, funny fantasy? If so, it works in a different plane than I have this painful scene in which the design of the production of 90% of the things (and even animated color disappointment). Robin Williams and (especially) Joan Cusack understated, like brother and sister toy magnate who avoided as factory heirs when their father dies. There's nothing remotely funny (or satirical farce-wise) in the display here. Draggy uniform, ugly, and one of the worst "big" movies ever. star is not from ****
