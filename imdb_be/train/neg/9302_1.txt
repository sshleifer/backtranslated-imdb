This film is simply awful. It is sad, it is of poor quality, the actors simply the worst actors I've ever seen, and the script is so bad that it's fun. <br /> <br /> Â«main" actor should be a hot guy who gets all the girls, but it's ugly, overweight, and looks as if he is from the beginning of the 90s. <br /> <br /> all the characters away for the weekend to get together with friends, but nobody really are your friends! The couple did not see the "main" guy for 5 years, and even then they were not really friends. "Date" the main guy knows him from his work and the girl there are pick-up at the bar. Now tell me that you run the risk of losing their jobs to spend a weekend in your cabin with people who are not even your real friends. Because that's what he was doing in the beginning of the film! <br /> <br /> Do not waste even one minute of your time on this lemon. I made a home video worse than that! <br /> <br />
