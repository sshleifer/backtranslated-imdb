It was a disappointing film. Given the material --- military life is always good for a laugh --- and stars, this film was to fall laughfest. It's worth a few chuckles, at best. Steve Martin was much funnier than this, and it seems that Aykroyd have to follow the dramatic roles, where he could take the example of Robin Williams and someday win an Oscar.
