** HERE BE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Summary: Mia (Helin) returns home from the capital Stockholm in rural Rattvik celebrate her birthday parents of the Seventy. It is certainly the youngest child, and my two sisters, Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petr√©n). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rattvik and Gunilla divorced and moved to the city far away. Mia and one more focused on his career. There are a lot of jealousy, and almost hatred between the sisters and conflicts arise around as they confront each other, and each has personal problems that they are difficult to handle. As the party goes (and alcohol is consumed), more and more secrets to become open and more and more conflicts arise ... <br /> <br /> Comments: In order to be the work of a new writer / director was disappointed to see this film is to follow in the same tracks that are older Swedish comedy / drama follows the years. There really are no new elements or ideas. This film is based on three main areas. 1) It is a shame humor only on the basis of the characters fool of yourself. 2) Sadness and 3) alarm. This step has a focus on the latter, almost forgetting the first point, as the movie goes along. There is no loss, though, as the humor, which does not exist, is not funny. Performances by actors well, I think, even though it has lost for all the suffering and soon forgotten. I was hoping that there would be new ideas and influences, but there was none. In conclusion, there are better ways to spend my time than watching it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
