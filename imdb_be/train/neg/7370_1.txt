I've seen a lot of movies Sigal, and while most of them are not great, or even good, it evaporates hill lowered the bar for bad movies <br /> <br /> The plot :. Not sure really. Something about a drug that makes you all crazy and strong or something. Who are the good guys and the bad guys? Hard to say. Much of the film cut scene goes back and forth between people in a dark room lit complain how good Seagals character «Mashall» is <br /> <br /> duties :. Blows <br /> <br /> The voice sound. ,,,,,, What a terrible voice! imposition of whether they could to find anyone who sounded any less like Seagal? Maybe it was Cheech and Chong do voice-overs, can at least entertain it. <br /> <br /> This film is boring and downright silly. Avoid this at all costs !!!!
