Let me first that I love westerns and Civil War history. I also think John Ford as outstanding director. I also have the same high feeling to the acting talent of John Wayne and William Holden. <br /> <br /> I can not remember when I saw this film when it first came out in 1959. Last night was the first time I've seen him since then. <br /> <br /> In my 4 rating, it can be said that I do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I try to tell you some of its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> John Lee Mahina, who wrote the script from a novel by Harold Sinclair, was a very gifted writer and has written many beautiful scenarios, the script is written badly and are poorly understood. They mention the terrible conditions in prison Andersonville, Andersonville film time was not in operation. They also use a rifle, which is not used in a while. <br /> <br /> John Ford directing more than 40 years and won four Oscars. He must have been sick during the filming this.His conventional style lacking. Maybe it was a movie in the southeast, but not in Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> He used to be a joint stock company of players he used almost all of his films, most of them are not enough this time. At this time, only minor cowboy star Hoot Gibson and Ken Curtis plays a role, of course, Anna Lee has a small role. There have been no other familiar faces for the 3 stars, except. (See below) Mr. Fords stock company made most of his films were classics; unfortunately we missed here. <br /> <br /> Now we come to the main stars John Wayne and William Holden. Duke also was ill, he seemed ridiculous here. This role is usually to match his style perfectly, it was just adequate here. William Holden did everything I could, but nowhere as good as he used to. <br /> <br /> It was necessary that there be an actress in this type of movie. Here, in her first starring role (second film) Constance Towers, very handsome man, but in fact is not an actress, she still has a role on the television. Let me be nice and say that she had a long career, more based on her looks than acting talent. In addition, Saha as a servant of Mrs. Towers is a tennis star Althea Gibson.I I'm glad she stuck to tennis. <br /> <br /> In other industrial loans were far from the usual high level of other films of John Ford were a few songs military type allegedly made camp cavalry, are not suitable. Scenes were good, but come to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Ratings * 1/2 * (4) 47 points (100) IMDb 4 (10)
