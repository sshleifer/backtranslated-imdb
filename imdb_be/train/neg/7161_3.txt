A young American woman visits her Irish roots and parries druid witch who wants to possess her. It sounds intriguing, but after an interesting start, I got lost and spent most of the time wondering where this is going. The film seems to blur in two directions - we see the severity of the Irish-American woman, hitting her problems with alcohol or we look straight from a horror movie about an evil witch who returns from the past? The director can not seem to solve. The two do not seem to gel, and eventually you will not get anywhere else. This can be done a lot better, and the story seemed to drag until the end. It was the sad and disappointing.
