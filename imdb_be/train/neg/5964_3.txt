A version of this movie I saw was called "Death comes from the grave." Horror in question plays an evil magician medieval Spanish horror legend Paul Our watched him play in the Ebenezer church pantomime hall. He rises from the grave, when a foolish descendant (I think he is a descendant, as he also plays Naschy) returns to his ancestral home and reunite the head and body of a wizard who has been separated from at witchfinders, to implement it in the attempt to stop him um, resurrected from the grave. <br /> <br /> Obviously, once the head and body with a whole hell of a lot to lose and people die. Like all good magicians, Ebenezer there is a great helper. This one played another Spanish horror big, beautiful Helga line. Like almost every other woman in the movie line periodically gets her kit off. There are many obnazhenok in this movie, not just a woman - we even get to see the belly of Naschy's body, which is not very nice, I can tell you. Most of the sex angle of the film is ridiculously gratuitous. There is one particularly funny scene where Naschy line and discuss their insidious plans, and then suddenly decided to both have to feel they had in the marriage of a young blonde <br /> <br /> It is also quite bloody revenge. - notably Herschell Gordon Lewis-squire when the line drops his hands in the human breast to remove his heart. <br /> <br /> the best part of the film is quite effective zombies who turn up to the end. They quickly deterred by the fire, although do not bother coming back. What a shame. The scene in which zombies are raised, however, the most ridiculously inopportune moment of the film. All this happens in a long shot, and we do not really got a clue what's going on, until we see some numbers on Shambling distance. There are a few moments of garbage like this, largely due to poor editing. If the worker falls under hypnosis Naschy head there big close-up of his face, which seems to last forever, and serves no purpose whatsoever. <br /> <br /> In general, not a big horror movie, but exciting enough. Of course, the version I saw was dubbed American version, which is likely to cut into pieces. For all I know, the original Spanish version can be a masterpiece ...
