It's funny that I find myself forced to rethink the film, but I'm here. <br /> <br /> I consider, because recently, I had the opportunity to observe the revival of R.C. Game Sheriff's "Journey's End" on the stage in New York, Belasco Theater, starring Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, and also be skillfully directed by David Grindley. <br /> <br /> I left the theater destroyed. I'm not exaggerating, I was surprised. After almost two and a half hours restored and very claustrophobic way of life of a soldier in the trenches of the Somme (I speculate), during the First World War, brought to life vividly, all the participants, I left the theater with the shakes. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind, I'm not shocked, and I'm not too sensitive. I'm a stage actor and director himself, so I know that the press of a button in order to achieve certain effects, both emotionally and psychologically. <br /> <br /> But what I just saw, I came so much life, that I had a chill in the spine, as I walked away. <br /> <br /> None of these emotions do not come to life, while watching «Aces High», the film based on the play, and even adapted for the screen, in cooperation with the remote control itself Sheriff, shortly before he he died. <br /> <br /> film adaptation takes place in the skies over France. Thus, it passed this claustrophobic atmosphere to begin with. <br /> <br /> The only plus of the film, are air battle scenes, which look dated in their special effects, compared to today's standards, but still very valid tactical flight taken on the screen. <br /> <br /> Allowed there were a few adaptations of "All Quiet on the Western Front" by Erich Maria Remarque, which takes place in the trenches, not in the sky, but it was "German" vision of things when one wanted to be picky on such things. <br /> <br /> «Journey's End" just another side of the coin, and would do it in a great movie, if they left him alone and intact <br /> <br /> Transfer to DVD poor, although in widescreen and adapted to the 16: 9 TV screens, the quality of the film is that the cinema. Nothing more, nothing less. It sports a variety of defects such as scratches and small point, though a copy, for relaxing, clean. <br /> <br /> If you want another movie WWI in your collection, especially for those who love and enjoy to see dogfights among the old-timers, this is the picture for you. But I would suggest, "von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, although it is also the film is filled with inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you who love a good action and drama, I would leave this one out. Buy the game. Go watch the game, if you have the chance to get a decent revival of it next to you, but not to let this potential adaptation. <br /> <br /> This is an anti-war film, granted, but the weakest I have ever seen in my life ever. <br /> <br /> presence of actors such as Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud, it's just a bluff, as they have just seen in a very weak and very short cameo role in the whole film. <br /> <br /> McDowell, a very talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, all delivered very little understanding, not because of lack of skills, but because of the lack of a genuine and solid direction. <br /> <br /> There are too many gaps in it, and as mentioned earlier, it pulls itself dubious end. Doubtful, because the original game, none of the people we have come to know and empathize, not to stay alive. All of them were killed in fatal and futile mission. In the film, they all die except Malcolm McDowell, who manages somehow to stay alive one more day, as the commander of a wing of the unlucky bunch, just get three more pilots to fly and die for the other bad. <br /> <br /> the end of the game leaves a bare stage in total darkness. You can hear the roar of cannons, machine guns and grenade launchers rattle impact throughout the theater. Then, suddenly, the total peace and quiet. The curtain rises. Light. And all of them. Lining up, standing up straight and hard. Obedient corpses ... <br /> <br /> It is much more interesting and much more shocking than the final «Aces High», which is also pulled by the hair. <br /> <br /> It's up to you to judge. <br /> <br /> for me when I had money and contacts to do so, I would like to take the game and develop it as it was intended. Adding here and there some action scenes in this area, just visualize the "external" terror and slaughter takes place in the "boundless fields of France", around the men involved, but then, just strictly focus on what is happening, what the tiny "box" on edge of sanity and the world ... <br /> <br /> He wants to film? <br /> <br /> Then, ask him. <br /> <br /> it is not.
