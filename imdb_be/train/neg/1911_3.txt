Formula swing guy who wants a girl, guy who will lie to get close to the girl, the guy who got the best one to help in blatant way (comedus reliefus, no?) To help the girl to deceive, etc. This one has been done to death, and with rare exception of a few rating of Mr. picnics, this has been done better. <br /> <br /> stale plot aside, leads are attractive, and there are a few good moments. Zhonaton shki done better, and his actions there were close to being called to. Whether or not a total loss, but there is nothing new in the case of cool.
