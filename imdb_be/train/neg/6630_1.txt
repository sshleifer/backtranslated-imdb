This so-called replica scary. I went to see it today .. the first day, as the expectation and hype was too much for me to handle. But in the first half an hour, we knew it was a disaster. This not only does not meet the hype created, but also offends the original blockbuster. The script was slit, the editing was untidy quite a few times. Mohanlal, who is an excellent actor did a good job. Amitabh was good .. the director wanted to portray as evil, his character, but he went a little overboard, which led to him to be strong. Ajay, who particularly smooth like that role also disappointing. Let's not even get started on the new boyfriend Prashant .. one would not be proud to start a career with something like this. Razhpal Yadav, who was thrown for a few laughs could not even get a smile out of any of its power of humor and a shrill voice. Nisha Kothari has proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have today. In general, RGV, I thought that one of the most talented and gifted filmmakers of India has failed ... He took such a huge challenge and responsibility to alter what is known as the best Hindi film ever, and messed with him.
