If you've ever seen the eighties slasher, there is not much reason to see it. Originality is often not one of the reference slasher film, and that's what this movie is seriously lacking. There's really not much that can be said about the pranks, so I'll make this quick. The film was one of 74 films on the list Nasty DPP video, and it was my only reason to view it. The plot follows a bunch of kids who are left behind at the hostel on Christmas. As they slasher, someone decides to start collecting them, and this leads to one of the most frustrating mysteries ever seen in a horror movie. The fact that this film was on the list of video Nasty strange because, despite several bloody scenes, the film is unlikely to bribe or corrupt anyone, and gorier slashers than (Friday the 13th, for example ) not completely prohibited. But then again, there banned films, which are much less bloody than this (The Witch, who came from the sea, for example). In any case, the conclusion of the film the best thing about it, because even though the audience really could not care less who is the instigator of this paragraph; it's pretty good. In general, it is dreary and dull slasher that even Slasher fans would do well to skip.
