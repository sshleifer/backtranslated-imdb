On the way to the small town, which is the way off the beaten path (but looks suspiciously close to the highway), a female reporter working in the country Hitchhiking, who agrees to help steer it to its destination. Amazing people, then lists a couple of creepy stories related to this field: in the first story, is guilty of adultery couple looking for women to kill her husband, but eventually suffer far worse than the share of themselves when they are attacked by zombies; and in the second story, a group of holiday makers have their vacation was cut short when the undead rogue offended by being urinated on his grave. <br /> <br /> Zombie Chronicles attempt writer Garrett Clancy and directed by Brad Sykes to create a zombie themed anthology ?? Good idea, but only two stories, it falls sorely lacking. And it's not the only way in which this low-budget gore flick fails to deliver: the current lousy (Joe Haggerty, like a fairy tale, saying Ebenezer Jackson, giving one of the most amazing performances I've ever seen); Location uninspired; scenario sick; there are sex scenes with nudity zero; and ending with .... well that beggars belief. <br /> <br /> In order to be fair, some of the camera-Sykes creative work is effective (although useless method, which is used as escape characters through the forest is Thad abuse) and cheap Joe Castro gusset enthusiasm: his ear bitten off, eyeballs are removed, the person is removed, the brains flattened, and there is a dirty decapitation. These positives only make the movie bearable, but keep in mind, The Zombie Chronicles is not a walk in the park, even for experienced spectators Mr class trash. <br /> <br /> I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generously to lift the rating to 3, since I did not get to see the movie with 3D benefits (although I have a sneaking suspicion that the extra dimension would not do that much of a difference).
