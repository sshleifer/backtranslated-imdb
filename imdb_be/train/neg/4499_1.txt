Any movie that has a nude scene, Karen Allen, and I'm still so sad, I go out, that is a bitch! <br /> <br /> Karen stuck in Paris, and is friends with sissily-handsome French man, with whom she has sex in the near future. Of course, he was married, ( "But, Cheri, why should this be a problem?") What might be an interesting clash of cultures (believe it or not) just bored. I went out. <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie was a lot better after I have gone; but it would have gotten a lot better, to compensate for a rotten start. <br /> <br /> My advice, if you find yourself in this, run, do not walk, to the exit. Save your time and your energy. Truly save your money. It's a shame the production company does not save money.
