... or audience. A quick summary .... <br /> <br /> So you got this doctor who experimented with stolen body parts on some vague cause. He wants to improve the grafts, but feels that he must do it in his basement. WTF ??? And then, unfortunately, and comfortable, his bride gets her cut off the head in an accident, that he was responsible. Tormented by grief, he keeps his head in the lasagne pan (or is it a strudel?) And pumps it up to the top "adrenergic serum" (sic), to keep it alive. Then she wakes up, telling her head (so to speak), even if her neck was clearly broken on the vocal cords, and she does not have lungs, so she could not speak, even if it was them. It seems ungrateful b * snip does not appreciate all that her fiance had done for her. Just like a woman ..... <br /> <br /> Then his grief turns horniness, he sees the possibility of vaccination beloved head on the body of the first running a prostitute, he can pick up from the street. At the same time, a physician assistant, a sort of dime-store Igor gets into philosophical discussion with the head, which struck up a friendship with telekinetic "monster in the closet" (every mad scientist has one). In the end, the writer realizes that he can not keep that causes his misogyny and fear of intimacy issues on the audience to infinity, so that it kills all the supposedly goes to the bank to cash a check before the financial backers of the film has a chance to stop payment on it. <br /> <br /> I have mentioned, I think it's a bad film? <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Turner Classic Movies, to stop the show, that an edited version without the bloody material. Sight assistant with his arm ripped off, pirouettes around the house, leaving a lot of blood anywhere simply too expensive.
