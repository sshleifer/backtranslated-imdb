In a word: excruciating. Advised me to read a few articles about the philosophical sense of the film later, but after sitting through the endless 115 minutes of the film and the future is slowly crushed under her swollen symbolism and lava flows depressing, it seemed better to just tell a reaction to the film. After all, who goes to the movies with a training plan in hand? And this movie was dull. Lead actor Claude Laida, from the opening of the movie to the end, is the same hard mask i irritate flour to be virtually indistinguishable from the eternal, the insidious voice of the film frame. Shooting one above the other, it might have worked better than to subject and audience, since they are basically saying the same thing: Priest Ambricourt is unfortunate man. The story about the haunted priest who tries to help troubled rich family does not do anything to make his character vaguely interesting or nice, like family unpleasant bunch of eccentrics, and the priest, he comes across as a curious pest, the last 30 minutes of offer some exciting message of grace and suffering of one man caught up by others, but because of all the condescending Closeup suffers Laydu and foggy subtext in the script by Robert Bresson, all I felt was, at last, it's over, let's eat ice cream. It is interesting for those who like Bresson fanatic Paul Schrader, just to see how many elements of character and Schrader installation is carried out in their scripts and movies, especially the "Taxi Driver," "Raging Bull" and «Light Sleeper».
