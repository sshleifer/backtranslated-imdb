Its arguments, it seems there are only four false sources (despite the fact that he has been featured in the credits on IMDb I have not seen Richard Dawkins anywhere), he edited together with roughly ridiculously amateur computer effects, and it is not It makes no attempt to are impartial. The narrative is saturated throughout with a mocking, almost adolescent anti-Christian sentiment, destroying any possibility that the film can really change someone's mind, and not just preaching the choir (ie me). Although there are some interesting discussion about the historicity of Jesus, the film strikes an unbearable obstacle when he begins to dwell on the Christian school, which was attended by the director as a child, an institution that seems to scar him psychologically ill, he takes possession of his day so far. <br /> <br /> While TGWWT was obviously low budget, there is an opportunity here to make a sensible comment on the dubious roots of Christianity. There is certainly a lack of skeptical religious documentaries on the market, and this film could help fill the void. Instead, the director decided to insult our intelligence with this piece of garbage, which in the end seems to come from their physical therapy for him. It's too bad that his Christian upbringing hurt him, but he has not put his audience coping mechanism.
