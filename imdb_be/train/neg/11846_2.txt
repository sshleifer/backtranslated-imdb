After watching this film, I complained to the local movie about the quality of the audio track, or sound cinema system can be damaged. At least in the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what someone says because of the background music 20s and scratchy sound track. I was ready to blame the cinema equipment, but not so. - it was the director <br /> <br /> I was told that the subject of my complaints is an important part of making the film. Music and sound should be distorted to create a very disturbing effect in the film. These days, directors go to many lengths to make their film unique. Unfortunately, no matter where and how you see that movie sound assessment will be the same. <br /> <br /> So, in addition to historical inaccuracies of the movie (which you can find yourself in a different place) sound track distortion in itself a good reason to give this film a miss. You will only hear the distorted scratchy audio track and, of course, not the cat's meow.
