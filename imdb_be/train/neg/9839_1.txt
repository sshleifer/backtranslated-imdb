At the beginning of the film it was good. He started to get really dumb after he told people that he wanted to kill himself. I think if I had come from a small town, I would have been offended after watching this movie. They have made many of these people look stupid and crazy. How could these people so little to do that they follow him all day. Many times these people told him ways to kill themselves as they tried to persuade him to do so. How many people may have little respect for others? I also think they could do a much better ending for this film. There were some good parts of this movie, too. Some people might, but I would not recommend it to anyone.
