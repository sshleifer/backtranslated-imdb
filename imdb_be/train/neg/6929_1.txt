I read reviews about this film and decided to give it a chance. I'm open like the guy in the end, and I have given good reviews on some pretty bad clicks. As the end credits to this I was looking for meaning and something nice to say. Here it goes: "This film was mercifully short." That's all I have. <br /> <br /> Well, well. Sets and visuals were well done and the music helped lends mood shelter life, but the film was painful to watch and endless dialogue took away from the good bits. I found myself laughing at this movie, but as you laugh at your best friend, who had just embarrassed myself in front of a large crowd. <br /> <br /> By the time the "chicken dance" in the finals, I had just decided to tuck and roll of film and let the body fall where they fall. I do not know what could save this film. Act was not bad, and it looked like it had a budget, but there was simply no way to make it watchable; not even the presence of beautiful naked breasts. Maybe I lit Doobie or drank a lot of beer to get the full experience of the film. In any case, I do not watch this movie again, when I'm not really depressed. Then I can say to myself, "At least, I was not in theÂ« Dr. Tarr Torture Dungeon. "I'm better than those guys."
