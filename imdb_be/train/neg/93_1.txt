A woman asks advice on the road to reach the mysterious city, and hears two hideous stories of local oddities, like a zombie related. But perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her, too ... <br /> <br /> Zombie Chronicles absolutely one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact, I must admit, it was so bad that I quickly cross the most of the debris. And there was plenty of that, believe me. It runs for only 69 minutes, and there's still a ton of filler. You get a skinhead do a lot of push-ups, a lot of stupid Kissy-Kissy meaningless scenes between teenagers (that rhymed, tee's) and some excellent examples of why some people should never be an actor. <br /> <br /> As for the titular characters, they hardly even a footnote in the film. Why, you get more undead action intro, than you pre-function! Although given as eye helpless escaping from the nests and eating brains sequences (among other "Invention") can be a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> And to top it all, it looks likes it was filmed on someone's cell phone to broadcast on Youtube. Jerky camera works, scratches on the print, the flickering light ... I had to rub my eyes when I realized that it was made in 2001, not 1971 even clothes and formed a kind of about three years from the date! <, Br /> <br /> If you think that I am not qualified to review the chronicle, not having seen the entire movie, and then move forward. You try sitting through it, I have not even make his first appearance of the blue Smartie-colored monsters before you make your excuses and leave. It's really funny that someone has decided to release him, and frankly, you'll get much more pleasure rest your drink on the drive than is actually torturing your a DVD-player with this gigglesome cause for terror. In fact, not to be surprised if he packs a bag and leave in the morning, with the result that you are doomed to watch video tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned ... 0/10 <br /> <br /> P.S What kind of 18-rated horror women hold mass sports bra during obligatory sex scene? See a movie can not even get that part right ...
