I read somewhere where the film was going to be a remake of one thousand nine hundred forty-nine film noir, «Criss Cross». I found the latter to be a disappointment, but it was even better than the film. <br /> <br /> This film is a "neo-noir", as it is modern and it is in color, the two things that make it the purists would be disqualified for membership noir. <br /> <br /> The biggest disadvantage to him, however, was not cinema (it was good), but the intricate plot. Hey, some of the '40s Dashiell Hammett stories were similar, but I do not care about some of them, too. The filmmakers will not help the situation, placing the story in retrospect, it seemed, every three minutes. Not surprisingly, it was to keep up with this story. It was funny! What happens is that in the 45th minute, not so much confusion, no one else cares. I know that I did not.
