Gene Hackman gets himself flew out of jail unnamed government agency, who want him for murder. It is a given, of course, Hackman has proficient skills to work. <br /> <br /> No one tells him anything, though, he gave as the audience gave bits and pieces of information. This was supposed to be suspenseful, but it is annoying and sad. <br /> <br /> Hackman goes on a mission, but escape is confused and the guy at the top of these mysterious essence of all orders of the dead, to hide it. So all in plaster dies, and in the end you really do not care. <br /> <br /> One of the other reviewers noted that the film was originally twice as long, nearly three hours and were cut down quite a bit. Maybe something really was lost in translation, but I'm inclined to think that it was a mercy effect on the audience. <br /> <br /> A very talented actors who were people like Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach, Edward and Albert so thoroughly wasted here is a crime. <br /> <br /> And we'll never find out what makes all this federal agency, the FBI, the CIA, the DEA, or even the IRS.
