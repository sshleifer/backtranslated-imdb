Absolutely the most boring film I've ever spent my money on.This was the wrong choice for all these big stars to spend their reputation. Sad! sad! sad! Each character has been portrayed in a less than inspiring way. A lot of acting talent Unknown -Just reading part. Alec can play realistic characters, as a rule, Gwynyth made herself look ugly for the ungrateful part, Annette should be advised on how to choose the movies, she wants to play, how to do all of these big stars that left me disappointed as they allowed their talent smothered in function, which leaves much to be desired in the entertainment industry. "Running with Scissors" lead the public to anticipate a lot of action in the film, which provides, subject to stress and deep emotions. There is not one moment when the cast was able to repel any interpretation of the screen. Maybe it was a mistake Director ---- independently.
