Somewhat uncomfortable spy mystery with a predictable story of World War II in danger. The mystery of whether Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) amnesia. Best actor Raymond Massey is Dr. Ingersoll, a good doctor turned evil. He is the head of Spyware tries to get information from amnesia Jane encoded information related to the activities of the Union. Will it say? Could she remember? Maroni Olson (Mr Goodwin) convincing as an accomplice in Weights. The role played by John Garfield (as Dr. Lewis) is not that other, as catastrophic. He seems to be so much that miscast casting must be ranked as one of the worst in the history of cinema. It is a pity that such a talented actor dressed in a role that is not properly his talents. The film is worth a look, even though half the spy and half gangster film, and despite having a parade of stereotypical characters. It is easy to forget this, amnesia is not necessary.
