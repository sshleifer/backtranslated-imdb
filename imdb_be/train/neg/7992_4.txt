I remember this film for a long time on television. I remember the room being a movie about a bunch of hotel occupants attacked by man-eating ants. What I do not remember how it was awful !!! <br /> <br /> I recently caught this movie on TV late at night. I'm sure it must have been a mistake, because movies like this tend to disappear from existence and will never be found again! Suzanne Somers (at the peak of his career, playing Chris on "Three in the company") plays a vacationer in Lakewood Manor. Constructions workers installing the pool outside and accidentally disturbed anthill. Or should I say, putting * cannibal ants "* !! One of the workers actually gets attacked by ants. One minute he was picking them their clothes one by one, the next minute he was all there. The next scene shows a skeleton in the mud. <br /> <br /> If you thought it was pretty far-fetched, you should see Myrna Loy play wheel chair bound resident who receives the delivery of air transportation from the estate by helicopter! I could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting transported by air from the film! <br /> <br /> The final scene depicts Susanna Foxworthy and the third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room, his back to each other, blowing through a straw and covered with ants. <br /> <br /> It is basically a movie. There really is no "crash" treatment or "big stars" bring to the film. He was supposed to be a "Grand" TV events at the time. Now, it's lucky, he gets thrown into the 4:00 am slot on your local TV station. <br /> <br /> If you want to catch Suzanne Somers in her best, and then watch an episode of Three company. If you want to see Myrna Loy to do anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills, and then watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10
