Loulou (Louise Brooks) works as a typist and lacking something in their lives. It is part of the Miss France against the wishes of his friend Andre (Georges Charlia), and she will win. She goes for the title of Miss Europe, leaving behind her boyfriend. She wins again, but returned home to Andre, because he asked her. Once together, her life becomes ordinary again so one night she wrote him a note and leave to experience the glory that awaits her as a Miss Europe. Andre worth it ..... <br /> <br /> This film is a silent film with piano music tracks all the way to the end. It also accelerated the upside, so everything seems to be fast. Limited dialogue was added later, and it is very false. Throw in a manner bearing in mind that this is a silent film. Much of the film takes place at the end, but the story goes on for too long. After watching this, I'm not quite sure what the big deal was for the appearance of Louise Brooks - it terrible haircut that makes her face look fat. I do not need to watch it again.
