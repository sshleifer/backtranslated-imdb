See the original with the same name since 1944! It is made for TV movie, just a god-awful! Although it uses (as far as I can tell) is almost the same dialog box, it just does not work! Whether it's action, poor direction? OK, so it's made for television, but why watch a bad copy, if you can get your hands on the magnificent original? Especially because you will be spoiled to the plot and do not use the original as much as if you were watching it first! <br /> <br /> There are a few things that are different from the original (it is shorter this time), but they are worse! Actors playing parts here simply does not fit the bill! You just do not believe them, and who can exceed the performance of Edward G. Robinson from the original? If you want to just watch it after you've seen the original, and even then you will be very brave when you look through! It is almost a sacrilege!
