Rookie suffered so much. There are occasional musical songs interspersed through the movie long enough nonsensical script and lattice farce to Jerry Lewis blush. Nun and Leavitt just do not know when to quit. It takes a full hour before the story finally get into the main plot and characters shipwrecked. Then the guys start to play the Japanese brands with standard racist caricatures of the day. It's a shame the funniest part of the film occurs when Noonan and Leavitt play stupid, stereotyped, Japanese guy. But, it gets pretty tiresome after switching back and forth between the two character sets. Then he just dropped. Even naked Julie Newmar in a towel can not save it. <br /> <br /> There is very little glamor in the movie, and it's half an hour too long. History just hanging together trying to create funny situations and fails. Stick Martin & Lewis. At least Dean had charm and Jerry, which animated face.
