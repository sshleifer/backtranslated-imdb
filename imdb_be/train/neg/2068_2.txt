The Gospel of Lou was the biggest disappointment for me. I received an email from the theater, showing him that it was a great and inspiring film. It was neither large nor inspirational. The cinema was quite dubious of the whole film. Many scenes are flash backs that have been made in such a way that it can not tell sometimes what they were. Voices are often distorted for no reason. In addition, many of the people in the film were far-fetched. He relationship with her ex-son never clear. In addition, the entire film has the most to him one way, and then suddenly the BAM, it is cured and inspire people. The entire film seems to show that boxing is one of the things that are bad in his life that makes him live his life the way he lives, but if it changes, it does not leave boxing, he teaches others how to box . Thumbs down.
