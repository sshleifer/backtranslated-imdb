Well, artyfartyrati Kahn may have liked this movie, but I'm afraid. If you like the type of film where the shots linger so long that you wonder whether the actor had fallen asleep or cameraman went to lunch, then this could be for you. Most of it, as it is with a short stay in the realm of trouble. I found it shocking, and is not a concern, as some other reviewers - just a little frustrating and pointless. The only reason I did not give it one star is that the current flattering ans movie pretty good shot. The plot, however, has little to recommend it. Much of the film simply shows a grumpy woman training or listen to the piano, which might appeal to some people. But lest you think this is harmless enough to be ready for some scraps of pornography and sexual violence, only to wake you with a bad taste in the mouth. Not recommended.
