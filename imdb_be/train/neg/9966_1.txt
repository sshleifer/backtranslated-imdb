While I would never want to be the kind of person who nullifies stranger of personal taste; if you want something that is good. But, this movie was terrible, and there's no way around it. I do not like Ani Difranco too much, but it's a great guitar player and songwriter that I can recognize. But I can not let there be any to buy quality in this film. Many people in a way that an accurate portrayal of the problems faced by seniors. Maybe, but it is drawn too far-fetched. There appears to be an attempt to "The Naked Gun" - esque kind of comedy, but time is excluded; there is too much space between each line of the actors as if they are holding for laughter (there was not). Whoever wrote the script was everywhere. They tried to cram as many controversial issues together in one film, almost never fully developed, none of them (especially the girl getting impregnated teacher). I did not laugh once during this film. I was very offended by the attempt of humor and satire, to do anything but roll my eyes on the screen.
