Story by Nikolai Gogol "Wii", which was filmed again and released on home video in the US through Faith Films. <br /> <br /> In the original story belongs to the priest, who must follow the witch's body only by his faith to protect him. Greatly expanded and installed in the United States, although it is obvious, filmed in Russia (the home, clothing and furniture are all wrong, in spite of the English signs), the odd film, which is not really work.Part this is an amazing option that It is trying very hard to be the backyard of America, but obviously isn't.There some strange, deliberately oblique moments as the protagonist being a reporter in the early priests in a short time. I do not know why they did it, even after manufacturing parts viewing on DVD) Another problem is the dubbing, which is beyond awful. He was made in the same, that all is said when their lips on Camera- or if they do not match the voices even remotely flaps his lips. I do not know if his fault Faith Films and the producers who made the film with the hope to shift to the West (as expressed in the manufacture of single). <br /> <br /> The film is not very good. As I said, it has all kinds of technical issues that are just doing this amazing balloon curiosity. Despite some really nice looking images of horror movie never works as a horror film. As the film to engender faith it is too tangled in this retelling of the composition to someone anyone to feel closer to God. <br /> <br /> Given the choice I would give him a pass, even at a bargain price bin. My advice would be to find a version of the 1960s tale called Wii, which will bring some chills and some understanding of faith in God.
