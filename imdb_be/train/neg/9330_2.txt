I saw this movie recently and had higher expectations. Not so much based on the director who has not made a cinematic release earlier, but more on the basis of his cast. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (leading role in the backup, Brian De Palma's masterpiece) all starred in a big movie. Nya together, though, and this has not changed at all because of this one. <br /> <br /> The film is incredible, very predictable and clich√©. The only thing that can make it a little attractive is the choice of the place where he was shot. In my humble opinion: do not waste your time on this.
