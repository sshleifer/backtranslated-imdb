Only a few of the segments involved here. The segment with the garage attendant from Nigeria heartbreaking. One Ardant and Bob Hoskins makes it a point, turn to turn, until the last shot entirely hamming things. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is the fact that only a few of the clips urge Paris. The rest of the so scatter-shot in theme, tone, and freedom production, you can also watch the "The Best Years of commercials, 2006." It really is everywhere. He does not develop over time it runs, and nothing reigns of Directors. Many design successfully combines Sun part ... boredom sets. I am for one hour and twenty minutes, points and Elijah Wood in some dull, over -commercial, overweight vampire shtick. It has about as much to do with Paris, as the old woman knitting in Antarctica. Fantasy shows up, I think that the first segment of the Coen brothers (Uh, thanks to J & E for ruining another film), and then makes too many matches. The point is to be in Paris, it is that you do not need a pretense shit to make your day extraordinary. Why divide the surrounding area if the Quartier-de-la-Madeleine are equal to vampires for some director loser? Was there ever a genre more represented in more than a vampire movie. Every three years, we get the same lame vampire clich√©s. <br /> <br /> Making things worse is the fact that the transition from segment to segment is quite simple. Transitions lost. It feels deliberate, it feels sloppy.
