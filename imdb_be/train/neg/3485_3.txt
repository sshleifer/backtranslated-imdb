This film was quite absurd. It was somewhat amusing details. It goes straight to the garbage can of films in my mind, where I think, "Hmm ..... the film had some funny parts, but on the whole, quite a funny story (or lack thereof).Â» <br /> <br / > I thought it seemed Ben tries a little too hard to be funny guy bun. And I do not understand how he himself made billionaire and still an idiot. In any case, I like Ben Affleck. He does some shit, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I love Jersey Girl, I do not think that Gigli's all his fault, that I like him as a whole. I think he's kind of like a child, you feel sorry for because he may just seem to get it right. <br /> <br /> My advice would be to avoid this flick. It does not really develop until workable plot and Catherine O'Hara and Jimmy D. is not used as they could be. They deserve better. Overall, this film is not the only one at home, this is NOT a Christmas story, it's not Christmas holidays or any of the other classics. Forever forgotten.
