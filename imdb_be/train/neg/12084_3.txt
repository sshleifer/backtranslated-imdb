Take: <br /> <br /> 1. known game <br /> <br /> 2. director of the now with his own ideas, who uses <br /> <br /> 3. a copy of the set design of the popular theatrical performance n ' play, referred to in 1. <br /> <br /> 4. actor for the lead role - who has no feeling for the role he plays, and you get: "Hamlet, Prinz von Dänemark» <br /> <br / > I was listening to the radio "Hamlet" play with Maximilian Schell as Hamlet, and I was so disappointed. I was hoping that the shot version will be better, that Schell, at least, have body language to emphasize that he does not say - nothing. Then the set ... minimalistic design is not the taste of each, but usually I like it when there is just enough to the stage to make it clear that the installation and nothing else. Unfortunately, this is the stage in the theater. It will not work in the movie based on a game that actually has a credible adjustment. It's an idea for the set has been copied in a theatrical production in which Schell played Hamlet already ... let's say, if it was the only thing to complain about ... I ask myself how Schell could get a piece of Hamlet somewhere in the first place and how someone could let him play Hamlet for the second time. If you have the choice to view any of sixty films based on "Hamlet", not watch this if you're not a masochist, really hardcore like to poke fun at untalented actors.
