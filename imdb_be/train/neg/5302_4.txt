Dewaana the film extends through conventional pad. A man and a woman fall in love and get married, her husband allegedly killed by a family friend who wants their family happiness, a woman remarries and surprise surprise husband no.1 reappears. The film reminds Chandni Yash Chopra and countless others. Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan gives good performances. Amrish Puri as the villain goes through the motions, and nothing more than the standard Bollywood villain Nadeem Shravan music is superb, all the songs were brilliant. My favorites Sochenge tumhe Pyar or Koyi on koyi chahiyye. Dewanna ordinary film that goes through the motions.
