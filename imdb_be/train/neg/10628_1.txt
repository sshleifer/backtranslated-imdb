This so-called "documentary" is trying to say that the US faked the moon landing. . Year right <br /> <br /> All those who actually studied business knows the different <br /> <br /> First of all:., Of course, is the proof. When the astronauts were on the Moon, they brought back a lot of pounds of rock from the moon - for geological studies. This is where spread around the world hundreds of laboratories that tested them. And they all came to the conclusion that they came from the same planet, not the earth, because the internal elements of the main isotopes different from those on Earth, but similar calculations on the moon. IE Conspiracy theorists have never studied anything they. just take the thing that fits into their theory and ignores the rest <br /> <br /> Another illegal demand of them is that they were the wind in the hangar, where they filmed the moon landing, the IE flag is moving. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it with his hand, so he moved. And it proves that good if the conspiracy theorists have even studied the footage, they will see that the flag never moves after astronaut has let it be, IE conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, they can not learn the subject well, or just looking at it, as long as they do not have what they have come so that they can make a lie of it, and make a profit (IE is the so-called "documentary"). <br /> <br /> A complaint says that this school could be photographed on the moon, because all the shadows from different places, as there are various light sources, artificial lighting of the studio. Once again, the conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same thing will happen in the Earth's desert at night without any lights. But I doubt that any conspiracy theories ever outside their grandmother's basement more than a few days-Star Treck Convention held within. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theorists are in denial, BIG TIME. They only see what they want to see. Thus, they make all the lies seem important - it's a fact.
