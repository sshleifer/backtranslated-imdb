This film is an excellent example of the book obtaining excellent film destroyed. Jacob have I loved, is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. There's no storyline, areas disappear, and editing badly. To top it all, the music directly from the synthesizer sounds incredibly scary. Bridget Fonda acting is decent, but the actions of all the others is quite amateur. I would suggest this movie to someone who is learning to be a producer, as a study of how not to make a movie like this crowded bad cut scenes, bad transitions and actions that had to be re-shot! Read a book and do not waste your time with this film.
