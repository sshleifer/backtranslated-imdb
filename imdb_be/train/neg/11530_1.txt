Over the past 10 years I have worked in 3 different indie wrestling organizations, managed many professional wrestlers (including 2 Backyard Wrestling stars), worked on 2 different TV programs to combat and did voice-over and commentary for many DVD fight . I've never seen the level of bits amateur nonsense, lack of talent and skill, and poor quality products found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. In order to even list it as a video struggle of any kind is a direct abuse of the term. Shot with camcorders low-dollar, it is mostly home video the kids play in the backyard fire. The sound quality is poor video quality is poor, and the effect is terrible. The "champion" to wear homemade costumes with hand-drawn T-shirts and ski masks and beat each other with various objects, and halfway imitate wrestling move. Sometimes the "match" are on the grass. Sometimes in the backyard trampoline. All the bad acting and provided with a shameless lack of any wrestling skill. In short, do not bother with this bitch. Is your interest in this DVD entertainment or academic (as in my case), you will be very disappointed.
