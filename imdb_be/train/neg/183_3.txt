This action western. James Steart leads an all-star cast in the picturesque north-west, which was filmed in great pomp. The sets and costumes are gorgeous. There is action and adventure. Stewart plays a rich cattleman who goes against the government curve in the old Nothwest. <br /> <br /> The main drawback is the stereotypical cynical that Hollywood is always in character. Even when this film was made was a cynic stereotypical hero, and one really reflects Stewart has several economies favors. He is good to his two partners, and it really gives it an extra dimension of trust and likability. <br /> <br /> However, he was so beastly to everyone else, it's really hard to take care of it, or accept it. It is very similar to the spaghetti western-dimensional characters (cut not too bad). <br /> <br /> However, the secondary characters are quite pleasant. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and others make it worth a look.
