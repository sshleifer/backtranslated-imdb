Every so often a movie comes along that knocks me kicking it up a notch and reminds me that my taste in movies I seek not always look perfect. I usually like to stay away from things like this, but I was deceived by some glowing reviews and pedigree Rohmer. <br /> <br /> There's a primary and intriguing novelty production, which significantly overlaps Romer actor in a colored (digital) revolution, the era of back-drops France. It decreases rapidly and is becoming as interesting as watching paint dry on the paint by numbers scene. What we are left with is a sad and oppressive film about the aristocracy in the 18th century in France. None of the characters are not attractive or cute. The pace is so sluggish, the dialogue is so hard, and the uncertainty is clearly foreign to the concept of Romer that I end up not caring whose head rolled hiding who or what a revolution the devil was supposed to be about. The film will be a great benefit some semblance of emotional capacity and scores (there are some great classical music used in the end). Despite the fact that this «Talky», the film plays as well as a silent film, and the worst kind of film that, dull and uninteresting movie about endlessly interesting subjects. Only the most astute French historians will find something to take from this film, as the dose seems to paint a well-known events from a new angle (Lady is English and the Cavaliers). Otherwise, avoid this hole any price, if you do not suffer from insomnia (I dozed off twice).
