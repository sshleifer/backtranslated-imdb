I can not believe that the Indian film industry still produces such waste is the third year, as the train station. First, the story is completely implausible ?? spoiled son gets thrown out of the family home so as to teach him some self-sufficiency. So what does he do? He quickly goes to win some national talent contest, making some star jumps in front of the jury (I honestly do not joke here). At the same time, his father died of lung cancer, but keeps it a secret from his son, but he survives long enough to see his son become famous, to see his new grandson, as well as making new toy giraffe with his hands. <br /> <br /> Effective distorts dignity in hamminess ?? no effort was made to try to act in any convincing manner any of the major players in this film. As usual for Indian films, the family lived in a huge mansion, and seemed relatively untouched problems of the real world. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the biggest loser, when there are such scary movies smart viewers who made the mistake of seeing this movie. Actors such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar will still revered as the gods of the people who have nothing but blind faith in Bollywood.
