Not as bad as some make it out to be, though obviously pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion Amitabh was as big as a villain Babban Singh - try not to compare with Gabbar in the original, because they are obviously not going to the same effect. Apart from some mediocre scenes, however, the rest of the movie is incorrect. Character development was poor and the development of the plot was hopeless, with many gaps, and not enough pieces of information that I would not have known if I had not read the back of the DVD casing. The worst part of the film was to support the role of Nisha Kothari and especially this new man called Prashant Raj. Niche is just annoying since it was the first to open his lips. As for Prashant Raj - seriously, who is this guy? where he is and why on earth he was present in the studio for anything other than serve drinks?. His acting ability is equal to zero, and it has the same tone, dialogue delivery and sustained expression in every scene, whether it's action, comedy, or even a scene where someone has just died. Ajay Devgan was average, at least, his expression changed, it's more than I can say for his mistake companion. in general, Aag RGV is worth taking a look at the solid performance of Amitabh and very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance.
