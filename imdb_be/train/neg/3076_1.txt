This film should not be seen if you are trying to kill himself. I think that this film can really cause serious damage to the brain. The main characters are whiny, sun hero Kevin Hey, his self-willed, godless conservative friend, Kyle, dork in red shorts who loves phone sex, Daphne, thin, horny girl who must not be "cool" and does not feeling, how to dress, and her friend Nick hypersexuality, an army recruit who can make insinuations about nothing. No, I'm not a pervert, it really is, as the film goes on. The film itself is overly sexual plagiarism 1986 Gremlins, but you never find traces of Gizmo anywhere. No, these Hobgoblins isolated Wimpy Man (I'm sorry, Kevin), make someone's wildest dreams come true, and then kill the victim. So, you guessed it, in the end, they wind up in a strip club, where the biggest dream in NERDY Amy revealed she wants to be a stripper! Look, I've seen this movie by MST3K, and even Mike Nelson, Tom Servo, and the blood of T. Robot makes a mockery of this cinematic Trainwreck and he's still my blood from both eyes. Not really, but I'd like to. I do not give you more land, because experiencing it gives me this great desire to drive a fork through my brain. In addition, it is not, as is the story worth mentioning. They should put a warning on the General Surgery this film.
