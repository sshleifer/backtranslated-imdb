First of all, sorry for the fact that even a rating from 1 to the film (no less than it is available). The film fails in every department, whether it's the script, the direction, the characteristic or action. <br /> <br /> 1) To begin with, the title of the film is really a class C (although the film coincide with the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan is doing his best to live up to the character, but a weak script in combination with the pathetic direction ends making it a humorous character. 3) In Sholay Gabbar Singh has 50,000 reward on him (which was convincing). Here in Aag, the figure was Rs 100 crore for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan, but have not been beaten by our so-called hero and had only a few men cycling switched (all machines). Creating Sholay as the film to set the type of Mumbai in modern times does not look convincing . 4) Nisha Kothari regard, someone should tell her that she does not know the effect. Why Ram Gopal Verma again and again throwing it? 5) Mohanlal was good, but it is unlikely to do anything for him. 6) Sushant Singh Yadav and Razhpal who are great actors spent in the film. 7) Legendry role Lila Mishra (Mausi with Basanti) in Sholay replaced cheaply in this film by some Gangu mummy. Rama please grow up and realize that there must be some intelligence in the film. Stupid enough characters in the film, like Shiva and Aag. 8) statement today Jai and Veeru..pathetic the most should not say. <br /> <br /> In summary, I was shocked when I saw this film, because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of the original classic. Please do not waste time and money on this film. I think watching AARP Ka Surror (which I thought that it was possible the worst film) would be a better idea than to see this terrible pack of silly characters, bad songs and pathetic direction. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Saurab
