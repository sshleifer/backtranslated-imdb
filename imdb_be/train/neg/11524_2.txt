Pretty incoherent film about a man who belonged to the left, and 1960 looks hippy religious cult who fights their sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other sects, who, during the police raid hidden and taken another man named Hawk, who lives in a small hut on the river bank. The cult of killing some of his followers and some of the people in the city. It's hard to keep track of who the characters or what period of time the scene should take place. The leader gets pardoned sixteen years later (I got that out of the box - I missed a lot of time in the film). No one made to look older, not noticeable, anyway. <br /> <br /> One murder made a large round billet saw, others are made with a knife or crossbow. I never heard the name of the main character is mentioned in the film, but he's the one who overacts most, screaming and shouting. <br /> <br /> The film is glued together rather badly, with voice-over, helping (not much) to explain what is happening. Some sound effects were pretty bad. A person becomes a fist, and we hear the sound of a whip cracking. Woman shooting a gun, and we did not hear the fire, but to hear the rebound instead! It seems it was not done for comic effect.
