The Nutcracker has always been somewhat problematic ballet. It bears little resemblance to the original ETA Hoffmann story on which it is based. <br /> <br /> In the ballet, the story, in fact, over the second half, when Clara (or Marie in this version) is sent to the Kingdom of Sweets to see a series of typical dances. <br /> <br /> There is an endless variety of scene that to rethink history in myriad ways (not always successfully) to compensate for the weak libretto ballet. <, Br /> <br /> Balanchine version does not really make any sense of drama or history in general (despite the fact that there is a lot of drama and mystery in an excellent first act to music by Tchaikovsky). The result is a completely forgettable first half of the Christmas party, where almost nothing happens, and where even dancing (what little there is in it) is not particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> pantomime over-action, in particular with Drosselmeyer, who may look passable on stage just looks ridiculous filmed for the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, things are not much better when we get to the Kingdom of Sweets (Act II stage version). Although there are several choreographic moments, most of the choreography fresh and boring. This, of course, not vintage Balanchine. <br /> <br /> Balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance, but I always felt that he was less successful, as the creator of narrative ballets. Watching this film version of his stage production of The Nutcracker only reaffirmed this view.
