There is a word for this kind of film, and the word "nonsense". This is nonsense, when he was a VHS rental, and now this nonsense on satellite reprint. <br /> <br /> He can deceive you, because it has 2 moderately well-known names in Kistofferson and Henrichs, a clever soundtrack music and good Monument Valley scenery. <br /> <br /> He also has some curly haired woman who fights a lot. <br /> <br /> If that's all you want from a movie, then maybe this will keep you happy. <br /> <br /> This is nonsense, though.
