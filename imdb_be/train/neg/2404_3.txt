Man, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1) Adam Arkin is more tearful than Ross Geller of <br /> <br "Druzey /> 2) Large unused gypsum (Mars Kenneth, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this amateurish script. <br /> <br /> 3) the film suffers from a terrible challenge. He jumps over to the mixed, confusing way. <br /> <br /> 4) The story does not even make sense. Why he wants to break a football strip? How about stupid violin music? not one of them is not explained. <br /> <br /> 5) it's not even funny. it's like a bunch of accountants, who are trying to do improvisation, saying Â«Lookit me! Lookit me I'm funny! "It was a bad attempt to make another" Love at first bite. " <br /> <br /> I wanted Larry Cohen movies, but the person he's not here. I could not wait for the credits roll. Horribly disappointed.
