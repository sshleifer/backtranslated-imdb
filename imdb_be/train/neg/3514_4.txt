Philippe. K. Dickian film. And a decent one on this issue. Better than a Paycheck (Woo), and the abomination called Minority Report (Spielberg). But let's face it, twisting and cheesing ending was too much for me. Halfway through the movie I began to be afraid of this kind of end, and I, unfortunately, right. But this does not mean that the film is not worth his time. No, not really. The first half (as many have commented here) is awesome. There are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director is going to convey the message that the show is extremely important in the future (we will do this kind of SF on banal things, because we CAN) or simply through association. But there is also a sense of paranoia "of the joint", too. Good one.
