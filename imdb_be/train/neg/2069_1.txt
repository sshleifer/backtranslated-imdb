I went to go see it in Esquire Theater in Cincy, Ohio, and - I hate my life now <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve would have been more believable fighter <br /> <br /> As a movie it .. it hurt, but seeing Bret Carr personally could see the despair on top of it. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the film saw BC slapped in the face, it seems, «C» the battery. The jury is still on it. It is with a dildo, and it was in slow-mo. Yes. <br /> <br /> «shoot the left side of the face only ... famous people demanding things!" - Bret Carr B. Carr wore a chicken suit for a bit of reverse psychology, wandering the streets of Clifton beat his own movie. He should. It is correct to beat film. <br /> <br /> My soul felt worn out after this film. <br /> <br /> not Brett Carr charismatic enough to be a cult leader, whether that matter for clever enough. This is the feeling you get from the fact that Bleepesque trickle brainwashed impressive neo-yuppies, who came to see the work Rayut Carr. <br /> <br /> it is emotionally draining experience just thinking about writing about this film, so goodbye. <br /> <br /> -Anonymous
