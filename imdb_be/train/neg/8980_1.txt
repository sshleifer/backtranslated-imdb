I will never forget that night I saw the movie. We were on a submarine on patrol in the North Atlantic, and it was scheduled to film in the evening. We were all given after the second coil. They did not even try to show this in the middle of the night show. Opting for relaying instead ...... That's all I really have to say, but they have this stupid rule that my comment should contain ten lines. I do not have to inflate a comment with random words, so I'll just continue to wander until I get ten lines BSO. I could not find George Goble listed in the credits, but I remember him in the movie. Xining was awful, and the song is even worse.
