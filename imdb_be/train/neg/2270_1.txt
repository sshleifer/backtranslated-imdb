The only thing that kept me from vomiting after watching this film was the fact that it's just the actors and not the freak show that usually appears on the TV show. It is also the main reason that the proponents of the TV show is not like the movie, but not the only reason. This film has the same value of entertainment, how to get a root canal. He approaches the depth abyssmal bad film, and then it gets worse. I will not waste my time, which describes the film in more detail; Suffice it to say that I feel sorry for the poor camera, which had to suffer watching this c ** p for the first time.
