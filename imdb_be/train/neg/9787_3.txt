... but the problem of this production is that it is very far from good musical <br /> <br /> Of course, you can not always expect a witty masters as Sondheim and Bernstein and Porter. while the music of this piece makes it look even Andrew Lloyd Webber witty. It is deadly dull and uninventive (with one or two exceptions), and only after I watched it, I could not think of any significant music -. What pretty tragedy comes from someone who has learned a whole are still hundreds of people in three plays <br /> <br /> Also, oddly enough, is not theatrical. This occurs at an incredibly big stage (one should really feel sorry for the people in the front rows, who broke their necks to see something happening in the 50 meters to the right and 100 meters on the left) and does absolutely nothing with it. If there is to be one man singing on a stage, it's exactly what you get - and the rest of the stage is empty enormeous. For me, as an aspiring theater director it was almost painful to watch. <br /> <br /> The fact remains that, Cole Porter seems to have captured the French culture in his works better than these nya-talents can ever come close to. And I'm puzzled by the popularity of the future of the legendary musical.
