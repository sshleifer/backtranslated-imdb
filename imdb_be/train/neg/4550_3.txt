My dear Lord, that movie! Let's talk about "special effects" in the first place. Do not get me wrong, I'm not one of these effects are fanatics, but I really thought that the composition was the practice of long gone past, mostly 60s. So for some time I thought that they may have recorded this movie a long time ago, and it took them forever to cut and release him. But as far as I know, they do not have cell phones in the '60s ... <br /> <br /> What I look for in a movie is mainly a good story with a very good message. Duties of the secondary, the effects are secondary, I do not mind a few small discrepancies. However, in such films as this bad actor, improbability, etc. add up to make a bad movie is even worse - this is what happened to me with Celestine Prophecy <br /> <br /> My wife says that the book was actually really. well, and even if I'm not all that spiritual stuff, I can somehow see that it can be transported through in a plausible way - the film failed to do so, <br /> <br /> There may be another reason to watch. This one, though. If you really love cheesy movies, it will be right for you. If the stars were to IMDb cheesiness instead of quality I have rated this movie ten stars. <br /> <br /> By the way, three stars, because there are worse movies out there as a "critical mass" (see the comments on this one - fun). Celestine Prophecy, at least entertaining to a certain extent.
