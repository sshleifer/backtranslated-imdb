Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is Satan pupil / serial killer who has «First Power»: even after being captured detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and formed in a gas chamber, it is able to move its body to the spirit of body and continues to kill at will. With attractive psychic Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, half sister Melanie Mr.), he tries to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> This concept probably had some opportunities, I think, but ultimately "First Power» suffers from routine scripts and filmmaking. It's nothing we have not seen before, sometimes getting better. There's nothing about this film, to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers. More specifically, it is not very exciting, and it certainly is not terrible. Phillips difficult to sell as a tough-as-nails, cynical cop stereotype, and does not look like Griffith tries very hard; best cast, probably, clearly showed Kober, doing everything possible to be extremely horrible. <br /> <br /> The culmination of a rather silly to very weak. <br /> <br /> Not a very quite acceptable to estimate the average film of its kind, so: <br /> <br /> 4/10
