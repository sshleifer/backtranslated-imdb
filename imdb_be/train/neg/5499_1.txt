I saw the bomb when it hit theaters. I laughed all the time. Why? Because his stupidity seemed to make me go crazy. I look back on it and realize there was not a single funny thing in the whole film. In Leat nothing intentional. It is very funny that Lizzie r chew a piece Nurplex and become a giant, carnivorous demon ... but her little dress completely intact, despite the fact that she is now a hundred times more than it was when she first put it on . Or a film in which a person may be shocked to defibulator and only falls unconscious, and return to consciousness without any medical assistance. And do not let me get started on the ridiculous fate of the "villain", they decided that it was necessary to create a "conflict". Uh-huh. <br /> <br /> To the person complaining about Disney only targeting child-The offensiveness of this film it seems to refute this assertion. Do we really need to Daryl Hannah accuses Jeff Bridges have curly videotapes? You do if you're Disney, and you're out of ideas for making the film appeal to a higher 8 crowd without writing a more reasonable scenario! I am deeply convinced that Disney pays top tips so that the films can get away with murder and still get a family ratings. <br /> <br /> What a waste of the DVD format.
