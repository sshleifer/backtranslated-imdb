I still shudders at the thought of EVER see this film again. <br /> <br /> I've seen action movies, I even liked quite a few of them, but it is one of the leaders. <br /> <br /> Not only it has the worst male actor ever (Sly Stallone) has played a leading role, but the film's plot so stupid from the beginning (for some reason do not take the money, while the aircraft is on the ground, will be a heck of a lot easier), it requires a person with an IQ of less than its shoenumber believe. <br /> <br /> In addition, the story has no real twists on all three-year-old child can guess what will happen next. It is a set of stencils (the genre of action), with Sly perform even worse than his other films (it was even better than Rambo III, unless to watch this movie as a comedy, not the film). Now there's an actor who can not act A) amazed B) boring C) is nothing but its main faces. <br /> <br /> I would still like to mention that this film has two factors that could make some people like it. Explosion are outstanding, but ... you can see better on the 4th of July. Landscapes without payment, but ... there are documentaries about the Alps and the Himalayas, so you can better see the sights that way, instead of wasting time on this movie. <br /> <br /> Go watch some other film instead, there are hundreds, even thousands of the best fighters.
