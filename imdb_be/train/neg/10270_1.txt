"American Nightmare" officially linked, in my opinion, with "It's Pat!" In the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Seven friends (strangely resembling version of K-Mart cast of "Friends") is going to the cafe to listen to American Nightmare, a pirate radio show. He is a guy with a beard. This is the most interesting aspect of his show. <br /> <br /> Chandler, Monica, Joey, and ... Oh, wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie, and the rest a bad one-liner beating gangs all take turns revealing their biggest fears bearded DJ. Unbeknownst to them, distraught nurse / serial killer listening ... <br /> <br /> Crazy nurse then proceeds to torment Ross and Rachel, and ... wait, sorry again ... making their fears come to life, these concerns include such Stunners as "bait" and the future descended on the old ladies with dentures. <br /> <br /> No. In fact. <br /> <br /> This movie was, in a word, rotten. Kill Streak Crazy Nurses is not enough motivation, there is nothing to make the audience "jump", ending strokes, and - again - the bait <br /> <br /> If you have absolutely nothing to do with your family, rent " American Nightmare Â»with them <br /> <br /> If you care about your loved ones -. even a little bit - go to your local Blockbuster, remove all copies of the" American Nightmare "and hide them in your freezer.
