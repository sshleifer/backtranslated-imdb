It reviewers liked this movie surprised me. The plot confusion. wooden characters. Michael Bowen spends most of the movie spy on other characters and underestimated all of them. No one has any mitigating or quality point-of-interest. This work was not nervous. This is not figurative. This is not irony. It is not reasonable. There's nothing direct about this tedious work. It skipped a theatrical release is not surprising. The fact that "The Network" is aired it reduces this place. I definitely recommend to refer to the relaying of the garden smart show on PBS, or even good information, if you are faced with this confusion of late night TV. If you are faced with it daytime television, take a long walk. Even if you go to the smog, you'll feel better, not get through the carnage. Life is short. This film for a long time.
