If this series should be an improvement compared with Batman - The Animated Series, for example, I think that it's not scary. Image character lousy ... (Catwoman, for example, looks terrible ...) But what really annoys me is that he did Batman look like some kind of a wimp, who simply can not take care of yourself in a fight, without help two, even three pals. I mean, he was Batman, please! I know, comic books, I know that Nightwing and Batgirl should be allies of Batman, except Robin, but still ... Batman does say he needs help from them ... What, he can not handle a few bumps ? In BTAS, he could face ten opponents without any problems ... It is getting old? Come on ... <br /> <br /> One more thing: I do not think Batman will allow a child like Tim Drake to go into battle, that in the near future, without years of hard training. Firstly, it is irresponsible (and Batman have all but irresponsible), and two, that is not what happened in the comic books, if we want to remain faithful to him <br /> <br /> Batman -. Animated series made history with animation, its history, and its heroes ... It really was a legend of Batman. Series The New Adventures of the legend turned into another movie about Batman.
