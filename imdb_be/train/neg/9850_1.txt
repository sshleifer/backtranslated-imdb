I feel brain dead, I tell you. This is the worst movie I've ever bought. (In my ignorance, I thought that it was Peter Jackson's film of the same name). The performances are so awful they're funny. The special effects are not withstood the test of time and look awful. The script helps a TV movie, look at the middle-distance type of action. The cast look as if they took lessons from Joe Tribbiani, they have one species each, and stick to it. In addition, I have never been embarrassed by the film until I sat down to watch it. This is a dream or not the story is not so terrible, that frustration occurs within a few minutes. Avoid like the plague.
