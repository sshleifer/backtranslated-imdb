Quite a few spoilers here, but I've been a fan since Waking The Dead began, but the last series, of which there were only 3 are still terrible. Stories do not have any similarity with the original idea of ​​the series. I found these in the last 3 series jaw droppingly ludicrous. In the BBC license payer, after the concert I called the BBC complaint to convey my disappointment. I am surprised that caliber actors Trevor Eve and Sue Johnston has no objection to the storylines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, surly they can see that they have lost all direction. It's a good job is the last series or the next series can start with the team, who are investigating the death of Santa Claus! <br /> <br /> Paul the Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
