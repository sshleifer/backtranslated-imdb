Spike Lee has been in decline since its first successes, and this disorder does nothing to help. I looked at the clock, often in the hope that the film will end, or get to the point. first film with Lee all white cast is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> What is the meaning? What the Italians swear and funky like sex, but not with their wives? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I would have a Scorsese film. Incredibly lame Godfather character just adds to the stereotype. <br /> <br /> I admired several Lee movies, especially the "Do the Right Thing." This film is a waste of time.
