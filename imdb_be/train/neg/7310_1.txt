** SPOILERS below !!! ** <br /> <br /> Fever has my nod for the worst film of the year ... I've seen it. This film is just rubbish! There are so many bad movie, you can not help but be amazed at how bad it really is. This film had a lot of potential to be good, but ultimately did not do so. Characters were dumb, as one may be; throughout the film, you just ask yourself, "Why did you do that?" or "What is your point of that?" ... it's illogical and silly characters. We will not get any background in them, so naturally, you do not really give a rat as a $ about his fate ... You might laugh only at their stupidity. <br /> <br /> - In the "slutÂ» (Marcy), for example ... it was that horny that she had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? There was no sense that .... it's almost as if the filmmakers needed an excuse to give it a virus so voila! UGH. <br /> <br /> - Will anyone actually go into the woods, and to drink water from the tap out of the cab, in spite of his first <br /> <br /> - Why not just Bert shoot the patient guy from the very beginning? The film would be in the way .... in addition, they will eventually kill him anyway <br /> <br /> -. Why it took them so long to finally decide to leave the cabin, even if they have to go? "No, I'll just wait for 2 of my friends are not infected (one blink of death), finally we decided to go to get out there <br /> <br /> -. What is the argument for trying to fish from the hermit Paul the body, only to fall in a contaminated tank and infected with a virus? Pure stupidity! <br /> <br /> I swear, common sense was not a friend, but more so in the young love idiots. I do not think has ever been worse, the movie ending. At the beginning of deaf children to ask the store cashier that the rifle was for and he said that "it for a nigger." At the end of the film, 3 young Blacks (dressed in baggy clothes, one of them in the du-rag at least) go to the store .... come to find out that the cashier was cleaning it for them to be used for hunting. Then, he goes on to give them all the pounds and handshakes and joke around with them as if they were his Homeboys. <br /> <br /> Well, what the hell, POINT THAT?!?!?!? How tasteless one could be that the filmmakers had to think to put that in the movie? I like the black man was, of course, hurt the initial comment "nigger." It was tasteless, senseless remarks. My question to the filmmakers: what is the point ending with black children? Was it to make me forget about the original racist remark earlier? To smooth things over with black audiences, making a joke with him? Well, I, for one, has not found that the unsuccessful attempt of humor funny in the least. The entire film was a joke .... pathetic attempt at filmmaking, which should not be given the time of day. Peter Jackson really thought this movie was good? What movie he was watching? <br /> <br /> ZERO * to **** stars .... if I could give it a lower rating, I would. Please comrades IMDb'ers, do not waste 1 1/2 hours of your precious life watching this abomination in the "movie." This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.
