Alfred Hitchcok not my favorite director any means, but imagine what he could do with it! The plot has a great potential for the unknown. John Garfield, as is almost always excellent and Raymond Massa bogey cast against type. Nancy Coleman is not very impressive leading lady, but the supporting cast is large and very capable. <br /> <br /> Yes, he begins to settle early. There are too many coincidences. And important topic trivial by his being transformed into a little more in the end than a love story. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to watch Garfield, Messi and character performers. But this is not very good.
