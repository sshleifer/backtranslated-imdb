I have always said that some pieces of nature simply can not be translated into a film, and this is one prime example. <br /> <br /> The game is very funny farce satyr Catholic Church, with the razor wit and a central character who is so shockingly unreal, we should be rooting for her, even when she begins to kill your believer (one of them made a fatal mistake, admitting that he had not sinned, as his last confession, so she feels she sends him straight to the sky). <br /> <br /> That's just one example of how far beyond the reality of the game is, and in sham world of theater, it works. Nevertheless, this kind of heightened reality rarely works on film, and it certainly is not here. <br /> <br /> Directed by Marshall Brickman put together a great cast who do a great job, but presenting all this nonsense in a realistic fashion comedy becomes a tragedy, and you are left with an empty feeling in the pit of the stomach. <br /> <br /> Look for the production stage the games instead, you will not be disappointed.
