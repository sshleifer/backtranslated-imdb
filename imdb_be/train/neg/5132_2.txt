I heard about this movie, because a Jew Ben Chaplin with Game On was in it. Playing on the British sitcom funny and apparently he left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and star in the film. He did not thank God. <br /> <br /> The film is very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo plays the ugly woman who uses her neighbor Uma Thurman today, Ben Chaplin, because she thinks that Ben Chaplin does not like her because she's ugly. The film is simply bad for many reasons. The plot is incredibly predictable, with obviously serious farce bit mushy bits: ugh just that assembly, where all three of them with pleasure, and then picture a little bit. These two scenes made me shudder! Janine is a nauseating character arrogant (and guessing from her role as a stand-up "comedy" and arch-feminist in real life too). She claims that the film "anti-feminist", when in fact it is simply realistic. Men are more likely than not to the appearance of a person. It is interesting to note the hypocrisy of it, too. She was a feminist and "comedy" for many years before taking this role, and then suddenly decides then that the film is bad. I believe that she hated the idea and the script of the film before it was released, but she did, she saved that quiet, so she could get the money for this parody of the film. I mean come on! She acted in it for God's sake! What this movie really was anti-male if anything. It reflects both the men stupid animals whose brains are in their groin as men do stupid things to attract attention to the character of Noel. <br /> <br /> Uma Thurman There are other bad things about this film is the same as the character of Ben Chaplin British people have every American girl is cute and Jamie Foxx is a token black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx had to try to simulate it accent a few times for good measure. This is the best the writers could come up with? Blimey, they've never done it before, with the exception of every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore movie ever made. There's also a really terrible phone sex scenes that are simply grotesque and argues like a cheap film. Other comments on here say it like Janeane Garofalo is not ugly, but really beautiful. Um, I was watching the same film as they were? She certainly does not look, and the only good thing about this movie was that it rightly cast as terrible. Although saying that I do not see the appeal of Uma Thurman, as well :. She is a tall, thin, looking <br /> <br /> I can guarantee three things about this film, if you've never watched it: <br /> <br /> You will know that the end will be; <br /> <br /> You will find the phone sex scenes uncomfortable and painful, <br /> <br /> You'll be bored after ten minutes <br. /> <br /> hours at your own risk.
