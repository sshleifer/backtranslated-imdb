This is really terrible. <br /> <br /> The single emollient about this film is that the next time, when people ask me what is the worst vampire movie I've ever watched, I would be the appropriate response. <br /> <br /> I think that he shot on 35 mm, so that it is sticky as hell. I would not bother to comment on, but I noticed some fans (probably related to the cinema) argued that it was the best film of the matrix. Allow me to debunk the myths and lies. <br /> <br /> There's nothing good in this movie. Screams tacky. Actress ugly. The fight choreography is the worst I have ever seen. The fight scenes are incredibly amateurish. Imagine a little girl waving hands in a circle helplessly weak and delivering blows that would not interfere with the kitten. It is obvious that the director just pulled a man from the street, to give them a role in the film. <br /> <br /> I know that the director does not have a large budget for the film, but it's better films were made on a small budget before. Unforgivable.
