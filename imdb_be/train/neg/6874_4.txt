Jean-Marc Barr (Being Light, Big Blue, Dogville), directed and interpreted this wonderful film, which is the second party of some kind of trilogy. I could be wrong, but I do not think that part of this film Dogma '95 manifesto, although it really looks like it. I'm not sure what I think about this movie. All the actors are good. They provide a very good performance, especially Ryazanov Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. History as something interesting. But I do not know, there's something about the movie that I do not like. The sex scenes are too long. It comes from the interesting works of art on the erotic piece of shit, I do not know exactly where it stands. Of course, this is not a bad film, but I never suggest that people see it or I'll tell them not to look. Just do as you wish. If you feel interesting, and you open, give it a try, you might like it.
