Titular creatures wreak havoc in a quiet desert town. It's basically the entire plot of the film, and while the scenes dedicated to Munchies several fun (in the form of cattle paths), everything else is just filler, filler and bad at the same time. From the "hero", which is painful Woody Allen imitators, to the ultra-silent city police, it is difficult to choose the most annoying character in the film. There were a few times when they were almost all on the screen together, and I thought, "Well, at least cute girlfriend, but why should we put up with the rest of these morons?". The film is also full of references pop (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which is likely to have done so already dated in the early '90s. (* 1/2)
