With this line begins a stupid, boring British science fiction film. Big Vorelli from the movie "Devil Doll" builds a teleportation machine only to its funding cut Blanchard, bearded man who has a thing for butterflies and men with big eyebrows. If his experiment fails, the good doctor learns that Lembach, the man who controls all grants in the world, will be in London for a few days. He is trying to project itself in the Blanchard house with the help of his good-looking laboratory assistant, Sheila. Needless to say, that something will go wrong, and it winds up looking like a rat. The rest of the film is devoted to a good orange-haired doctor to walk around London's shocking people with his mutated arm and wearing a diaper on his face. There are several murders, some modest working papers, and, finally, the doctor disappears, where ever the rat faced doctors go. Fortunately, no one decided to make a sequel.
