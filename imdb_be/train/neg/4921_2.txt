Nod to executive producer Wes Craven and financiers Weinsteins for this big-budget fiasco: update from "Dracula" of thrash metal, with a condescending verbal kick in Bram Stoker (who probably would not want his name to this thing in any case) and nothing special for all of us, except for chopper-style shocks and gore. Christopher Plummer looks winded as Van Helsing in today - not just a descendant of Van Helsing, but the real thing; he keeps himself going leeches obtained from the corpse of Count Dracula, who dug up from the grave after the theft from the store, Van Helsing and flew to New Orleans. This is exactly what we need in New Orleans in the 21st century! The film is made good, but without a single original idea (in the case of several racial victims, except) is simultaneously pushes and lazy, and after about an hour begins to repeat. * From ****
