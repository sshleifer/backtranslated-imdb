It must be the corniest TV show on the air. This is likely to escape Belushi and all his bad movies. His brother sucked all the talent that he had a younger brother. I hope that this show will be canceled, and never spoke again, except for negative use. Jim should resign or something. Please let them go out of the air. When I was here a joke out of this show I'll throw and and wash your eyes with a toothbrush. Id, and come from the devil himself than to watch a full half-hour, that part of the program. I still do not understand why the show is still in the air and run. We all know deep down that we want to take our television screens, when we see the face of Jim. In conclusion, there is no more please.
