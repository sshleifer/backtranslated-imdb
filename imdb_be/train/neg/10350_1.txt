We all know that some of the greatest films of all time were based on the books. Although not especially accurate devices, these films were, however, a great movie. Some great examples of the series Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings trilogy, and, to a lesser degree, almost every Disney movie ever made. Nevertheless, I regret to inform you that wrinkle in time is not one of those movies. Not only that, he is not able to meet some of the most basic expectations of fans of Madeleine L'Engle, he was able to defy the writers of standards, acting, special effects and, ultimately, respect for the audience. Keep in mind, I'm not trying to be mean; on the contrary, I went into it with an open heart. I realized that I did for T.V. The film will compensate for his absence spree in his scripts. In the end, the spin-off of Star Wars Ewoks was decent, if a bit ridiculous. Think about it, Star Wars original was placed on the "lunch money budget", and see where it took George Lucas! However, from the first scene forward, frustration beginning enveloping me as if I got too close to the Black Thing while tessering. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Greedo shooting first became a symbol of Star Wars Special Edition 1997 (disaster of monumental proportions, associated with a disgruntled director make a few changes disgusting favorite classics), Mrs. Whatsit officially become my personal symbol of confusion and stupidity that time wrinkles. The reason for this is the fact that it had mutated beyond belief. In addition to casting a bit of a controversial decision Alfre Woodard (Star Trek: First Contact and radio) in our favorite star-turned-teacher, the filmmakers decided that it is appropriate to introduce it as a crow. It's true, the raven. In addition, the celestial form centaurion this very favorite character was hacked on what looks like a crazy eight-year-old; a majestic half-man, half horse with wings has become a huge human head with a terrible smile installed uncomfortable legged on the horse's body, which happens to sport a pair of wings in the middle. If I was five, it would have been psychologically scarred me for life. The worst thing is that when he spoke, it was shown, because in order to avoid responsibility lip sync, leading to a scene that was spent looking at the back of the head and seeing a single fixed cheek so way making a piece of special effects less plausible than ET <br /> <br /> Having the most painful part of the way, I have to go on a break to induce one: characters, acting and story. I, personally, have always represented Meg look a bit like a moaning Myrtle from the Harry Potter films: hair, glasses, and the figure most supermodels would find laughable. She was always a little anxious, pessimistic humor math genius who simply could not care less about importing and exporting Nicaragua. In the film, it is unpleasant know-it-all, for which I have no sympathy at all. In fact, it makes me feel sorry for poor Mr. Jenkins, her school, who constantly have to deal with it. Calvin, kind, smart kid who everyone thinks is the athlete became ?? Jock! The irony is that horrible. As for memorable Happy Medium, they have a pleasant old woman who loved to look at the happy things, and replace it with a creature that is "above floor" and likes to look at the "funny" things such as girls fall swing. Only three people I can think of who has done a decent job of the Charles Wallace, Mrs. Whatsit and people with red eyes (nicknamed "the red-eyed man" because of his complete rethink as a character). <br /> <br /> the history of the disorder. A good comparison to this aspect of the film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, who have not done a good job of retelling the story in the book, but kept the sole original work. Here, only one of the books that have a pleasant conversation with Hades in the underworld down, apparently not knowing that his body is destroyed. Dark Lord complements the sole of how well he showed that the truth must be felt or seen, with a flat face with Wookies Ixchel (replacing the marvelous creatures that keep Aunt Beast in their ranks) to break up the spine. As the God of the dead notes as thin was torn pages scattered terror Earth as Camazotz in the sand and lost in the darkness of evil land. <br /> <br /> I'm very sorry that this film exists. I do not think that the actors really bad. This is how the characters are written, it destroys itself. Wrinkles in time deserves to be adapted Kezdan, director George Lucas or Steven Spielberg, expanded at Industrial Light and Magic, slain by John Williams, given its sound at Skywalker Sound, edited by THX and sold Twentieth Century Fox. In its current state, the film does not deserve to be shown respect people. Even Madeleine L'Engle thought it was bad. The book was good, the film was poor, and Mrs. Whatsit was ugly <br /> <br /> Evaluation :. 0.1 / 10 (If I could) <br /> <br /> Advantages: <br /> <br /> They got the names right. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: <br /> <br /> It was a terrible problem with the level of adaptation Cliffs Notes, script, acting and special effects, not to mention the lack of evidence has ever read the book. Oh, and the main cover / poster has an image of three main characters riding a flying horse with a lock. Someone may say that it symbolizes the high adventure. I say that symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist, not even found Photoshop Meg hand on the right.
