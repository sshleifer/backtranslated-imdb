Firstly, I would like to mention that Sam Niel nowhere to be seen in this film. What's a movie without Sam Niel. Has anyone seen Event Horizon. D-Wars does have the potential of the movie about the dragon, which controls the lizards with missile launchers, it sounds cool, but unfortunately it is not. No, Sam Neely, not good film. I recommend taking a 5 dollars or so, you need to rent a D-Wars and adding 10 to these five and buying Sam Niel film seems to present it, I shall have ten lines of text to HEREs list Sam Niel movies I recommend <br /> <br /> -jurassic park -dead calm -hunt for red October -Event horizon-not Jurassic park three <br /> <br /> generally D-Wars is a pile
