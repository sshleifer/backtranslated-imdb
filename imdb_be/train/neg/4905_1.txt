I'm usually disappointed with the movie network. Even Flix, which attract big name actors, tend to be emptied of TV. Nevertheless, this one is the worst of the worst. The script is weak, and actions, especially in Tracy Pollan disgusting. I tagged along to see my kids'high school plays and was treated to the best effect. Pollan acts as if she was reading the script, she says. When she tries to express fear, anger or grief, it is very hollow. Due to the overall quality of production it was hard to take it seriously. If you have decided to stand this time to be ready for a big disappointment. Scary stuff, is not to scare you, boring stuff, will not make you bored, romance does not make you feel warm and fuzzy, and you will probably be as anxious as I was to see the end come. "The first to die," says a lot about this film.
