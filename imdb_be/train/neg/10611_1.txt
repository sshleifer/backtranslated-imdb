Terrible acts Potter and flat area, without stress what so ever. And as for the feminist polemic is ridiculous. I have seen this garbage when it was first released, and although I found it tedious beyond belief, I am glad that I went to see him. This is because I now have an immediate answer to the question "what is the worst movie you've ever seen? In addition, I have the comfort of knowing that every film that I see for the rest of my life will be better than Tango Lesson . But I must admit that I was amazed at how Potter wrote the screenplay, which attains the maximum number of grants to the Arts Council from around the world (as disclosed in the credits). <br /> <br /> I'm just very recently saw Orlando, and I can see how Potter had learned the wrong lessons from the making of this film. All it took I had a bunch of fanciful costumes, some hard looking at the camera, leading lady, and free land to lure film publicity. So why should not she think she can get away with self-indulgent nothingness that The Tango Lesson?
