I read the novel Reaper Mezrich and FEWS years ago, and last night I happened to see the fit. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it was years since I read this story for the first time, the differences between the novel and the film are enormous. Very important elements that made it all believable only drawn or change bad <br /> <br /> If the plot sounds interesting to you :. Go and get the novel. It's much, much better. <br /> <br /> However, 4 out of 10, since it was hard to stop watching because of the large main story Ben Mezrich.
