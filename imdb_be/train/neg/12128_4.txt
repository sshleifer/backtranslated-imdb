If half of the frames of the film looks strangely familiar, it means that you're watching too much of this bloody Italian cult shit! After all, you see, the notorious demigod Fulci not only to make this film, he also took the liberty of re-using the most sadistic killer in your sequence (and easily verified) "The Cat in the brain." The opening scene is already in which a prostitute brutally beheaded with an ax, especially in the later film Fulci and so do a few more murders and immorality points. Andrea Bianca «Masssacre» fails miserably as Giallo, as the search for a sadistic killer among movie-set group of a horror movie, but it's compelling and disturbing, but it's still good fun when you are in a cheap 'n shlocky horror trash incoherent script is a whole bunch of despicable characters that you are potential maniacs, but none of the red herrings Biachi invents plausible, and you can show on the killer almost immediately. all that will benefit are truly misogynistic makeup effects are gruesome and funny actor performance ensemble cast. Every time there is no bloodshed in the screen between the first and the second murder, "Massacre" is a slow and almost unbearable with his meaningless dialogues and thoroughly uninteresting photos. Fortunately, in the second half, there are women getting impaled on fences and men being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes. Music shit and use of places of filming is very mundane. My advice would be to skip this puppy and go straight to the aforementioned "The Cat in the brain." This one has all the great moments of «Massacre», and then some.
