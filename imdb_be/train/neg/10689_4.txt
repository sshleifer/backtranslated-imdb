Cuba Gooding, Jr., a secret service agent, who blames himself for the murder of US president, I'll show you right away that this is not the type of role that this talented actor is known, and this film shows us why, he merged with persistent news reporter ( angie Harmon), to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the death of the president, and so on, blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Even with a cast of James Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr., Anne Archer and Angie Harmon "Endgame" is not able to capture your attention, plain and simple; some action is good, acting is not all bad, and the story, though formulaic done before could lead to an entertaining and enjoyable film - Oh, no! Script writing and direction make absolutely sure that in any moment it suck you into the story, or to get you to give the slightest thought to any of the characters. <br /> <br /> 4/10 It's a sad, predictable and dull.
