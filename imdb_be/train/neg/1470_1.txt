I was looking through our DVD tower last night, something to watch. We were between Netflix mailing lists and it was quiet Saturday night. I pulled out one of them, that I never heard before, and realized that it was borrowed from a friend. With the jacket, it sounded like a plagiarism of «The Big Chill», but with an all-star, he felt that it might be worth a look. Boy, I was wrong !!! Moreover, it is like «The Big Chill," it was a rip-off almost character by character. The character of Bill Paxton was a copy of William Hurt ( «Where have you been all this time" role) -spoiler Warning- and, sees, he left behind to take care of the old place (cabin / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; jerk womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum, etc., etc. I wondered why I even watch these people. It was the lack of character development for me to find any interest in them. As "Uncle L" even find the characters after 20 years? In addition, it is not even funny, except when Perkins fell wrong "flopped" out of bed the first morning, it was a sign, and I missed it. After it was over, I asked my wife, "Were there any characters or tender in this film? ... you sleep there? "She replied:" No, I still think ... No, I can not think. "
