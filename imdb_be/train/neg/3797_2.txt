Years have passed since the rain, Alex (played by Gruner in the first film) stumbled on a monstrous plot, which involved replacing people with machines, but since the war between the cyborgs and humans arose, and we lost, is now kind of Superwoman, who is the daughter of Gruner character (she also inherited only half of its minimal acting ability), which I think is the minimum connection to the movies first, but when you create a superwoman, she hides in 1980, while the bounty hunter from the future hunts her down this misconception of science fiction clunker. Nemesis has become a cult, I can understand why people love, even if I was not a fan of this film. Nemesis tried very ambitious, to come up with different ideas to develop a beautiful appearance and provide tons of activities, it almost worked. Nemesis-not even have that ambition, it is a cheap rip off the terminator from muscular woman who is so low on the acting skills she does Gruner seems to be a master stage and sequence of actions is not explosive volume, which was the main selling point of the original. I admit that I was not a fan of the original, but he deserves better than to follow this. The original also showed a good shot as Tim Thomerson, Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and let Jackie Earle Haley is one does not have one, and this time it's just a dumb film with a pretentious vibe. In fact, after I saw it, he was inspired to add half a star to the original. <br /> <br /> * with 4- (Bad)
