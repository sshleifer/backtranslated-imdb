Another film that exploits gratuitous frontal male nudity; hardcore action, and that the lovemaking scenes are the most nya-sexy I have ever seen (and this is not about me, not associating the idea of ​​two young men, making love, because I was gay). <br /> <br /> Again, as in Mil Nubes de Paz, Julian Hernandez sent incredibly ambitious film with a story that makes enough argument for the short film for about five minutes, but manages to make a 2:00 movie with him ... and this time, there is not even a problem of racism and marketability in the Mexican gay community to speak of! God is merciful, have mercy on us!
