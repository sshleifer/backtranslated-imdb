After all, the debut film by Derek remained invisible for eight years ?? and that's how it should stay! John Derek was a competent actor, but as a director, he is almost erotic movie Ed Wood ?? not that this is particularly evident given that Bo (atypical sports dark hair) was only 16 when the film was made! John also wrote and photographed it; recent results in some decent footage of the Greek island of the situation against which the story is set ?? but the construction is childish and brutal dialogue! <br /> <br /> character played by actor Peter Hooten was brought up with the family Bo: they grew up like brother and sister, but now as a teenager, it's time to discover that they are attracted to each other (but, as I have I said, do not expect any fireworks sexy!). However, the worst thing is that the main characters of each hide obsession throughout the film, which are not only stupid in itself, but annoying in their intransigence ?? Hooten wants to transform fishing community in a remote seaside resort modernized and keeps waiting for the cruise-liner, to appear in the field of view (which, of course, this makes the final); Derek even nuttier ?? she craves possession of a large antique bath !! For the record, the couple married at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, participation in non-events female mayor of the city and a vagabond photographer who wants to make a model with Bo (and which, of course, takes upon himself the wrath of jealous Hooten). Sometimes, for no very good reason, in the open air, we were treated to even fragments of old classics screening of Hollywood in a movie theater, to which the whole city is going (among the names mentioned is public enemy [1931])! At the end of the day, while the naive Ba for undeniably charming, it's not enough to offset the vast haze of the film and dilettantism.
