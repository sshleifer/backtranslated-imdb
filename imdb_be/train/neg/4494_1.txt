*** spoilers *** *** SPOILERS *** Continued ... <br /> <br /> At this point in the entire movie collapses in on itself. First we meet a rogue program, indicating we will get a ghost and a vampire and a werewolf, and the like. We get the guy with the accent retarded endless trash talk, the two "ghosts" that serve no real purpose and do not have a character that, yes, one day and a bunch of scrap. Someone told me that they are vampires (straight out of Blade 2), but they are so uncertain, I did not understand. <br /> <br /> It's funny accented guy with a funny name suffers from the same problem as the Oracle, only much longer and is much much worse. It has a simple point of causation, makes it, and then continues to do this and to do it, until it becomes confusing and silly. His last line before leaving on a comparable storm "you know what happens to a frog ..." line in the X-Men at the levels of total soft baddness. Chocolate cake so lazy, pathetic cliché and Monica Bellucci as the wife does not do anything other than what it is, we expect that at the moment we see it. <br /> <br /> And then we get another kung fu fight !!! WHY? Nah, supposedly, The One. He can do anything. He has absolute power and that he uses it for. Kung Fu damn time. And while it can stop bullets in 1000, he still cuts by the sword and still makes food 5 obscure assistants (vampire?). I would like to see the mind blowing power. I would like to see him do the wildest, most insane crazy S *** to people, because he can do anything. I got the same as before without the 'wow'. <br /> <br /> The legendary car chase. It can not be bad. Well ... no, it's not. It's just not what we tyold was going to be. All the cool pictures from the scene in the trailer. Every one. So anything is possible Wow was taken from us, so that we are all now getting good consistency with Chase thinks that, kung fu fight !!! Well, this is not the Neo, but you'd think he would have told his close friends about the reality of the Matrix. At the very least, I teach them something. It's not hard. <br /> <br /> «Hey, Morpheus, do not worry about what happens to you in the matrix. This is not true. By the time you realize that nothing is real, nothing can harm you. »<br /> <br /> There you go. Simple. <br /> <br /> Thus, the pursuit is not bad. It's never boring, and it does not seem like 16 minutes. It's just so crushing. And yet, it's even worse. <br /> <br /> Final climax of the film is quite probably the worst you can imagine. They have this whole elaborate plan, which includes three of the crew. Then they show it only sporadically between Morpheus over long super instructive monologue. To make it worse, they never clearly define what this plan, which needs to have 3 teams. You know, in principle, but you do not know who is doing what, where, so that when a team goes down, you just do not care and you do not know how it will affect what happens. <br /> <br /> I sum it up, though, it happens like Trinity in the Matrix may come back to set the end. This is the only reason why this is happening. The question arises, why do they have to send 6 people originally? Trinity gets five minutes to myself! <br /> <br /> Neo journey to the center of the matrix (so to speak) are treated equally lazy. Ohhh !!! He works in the other 100 Agent Smith !!! Woooooo !!! It must have taken a lot of thought. Only now they are in the corridor, so that the fight does not scale, and ends at the moment. Man, that finale !!! <br /> <br /> And then the architect !!! <br /> <br /> Remember, all I said was bad about Oracle and foreign guy? Add them together and double it, it's like a really terrible architect. The only reasonable potential it he is going to establish cliffhanging climax. <br /> <br /> And then he blows! <br /> <br /> Let's look at the options it gives Neo. Select one of the door and the whole of humanity dies (except 27 !!!). Select another and all of humanity dies !!! Given the choice it is that this film tries to explore it really does not give one a hero. If he had the choice of the salvation of mankind and the wife dies or save his wife and kill mankind is still potnetial internal torment and stress. In addition, the Trinity being in the middle of autumn, the potential of the real exciting, no matter what I did seeing a third more significant. But no. He did not save, no save or correct. <br /> <br /> Now, the worst in the original matrix Neo dying and then coming back to life at the end. Year went everyone was so annoyed by how stupid Jar Jar was, they did not notice that at the end of The Matrix made him look for his Stephen Hawking. "Oracle told me that I fell in love with the One, and I love you» .... Come On !!!! The whole world is missed, how absolutely terrible, what happened? <br /> <br /> So what do do Wachowski in the future? Well, they are doing better than the ending of the original look. How? Well, doing almost the same thing again (only the replacement of characters), only much worse, I think my fa and g keys are worn out, if I continued to write far before I got worse. <br /> <br /> And the climax is simply not very exciting. This is a reminder. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is just plain bad. I really do not want it to be bad, but it's true. Poor in just so many ways. And what's worse, it's not a movie with not enough budget. This is not a film with too short schedule. This is not a film that has been popped up. This is not a movie where it's too much influence from the outside. This is the film the Wachowski set out to do with Warner condition fully behind them. And that's what makes it so awful. At least, Rancid Aluminum can say that it is not haev enough time and money. <br /> <br /> The Matrix Reloaded. Worst film ever made? Maybe not quite. The most frustrating and defalting film ever made. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt. <br /> <br />
