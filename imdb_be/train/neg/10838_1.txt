Minutes you give "the feature film" 1/10, you have people baying for the ignorant, half-asses ed, artistically delayed blood. I will not try to justify, as I am not aesthetically challenged retard by listing all of the "art house cinema" and I loved to mention, as I gave some unknown "cult" 10/10. All I ask someone to explain to me the point, the purpose and message of this film <br /> <br /> This is how I would summarize the film :. The opening montage of three unrelated urban legends, which shows almost absurd level of co disease. This should (in a nutshell, to save you 3:00 pain) following - a children's game show is dying of lung cancer is trying to patch things up with his coke-addicted daughter, which he may or may not be raped when she was a child, and who courted clumsy a police officer with issues of relationships, while the star party game show decides he does not want to be denied a child prodigy, the fate that befell another one of the game show contestants from the 60's that we see now unemployed homosexual in love with the bartender with braces and needs money for "corrects Maxillofacial Surgery", while the manufacturer of the game show, he was dying of lung cancer, he asked his orderly to help him to close up with the son he abandoned years ago, and who later became a self-help guru debauchery as the second wife of Mr. staging suffers from guilt suffering of deceiving the dying, and, in the end, the rain frog (you read correctly). I spared you an incredibly long and pointless, just rambling monologues, each character seems come up with on the fly without any reef we or reason, except, perhaps, to make sure that the film crosses the 3:00 and it becomes classified as "modern epic." <br /> <br /> You're probably thinking that I could do a better job of summing up the film (and in turn does not confuse), if I wrote the damn little more smoothly, perhaps in a few sentences instead of one ... Well, now you know how I feel.
