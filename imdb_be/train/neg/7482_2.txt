This film is not so funny - a waste of large stars that seem to catch up and in their own glory, that they forget. Only shining moments belong to John Cleese as the hotel manager who likes to dress - you almost fall from the chair with helpless laughter when he dances Donna Summer «Bad Girls», while wearing high heels, a mink coat and an elegant hat. The rest: Forget it!
