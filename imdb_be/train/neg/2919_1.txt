Damn, how a gay man living in New York, I can say with gratitude that I have never seen the underbelly of gay culture, which is depicted in the film - and I am glad of it !!! Whether the film was broadcast on television throughout the United States would be a great anti-gay backlash, and I can not say I blame them. People in this film do not represent the average American or even Gogo Trandgender average American, what they represent is pure and utter nightmare. The inclusion of the minor characters is obviously appalling and obvious racist (anti-white) are outrageous and alarming - society can not be blamed for people who chose drugs, unemployment and the abandonment of education by the "actors" of the film - the actions of these people do not are acts of desperation, but rather a rejection of any such personal ambition and the desire to do something with herself.
