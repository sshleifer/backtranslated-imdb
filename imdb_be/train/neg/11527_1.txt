<br /> <br /> The film begins like a regular comic hero movie. He winked at the boy, who took over, did not have parents and madly in love with the school # 1 girl. Nothing surprising in the film, there is nothing that you can not guess, goes to the movies. Toby Mcguire shows us that either it is not a good actor, or that no one actor in the world can not save a script like this. Maybe children around the age of ten can enjoy the film, but it's a bit violent for children. You can not get away from the idea of ​​cinema as X-Men, Batman, and Spawn. All these names are better. I almost went to the last 20 minutes! The only thing that would be good, although there was a computer animation, but even something to put in the Christmas tree! So my recommendation: do not see this movie, even if you get paid for it!
