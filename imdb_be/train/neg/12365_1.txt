I think this piece of garbage is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed, why all American animators believe that these days children want to blunt version of GI JOE good stories ??? in Looney Tunes it is one of the most beloved characters in the history, but they were not created to be the Xtreme, I mean, let's !!! Tiny Toons was a perfect example of how an old idea can be updated without losing its original charm, but this piece of garbage is just an example of stupid corporate decisions, which only wants to create a low-cost idiotic show that kids will love, because hey !! ! Kids love superheroes right ??? the whole show is just a waste of time, in which we see a new version of the Looney Tunes, but this time in the form of a superhero, it's not so bad, but the problem is that this show is trying too hard to copy a series like Batman animated series, and the new Justice League, the result ??? bad copy of Flash (Road Runner) or Superman (who else ??? rabbit error) The problem is that the Looney Tunes were not to be dramatic, it had to be funny !!!! as I mentioned earlier in this series sucks, and many people wondered why the anime takes around the world ??? this show is trying to be dramatic and action packed, but it's something that a few series and anime are able to do, if you want to see a good update of the old shows to watch Tiny Toons, this is an example that it is possible to bring back to life the old characters, but with a good history and respecting the original roots. Too bad the show is dead, another corporate wise decision, I suppose.
