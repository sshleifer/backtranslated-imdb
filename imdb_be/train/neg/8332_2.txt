Shiner, director Christian Calson, centers around three "pairs" and their relationship with the fury and violence. Quite a good start as far as I'm concerned. That's interesting. Couples fall into heterosexual couples, two heterosexual male friends, and straight guy being a "harmless" persecuted gay. <br /> <br /> Â«Gath" a couple does not really have much of a role in the film. There are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive, when to have sex or playing with each other, but it seems to have no real purpose, because so marginal. My guess is that they are a daily illustration of how the sex / violence are integrated into the life of the couple. The pair are not very aggressive, and it is not even shot in any form of the erotic way. As characters, they do not add a lot to the theme or plot. <br /> <br /> Two male friends make up a large part of the plot. They are involved in some kind of gay-bashing grades convincing homosexual man to have sex with them in the lane. It develops into violence. And violence is changing them. It is a means of sexual gratification. And their need for violence t release increases as the film progresses. The main problem I have is violence is not convincing. Not once did she think that any of the characters in any real danger. It just does not work. Given that the entire theme of the film about the relationship of heroes violence is a serious problem. Unfortunately, makeup does not help. Sometimes, that's fine, other times, it is very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one of the characters was ruddy smeared on his face. Mixing. <br /> <br /> A pair of interesting characters is a "stalker steam." There Calson seemed to say more and was able to develop a more coherent storyline. Perhaps this is because the characters seem to be developing more and have a resolution at the end. Shiner may well be much better if stuck with these two. <br /> <br /> I understand that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film. It's great. Most clicks do not seek low-budget deal. I do not think Calson achieved desire he aimed. I myself, I did not find anything particularly controversial or disturbing. Shiner was unconvincing. This does not mean, however, that the director can not accomplish anything with his next film. <br /> <br /> It seems to have something to say.
