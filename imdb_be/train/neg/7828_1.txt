With 2 days in the valley, I think it's one of the worst films I have ever seen. Just another long line Tarantino rip-offs that have emerged since Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere creates a fun movie for the first five minutes, but then the filmmakers make the unforgivable mistake of allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence up to the factor of "hip." You'd better skip this one.
