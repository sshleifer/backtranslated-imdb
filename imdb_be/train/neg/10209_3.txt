Being pleasantly surprised by the performance of Sandra Bullock in Miss Congeniality, I decided to give a shot Murder By Numbers. While decent in bold, dedicated roles perform Ms. Bullock "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, speed 2, 28 days) leave much to be desired. Her character and at the same time, the all-knowing, confused and sexually unadapted (sub-plot of the last Sandra comes across as a useless filler that does little to develop its already shallow character). Two teens were given a decent performance, although the forensic examination and the examination of a comprehensive me when-can attitude refuted dumb mistakes that scream "We did it!" Chris Penn is all too obvious suspect is wasted here as a marker for partner / love interest character. <br /> <br /> Ben Chaplin *** Spoilers *** Next Mediocre acting aside, the greatest deficiencies can be traced back to the TV story-of-the-week, which never has you completely buy into the motives of the murder in the first place, and, as already mentioned, the stupid mistakes (rare vomiting up food at the murder scene, too comfortable and framing the school janitor, two boys hanging out together in public places, a comfortable love interest causes friction, etc., etc. ) cause a kind of go on the intrigues in anguish and frustration killer. The ending was strictly "in numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the film. Now, using the tactics pattern shows nearly a highlight scene early in the film, and then fill the audience in how we arrived at that moment, the final scene does not surprise anyone, and did not have any of the so-called film intelligence claimed to come to this conclusion. Several promising concept, but poorly executed and weak in almost all respects. * On the ****.
