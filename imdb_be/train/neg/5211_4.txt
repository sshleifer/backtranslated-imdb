Ha. without a doubt Tommy insidious here. I do not know why but for some reason, young children in the horror movies tend to come across as a little butt chewing. and because they are children, they will not die. because they are annoying ... well..except refuge terror. but those are few and far between. <br /> <br /> In any case the movie. I can not find this movie on DVD? you can! all you have to do is to buy the classic scary DVD package! you not only get a metamorphosis on the DVD for $ 15, but you will also get 49 other films! what a bargain! pff. GOOD. I get bad publicity for these paintings. let's just say, this movie is not worth 15 bucks on your own. <br /> <br /> So, we have chemists. Yes. cause all pharmaceutical scientists look as beautiful as this guy plays Peter. He is trying to come up with a serum to stop the deterioration of the body. college he works wants to give up on the project, so he tries it on himself. but because it's a horror film, it sucks it up and starts and incredibly long sequence of transformations that take up almost 3/4 of the film. <br /> <br /> inflate out of the movie, he gets into a relationship with another woman who has a son. and she has never been married! scandalous! But, of course, Tommy is one of the most annoying characters .... no. I take it back. He is the most annoying character. Much worse than the old crippled guy who wants to take over the work of Peter and gloats over him while he is in the hospital. that's right, even as an old cripple, you can still be a villain. <br /> <br /> Thus, we can see, Peter begins to randomly kill people in a vision he has, until he realizes that he is the one doing this and just decide to kill all in its path to get back to normal life. However, in the end, it ends up being transformed into a de-lizard. Yes, I know, do not ask. The ending really does not make any sense. And if you are looking for any really good win, you're not going to get it. <br /> <br /> It's not a terrible film .... it's just frustrating because of the lack of good payback. If you already have a package of 50 films, and this is the next on the list, you are not a snoozer, but you also do not for a great movie. Just sit back, relax, and have a lot of snacks. Because this movie will not make you jump out of the skin at any time in the near future. <br /> <br /> The Metamorphosis receives 4 plastic lizard head with 10.
