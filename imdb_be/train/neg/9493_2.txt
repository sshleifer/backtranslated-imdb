This ridiculous movie offers a standard 1970s "hippie mentality" in a nut shell and annoying us in the process. His attempt to rationalize the absurd marriages of young, innocent women age sex cats and wash the windows. A naive young hippie playing Homeless-like (Kay Lenz) hitch hiking and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day she meets a funny (the Holden), at a mature age, to drink hard liquor and washed as an actor, and she decides that it is in "love" with him. If you think that is superficial, it encapsulates the entire film such scenes. She goes on to say how much she "loves" him, and she met with him only, it wears thin very quickly. I could not stop laughing throughout the film. It is obvious that she is just using it as a ticket to the food, but the director is immature enough to think that we are going to buy, there are really any love passes. Disgusting scene, where the two naked and sex, I had to fast forward, because it is almost inspired me sick. Trite offer music from the 70's and spreads through the film. Avoid it if you can. Grade D.
