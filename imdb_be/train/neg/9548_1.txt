I can not believe I watched this expected more. It starts OK. This film pushes the boundaries of reality, how far !! At least, the first one was more realistic. He rips the first film, and even mentions the Joshua Project. Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie. He has one good message to it, though, watch out for BIG BROTHER !!! The film just makes it seem like Big Brother way more than it actually is, actually. It was very aggravating. Even the makeup on the actors were really bad. Some of the acting is pretty good. Some of the acting is really bad, though. The script was OK in some places and completely messed up in other parts. This film plays on the convenience of approximately every five minutes. As I said, I can not believe I watched was expecting more. I think I'll pop in the original, to return to the ground ... Q
