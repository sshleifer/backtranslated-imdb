I'm a big fan of the true crime genre, but I could not sit through this rotten piece. It was almost as if Dahmer was conceived as erotica, up to a porn flick soundtrack. There was no look at what he did Dahmer mite, Sun studies that have been its victims. Nothing but "Look at how horrible this guy." And I have to give the filmmakers a lot of it - their Dahmer is the creepiest, that someday shame the screen.
