This film is quite possibly one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. Length was not nearly long enough to enable a good storyline. In addition, as the adoptive parents were killed were simply ridiculous. Mother suddenly dies from falling through the shower after stumbling in the figure, and my dad shot a police officer? I can see where some of the original may be that they were going on, but it could be better. In addition, all the cheesiness that made me press stop before it was finished. After hearing all named Lucy and find out that it was "Lucifer," I wanted to gag. Yes, it is interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. This is a male name. It should be given to a male character. In general, the film was sad, and could use a story.
