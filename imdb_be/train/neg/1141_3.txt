I will not say, the new material was a class of material, but it provides a very solid basis for what "could be" a good all-original film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was collected in 1955, during a one-day shooting schedules. After the new video Jules White decided to just Thumbtack stock footage from Â«Brideless Bridegroom 'in this short, making for a not very smooth story of transition, Jules and Felix Adler trying to fix with substandard bit of new footage at the end, giving us the old, worn-out ending boys (Moe and Larry in this case) to get shot in the ass. <br /> <br /> 3/10
