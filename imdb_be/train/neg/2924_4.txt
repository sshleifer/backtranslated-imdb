There is something here with the female role having this wonderful life she always wanted, after the worst life possible, since, as a child prostitute and winding with Eric Roberts. But her background makes it impossible to trust Dean Cain for her, and it completely destroys it in the end. It sounds strange, but I like the position of Dean Cain was at the end and the choice he made. He can not hurt her because he loves her, and she was the mother of his child (I think that the timing explains that it is his child, and not his brother), but at the same he can not forgive her for all that she did sleep with his brother (who shows love and the debt he felt was pretty much), and then to be a part of his death. In the best of hands that would be better than the movie, but something I caught a late night cable, it's not bad.
