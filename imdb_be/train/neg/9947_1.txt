This movie was terrible. I swear that they did not even write the script, they just kind of winged it for the whole movie. Ice-T was annoying as hell. * SPOILERS Phht more reason not to look * They sit down and eat breakfast within 20 minutes. it coulda been long gone. The ground was hard it would be, it was almost impossible to find it from the outside dogs. And if the ICE-T on this hill and uses the Spaz-15 assault SHOTGUN his sniper rifle (and then cut down a tree with eight shells ?? It will take 1000 shells to cut down the tree, size.) Guns and handguns are considered unreliable in 100yards. And they even see the reflection. Reflecting the light ?? I did not see the field on this thing. Moreover, when he was shot in the stomach and continued to walk, that he was hampered bled to death right there. PlusThe final, where he fills a stone or a cigarette in a barrel, guys. It would not have to blow up and kill him. The bullet is still fire to kill the Ice T, but to spoil the barrel.
