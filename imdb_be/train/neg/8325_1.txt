I just saw this movie last night and, to be someone who had very low expectations to begin with, I am still disappointed. The most obvious error in the muck of the film is that the main plot (the guy waking during surgery), had no relation to the result. This would end the same way in any case. Thus, what is the meaning of this? Who knows. In addition, the surgeon had 4 malpractice case against him, and he did not think that people will ask questions if the patient died on the table? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is completely inept and Kristians almost as bad. All this was just ridiculous from start to finish. I am absolutely sure that if you could feel someone cutting through the chest with a scalpel, you will be in more pain than that.
