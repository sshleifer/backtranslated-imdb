Imagine a woman alone in the house forty-five minutes in which absolutely nothing happens. Then it happens twice. Drawing up of flat and lifeless and unfunny joke, and a bad game keeps you from taking care of any of the characters, even if they are fighting the wolf packs and get beat up thugs brethren. Anyone who takes this film more than two is not quite reasonable.
