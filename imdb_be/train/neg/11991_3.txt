- Bad Stuff: This film is really crap. Bad tricks for one thing, they look so fake, I thought it was a «The Twilight Zone». Memories are pretty much useless. One part of the movie, he thinks he takes his anger at the window would make his life better. I want to know, the casting director, and when he was high, because the actions of the adults was even reversed. Kissing scene in the film even sucks. This film has killed the book. The book was great. I strongly recommend this movie. Not even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> - good stuff: I do not know what I can say really. There are several parts of the unknown that you have going on, but they were quickly shot down by bad tricks and acting. <br /> <br /> - My verdict: Do not look.
