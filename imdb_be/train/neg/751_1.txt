I truly believe that anyone considering shooting subjected to this overwhelming failure. As well as "films" Ed Wood, Jr., in the 60s and 70s, this film is a prime example of why these filmmakers have to expend so much energy to rewrite scripts to re-edit your movie, rather than tinkering with their special effects, while they finally look right. This film is also a decent argument for the pre-screening process studios. If Mr. Haynes were forced to endure the honest hard-hitting reaction of audiences, it may be reduced by 75%, or travel / work / walks onstage and edit the film down to a more bearable 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Students from the movie should watch this film as an example of how dangerous it is to think their job is "good enough" may be for real. Every speech, every line of dialogue, every digital effect, each filter effect, in fact, each frame of the video expresses the danger of aspiration to a mere mediocrity. Novice director may find himself / herself to temptation from time to time to think, "At least, I achieved something," or "Just finish it will be the achievement in itself." This film will help them understand how bad a film can get. <br /> <br /> Critics may also benefit seen this movie before they duplicate last summer entertainment, "the worst movie ever made." <br /> <br /> The beginning writers can learn from this film, how important are rewrites, and perhaps understand the need for rewriting. In addition, young directors can learn about the importance of a good script and a certain degree of respect for just how difficult it is to write a script that makes the spectators feel emotionally compelled by history. Writers and directors who look bad made for cable movies of the week and think "I can do better" can be seen to get an idea of ​​this film, it is difficult indeed to make even mediocre results. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that this film can serve as a tutorial for novice filmmakers. Especially those who come into the craft in the current post-Lucas and the environment after Spielberg. There is a reason filmmakers, such as they are declared to their abilities with the help of special effects. War of the Worlds clearly shows that not everyone can pull it off. Some of them can not even come close to it.
