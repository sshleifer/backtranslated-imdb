They should have called this film "Accepted Mouse Brother, slightly Inspired Vague Recollection someone of Stuart Little, which simply type skim the book a little, but mostly just remembered Cover" If it were not so misleading, I have given it a better review . <br /> <br /> But seriously people, do your kids a favor and read the book to them. They might actually learn something instead of their mind stunned by the fact that we all know as the Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> In the book, Stuart little about the mouse, it is about a man who is very small and mouse-like. He was born to his father, it was not accepted. A book about his life and eventually leaving the house and the way it is started up. There is a cat named Snowball, who thinks that he wants food and eat it, but Snowball can not speak. <br /> <br /> In the film, they screw everything about. I think the only thing that they have kept from the book were the names of the boats and the race.
