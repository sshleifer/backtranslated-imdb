I understand that this movie for children, and as a father, I sat through a lot of films that are not particularly hold my interest, but I can appreciate from the constructive point of view of how it turns out for my children. Parents should be encouraged still take part in the activities of their children and to control the quality of entertainment that they are considering, so that should be something that appeals to an adult audience, at some level, even in children's films. Disney has always understood this and, therefore, it is so difficult to understand how he could allow such a complete piece of Drek bear his name. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, sound editing and all the terrible dialog sounds super-duplicated and unnatural. I personally hate, but it was twice as badly, considering the dialogue itself, it seemed as if it was written by 12-year-old for a school project. "Action" reminded me of a school play, and none of the children actors had a range of emotions in their voices. Fortunately, it was a very short film. <br /> <br /> At the moment, before I come off as a video movie geek measuring children with an adult yard stick, the one thing that can save even the worst children's film is a positive message. Far from being able to determine how the message should be delivered as long as the right one. Let's walk through this film to see what messages Dano: <br /> <br /> If you get lost, do not worry, you will inevitably find its way home <br /> <br /> approach. wild animals. without any fear <br /> <br /> you can win any competition just because you "know" you can <br /> <br /> and my favorite, the last message left in the film :. <, Br /> <br /> it is good to obey authority figures, and do what you think is right.
