Hard to believe that the director Barbet Schroeder once did a magnificent and very funny Maitresse (1976), and now, it seems, only to do "by the numbers" Hollywood thrillers. <br /> <br /> This is a very light material, John Grisham, crossed with the story of television film. Bullock Cass Mayweather, wicked and independent investigator, specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin it reserved the police partner Sam Kennedy, and together they make an awkward duet. Not good when two unbalanced college maladriots (Gosling and Pete) decided to send them on a wild goose chase -. Seating is very clever and misleading evidence at the crime scene <br /> <br /> fair enough, but while Bullock and Chaplin do not create sparks, we also need to withstand a few dim overly melodramatic flashbacks that illustrate an important event in history Kos. Then, of course, there are frequent shots at the house on the side of the cliff, where there is absolutely no doubt OTT end will be installed. Ohhh ... atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Watch any episode of CSI instead. It is to the point and much more exciting.
