As for the movies go, it's quite nice. Fascinating characters, good dialogue, interesting enough story. I would really like it if I was not very annoyed while watching in full contempt it shows the city it is set. <br /> <br /> Glasgow. In Scotland. However, each character is English (except friend Sean, who Dutch). Scottish accents are heard only fleetingly in low-paid jobs and roles. The Scottish women (and as a spectator, who loves her "real life" movies to be a little more, as in real life), I did not think it would hurt to use any one of the many talented Scottish actor ... or at least, there is the English who could Toss together a decent accent! Vain attempts to use the word "pee" a few times did not do anything but further insult.
