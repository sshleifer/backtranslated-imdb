... they bothered to make this film? Does anyone? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the coming of legal age movie, go rent Summer 42. This is not a summer 42. <br /> <br /> If your big stars Nolte & Sarsgaard, and Sarsgaard gets more screen time, that is your first warning sign and, of course, for such an "artsy" movies, there are a lot of cursing and skins thrown around, just to make it "pretentious". <br /> <br /> Sarsgaard made his usual uninteresting, cardboard character, punctuated by moments that must have been intense. The intensity is that someone with bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> Miller is best known for her appearance and what she had to say about the city of Pittsburgh, after this film. Pittsburgh should hold a grudge against her. It has distorted the real Pittsburgh native. <br /> <br /> Foster gave Sarsgaard run for their money in a cardboard acting style. Wow! Whether it was his first role after graduating from high school? <br /> <br /> So, we have this amazing triangle. Foster crush on Miller, but with his boss / girlfriend. He can not take Miller to bed, and will not take his boss to sleep. So he hangs with Sarsgaard and Miller, and watching them get it. <br /> <br /> Then, after one of the pseudo-tense moments Sarsgaard in Foster & Miller to get it, the scene that we are "processed" in every sleazy, groaning in detail. And finally, just to round it all, Foster and Sarsgaard get it, with Foster in the role of Miller. Now I know how 2 guys get it (as if it was once something I needed to know). <br /> <br /> In the end, that is all that remains a tragic end for a sign and retrospective views of the remaining 2. It makes me right in the pit of my stomach. Oh, wait! It was a pepperoni pizza I just had. <br /> <br /> I would like to go back in time the film took in my life, please.
