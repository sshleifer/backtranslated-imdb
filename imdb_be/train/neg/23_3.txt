I rented it on DVD without any prior knowledge. I was suspicious, seeing Michael Madsen to appear in the movie, I had never heard of, but it was a freebie, so why not check it out. <br /> <br /> Well, I think Mr. Blond would very much like to forget that it ever participated in such a shame the film. <br /> <br /> Obviously, if your script and dialogues are terrible, even good actors can not save the day. Not to mention the amateur actors who fill the movie. Too many non-native-English-speakers play a part of the native-English speaking, reading lines from a script that had to be thrown out and has not been made into movies. It is unbelievable how incredible all the lines in the sound cinema. Music awful and totally inappropriate, and it all looks and sounds like a bad school play. <br /> <br /> I recommend you see it the only way you vote other, better movies. That's why I gave it 3 instead of 1, which it deserves.
