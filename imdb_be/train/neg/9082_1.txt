This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was tricked into thinking that can be a good thing because a few of my favorite actors in it. Now, I want to hit Jason Schwartzman in the person for this role. I was physically ill after watching this movie. I really do not understand, Hollywood time. There are so many people who are trying to break through that, I'm sure you can slide from the top and get the best. Thus, the worst movie you make is equivalent Ferris Beullar instead sludge. Gag, like dolls hair and rough tearing jeans advertising humorlessness added to the film. I am glad that I avoided this film and watched it on TV. This proves that you must avoid Jan. emissions at all cost.
