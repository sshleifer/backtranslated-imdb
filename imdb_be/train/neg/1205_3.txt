What is it? Canada made a zombie movie that I had never heard before. Undertaker works on the body of a recently deceased young man. This allows for a long flashbacks that show how the guy got. Basically, he and friends went to the cemetery on Friday the 13th, and raise the dead because of their silly singing. Cut back to the morgue, where our dead body back to life and kills Mortician and the owner (who gets his eyes popped). Ultimate WTF? shot is the owner of a funeral home in a straitjacket and screaming, "I'm not crazy!" Surprisingly, it has its eyeballs back. <br /> <br /> Starting the poor 58 minutes, this is definitely one oddity in a zombie movie. It feels a lot more, but put me in some kind of trance, where I could not stop watching. The film also has one of those "if you see this image, turn away from the screen" gags. This image of an old sick in the theater (prophetic?), And if it is (only twice), the blood begins to flow. Scene pretty damn bloody during the time period. There is a big mistake, where a zombie cuts right hand of a girl with a shovel, but - if he pulls the fake hand in the frame to nibble on - it's the left hand.
