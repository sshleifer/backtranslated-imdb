It was just a terrible film. It pains me to watch it. Almost every action was unmotivated in the context of the film, the action was very bad (P.Diddy was the best actor that really says something about the film) and the plot as a whole predictable. Some links on the Way Carlito was in order, for example, his dream of one day moving to Carribien, but in general they were weak. Love interest, in my opinion was a flat-out wrong, but hey, this is debatable. In any case, I really did not expect much before watching the movie, and I think you could say, even those expectations were not met. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez, because he really is a decent actor (Friday Night Lights). He was lucky, though, because I'm sure that will not be too many people watching this film. I usually give the film a decent rating, as they spark my interest at all, so I'll go ahead and give it two stars. Better luck next time. And yes, I really enjoyed Carlito's Way.
