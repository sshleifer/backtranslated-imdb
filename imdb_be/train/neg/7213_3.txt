While I certainly think the exorcist is a classic horror film, I must admit that I do not keep it in the same high regard, as do many other horror fans. As a result, I have not seen that many of the exorcist robberies, and if Exorcismo anything to go by, I have to say that this is a good thing as this movie is boring as hell, and, of course, it is not necessary to spend ninety minutes on it! In fairness to the other Exorcist rip-off, it is often considered to be one of the worst, and so perhaps it was not the best place for me to start. It is not difficult to guess that the plot will be: mostly the same as the one in The Exorcist and sees the girl get receive a demonic spirit (which is the spirit of her late father). Village priest then stopped in to perform an exorcism. Like many other Spanish horror, this one star Paul Naschy, which is largely the best thing about the film. Exorcismo was sent to Juan Bosch, who previously led the Spanish derivative Giallo «The Killer» was wearing gloves. I have not seen any of his other films, but also on the basis of these two: I believe that originality is not one of his strengths. There's not a lot of good things I can say about the movie; it's basically just runs along the exorcism scene, and should not be expected. Of course, I do not recommend!
