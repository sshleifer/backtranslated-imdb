I got the DVD is very cheap, and I'm a total Drewbie, and it is probably the only constellation where this film would interest anyone. <br /> <br /> One of the first Drew movie, it looks great, and she gets a lot of very nice of her scenes as the soul of the scene, a sexy dance scene, quite a few sexy outfits, etc. It does not show the friendly charm, we know of her more recent films. <br /> <br /> the movie itself is pretty average or sub-average, and much more like a made for TV than the one for the movie. There is no real fear or tension built up and the dialogue often cheesy. <br /> <br /> The most interesting, perhaps, the end, because I really do not understand. But, perhaps, there is nothing to understand about it anyway. But at least you do not get to the end you'd expect, and it also goes much faster than you would expect. <br /> <br /> In general, I think that this film exclusively for Drewbies.
