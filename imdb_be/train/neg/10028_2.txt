I had a lot of expectations from this film and even more so, since it was Yashraj film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy runs a call center, and one day he invited Pooja Singh to teach her boss, Lakhan Singh, English, two fall in love and decide to run away, but Pooja tells Jimmy that she can not do it like she is indebted to Lakhan Singh, who is also known as Bhaiyyaji. But they decided to steal his money and his only Jimmy learns that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is Don. At the same time, Bhaiyyaji hiring someone Bachchan Panda to find Jimmy and Pooja. <br /> <br /> Starring Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshay Kumar, the film is directed by first time director Viay Krishna Acharya and produced by Aditya Chopra and the like Yash Chopra. <br /> <br /> «Tashan» should be one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Yes! Scenery is good and Kareena Kapoor (and its widely publicized weight loss) look good. But the plot is very thin on the history and sometimes makes no sense from one scene to the next - so, why I said at the outset that I was expecting more from this film, as it was Yashraj production. As for the songs, unfortunately, there is not one song that I remember. <br /> <br /> There are times where you can laugh, and that's mainly due to Akshay Kumar and Saif could definitely do better, while Kareena Kapoor played his part well. But it can not be said for Anil Kapoor - it did not suit him at all as a villain. And finally, I never mind Aditya Chopra, who was a former producer and director of good films such as «Mohabbatein," that Yash Chopra makes producing a film garbage? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Bad movie, do not waste time and this is my first and last impression of this kind.
