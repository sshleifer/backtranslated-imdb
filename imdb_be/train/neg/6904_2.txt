It seems to me, as a recent film school graduate, that in these times of New Zealand's film reaches new heights, the general public seems to think every New Zealand film is made fine. Sione wedding proves it wrongly. <br /> <br /> This is completely overpriced and not that funny, and far away from the "gay" film other users have commented on IMDb. The only really funny, that I found in this film was Derek imitators black guy, but in addition, that the jokes were recycled crap that we've all heard before. <br /> <br /> As the Samoan half decent, I wanted to see how the film will deal with Polynesian show. It was a mess - I know what it is to comedy, but I do not feel that the characters do not have anything new to say about the Polynesian identity, even if it was okay, insincere. I was most disappointed with the end of the film and the resolution of relations character - Mikaele was a player who just messed around with white women, come to turn his way slightly when the "gloomy MaidenÂ» arrives in the city, is enlightenment, that maybe he should start looking for a stable relationship then at the last minute does not accept it and accept his position as Polynesian PALAGI Playboy for women. I do not understand why they did it. <br /> <br /> In general, it was very disappointing. My whole family went, that he was waiting to have a good laugh, but ultimately really bitter about paying to see it in the movies. Lame joke at best, acting, in particular, Sefa girlfriend, monstrous, and to be honest, I would be happy if I got my hands on one of these pirate copies of the film in order to save themselves the cost of the ticket is $ 15. <, br /> <br /> I think that the only good thing to come out of the film that is the second step (for the number 2, of course, is much higher, the film before) in the birth of the Polynesian cinema. I hope that the Pacific filmmaker in the future can learn from Sione wedding is to not reflect Polynesia and there is something more meaningful and sensible to say. Even if it is done in a comedic manner.
