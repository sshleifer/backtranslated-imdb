It is difficult to understand where this adaptation starts to go wrong, because I think that the problem begins with the very books. McCall Smith worked, that you have read them, not for the detectives, but also for his deep-indulgent and completely fake African vision, does not exist. He has done for Botswana that Borat did for Kazakhstan. - not so successfully, but based on how much the fact <br /> <br /> Once I realized this, he stopped gall me that Jill Scott, American singer / actress is cast as Mma Ramotswe. If it will be a land that is not Africa, as a way that she black woman who is not African? She was not the only American in the cast; Mma Makutsi plays Anika Noni Rose. Both women are far too young for the role they play, and too glamorous. And brutally murdered local accents, and both focus so exclusively on this cruelty, that they were not able to offer much in the way of action. Scott Mma Ramotswe is a cheerful, sweet and soft. Rose Mma Makutsi is annoying motor-mouthed bitches. <br /> <br /> As a result, almost unwatchable. The main roll is redeemed only by the presence Lucian Msamati which is in fair performance as Mr. JLB Matekoni. Hes off smarter and more intense than in the books, but I think I can not blame Msamati for it - it is a bright light in the ocean suckage. The contradiction between his work and the book is clearly stated in the legs which Myasnikov committee wrote. <br /> <br /> For me, writing McCall Smith has always been a very interesting yet certainly bad. He refuses to be edited. As a result, his books contain grammar experiments that border on science, and the characters who change the name short. That is why the achievement of that writing team for this project actually made it worse. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is now largely anglicised. Characters talk about "opening" and "sensitivity to his needs." Mma Ramotswe and Mr. JLB Matekoni gallivant open. Mma Makutsi moans of which do not have a computer, but, given its constant restyling hair, makeup and jewelry, I am surprised that it has not MacBook in a bag along with her Visa card. <br /> <br /> So, we stayed here? It's hard to be upset by this bad adaptation because, frankly, most of the things I love about the original apocryphal books anyway. McCall Smith draws a fictional Botswana populated with nice, sun-threatening black people who are full of fun and delicious nuggets of wisdom. It reads well, despite the language of parody, but it is a vision of how a certain type of white man wants black people. This is simply not true. <br /> <br /> Given that it is no wonder that this show sucks just as it does. It remains to be seen whether the European and American audience does not even notice, however.
