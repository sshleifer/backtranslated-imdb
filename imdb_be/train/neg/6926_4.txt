I got it in the DVD 10 pack CURSE Dead. You must love these packages deal. Even if they do not have this remastering, rehabilitation and all that hoo-ha, and movies, as a rule, in full-frame pan and scan format, there is no doubt that there are always a few gems included. And the "gems", I mean there is always some good shit to see, especially if the films from the '70s, as the Mansion of Madness. <br /> <br /> May copy is called House of insanity, but if the screen name 'roll is Dr. Edgar Tarr Torture Dungeon. It does not matter, really, because it's shit shit shit, no? Yes! But to say this film is completely useless wrong. There are some funky elements here and there, and it is obvious that the film had a decent budget. <br /> <br /> The sequence opening titles cool with color negative run cheap watch TV. Dialogue is always cheerful. Near the beginning of the film, the horse and the gods of the driver gets out to move a dead tree stump in the middle of the road. "WHAT THE POWER!" Says our hero. It's funny that this guy should not subsequently be able to fight with a silly longhorn when they come to make a whimsical fun. You have completely forgotten that this guy was even in the movie until it comes up later towards the end. Here's how memorable those characters. <br /> <br /> A large part of the Mansion madness, however, must be unusual and eccentric music jokes that the good guys have to endure. It's like a bad cartoon music that will find an enjoyable three years. And why are all perverts farce, anyway? I would say that my favorite moment had to be when the horse, and the gods of the forest monsters ambush, when they pull a stupid looking homemade ghost up shelf in the middle of the road and make the wrong stop. What the hell? Oh yes, there are a lot of fools to see, as well, for those of you that dig these things. Boobies, bad dialogue, and silly music. What best sums mansion madness for me. It's worth at least one view, and may be much better if you had a little to drink or whatnot. I can not say that I've never boring to watch, but I can not deny that it is also a barrel of feed. Interesting as Magical Mystery Tour, but with the story, but no. Hmm. <br /> <br /> Both Mr. Chicken PWNZ.
