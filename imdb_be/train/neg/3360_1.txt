Somewhere in his nonfiction book Danse Macabre, Stephen King says that one secret to writing horror stories, to avoid showing your readers is what terrible thing is waiting for the door to get them. When, finally, the door breaks and error in the ten-foot-high heels later, the reader can be a little scary, but it will also be thinking, "Well, I can handle it. At least he was not a hundred feet. " There's nothing worse than that lurks unseen and unknown, just on the other side of the tightly closed door, waiting to get you. <br /> <br /> Ghosts There is so completely wrong opinion that the director Jan de Bont is more or less begins his film metaphorically throwing open the door himself and screams: "Look, everybody, see it ten feet high error Is not terrible? !! "law of diminishing immediately die by the end of the film, the director, so to speak, jumping up and down, banging pots and pans CGI madly and shouting hoarsely :. "Look, everyone, come see this! ten one-hundred-foot-high error! ... And now, here comes one hundred thousand feet of altitude error! »<br /> <br /> The filmmakers seem to believe that the special effects alone can compensate for all other shortcomings in this matter (and there are many). They can not and do not. In fact, impressive as they are, the special effects are so persistent and obtrusive that distract the viewer looks at the end with them - whether it's happy or irritated. - instead of being immersed in history <br /> <br /> for me, the lowest point of the stupidity of this film occurs when the statue, the "blood" poured out of his mouth, trying to drown Liam Neeson (as Dr. Self) in the fountain . The filmmakers obviously did not know what to do with this alleged idea if they were, so they just throw Nissan in the water a bit, waving his arms and going glug-glug. At the next stage, a good doctor, apparently wiped and, ho hum, forgotten all about the annoying incident. <br /> <br /> Shirley Jackson novel, seems to have been dumbed down in this ridiculous scenario Committee from low IQ Stoners teens who thought so to scare people was to make every effect is bigger and stronger, "Okay, next, let's, well, to make a ceiling, you know, look like a terrible person, and, uh, leave it ... and all these prickly things like trap her in bed ". <br /> <br /> single saving grace Ghost is that it finally becomes so terrible that it's actually funny. By the time Owen Wilson (Luke Sanderson) fell to the floor, and then continue in his death Magic-Carpet O »to be fit for riding, I just about fell on the floor and I laughing. <br /> <br /> Poor built, brainless, grotesquely dictatorial, absolutely incredible, and filled with awkward dialogue and pointless scenes, it's idle chase is a textbook example of how NOT to do a horror film.
