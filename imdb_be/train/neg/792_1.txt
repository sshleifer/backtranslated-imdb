Thanks to the BBC for this show. I suffered from an inferiority complex, I could not bear to leave the house, talking to new people, and I had an overwhelming sense that people hate me. However, after watching an episode of the 4 Non Blondes my luck began to change. After the 2nd series, I began to apply the new jobs, fashionable clothing, and I actually feel talented. If the series was over, I was up in the sales department at work, striking scores of women and often won a karaoke competition down to my local. If you ever have a crisis of confidence and do not know where to turn, then take a trip to Poundland and pick up the DVD is only 99p.
