Seriously, I love those old movies and simplicity, but I just watched it for the first time last night, and he easily slotted myself in my bottom five times. It was it to be a love story, or zombies ??? This movie was so bad that after it mercifully ended all I could do was laugh, how ridiculous it is bad indeed. Fortunately, I'm too anal to make a film with not seeing the whole thing, or I would not be able to show off to watch it all the way through in one sitting! I like to think that something positive can be said about anything in my life, so that in accordance with this theory, I admit most positive asset of this film, it was very short for the full length of the film.
