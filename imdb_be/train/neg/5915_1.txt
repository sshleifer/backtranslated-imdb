I have seen many, many films from China - and Hong Kong. This is the worst. No, the worst one was the «Unknown Pleasures». I watched the "Platform" last night and thought that the other two films Jia Zhangke should be better. That evening, I was disappointed again. I will not look, "Xiao Wu" tomorrow night, because I just placed all three films in the trash! Whoever gave this film, "Platform" ten out of ten, you need to watch more movies! The picture was very poor: it was very difficult to distinguish between some of the characters, because of the lack of close-up work. The storyline was so inconsistent that I quickly sent it to the end of pure frustration. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Give me a Zhang Yimou or Chen Cage on any given day. This is the real masters of Chinese cinema, not frilly scams!
