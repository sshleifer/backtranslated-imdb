This one is a little better than the first. It still depends on a lot of his humor, which basically goes on to say that the old Bond films were not realistic. It wears thin after so many parodies. Girls were more interested in this. <br /> <br /> There is a tremendous amount of total gross-out humor. I hope one day the real comedy back.
