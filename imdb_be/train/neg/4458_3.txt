Most French films that I've seen - and enjoyed - were more talk than action, but this is normal. I found them interesting, well photographed, and with the intriguing actors. (However, I did wonder at one point, when Gerald Depardieu had ever done it seemed in every French film.) <br /> <br /> This film has the same exciting visual effects and had a good opening . But then he began to talk, talk and more talk .... is good for drama, but not for the murder mystery. After a while, I almost fell asleep watching it. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film was more like a game with almost all scenes were playing in the same room. So, if you like the game, you have to like it ... but I want a little more for the murder story.
