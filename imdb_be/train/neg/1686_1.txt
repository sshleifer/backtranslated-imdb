And it did Boffo box office over the weekend, so it should be pretty good ... so there you go. <br /> <br /> And you're actually in a state of shock when the film ends as it does, and you hear yourself saying aloud, "that can not be the end of the movie ...." But, unfortunately, this is the case. <br /> <br /> and imagine leaving the theater, being embarrassed and ashamed to recommend a dog in a movie. Do you think that your date thinks you're a dunce, who suggested such a crime, and your offer will certainly end promising relationship. in fact, it was so bad that we both cracked up laughing, how bad it was. I do not I see a future for Miss Gellar in a movie, and I believe that it adheres to in the future television. In fact, it will not be long before it is given to the flea market conventions that sell Buffy memorabilia, and it can not happen fast enough, .. if you ask me terrible, terrible, terrible plot does not make sense, continuity was awful It is obvious that the whole ending is contrived to be «Grudge II - Return of" Cat-Boy ".».
