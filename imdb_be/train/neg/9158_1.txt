Oh, my God. I bought this movie and ... I looked ... ... and ... ... the whole thing. ,, Well, it will be good ... I'l know that everything will be fine for a month or two. Some time in the near future I hope to get rid of back flash. I was going to eat something after the movie, but I just can not seem to get up the courage to try and keep any food at the moment. Bad? So bad. Too bad. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. Wait, bad, does not seem to get the message across quite right. Hmm ... There are not words to describe how awful .... not so terribly awful disgusting ... hmm cast / acted / removed / director / writer. Now I do not know what to do but throw it away. Maybe write it, I would not want to end up in the bottom of the architectural dig a thousand years. Worst movie since "Hey HappyÂ»
