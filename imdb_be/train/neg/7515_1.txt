Sucks. That's all I have to say about this sad occasion for the film. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. I mean, what the hell were they thinking? Idiots involved should never be allowed to do more movies. The action was so bad that not even able to entertain on a poor level. Trying to "lesbian scene" was sad. I felt so bad for the ladies involved. This movie sucks! Sucks! Sucks! <br /> <br /> I've heard rumors about the sequel. <br /> <br /> God <br /> <br /> Help <br /> <br /> We are <br /> <br /> All
