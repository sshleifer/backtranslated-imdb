He was at a copy of this. Not mine, and if I had spent my money on it, I would find the guilty and to demand it back! All I can say is that it would be a terrible student film. Any understanding of the film medium is absent. Responsibilities god awful, the story would have been rejected from the original series Twilight Zone, how unoriginal and lame, and the change in tone of the lead character's reaction to "ghost" a clown. <br /> <br /> I can only agree that "glowing" reviews of the film from friends and family. I'm afraid it's not even fun bad. <br /> <br Amateur /> in the extreme! <br /> <br /> Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!
