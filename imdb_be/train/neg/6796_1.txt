Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater, Chuck Traynor. I do not understand how to have sex with a dog (that cruelty to animals as well) can be found to be interesting and fun. Linda Lovelace was actually a prisoner who was forced into making these films. I know some people will criticize this comment, but I firmly believe that these fuels films fire of hatred and further sexist feelings against women. This society continues to show women as sex objects, unlike humans. We call ourselves "civilized", but I feel that we have a long way to go before we are ever likely to scratch the surface of civilization.
