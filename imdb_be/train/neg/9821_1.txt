Not often I watch the film, which is as bad as this one. I continued to watch every minute in the hope that it was meant as a joke only to find it had to be taken lightly. Well, as serious as the genre demands. <br /> <br /> The action was shameful and terrible situation contrived and formulaic. If the film was made in 1920 (for example) and had a quality show & Seek (cable) in its direction we think that the film was then naive. As it happens, this film was made in 2000, and I have yet to see the film with the silent era that has just as little as the charm of this. <br /> <br /> Definitely not for the serious movie-goer. <, Br /> <br /> [should not rated]
