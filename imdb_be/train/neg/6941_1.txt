This film is not only sad, it is also very badly done. The graphics are so bad that they are not even second rate - they are terrible. Symbols do not show faces expresssions, voice empty and without a soul, and the plot is absolutely not enough .... well ... anything and everything. My 5 year old loves it - but thought it was a bit boring. I agree with him.
