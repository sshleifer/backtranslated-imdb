John Huston's Wise Blood was a terrible distortion of the book Flannery O'Connor, than I could have imagined. With all the horrible acting performances (and not you, "That was done on purpose, you just do not get" me!) To score, which is more suitable for the Rockford Files episodes, this movie was disgusting. I saw it in good faith in the beginning, and, in fact, waiting for a pleasant experience. But the distortion of southern characters, from the ridiculous fraud southern drawl to the rhythmic, comedic, their faith was portrayed, unforgivable. Up to the end, which was completely devoid of any nature of feelings, it is not in every place that the book O'Connor light and resonate. Actors portraying "southern" police may also ate a hot dog smothered by the streets of New York and is worth quoting Godfather. One redeeming performance was an actor living and dead at the idea of ​​Ned Beatty Hoover Shoates, religious cheater hears Moates preaching Christ Church without Christ and see the dollar signs and business opportunities. O'Connor powerful book is the most well-known for its terrible, closed religious that ridicule the seemingly lifeless body of "faith." film Mr. Houston is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions, as they are clear to me and most of its fans, when I may be so bold as to say so. Although I admit that I can not know exactly what the author wanted to convey, I have enough attachment to it, and it works, to desire to remain a fan. When I considered wise blood, as Mr. Huston, apparently did, I would have tossed it in the trash. Flannery sake, and mine, I forgive you, John Huston. Forgetting .... it will take some time.
