The only way to get anything from this film to approach it as a comedy. Seen in this world, put it. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a serious film, look somewhere else. This film has no depth and offers a bit more than an involuntary and a one-dimensional consideration of "questions" without understanding at all. <br /> <br /> Creating a film about stereotypes, and then make every character in the movie stereotype is a very bad strategy - especially when the same characters are only scratching beaten in the form of predictable, stereotyped ways. <br /> <br /> Basta and Ice Cube to make a film almost watchable and Rappaport turns in a good performance, but the script is so awful and social commentary is so commonplace that it is difficult to find something soothing.
