This indicates that a girl named Susan Montford wrote and how this "film". No wonder she has no other credits her name by writing or directing. She made a serious professional error in the choice of her career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium. <br /> <br /> The fundamental things wrong with this film, except it funny story of women running away from four weak thugs is outrageous and a complete lack of LOGIC. <br /> <br /> ** After she leaves the mall, she gets approached four thugs as they surround her. Tell me, what kind of woman will aggressively shove a potential attacker, being surrounded and verbally abuse them? I do not mean after the attack has already begun, because then, of course, it is quite normal for someone to resist. But she pushed that guy and pretty much outgrown it to the next level. No woman would do if she 1) was not a weapon, 2) have the confidence in knowing that a backup is very close, and so is relatively safe from harm, or 3) the attackers are so young, and weak I am looking, that she was sure she could take them. None of this does not apply in this situation, so that it simply acts as a person who asks to rape or rob. And by the way, when the guard came up as soon as he entered the observation distance Besinzher Kim, why did not she immediately or to run to him for help or shout ?? <br /> <br /> ** When she leaves after the guard gets shot in the head, she is driving in a deserted part of the city, and accidents. It was a good three minutes ahead of pursuers, instead of just running away on his feet in a diagonal direction of the houses and climbing board and continues, she comes out of it Red Toolbox and starts messing around under her hood. I understand that she is trying to fix her car, but she had to escape. <br /> <br /> (I did not mean that it is a chronological summary of the movie, because I hate people who are doing it in their reviews, but it turned out that every major sequence of the film, there is something so blatantly foolish I must comment on). <br /> <br /> ** Why is she wearing a loud, Red Toolbox, as it tried to escape in the dark? If she catches one of the jokers need for her to open the toolbar. At first she resists, then finally opens it. And removes the key. This scene is so rich with subtle notes of the complete failure of dramatic effect, I must break it down, this is one of the most stupid scenes in the entire film. When he was asked to open the box, it resists at first, as if it was her plan to somehow one of the thugs to open it themselves with anger after she did not open it, in the same way that someone in some insurgent may have a device that the enemy requires people to touch / button / open / manipulate, and once the hero refuses to open it, the enemy seizes the device, only that device will automatically dispense the chemical / shoot him in the face / rendering him unconscious, that was the plan all along hero. A feeling that this is what they tried to do with Kim Besinzher here, as it opens a set of tools to quickly and dramatically remove the key and sends one of the thugs, and somehow frightened runs away from him and three other thugs. <br /> <br /> ** in the rest of the film, basically what you see, it's a suburban house wife, sneaking through the forest when she has her Red Toolbox, taking various tools used as weapons to kill her attacker. <br /> <br /> ** If she escapes, she will eventually move to where the bandits are? I think it was the scene where they were, that radio played loudly in honor of the dead man. She somehow has crept upon them, when I thought she was moving away from them. <br /> <br /> ** Finally, the whole premise is so weak, because the whole reason she pursues in the first place because of the thugs' point of view, it has been witness to murders they have committed against the security officers before, and so they We felt that they had to kill her. How ridiculous. As one of the thugs even said that they could have just left the city and returned to any city they went to no one but her, still they saw, and it probably will not get the license plate. Even if these features do not work for their benefit, as the dissolution and watching for someone to kill them by improving your chances to get away from the original murder?
