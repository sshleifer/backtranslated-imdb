Yes, it's about sums it up. This movie was terrible. Two minutes later, I wanted to gouge out my eye. It is praised as "innovative LDS comedy", but it is not even good for the members of this church! I do not think that anyone should be such as victimization, to watch a movie this poor quality. <br /> <br /> First of all, you can say that absolutely no effort at all was not included in the film. It seems as if terribly monotonous fights, hackneyed plot was thrown together two crazed weasels is imbued in vain for a coherent (at least partially coherent) thoughts. Then, there are actions gloomy from * all * of participation. Even cameos Sun revive anything higher. <br /> <br /> And let's not forget the fact that our hero is a shallow jerk, we would like to believe, may change, but the road is full of strikingly bad dialogue, terrible disgusting "gag", and many Mormon "in-jokes" that anyone in his right mind, the LDS or not, should be considered purely * * stupid! This should be one of the worst films I have ever seen!
