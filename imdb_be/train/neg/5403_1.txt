I gave the film one star only because it was impossible to give him less. <br /> <br /> The researchers developed a formula for the replication of any organism. In his laboratory (and run into the composition in the memos), they create a T-Rex. Group of industrial spies break to steal the formula and the rest of the film is one endless pursuit feet. <br /> <br /> course, T-Rex (rubber puppet) becomes loose and begins to destroy the cast. He has an amazing ability to sneak up within 2 or 3 feet of someone without noticing them, then quickly bite their head. <br /> <br /> One cast member runs away in a police car and spends the rest of the film driving aimlessly around town. She has such great intelligence, she can not even work on the radio. She never makes any attempt to get to a substation or a donut and seems hopelessly lost. <br /> <br /> T-Rex to cause harm to the whole city, there burns a gunfight and building (cardboard models) undermine, but a police car or army, nor anyone else has ever found. Such activities should be a common sight in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> We can only hope that the sequel is planned.
