Spectators gushes over everything, including the title sequence (Now that's funny) would like to make us believe that this is some cinematic miracle, but, believe me, guys, this is one of the most strikingly bad movies you could ever see, and if you " re not laughing at him for five minutes, I would say that you have lost a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> David Niven plays convicted and bravado-besotted RAF pilot, someone considers it appropriate to draw an impressive (female) air traffic controller in an emotional conversation about love, just as it is immersed in its specific and fiery death. (Is not it romantic ...) Of course, he was spared from a metaphysical strangeness of chance, and washes up on the beach, as well as the same air traffic controller is riding on a bike. (They immediately clinching). <br /> <br /> Looking past the amazing homo-erotic subtext (the top you really need to treat them as supertexts, of naked boy sitting naked in the sand butted games gloomy zonal-squire theme of the film on his little flute, the heavenly messenger so campy / bastard had caked on make-up more closely than will), the most surprising aspects of the film is how to weave such a bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes in a mysterious attempt to argue some point of the universal character and the power of love. We get it - to fly the boy the girls in skirts and heels, and girls as Â«Em ago, and, apparently, all you have to do is to cry a little bit, to make it a noble enough for the film to get 10 stars on IMDb ... <br /> <br /> regard to product quality, continuity / Editing poor enough to induce hunching his shoulders, and the lighting, maybe even worse than it is, but you're unlikely to have noticed, because the script is so bad . There are games played with the Technicolor, (no matter goes to the sky in black and white, if you can figure out the meaning of that), and the omen (so funny, my fellow audience member who, as a rule, like a movie, like it actually cheered and laughed when the motorcycle DOC then finally appeared in a fiery crash), and the stop-motion (which is funny just because a woman lead so poor when standing still, you know, stage hands laughing on camera). <br /> <br /> The best pictures are early, on the beach, but after that, it all down. (Moves like an escalator is moving) staircase hardly Odessa steps, to put it mildly, and I really caution against any sense of how they would have to see this lame attempt to film-making to their accounts. The film as a whole is bad enough to be funny, and it's about the best thing I can say about it.
