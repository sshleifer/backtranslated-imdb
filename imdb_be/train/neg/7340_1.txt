Impressive! This is the worst SRK film and one of the worst Bollywood movie I've ever seen! I do not like this novel, but the film made it worse! Very bad music, even worse than the actors (except for SRK, of course, though he did not even manage to save the movie), not so much sense. The director makes it all looks very strange, God knows why ... Maybe it's because he's trying to do it all seemed very surreal, and yet credible. Well, it can be neither. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a few hours to make, do not watch this movie, please! (In saying this for your own well-being!) Continue to search, you'll find something else to see!
