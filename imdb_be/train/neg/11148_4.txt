This is a prime example of a low budget, winning for what would be a good storyline. Let's return Samaire Armstrong (see her work on the OK, I know what it can do better), and then find the best screenplay and budget. <br /> <br /> special effects were so bad, and mostly bad computer that he almost lost me the first time the wolf was seen on the screen. And Samaire Armstrong (in alert!) Changes in operating assets was done by reducing its first bad GCIF figure before she even begins to change (people for Final Fantasy, as well as Pixar made it to the ridiculous, to think of the figure as a nude Barbie Doll) . <br /> <br /> in the history was interesting, although the idea of ​​ancestry into werewolves is nothing new. As also hit the balance between evil (probably) not evil, and a possible end to the human race must-mate two lines. Scene from the "Book of the Werewolf", which payment, made some of the other characters in the manner of a spell for some time to be effective, but can be extended even to explain what happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Bring in the best scenarios and directions, and I will come back again.
