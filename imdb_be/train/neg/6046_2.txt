This film is basically two o'clock character Defoe drink himself - almost literally - to death. The only surprise in this film, that you did not have enough evidence or the nature of the knowledge to be surprised. It was just a dark, boring waste of time. <br /> <br /> Will Defoe excellent actor. Peter Stormare great actor. But this movie just sucks. Slow does not make a bad movie, it was just bad. Fragmentary plot mixed with delusions art anamorphic detail not cohesive tightened significantly to the area except to highlight some gusset, which is illustrated in several ways, finally, in the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as entertainment, it put me to sleep. (Seriously, I fell asleep, and had to re-watch the movie -., Who was even more disappointing) <br /> <br /> I do not like to make negative comments or feedback about the work of others, even if they suck, but this film justified one. It's just too bad, that these great actors are a disgrace to this end result.
