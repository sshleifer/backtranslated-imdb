I bought it from Blockbuster for 99p. The guy behind the counter said that the reason it was so cheap because the disc was scratched with shit, but do not mention the fact that the reason it was so cheap because the film was ap * ss poor effort that sucked more than Paris Hilton home video in the hotel room. Speaking of home videos, as when there was no fair play, to release them in the form of films - I mean, the films used in the work of actors and technicians, and writers, and so on - no more - just gather friends and the lame-O ideas together for the weekend, lavish production with a budget of £ 8,00, and get someone to fall down the stairs with a Casio keyboard (soundtrack) - then slap him on the shelf for some poor sap (I) to take home in lonely despair. But here's the clincher - I fast forwarded through most of it, and threw it to the side, ready to hammer ... until the next night, while watching Darren horror «Hellbreed» Day (£ 1.99, to take home and keep from each other blockbuster). Now this film made «Grim Weekend» Exorcist look, so I hit Grimm weekend again to catch up on some of the points listed on the IMDb message boards beautiful, the audience claimed were gay. Of course, once I got through the suffering, pain and horror, realize Grimm weekend was full of chod on toast, I could enjoy, enjoy, and downright funny things begin. And there are many. Check the board. Then check Flick. Hell, it might even be worth. Awwwww Shit!
