and its official. they just killed American Pie. The first 3 were absolutely hysterical, but it is one, and the rest were terrible. I mean the story of two college fraternity, who are fighting with each other for their homes, I mean come on talk of weak points, the first three are considered grown up, change, and marriage, which are all worthy in terms of development of human society. <br /> <br /> New Stifler is the biggest joke I know him trying hard not to compare yourself with Steven Stifler, but no cigar. I give this movie 3, because there are 2-3 funniest bits in the movie. <br /> <br /> The best character in this film is, of course, there's Dad Jim, I do not know why he continues to keep doing it poorly developed films.
