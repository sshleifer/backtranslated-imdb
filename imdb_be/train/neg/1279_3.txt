Three tales say in the film that seemed to have been shot without the knowledge of being combined vignette film. The creators connect three vignettes, with their ever-connected compressed Martin Cove, although you may never see some of the entries in wait. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is sexy Vivian Schilling, a woman afraid of everything under the sun (it does look like Adrian Monk bold) having paranoia permeated the evening at home alone. You will literally yell at Vivian to do some funny things. She spends most of her time in Nighty, which shows its amazing features. But her film is the worst, if not the most nail-biting. <br /> <br /> The second vignette belongs Bill Paxton, as it reflects the roommate from hell. His roommate that causes allows it to take full advantage of it, and the bill does it whenever he can. <br /> <br /> The last vignette funny how a person is afraid that death will take him at any time, just like his friend who choked on an olive. <br /> <br /> Not very exciting, like the film as a whole seems to be cut with very little thought sucked. A must for fans of Bill Paxton.
