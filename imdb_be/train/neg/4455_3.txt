Where to start? Well, do not compare the movie Fight Club for the start - ridiculous. If it was even a band-aid on the fight club, violence, blood, blood, etc. It will be much more obvious and realistic. Second, this film is not football factory - which is so much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look like embarrassment). Rightly, the plot is quite decent and well choreographed fight scenes - I might add with a decent ending. But the film as a whole is poor, is seriously poor. Because people have been mentioning the emphasis should not spoil the film - I agree - or a simple error of pronunciation, or lack of effort in coaching voice made the film to annoy all the way - it was seen from one scene to some American / Jordi played a role. Do not get me wrong, good looking guy who looks great from the scalp - but not a football hooligan. I could go on forever about how funny football scene - in "false steward" of the situation. In addition, if the GSE are going to play United in the north, they go on the train, waiting only 3 of them - it makes no sense - is a real organization of gangsters and thugs, who is portrayed in the film some mickey mouse cult of approximately 5 people. In terms of precision - made West Ham and Milwall not play in the last few years they have been in the league together? Hmm, ten years in order. And I'm sure that "disturbed" will be able to just waltz in solid pub Milwall. In principle, a very bad film that will appeal to people if they have little knowledge about the real football and hooliganism. If you really love football and are intrigued by the criminal hooliganism ,, you just feel like this film is insulting your intelligence. George Ross
