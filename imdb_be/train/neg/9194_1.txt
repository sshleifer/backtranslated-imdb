Well, first of all, I'm a big fan of the zombie movie. I loved everything clicks Romero and thoroughly enjoyed the remake of Dawn of the Dead. So when I heard a critic of the film rails, I was still optimistic. I mean, critics hated Resident Evil, and while it may not be particularly great film, I liked it, if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot-em-half decent plot. It is, however, pure shit. Terrible dialogue, half-assed story and video scenes inserted into the film. Who in their right mind thought it was a good idea. The only thing in this film (I use the term loosely) that I enjoyed were Prochnow as Captain Kirk (UV). Despite the fact that his name throws the novelty of the window, you can see in his performance, he knows that he is a god awful film, and he might as well make the best of it. All other actions as if they were doing Shakespeare. And it is very bad, I might add. Basically the only reason anyone should see this ugliness, if you do.) There is a huge zombie lovers and a must see Zombie Flick made, or b.) How to play MST3K, in a home game. Watch it with your friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughter. <br /> <br />
