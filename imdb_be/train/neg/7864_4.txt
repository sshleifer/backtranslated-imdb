The Hills Have Eyes II that would be expected that there will be no more. Of course, this will not be an Oscar-nominated film, it's just pure entertainment, which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The story is basically about a group of National Guard trainees rendered the struggle against the notorious mutant villagers on their last day of training in the desert. It is only they are resisting throughout the film, which includes a lot of violence (which is mostly the entire film) is constantly flying around in blood and guts for all of this, as well as another graphic rape scene, which aimlessly thrown on to shock the audience. <br /> <br /> I'll Hills Have Eyes II 4 of 10 for pure entertainment, nothing more. Although even then I found that looking at the clock more and more as the movie went on, he began to pull out of the fact that it is still trying to shock the audience with graphic gusset and the occasional leap scene just to make sure that the audience not sleeping. The Hills Have Eyes II is a decent holiday, you pass the time when you are bored, and nothing more. <br /> <br /> 4/10
