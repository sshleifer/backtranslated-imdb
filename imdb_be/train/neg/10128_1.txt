He was my hero for as long as he did not go along with {if you can call it a movie} I went on the show to watch it and get out, rather than just asking for my money back, but asked for double the money that's how bad my action the hero and the hole thing was ............. I can not believe that the career of Steven Seagal hit so low that he was reduced to the creation of the 4th year of movies with fifth year secondary sub ' objects. I watched it move, expecting to see his beet the crap out of some people, the way he usually does. If it comes down to using the same judo chops between the shoulder blades to remove the enemy and the guy falls like a ton of bricks, that something is wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is incredible, like in the movies, and even if you just visual and read this story as a novel, you would be left wondering why you even have a book. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal goes through the motions, and it seems as if he only does it because he has to. He shows no effort and no enthusiasm, and in some scenes he did not appear at all. <br /> <br /> I do not want to repeat other peoples comments, but the use of footage for the deleted scenes and visual planes in flight gloomy. The status of these scenes cut in the unstable and the scene itself seemed to have deteriorated over time. Zappruder movie showing President John F. Kennedy being killed is more stable and cleaner. <br /> <br /> Private opinion, to tell you not to waste your time to see this movie, not up to the standards of his work in a shimmering or exit wound. I read one review that said that the film had a budget of $ 12 million (Segal pay 5 of this), and that the film still came in under budget. I have to agree. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that it is straight to DVD movie, no matter how conscientious the owner of the theater will not play in this film.
