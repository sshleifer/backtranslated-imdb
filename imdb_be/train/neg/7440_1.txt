I'm going to go on record as the second person who has, after several years of use, IMDb, to watch movies, motivated by his films, just create an account and leave a comment. This is hands down the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The site is on the brink of non-existence, and none of the "puzzle pieces" is not summed up in any way. Action was ludicrous, and the letter was uncomfortable. As this film has received support and came to be completely beyond me. The only saving grace I could find cunning and reuse Anastasia Hill on the zeta words. (And the brilliant sound design) If I was faced with the possibility of again see this movie or be torn to pieces by wild-hole I would be against a hard decision. I am disappointed that I can not give it 0 stars.
