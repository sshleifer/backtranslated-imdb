NOTHING in this movie is not funny. I thought the room, giving the human libido ram Randy, it was interesting and should provide for some laughs. Wrong! There's just nothing funny movie. For example, the protagonist makes a pass on a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer's yard is not funny, it borders on the obscene. They are toying around with bestiality in the film at the same level, and this is simply ridiculous AINT. <br /> <br /> We all know that dogs will eat anything, anywhere, anytime. The main character does it with everyone, everywhere, every time, too not funny. This becomes a stamp. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider, I think that is acceptable in this role. By this I mean that he is not a bad actor, but a rotten material, it is difficult to comment on the quality. However, Colleen Haskell, the other half of human romantic leads (one counts the number of animals that the protagonist has an interest as romantic leads, too?), It seems confused all of these, as well as it should be. It seems that it acts in some vacuo separated from all the other actors in the film. <br /> <br /> See this movie only if you want to be drilled tasteless, dull, repetitive material.
