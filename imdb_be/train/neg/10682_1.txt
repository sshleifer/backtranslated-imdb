So I'm looking to rent a DVD and I meet this movie called "End Game." It stars James Woods and Cuba Gooding, Jr. and has a summary of the student's political thriller. Well worth a look then. Or so I thought. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The end game is just about the most ridiculous story I've ever had the displeasure of enduring. Now something a whodunnit, I can not take her away from him, as we would like, not "ruin" it for anyone else experience this ugliness. But questions such as "Why is he / she / they do that?" And "Where do they get the resources to pull it off? all-too-rich following the conclusion unintentionally hilarious film <br /> <br /> As for the action. - You know those movies where you can almost feel that the actor realized that they made a terrible mistake by signing on to the movie, and then it shows in their performance? This is one of them. Accompany it with a ludicrous script and serious shortcomings, irritable direction and you have a recipe for cinematic poison. <br /> <br /> Of course, it did not make it into a movie, and for the same reason, you should not allow it in the living room; it's terrible.
