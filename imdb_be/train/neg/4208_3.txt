There is a very good movie lurking under the surface layers in the layers of cheese, which is «Pagemaster». <br /> <br /> I learned this when I watched it this morning after neglecting it for years and years. I remember hating it with a passion, when it first came out, but this time, I discovered that the special effects are very good. The plot is simply "The Neverending Story" with the work-endectomy, but that's ok a little flick for those who just want to have some really strange eye-candy. Animation is amazing, and I particularly liked the way the animators let their characters look and behave a bit more surreal than the norm. I give it a grade three, I * b * gave it to two (only for parody value) if I ever decided to watch this movie expecting that this is absolutely my view undermine the story wise.
