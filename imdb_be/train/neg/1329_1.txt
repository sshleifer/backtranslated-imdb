This movie is terrible. I have not laughed so hard in a movie that was unintentionally funny for a long time. Lena must stand delayed and late evening television. Cars in movies were cool, but the film itself is a stupid movie I've ever seen. It's pathetic, horrible acting, and story may have been written 4 years. Do not get me wrong, Jay Leno is hilarious, but not in this movie!
