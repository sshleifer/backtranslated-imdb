I was bored, around 10 pm, so I watched this movie. And I could not help laughing. It was so funny. The way children acted like they were older than 11 times cracked me. One of the children had a ring that allegedly killed the man after 3 years or so. This gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster. <br /> <br /> it's pretty hard to take seriously young children, especially if it is related to eating worms. They act like all such a big deal, as if Billy (the main character) does not eat worms, that the world will end. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for young children (except for the fact that 5-year-old says "penis"), but not for teenagers or adults who do not want to waste your time.
