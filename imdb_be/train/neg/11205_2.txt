Yeah, well, I definitely would not regret giving up my Saturday night to watch this amazing small but very long movie. Perhaps neither did the main character for the theft of two hours of my life. . Here are the embodiment of the anti-hero in "Do not regret We have this jerk, so messed up, so wandering around, selfish, unnecessary and unpleasant that it was very hard to go past the attraction of a promising son Blagodatnaya businessmen, Jaemin, if it was not just that: physical attraction . he says that otherwise it was love. but after watching this, as the likes of Charles Manson, because you dig the beard. (Okay, it's not so bad, but still no real repaid performance.) I I could never get past the reasons . Jaemin endless stalks Sumin It has never been shown, simply he said he loved Jaemin Sumin Maybe it is a culture thing that flew over my head.. Crazy / stalking = mad love on the Seoul This should be because a little more than half of the film is one annoying other, and the last part of the wings back and forth to the point I thought it was transformed into a screwball comedy. I was waiting for a tiger named "child" to make an appearance. Okay, so Sumin works two jobs, going to school, so far so good for someone trying to better themselves. But after his first taste of attracting his stalker, he gives his day job at some pimps. What? Well, well, as mentioned earlier, the obsession does not stop because of work / career change, and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie, where the incredible events just seem to occur without delay. The main film, not 100% horrible, but you can do better with foreign gay-themed movies.
