He got Christopher Lee, he received huge banks in 1970 computers, which make TeleType noise as there are letters on the screen, that is, radioactive isotopes, which are not only light in the darkness, but let pulsating thrumming noise, it is a volcano! Evil aliens disguised as a nun! tidal waves! Earthquake! exploding car! exploding coffee machines! and as the culmination of the entire planet explodes. How on earth does this film was able to be so incredibly, mind-numbingly Stupid? The answer, my friend, because 90% of the film consists of establishing shots, most of them involving long runs, pans or zooms in combinations, or from time to time, all three that do not do anything other than give the crew something to do. There are endless shots of our protagonists driving, getting in and out of cars, control again, walking around, looking at things, get into the car and driving ... I just sat there, watching the endless parade of nothingness into a stupor muttering "Say Anything please, someone, just say something ... do something ... anything! ... «<br /> <br /> dialogue, when it comes, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> "Maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than we do." was usually meaningless line. The script ends in the destruction of the World footage justified in this speech with Lee as the chief alien : <br /> <br /> "Earth produces great wealth of diseases, they pollute the universe. All the planets light years away will suffer if it is not destroyed! »<br /> <br /> This is a Neanderthal SF script writing. It is a kind of motivation you can find in a 1950 Japanese movie monster costume, designed for 7-year-olds. That, and I collect things, the most god-awful line from English SF film, as Buster Crabbe resign. I can not believe that this film was released in the same year as Star Wars and Close Encounters. <br /> <br /> Lee, who I've always wondered how smart, useful actor with a certain knowledge of its limits, it provides a line as if he was going to kill his agent to get it into the pile Drek. I do not blame him.
