Why do they insist on re-make of the big movies like «High Noon», «From Here To Eternity" and this? <br /> <br /> Why do they think that the color is more fun for the viewer than the stunning black and white? <br /> <br /> Why Robert insist on wearing that sluggish, broad-textured, a baseball cap? ... it made him look like Jim Varney. <br /> <br /> Why would anyone spend four o'clock suffer because of it? <br /> <br /> See the original. Then you do not have to ask yourself why.
