This happened because of attacks by the prophetic 13 in 2005, it happened because of Lost Boys in 2008, and now it had happened to another classic from the '80s Wargames ... :( Why, oh why, oh why does not Hollywood ever know? leave them alone! ... They can not be altered ...! They suck ....! We all hate them ....!. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have not seen the original 1983 version with Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy, go rent / purchase now .... !! the hardware may look outdated special effects is not new millennium, but it still beats the garbage hand down .... <br /> < br /> for those of us who yv during the 80s, when the hacking was sexy, the Internet was something mysterious and your wheels have come as a flexible variety of 8 ", and now we have the wisdom to avoid this film as in a thermonuclear war! <br /> <br /> Never before has "a good game of chess" seemed to be the best option ....
