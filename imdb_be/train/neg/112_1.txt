This film is simply awful. John Ritter makes Pratt falls, 75% of the actors who bring them up as if they were read from the card replicas, bad editing, mixing a terrible sound (dialogue is difficult to find in places above the background noise), and a story that really will not leaves. I do not think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten not the worst actress in the film. There are at least three others who suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with enthusiasm Ben Stein. I began to wonder what she died inside. Even children Bogdanovich terrible (the oldest, certainly reading her lines from cue cards). This movie is seriously awful. There's a reason Bogdanovic could not get another project to 4 years. Please do not look. If you see this in your TV listings, cancel cable. If one offers it to you to reconsider your friendship. If your husband wants to watch it, you better find another mate. I would like to poke my eyes out with a lawn dart than sit through this piece of garbage again. If I could sum up this film in one word, that word would be: Suckotrocity
