I saw this movie once, and I thought it was fine. Then my friends at work said, "Look again, it's better." So I did. And to my surprise, it was worse the second time! There's a word boundary, so I'm going to get the ball rolling here. <br /> <br /> -The bombing scene was so stupid. Why would anyone-WAIT, to cause an explosion ??? -No character here even remotely pretty. Not for the first time, not even the second. <br /> <br /> Oh, and last time I checked, the car does not explode from a single shot pistol, and can not fire a huge lean out of a tiny fire extinguisher ... made above 3/10 viewers actually watch a movie? ?? -The camera is so shaky, I can only say what is happening. This opening scene with the robot was my stomach quite simply, the rest of the film was not much better. <br /> <br /> -The sniper scene. McManus Brothers (from "The Boondock Saints") will roll their eyes, it was so stupid. Firstly, why the guy a gun factory, where one person was shot? Besides, why would he spend a lot of time cleaning the bullets, reloading, aiming, and not get a shot when there was so much chaos going on around him? Types -SAS RUNNING instead to stay and restraining ?????? Yes ????? And the soldiers ... gay ... ??? I do not want to sound homophobic, but frankly, the scene was so funny. <br /> <br /> Too long for its own good, but too small for the amount of material in beating him. Bigelow seems to think that the more action, the better. It looks like she's wrong- film full of unnecessary scenes thrown in there to distract you from the absence of a central site. I know Watchmen longer than 163 minutes, but at least this film does not drag. This film, on the other hand, does, and it feels longer. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was Renner, who was satisfactory at best. But do yourself a favor, just skip it and not give in to the hype.
