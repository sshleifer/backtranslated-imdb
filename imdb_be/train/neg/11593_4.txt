I believe that this film is one of the worst in a series of nightmare. It was so boring that I could not remember a thing 20 minutes after the film was finished, he even tires me to write a review about it. <br /> <br /> Well, # 4 was a joke, and Freddie was a joker. # 5 was trying to return to the roots of the series. It was darker and more atmospheric than the Nightmare 4, which is a good thing, basically. They tried to remove a horror movie instead of comedy. Unfortunately, they forgot to add intrigue and horror stories. Because of this nightmare 5: The Dream Child is neither funny, nor is it terrible. What we actually get is a boring film with the usual bad actors (with the possible exception of Lisa Wilcox). <br /> <br /> The plot (Freddy killing friends Lisa using dreams unborn baby Lisa) has a good base, but it's just not enough for 90 minutes of the film. Sometimes the story gets very confusing (maybe because I do not have one), and you can not stop wondering what the filmmakers were aimed at. The script should have more holes than Swiss cheese, and so the film was very cheese itself (let me say that I do not like cheese, though, even if I'm from Switzerland). Even the special effects were not as good as, for example, in part 4. <br /> <br /> It is not necessary to rent / buy this movie if not for the sake of completeness, it is quite a mess. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 4/10 (get used to it, # 6 and dirty one ...)
