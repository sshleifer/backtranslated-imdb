I've seen a lot of horror shows over the years, as the Nightstalker, that it was a Wendigo legend, so I'm looking forward to beating the malicious spirit, to add flavor to the season of Halloween. Man was I wrong. The entire film creates this sense of events happen that would be scary and horrible, but then delivers a very simplistic tale of revenge and murder due to the loss of some property. Ve-ry scary - no! This film has a lot to do with the Cold Creek Manor, the other general failure. <br /> <br /> It's getting harder and harder to believe everything that Hollywood horror releases, as they rarely come through with something original and ghosts more What idiots pay for a fictitious film to make? Go back to the drawing board guy, and do something useful with the millions of greenbacks you have to throw around.
