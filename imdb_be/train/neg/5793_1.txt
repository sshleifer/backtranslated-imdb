It really was that bad. Along with (fortunately!) The short-lived television series «Dirty Dozen», which starred Ben Murphy and was made around the same time (and cheaply in Yugoslavia). <br /> <br /> I was embarrassed for the actors of the film - and Savalas in particular. He was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role (pushing 70 when he made this garbage), and reviewer who draws parallels with Telly in the Greek and John Wayne in the "Green Berets" pretty much sums it up. <, Br /> <br /> Other observers point out some of the many jewels of laughable that this is a crime against celluloid contains, so I will not repeat them here. But I will add that I am surprised that no one has ever even mentioned ridiculously tiny-looking helmet, Savalas wears on his big, swollen head. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised that it Trainwreck film is rated as high as 4.7 here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> As far as I understand, is "1" right across the board if you want a good example of why the franchise flogging to death is really a bad idea (especially more than 20 years after the original.) - not to look more than «The Dirty Dozen - fatal Mission». <br /> <br /> The Awful - avoid !!!!
