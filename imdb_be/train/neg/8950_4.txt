I heard about this novel for a long time, many of my friends recommended me to read it. I was looking for it anywhere, and finally found it. This is a book that everyone should read, because it is a genius, and because of his vision. I enjoyed every page. <br /> <br /> I knew about this movie and can not wait to see it. When I finally I was very disappointed with many things in the book is not in the movies (I do not think it's a spoiler), which just makes the film is not logical ... Michael Radford can be a good director, but a bad writer. Especially the book of the adopter. The film is not dark at all, writing is really bad, the only thing that is good, even excellent, is an action. John Hurt terrific actor and the only person that I saw, as Winston Smith. <br /> <br /> What angers me the most are the people in IMDb, who called it "the best adaptation EverÂ», even without reading the book! Or not knowing anything about the screen for writing! <br /> <br /> You can only understand the brilliance of history, after reading the book, do not consider this as an alternative. As a supporter of the book, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> things that I have given to this film goes to the action.
