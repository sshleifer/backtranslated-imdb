From the plot and movement point of view, this movie was terrible. I found myself looking at the clock in the theater in the hope that this is the end, and released after 80 long minutes, he graciously did. Basically, there are five characters in the film, the son and the father, the son of a friend, and the two male characters in the age of his son, which appear and then disappear without context or interpretation. The film and the scene seemed to offer homo-eroticism, but nothing actually happened to show it anyway. There were a few bright scenes. At the beginning of the film, the son of a friend shows up in the window outside my room, and they are involved in a strange conversation. Photos and actor gave an incredible seduction interaction between them, ending her admitting to have another person who was "older." The end of this story.
