In fact, everything in this film looks like they want to be anywhere else! Not surprisingly, the cast is made not on the left side, not at all. I have nothing worse than Natascha McElhone impersonating a agent carrying a weapon not seen. You can not use a spoiled city child look in such a role. Worse, I can imagine, casts Doris Day as a prostitute. The rest of the cast is also terrible, perhaps with Hurt as the only exception, sometimes you can see how he tries, but suffering. Oh, did I mention that it's completely crazy story? It endangers many people's lives, because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, it must be because the guy (Weller) German? <br /> <br /> 2/10, because the picture could be worse.
