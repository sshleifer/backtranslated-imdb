I actually saw this movie at the cinema so in its original version. It was painful to watch Peter Sellers bother so bad. The story was incredibly lame and hard to follow, and the ending was funny. It was just sad to see how the powerful fall. I will not say that I'm a big fan of Peter Sellers, but I thoroughly enjoy the series of Pink Panther, and I felt that it gave good results in being there. But this film never had. From what I've read, he went on to produce the film against the advice of the people around him. Okay, but that does not excuse the studio actually produce the film.
