This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The only positive thing I can say, it was so bad that it seemed comical. Firstly, there is no plot. The actors seem to read cribs and do dumb things. Such as being chased by dead people, but still wants to go out and look for my friends. In addition, the zombies were terrible, no where near as fun as any work of Romero, who receives her fork in the film. And a dull part of all was they continued to show flash video sequence of actions. As we do not get a video game about shooting zombies. In addition, all 20-something, as some know how to use automatic weapons and hit the target even directing the gun. And the way people die so stupid. This is how they run out of ammo so stand and wait to be overcome on. And if cornered in front of the house, they run out of ammunition instead of shooting the door open, so dumb <br /> <br /> The verdict :. If any of these actors appear in another film, they were blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst film I've seen in years. A B-movie on Cinemax better.
