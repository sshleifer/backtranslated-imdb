The final score ... who cares - it's a reality show. He has no love for his audience, he indulges viewers lazy, does not put nothing in and nothing gets out. <br /> <br /> «Joe Millionaire," the most overtly fake reality show of all, television is a disaster of epic proportions. This watershed moment balancer, not just Fox |, but for the American public view, that actually look like and talk about this shit the next day. You people should be ashamed. Because just as Fox promotes this garbage will not make any money if it does not look at people (and boy was it, the final number almost got Super Bowl?). It does not bother you people that there are many high-quality show written, directed, acted and in general the efforts made by them, which were canceled while you sit and lap up is easy, cool game show? <br /> <br /> I used to be a staunch supporter of Fox. It is those of us who, as I like and find as the TV, which helped build the Fox back in the days of Married ... with Children and The Simpsons. Conveniently enough, and now none of this show was to do it in 6 weeks with the current management. Gail Berman "Terror," as it is often called. Network led war on TV scenario and, oddly enough, it is the fans. The same people who helped to build them in the beginning. Now we not only have to fight for a good show, but we have to fight against its own network. It boggles the mind. Nothing Fox made sense in the past 3 years. The cancellation of such hits as "Titus," "Futurama" and "John Doe" (NBC can restore «Boomtown», but Fox can not lift his miserable head to give the only decent show they had another shot this season? ) And the reason that they can do it all:. success junk like "Joe millionaire" Now they can say. "we do not need you TV fans, we have a reality show," they apparently seem to have not. no idea that a large audience drawn from this junk is impermanent and leaves them second oddity comes next. In order to push at its base, as this will eventually kill the network, in which, as it is set back to ABC. <br /> <br /> themselves show jokes. Here we have a room, now classic Fox gimmick that promises us something something different and edgy, but then delivers that something is in any way different from «the Bachelor» or something on the big 3. Fox has gone mainstream. Final and the "twist" (quote / unquote) indicated that they NO sleeve ideas. Now we know that all these shows, no matter how different they look, not all end up the same cornball, fairy-tale ending. We got to see a bunch of lame aspiring actors the network picked from millions of head shots to fit their demographic parade around like high school, pretending that they only girls like Evan Marriott, because ... well, because it was a competition and this is what you should do. Marriott himself like a badly disfigured CHRO-Magnum man who struggled to gather the most simple sentences. But how can women (all by an average of ugly looking, by the way - an important negative guilty pleasure show like this) do not fall for the "Joe" with such magical lines like, "Listen, you're not crazy" <br. /> <br /> I used to think that people who are watching this reality / dating / game shows were just out of laziness to change the channel, but after "Joe Millionaire" I think they should really be mentally inferior. Come on people, have a little more pride in yourself. Demand a little more from your entertainment, you know. <br /> <br /> The boycott FOX.
