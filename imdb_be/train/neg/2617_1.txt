This film was pure pain. Sitting in the theater x number of minutes, I was wondering if the movie is going to start. All the constellations were in place; a typical love story, the heroes must overcome their short supply, the villain should appear, but none of them had ever initiated. By the time this happened, I was bored stiff and devices have been completely ineffective. In scenes that require great exertion and accumulation, it felt like the necessary staff have been cut. baby things should not be. Children's films can be both riveting and engaging as the adult ones. Justification, "hey, his children," Bull. I'll take the "Sword in the Stone" on any given day. It was awful. I get the feeling that Disney put anything these days. As for the children, 10-year-old I've seen it with the ... pure junk.
