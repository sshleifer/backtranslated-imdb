I have always been delighted with the period drama, an art form in which the BBC has succeeded in the past. This presentation of "Byron" was unbelievable. Incredible bad! The script was terrible, uninspired acting, and all the characters are very tasteless. Apparently Byron was "mad bad and dangerous to know", and set the lady of the heart all a-flutter. Not in this production. There he appeared as insipid insolent small syringe instead of a fiery character and the women of the Greek struggle for independence. It is said that Byron was limping. This is an image just to limp all over. <br /> <br /> I've watched as much as two and a half hours waiting for something to spark into life. Nha crack, not even a glimmer. It was full of anguish when not just nostalgia, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> With the belief that no one will ever be better than the Bard of Avon, I also think that the poetry of Byron, is extremely honored and my mind should be thrown into the background, and it is a dramatization of his life should be given a the same treatment. <br /> <br /> I think that the BBC has lost its LEO with this
