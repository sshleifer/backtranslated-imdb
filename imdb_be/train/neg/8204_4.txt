Aftermarket, too predictable and only mildly entertaining low budget rehash of sci-fi formula, we've all seen hundreds of times - a group of scientists in the isolation faced by some unknown alien something, and in all places (surprise, surprise!) Antarctica <br /> <br /> James Spader in the film and almost nameless supporting cast (with the exception of Carl Lewis, which is actually not too bad for the Sun actor) - who deliver ho-hum performances, which do little to revive the presentation of the dialogue script. To make things worse, the film's pace is slow, almost no plot, and are more action sequences stereotyped and not so interesting. It is not surprising that this thing went straight to DVD. What is surprising, why Spader - sometimes a great actor, who won the Cannes best actor for `Sex, Lies, and Videotape" and did an excellent job in the innovative fantasy film `Stargate" - decided to sign this dull project. Or maybe not, if you look at his career, because it seems that he has invested his talents in more misses than hits. <br /> <br /> The great thing about `Alien Hunter», how they managed to cram in as many elements of the many great science fiction films, and so far, it will turn out so lethargic and unnatural. There are huge borrowed bits from `The Thing" (Howard Hawks original and John Carpenter's 1982 remake of the fine), 'Contact' and 'flares'; few hints' Alien 'CE3K', `The Andromeda Strain ',` `2001' Kubrick (ie` strange black box ') and` Mission To Mars' (that is, the secret message); and even a little shooting gallery `and` sneakers great mind" (though not science fiction movies, they have svyaz` cryptology "). Heck, there is even the fields and Antarctica, as well as the recent `X Files Movie». And the light translucent spaceship at the end is exactly the same as that taken out Outtake from `The Abyss'. <br /> <br /> It's all been done before, and did much better, although I admit that there were a few mild surprises until the end. I could say a bit more about the story, but there is absolutely no need. You already know more than half of this film without seeing it. (5 of 10)
