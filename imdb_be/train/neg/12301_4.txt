Oh my ... bad clothes, worse and worst synth music: David Hasselhoff. In 80 back with double force in Witchery, US-Italian coproduction, helmets for the infamous Joe DAmato side and short production careered director (Thank heavens for small wonders) Fabrizio Laurenti uncut. Sold as a kind of continuation of the series Evil Dead Sam Raimi in Italy (which was called «La Casa» there), Witchery provides some modest blood gore groceries and bad action. <br /> <br /> The combination of ghost stories, possession and sorcery film bounce ignorant of the stage to the other without giving some serious wooden actor and a fun day and night entanglement slow its progress expectable endings, topped with some serious WTF surprise climax. (I just love the look on her face ...) Surprisingly Laurenti manages to gather some suspension and anger in the air a few - very few - stages; Unfortunately for him, a few glimpses of the soft magic of cinema to go down quickly and efficiently. <br /> <br /> plus side have a great experience when the blood hit the fan. This department is very efficient and interesting in this classic latex paint and red style of the 80 Italian-gore when they were made 100% handmade and how shocking and bright as modest budgets could afford. I could only watch with sadistic joy and laughters few more top-ways, disgusting characters (and actors) got distorted and wrong, one after the other. I just felt sorry for Linda Blair, who, apparently, are not released to try any other than the good old devil girl / woman role ever in his career, or so it seems, checking his filmography. <br /> <br /> Well, people - not much more to say, and even less to say about the home. Do not expect too much when spending a rainy day with this, and perhaps you will feel at least some mild pleasure. It also helps if your rotten little heart pound to the beat of the euro gore horror 80s. And if we talk about the heart - every movie that has David Hasselhoff getting skewered on a substantial piece of metal and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors, should have this one in the right place <br /> <br /> This is my truth. - what is yours?
