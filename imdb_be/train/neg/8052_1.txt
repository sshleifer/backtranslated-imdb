In the midst of the storm, the wind strong enough to blow the windows out of the house, but the trees in the background completely vertically instead of moving letter! In fact, if the characters are outside the house, bright sunlight can be seen illuminating the treetops. At that point, what would the filmmakers developed the confidence evaporates faster than highly localized rain in their film. Too bad all the hurricanes do not like this, it will definitely help our homeowners insurance rate here in the Sunshine State.
