Larger and reflect well on Canada's landscapes. The story was on the other hand, it is sad; In my eyes, it was a love story in the forest as well as the Titanic was a love story on a boat. I did not feel that great gray owl was a great environmentalist. I usually like Lord Attenborough, but this was ... bad.
