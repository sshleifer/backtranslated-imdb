Earth views that statements in this movie were fake NASA recently compared with historical weather data during the Apollo 11, and show a good match between the cloud in a video sequence and the actual rainfall records per day. <br /> <br /> It would blow up the whole argument put forward in the film, that the film "all the earth" is actually a small part of the planet the spacecraft window frame. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for Bart Sibrel still argues that historical data were falsified by NASA conditions, although it will undoubtedly attract them and replace each archived copy of a newspaper with a weather map, and those in private hands will continue to be a problem <br /> <br /> Oh, the answer is: ". Trying to discredit the film, referring to NASA weather data, I'd say it's charming, but a weak and gullible argument What about the rest of. footage and evidence in the film? a wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels. Is there any way to feel that perhaps it is possible to apply to what you are trying to do here? :-) This movie is simply packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim made by the US government once that month mission to succeed, and that people now are the true masters of the universe. Things are not nearly never quite what they seem .. Just watch the movie and I dear say that you will see things a bit different than before. "<br /> <br /> First, weather data 'and does not come from NASA's, we are talking about Et agencies around the world. Secondly, weather data undermines the main claim in the film. third, not "packed with irrefutable evidence", the remaining claims in the film were carefully debunked. Sibrel thought he was previously a secret piece of film, so he edited and added his own interpretation. Unfortunately ment for him, his sources of the film is in the public domain, and Sibrel bits cut contradict his claims.
