The slow, tedious, and one measuring wheel! Good casting cliched dialogue, boring storyline, and soulless direction from Mr. Marshall! Traditional and predictable story of the most famous forms of prostitution from the Asian continent, not enough heart, new ideas and depth. The main character looks at the place because of its tiny phisique and fake-looking contact lenses. Lexicon hired geisha sounds forced and a bit too complicated for them a limited impact on the ways of education. The history continues for several hours trying to convince you that a small, dull, flat torso Asian girl is the ultimate geisha, they actually say in the movie "It is destined to become a legend," I say tough case! The film is just boring, it's nice to look at, it has very little interesting moments, as many as you can find by going for cigarretes. Basically, if you do not believe the messenger you are not sure that the message, and this girl is not filled with shoes! Borin, sad, miss it!
