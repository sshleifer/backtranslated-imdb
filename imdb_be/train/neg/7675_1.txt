You can ever say that there are some movies that have no opportunity or would have to buy it? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After helming terrible "House of the Dead" director Uwe Boll is now cast less than talented eye to yet another video game adaptation. Do not these guys get it? For those who can not understand the letters printed here for you: a video game does not make for a good movie! Act here, in the best case, sub-standard. Set and poor special effects. Unlike video games (which really had its scary moments) film has the atmosphere of hopelessness, no sense of danger or threat. Pacing and sketch confused and paper, printed on the script would be better to use as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses a camera with grace and agility of a monkey with a brush. Beaten zooms, pans raids and spliced ​​the whole sad business in unpredictable moments, leaving the audience disoriented and sad. Why this guy could afford next film set in the first place should stand as one of modern cinema's greatest mysteries. Avoid at all costs.
