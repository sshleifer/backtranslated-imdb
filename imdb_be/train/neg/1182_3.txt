This film is a little more than a poorly done, fetish porn, and that says a lot, considering the kind of shit that was done in that era. It was recommended to me by a friend as "a unique experience of the film." He was right. I believe he meant that as a joke. Not disgusting, not even that shocking. Only the mediocre and bad actions sample percussion art. Bit through the camp, although I do not think that the creators of this film is done deliberately. And so, as the previous reviewer mentioned, it's sex with a guy in a bear suit. Do not spend much money on it. Try to take it when you have to see it. Or contact with me, I would be happy to sell you a copy for half the price. <br /> <br /> I may have seen one of the films of this particular film director, since he seems to have a certain following. But if it's something like that, I'm sorry again for another 2 hours of my life is gone forever.
