First, lead, Brad Dourif is KOOK. If you're trying to take this movie seriously, I guarantee that it's going to ruin it for you. If you do not take it too seriously, it's actually kind of fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) Dourif and declare their love for each other - between dodging the jets of fire flames from his hands in the car. Another great scene mannerisms watched John Landis as snotty producer of radio shows get toasted and rotation around the room. In fact, I found that the last 15 minutes of the film, to be a non-stop laugh riot - I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper means that it will be so.
