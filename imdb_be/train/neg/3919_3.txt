This film is not as good as everyone thinks. low-level actors and the story is very like the comic. I respect the fantasy, but fantasy The Lord of the Rings ... Conan..is fantasy ... IT JUST NORMAL HK-LOWPRICE-ENTERTAINMENT ... Why did they include the Splatter-language, it makes everything worse. The only good thing is the cinematography and the work of the cutter.
