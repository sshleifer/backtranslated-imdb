If a film like "The Dukes of Hazzard" brings more than $ 75 million, which makes some incredibly boring statements about the state of our society. Either we all too stupid to keep away from garbage, as it may be, or I just do not understand how many people this kind of non-waste efforts will appeal to. <br /> <br /> Hollywood had no incentive to make good movies, as if to put out the garbage, people will see it anyway, because there is nothing else on the screen. It is that. I went out, despite getting a free movie pass. Dialogue can not be more stupid. Tricks can be more over-the-top and defiant. Perhaps it is "more than that great" branding calls for the Texans, but it did not appeal to me, nor anyone else in the theater. None of the "big names" have not been in this career end Flick for Burt Reynolds, who says all you need to hear, except for Jessica Simpson -. Do not tell me <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film to video, even if you are desperate .. It's all about fooling the public, to make enough money after the opening day of the equal or better than it's worth through marketing. They did, in spite of the public It is warned. Stupidity in abundance.
