I can not believe that I am wasting my time watching this garbage! I did because Maltin gave him «AA» rating, and for-TV movies is usually a reliable indicator of some quality entertainment. <br /> <br /> The action was good, but the one who wrote it should be permanently refused access to any communication environment. The plot is absurd, prompting the "bad guys" is completely absent, and a variety of family interaction stupid and shallow. For example, the Pope preaches that a violent reaction to the aggression of bad, but it turns out to be a "great" man not because of his "ignore idiots" philosophy, but because he's very good with his fists ... <br /> < br /> The only message that I was able to extract from this mess is that the nuclear family of good and bad alternative mechanisms of life. Oh, and bad people happen to good people.
