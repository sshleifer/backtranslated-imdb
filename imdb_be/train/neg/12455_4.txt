I remember watching it in prime time, when I was about 7 years old. I've been a huge comic books at the time, and all associated with superheroes is difficult to expect. The end result, however, was destroyed. <br /> <br /> I knew about "Emma Peel" Diana Prince's stories, as they have only recently come to an end, and Diana returned to form the Amazon. However, there was so little action, I was bored throughout most of the film. The final suit was an interesting idea, but it looked like a cheerleader than a superhero. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie again in my late teens. It has not improved. Cathy Lee Crosby was more familiar, thanks to the incredible, but its effect was not better. The script had some good ideas, like Amazon rogue, and a decent villain in Montalbane, but it just did not come together and still sad. <br /> <br /> I think that they should have built a back story better, and built the show in a more epic climax. It was too much like a soft spy movie, crossed with a superhero story written by someone who has never seen a comic book. Amazon elements were intriguing, but needs to be expanded. <br /> <br /> The film succeeded in forcing manufacturers to get back to the drawing board and come up with something more true, if a bit too camp and a low budget, the budget was also quite low here, and a superhero is not cheap. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to have the film is available on DVD, if only as a reference and historical document. Even Superman 4 is available, and it has nothing about this film (besides Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It is worth seeing for the sake of curiosity and a bit of inspiration and protection for future versions.
