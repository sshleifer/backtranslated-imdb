Hard times for Angel Town, gang rule with an iron fist, and for reasons mostly unknown (mainly due to the heavy sheet) gangs want Homeless, Martine joined the band, so they beat him every day. However, due to the presence of the Olympic kick-boxer (Olivier «Lamest actor in the world» Gruner) named Jacques, hope on the way. Angel Town is seriously one of the most mediocre films ever made Messaging (And I've seen my share), it seems, is the idea that all the gang infested areas of need, the French kick-boxers who can not act. Worst of all there are so many awkward moments is just really fun. It is best derived from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon, which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing. To Wit:?! "You, as the battle (Olivier grabs his Asian best in Headlock one) I could kill him right if I want him to die, he dies reason why I do not want him to die, because I am afraid of him, and I know that if I was going to kill his son and wife will kill me, that's why he does not die! "<br /> <br /> Of course, the fact that it is wrong to kill someone, do not mention your best friend, of course, left out of the equation. Strange. <br /> <br /> However, do not let me make this sound that I hated this film, far from it, it is so terrible, that's priceless. The biggest laughs come at the end in a catastrophic finale, which sees Grunner coming face to face with a gang member, which (more logic film rupture) renounce the use of guns. In addition, a disabled Vietnam veteran helps shooting his machine gun at the gang, while Gruner kick boxing remaining. All this set the sound horrible "Mexican" accents and surreal energy that make it a memorable one for fans of cinematic garbage like this. <br /> <br /> Other sweets about this film is that, for whatever reason, Gruner never attends college, despite that the main reason he is here in the states, but not in France, receiving his with his girlfriend (at the cemetery in an uncomfortable beginning of the film) Angel Town, without a doubt, a failure at all conceivable levels, but if you laugh at the idiotic martial arts movies with insane levels of performance that make no sense on any level, it is perfect movie for you. On the other hand, be sure to down tequila seem ridiculous opening part song, "Do not grace in Angel Town» <br /> <br /> * with 4 (Poor)
