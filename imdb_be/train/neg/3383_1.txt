I first saw a live musical in Denver Performing Arts Center, and it was absolutely mind-blowing, stunning and had such a fantastic story and continuity of dialogue, which I liked a lot more than most musicals I have ever seen on stage. The interesting thing is that you should never see the face of Zack. He was always in the dark, but his presence was strong and led the direction of the entire production. Whe I heard that they were making a movie of it, I waited with bated breath, but when I watched the film version, I was so bummed out disappointed that I felt like I was deceived. The film lacks the exciting mood set in direct production and it never lets you completely in close contact with each symbol. Personally, I would like to see a live version again, and if anything needs to be revived, I would heartily recommend that you get out of your way to see it. This will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy.
