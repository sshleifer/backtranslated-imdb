This film is so bad, I can not believe it's actually shot. People who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7, you crazy? Are we watching the same movie? Or sh ** I have to say. All the bad in this film. The history (story?) In nowhere, completely unintelligible acting (some conversations quite simply ridiculous), score (that **** is that?), Editing, and especially the art direction, the net disaster. Reminds me of the old movies Macist ... To give you an example of amateurism production mermaid costume is a sleeping bag with sequins pasted on it. I'm not kidding, this is exactly what <br /> <br /> Another example of the huge mistakes that we find here :. You see in the scene extra fat woman of about 200 pounds, which is talking on her cell phone. The next shot, which is in full elsewhere, you can see the same woman, still talking on his cell phone (!) Yes, it goes so far. <br /> <br /> big, huge waste of money. Useless.
