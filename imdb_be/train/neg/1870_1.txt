I always like to score because of its great script and characters, but lately I feel like she turned into an emotional type of soap. If you look at the advertising images / bill posters Now you will see two of the officers or hugging / kissing Do something to do with friendship, while the promotional photos of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with the crime. This proves that he has changed a lot from that, it is absolutely strange to the average police drama such as television soap. When I look at it I feel that I look at the police version of Coronation Street or something like that. I must say that I still like the bill as I am interested in police work and that sort of thing, but I really miss the greatness that Bill used to have. I want to rate it as a 2 out of ten, because you have to admit that it was completely destroyed by people who took the bill. <br /> <br /> As for the script and the characters they both went down the slope, most of the great symbols of gone now (although some of them still remain, I think), and I'm not saying that the new characters that poor whether either because they certainly are not, it's just that they do not have rigid attitudes, identity and line of the script that all the old symbols, which are used to be, because most of the new currently involved with stupid relationships and family troubles. <br /> <br /> as a whole is one of the few police programs on TV these days, Bill will always be crappily interesting thing to see, but as I said it lost many of its uniqueness (if that is the right spelling ) and is now classified as a scary, surreal TV soap. <br /> <br /> encouraged to monitor laugh at the stupidity of the police - 2/10
