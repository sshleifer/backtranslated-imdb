Not as bad as you've heard. There are actually some funny parts and Affleck and Applegate have pretty good chemistry. Applegate, in particular, is attractive and likable as Affleck's love interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are complete professionals. They are very good at just about everything. In the end, "Survival" is not the worst holiday movie you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is out of focus, and much of the comedy compulsively. Attempts black humor come off as Dour. Affleck is trying his best to be a loving and spastic an overenthusiastic, but comes across as broken. cartoon character of his hero is brought into high relief when viewed next to Gandolfini and more muted, believable performances O'Hara. Even by the standards of cinema relaxed holiday, you never fully bought in Afflka "rent" a family setting for X-MAS. <br /> <br /> There are also scenes that border on the surreal in their singularity, mas eve scene is replete with humor incestuous (son appears, looking at the naked, provocative photographs of his mother) that is not only believable if funny but anxious. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the colors in the movie dull, almost noirish. The house is located where most of the film takes place looks unnatural and cheap. <br /> <br /> Â«Surviving" primarily of interest as the fourth row in cash NRB (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl, and this) for Affleck. It remains to see how lasting the damage will be.
