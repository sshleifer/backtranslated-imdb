This movie has a few things going for it right away. With Dani Filth as the lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie. The truth is, I love Cradle of Filth and listened to the soundtrack for this film, long before I watched it. Dani Filth is very well-known character and make for a great lead. Independent film shooting style is perfect for a terrible factor. There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this film. For what a low budget, the special effects are not bad. Methods that are dead people were very creative and nightmarish. <br /> <br /> Now for the cons. There is very little to say throughout this movie that does very little, as far as character development. It's hard to fear for the life of a limp, static characters. When I was little conversation, F bomb was in abundance, it is in random places. Yes, I understand that people swear, but it seems to me, as in the pre-teen boy on the scenario and is considered myself cool to include all languages. Storyline that I could make of it was pretty good, although many details remain dangling and lack of conversation one often leaves wondering what was going on. <br /> <br /> In the end, the Cradle of fear looks like porn for people who like sex and violence, but as a porn trying to pull out of the storyline, it just does not work too well. Rent, though, if you're sick person who is looking to satiate your appetite blood and flesh.
