This film makes the Canadian and British, to be stupid, senile idiot. Men get a buzz / drunk, and then screams / beat each other in almost every scene. Women are superfluous in history ?? I do not understand that they are there ?? They spend every scene, causing noise or worse, crowded, as if hypnotized animals. Apparently, Canadian women quarrelsome or vulgar tramp or floppy hippie chicks. This is a standard disassembled to her friend, her loser boyfriend and his evil ludicrousness mother that we've seen in countless films before. <br /> <br /> Every character here is nitpicking, infantile stereotype. Not to mention the fact that they all looked like they were in need of a shower! And the idea of ​​any kind of scene, referring to sex with George Wendt ?? Chills ?? enough to make anyone gag! I watched the movie, because Samuel West was it ?? but I can not understand why he would accept the role as it is. Maybe he needed money. Ian Tracey is an excellent actor - just one of the uncertain redemptive moment, but his talent is wasted here <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the site ??. three degenerates trying to get his weed back ?? yawn - or Carl ?? who died and who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those who remained (almost like Rebecca Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece ?? although I am ashamed to even think to compare these two films), why even bother? Carl is so egregious that you have found the circumstances of his death, it is gratifying. <br /> <br /> By the end of this wretched film, I thought they were all better than going down with him on the boat!
