This low-budget spoof spy genre. In order to help formulate your expectations, you should know that: (1) The current wild heavy-handed. Stars that have great pleasure to deliver them up to excessive eye movement, frequent hand gestures, and from the pacemaker key. (2) The scenario deliberately lacks continuity and credibility. Oftentimes line sharply shaking and with a sense of humor, because they have absolutely no relation to the previous element of the plot. (3) The shots are often framed in the corners off-balance, poking fun at the excesses of the genre. (4) Lupato Jeff Goldblum provides a comprehensive and classical in a conversation charmingly sarcastic manner. <br /> <br /> The film has a guiding intelligence, deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from B-movies of the 1930s: the secret code with a structure that would not be explained Carl Sagan. over-the-top action of the film is mainly used for comic effect in the first 90 minutes. At the beginning of the town, the son of Fay Grim-Ned's so often said to leave you can not help laughing, feeling sorry for the guy. well-organized Autumn Parker Posey bed also helps to establish a humorous tone in the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> slow pacing of the film does not reinforce the elements of comedy or dramatic elements that occur later. The impact of the film as a drama substantially reduced at the beginning of the comedy. In addition, it is difficult to be too associated with the characters and their fates, when the first part of the film is so sarcastic. Score deliberately heavy-handed, and I have found it (and off-kilter camera angles) are more irritating than humorous. <br /> <br /> above the upper current, the fetched and almost inconceivable plot plots / plot counter, and slowly steps to grind many viewers. The film is too much for 158 minutes of time. <br /> <br /> However, fans that are susceptible to the sarcasm of the film may want to see again ... with the help of closed captioning to better catch the absurdity reasonable dialogue. The film was too slow for me, and sarcasm felt more powerful than a light-hearted. But comedy may well appeal to your taste. The film is worth a look for those who love independent films, directed by Hal supporter of Harley, or a devotee of Parker Posey (which is most of the time, the camera).
