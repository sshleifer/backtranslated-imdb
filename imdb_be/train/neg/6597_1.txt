It is much worse than the terrible Laurel and Hardy cartoons 60s. They were terrible, but at least they were just ripped off then Stan and Ollie revival. New audiences were once again a comedy genius and a pair of cartoons were heady waste sent to cash in on the interest of children. It was to be expected. But, as you can even try to rationalize this work ... I can not even think of a word. I am sure that the creators hoped it would somehow inspire more Laurel and Hardy revival, but you can not inspire interest in the past with small and unfunny cartoon that made the original so appealing. The Impressionists (I hesitate to call them the actor) make the act of Vegas and this is where she belongs. The plot is even flimsier, than those used in the old days, trying to stretch the idea of ​​two-reel function. If this film was someone's first contact with the real Laurel and Hardy, I'm sure the audience to dismiss the original duo's reputation as senile went to brawl. The only movie that I hate worse than I spit on your grave. And, you know, these filmmmakers basically did the same thing with Stan and Ollie.
