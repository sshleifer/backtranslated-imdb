Has anyone read the script. This must be some of the worst writing and directing the whole year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson could not pull this one out. About two-thirds thought Giamatti eyes said, I can not believe I signed a contract. This is not the worst film I've ever seen, but it is actually a very bad Christmas movies list. Not enough lines, but what else can I say? Well, the film simply does not move from the dialogue fraudsters Vaughn, his character just awful guy who you just can not get through. It was just a dull walk, that no one seemed to be able to get.
