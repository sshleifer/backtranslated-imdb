If this film had a budget of 20 million, I just wanted to know where the money went. The monkey can make the best effects CGI, what was lost for 3 hours at this awful piece of garbage, although I must admit, machinery and Martians would look really, really good on the original game station 1 game and the first game for PC since the mid 90s, when the game has ever been made. What confuses me what happened to the money? Pendragon films would make a great movie with a good old-fashioned models and computer-controlled camera a la George Lucas about 1975-83, and the actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing (or destroy in this case) about the same 20 million people. This is quite possibly the worst film ever made! I would like to sit through 24 hours of Ishtar repeat screening than watch this movie again. I hated it completely! I regress. I say this is the worst movie ever made, because unlike the other bad movies like Plan 9 or killer tomatoes, or Santa Claus will punish Martians are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them, you I love them. There is no love for this film and have no place in my DVD library for him. I sold it to a guy for a dollar. I put the money on the film has been spent on drinking and other vices for the cast and crew. Shame on you Pendragon movies! I want my money back!
