You may want to consider a few facts in the discussion, to be spoilers. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but Spielberg did not deserve to win any Oscar for this piece, and I think that the Academy was right in that vote. (Other Oscar nomination for best actor and such ... I do not know. But it would be difficult to justify, given that they were told to do and what you see in the final product.) The path Spielberg directs this so contrived so annoying. While watching this movie distinction made during the cinema as an art, of course I took was shouting at me: "The mood is fairly honest emotion sentiment to nausea and unreal false picture of life.". This over-the-top sentimentality. If in real life to two people ever start reading out loud in sync, and Celia and Shug Avery done sitting on the bed, touching letters from Nettie they found? There are examples of this type of artificial behavior throughout the film: all the men crowded around the car Miss Millie, and then jumping in unison, like a flock of birds takes off when it comes to drive away; Kharp fall through the roof of various buildings, he works for (slapstick gag); the whole party of revelers that are sent from Jook Joint in droves chapel as if magically charmed by the singing of the choir ... and beyond. Nothing sounds plausible. I even thought that HARPO name was chosen deliberately because it was his wife's real name Sofia, "Oprah" in the opposite direction. Spielberg is not above such a "charm." <br /> <br /> This is not something that Spielberg is not able to honestly rendered actions and emotions. Schindler's List was amazing, deeply touching me, and I admire Saving Private Ryan also for realism, even if the story is a little unnatural.
