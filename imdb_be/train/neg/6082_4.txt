Although there are many "television" associated with "a man named Sonny" familiar names, there is nothing unusual in the film or on any performances. In fact, the only thing that distinguishes it from the television series of the 1960s-70s as «The Rat Patrol» is a cast, and more violence. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the biggest star and seemed to think that he should try to break away from all light comedy thing he did ( "Maverick," "Support Your Local Sheriff" - "shooter" and etc.). Unfortunately, his earthy likability working against him, how dreary it Sani character is written to cash in on the popularity of spaghetti western character of Clint Eastwood. But Eastwood's stuff was not that flat and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> I believe that "A man named Sled" can be classified as spaghetti westerns although walk too slowly to match exactly this subgenre. Supporters of the slow paced "Combat" TV series will feel an instant connection, Vic Morrow directed the film and co-wrote with Frank Kowalski. Throw in some fashion can then slowly shots and cross dissolves that require attention, and not serve to narrate. <br /> <br /> The plot is the standard "big rip-off" thing (insert "The War Wagon" here) Sanya plotting how Heist $ 300,000 in gold shipment. His gang includes Claude bard and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that while on the move cargo guarded 40 riders and during the stop it is locked in the safe inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" with the same story. <br /> <br /> The story will make a decent hour of television, but boring very quickly, like a very soft full-length film. Garner does not allow any of his charm to seep into his characteristic, and the film does not produce enough suspense to keep interest. <br /> <br /> viewer fact, finally, falls and burns shortly after the robbery, when the gang engaged in a contrived and utterly illogical card game. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
