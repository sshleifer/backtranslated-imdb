Live! Yes, but not your feet <br /> <br /> The real story :. Some time ago, a Dutch television channel made a statement that they were going to air a new reality show. The contest soon. The main participant of the show will be a woman who was dying of something terrible, and it will be donating her kidney to one lucky person with progressive renal failure. For real. <br /> <br /> In the country and the international media have been all over this story like flies on dung, saying that it was horrible, immoral, what-is-this-world to the next, and so on n. , In a sense, I had to agree. <br /> <br /> As the months passed, the tension built up to such an extent that the government is mainly engaged in the question of whether they should let this show go ahead or not, instead of running the country. <br /> <br /> show did air and up to the last moment, when they were pushing forward. And until recently the country was in the hands of Prime speeches, all the newspapers wrote about it, everyone in the country with bated breath. And he pushed the network. Towards a new frontier in television. And they certainly managed to do just that. They pushed the envelope. <br /> <br /> The show on the air, and we all watched the terminally ill woman choosing the right candidate to receive her kidney so that he or she will live until she dies shortly afterwards. <br /> <br /> And then, in the last minutes of the show it became clear that it was a partial deception. The woman was not sick, but all the candidates. There was no auction kidneys. All show that, with advertising and commercials and all the discussions, was built in a few months to a fantastic climax was a publicity stunt to draw attention to the problem of shortage of donor organs in the main. The man who founded this particular network he died of kidney disease. <br /> <br /> Now it's television. Leaving behind all perplexed. <br /> <br /> Do not let me badly acted, poorly directed film about a woman trying to get Russian roulette show on US television. <br /> <br /> As once. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * As if I'm going to assume that they would have received it through the FCC. As if I believe to get through the US Supreme Court on the basis of free expression. As if I'll believe ridiculous ending, where the woman pulled her conscience and my problems, because some guy shot himself in the air. <br /> <br /> All of this has been done before. See Running Man with Arnold instead. At least it was a good end of the floor. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * This terrible bad piece of film, along with a funny ending. So she gets a shot in the end, it should make us a movie going public feel better after we leave the theater, because there was some kind of justice? Do not take my word for it, but I would say: leave it alone and watch the test pattern instead, you will get more money.
