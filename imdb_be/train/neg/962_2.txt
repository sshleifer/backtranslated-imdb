Most likely, if I watched this time I could get physically sick, the movie is so annoying ..... if you do not believe in psychics, reincarnation and other hocus- pocus which it contributes to the big time. "Again, the cycle of souls," they call it here. Puh-leeze. <br /> <br /> This story has been done several times before with such films as «Heaven Can Wait.» This was also done much better. it is a pity that they had to be exchanged, Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, and Mary Stuart Masterson. <br /> <br /> at least, this is pretty tame film, language-wise. this is about the only saving quality of this film.
