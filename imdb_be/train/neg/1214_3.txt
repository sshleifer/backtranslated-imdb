A friend once asked me to read the script of his, which was Optioned at the studio. To say that it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts I'd ever read a bold humiliation. However, I never told him about it. Why? Because in a world where such films as "While it was not" may be given the green light and attract Oscar winning stars like Kim Besinzher, the script lacks character, content and common sense is not a guarantee that it will not will sell. <, Br /> <br /> Like many other reviewers have noted, "While it was not" it is terrible under-written by a woman in Peril, a film that has abused housewife Basinger hunted four unlikely hoods before Christmas. Each is a legitimate gripe, from weak dialogue and a bad effect on the superior logic of failures, but such an interesting actress Basinger and the room is not unpromising. Here are a few things that struck me: <br /> <br /> 1) I do not care how much we have to think her husband is a jerk, house mess with toys. Because when he was child abuse that children pick up after themselves? <br /> <br /> 2) a variety of racial gang rare everywhere except in Hollywood where they are, as a rule, only a racially balanced group on the screen. <br /> <br /> 3) Of course, the film is dull. But since it is numerous "thrillers" I sat through where women are portrayed as crying, helpless victims of male sadism. Silly or not, I found it nice to see a woman gets the best of her tormentors. <br /> <br /> 4) I loved the ending! <br /> <br /> 5) Although an early reviewer coined this phrase, I do think that this movie should be renamed the "Red Toolbox Doom."
