Man pot roast Joe Don Baker (Mitchell) star in this dull, unremarkable `action 'movies as a substitute Jeronimo, fat, carbonated slush, who sits around in a bad looking cowboy suit, listening to country music, and eating too many donuts. Meanwhile, it is unclear offender guy named Palermo (played by a guy who owned a drill in the villages FULCI Hell) stumbles into the territory of Joe Don and shoots the sheriff in a poorly edited stage. Joe Don-slowly- gives chase and off brother Palermo after delivering his legendary catch phrase `This is your step. I think you can take me? Well, go ahead. For some reason, Joe Don, Lawman Texas, should be transported Palermo, Italy ( `Mr. Palermo was a major source of confusion of the Italian government, says Mr. Wilson, another vague plays Bill McKinney, who was in the MASTER NINJA 1, she played, and a lot of good Clint Eastwood's films). <br /> <br /> Anyhoo, Joe Don plane should land on the island of Malta, where Palermo escapes with briefcase and the guy who looks like Jon Lovitz. And this is where the movie grinds to a halt. For the rest of the film, Joe Don is looking for Palermo, Palermo loses, in the end, in a prison cell, like shouting to the head of the Maltese police and then released with a warning not to seek more than Palermo. Then Joe Don continues to look for Palermo, Palermo loses, in the end, in a prison cell, like shouting to the head of the Maltese police and then released with a warning not to seek more than Palermo. Then Joe Don seeking Palermo, Palermo loses, in the end, in a prison cell, like shouting to the head of the Maltese police and then released with a warning not to seek more than Palermo. This is one aggravating film. <br /> <br /> At one point, Joe Don presumed dead at sea. All other characters are interesting when he died or not, in the end to the conclusion that it is. But then he shows up (he was rescued by a poor family), and no one mentions the fact that he was missing at sea for several days. Even his darling, Julia Louise-Dreyfus-esque sidekick does not welcome it. It does, however, offer to help him find Palermo, so Joe Don seeking Palermo loses Palermo, settle in a prison cell, like shouting to the head of the Maltese police and then released with a warning not to seek more than Palermo. <br /> <br /> climaxes include quirky carnival with amazing colorful floats and some sexy stripper shoot out with the participation of the child, dressed as Napoleon and the cart of tomatoes, chase scenes with a guy dressed as a monk, and any scene without Joe Don. Lowpoints include Joe Don threatens puller with hanger. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that this is due Graydon Clark, director REVENGE ANGEL'S, which is the sheriff. Eek! <br /> <br />
