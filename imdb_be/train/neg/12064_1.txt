This is one of the saddest horror films that I saw how absolutely god awful, John Carradine has a very limited screen time. All the characters are sad and terrible story, plus I could see two twists at the end of the next miles!. Most installation and spooky house certainly would help if it were not so damn boring, and not a single character to root for something, plus I hope it makes it's way to the bottom 100, because he deserves to be there at my opinion. When John Carradine finally appears in the end, this is a very good scene, but it was too late, and the only other screen time he had been in retrospect, plus just really bloody scene in the movie when a character gets his own face messed up by bees, as it was pretty bloody. I got it in Horror DVD set titled Back From The Grave and all really overacts in my opinion, plus lucky it was included in the kit I bought otherwise I would have thrown it out the window!. This is one of the saddest horror movies that I saw, as it is absolutely god awful, John Carradine has a very limited screen time, and I say avoid like the plague! You do not want to go through the torture. Direction absolutely awful. Carl Monson makes absolutely horrible! work here, which makes every thing look cheap, spending their potential to create a creepy atmosphere and just keep the film at an incredibly dull pace. Responsibilities as bad. John Carradine is good in its place, but the other is that it is unlikely in the film then other flashback scenes. (Carradine Ruled !!). Merry Anders overacts badly here as Laura, since it does not convince me. Ivy Bethune OK, and some terrible, but outplayed, it was a terrible smile at the end though. The rest of the cast, I did not pay enough attention to as well as I had a lot of trouble to get through it, but they were really bad. In general, please avoid it, do not the agony!. BOMB of 5
