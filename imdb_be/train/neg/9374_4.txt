This documentary in the best case, if it just shows Ayurvedic offices and preparing for treatment. Not There is no denying the grinding poverty in India and despair even his wealthy clients. However, as an argument for the Ayurvedic medicine as a whole, this film fails miserably. Although Indian customers recall seeing «aleopathic» doctors, these doctors did not interview, and we have to accept vague statements of their patients in the face value-- "the doctor said that there was no cure", "doctor said that it was cancer ", etc. Well, the "no treatment" does not mean "no cure", and what type of cancer the patient is doing? The film is in its weakest when showing Ayurvedic practice in America. it boils down there, apparently, to a stunning suggestion that the presence of high power Wall Street work can make your stomach pain.
