We went to the movies with a group, because the game, we were going to was canceled. This is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever. It's not that I do not like cult movies myself. But nothing happens in the film. One does not feel any connection with the characters at all. Endless time without dialogue. And the car. As Tay carry huge tent and bed chairs and clothes for each day in this car? This two local! I have to say, but the scenery is beautiful, but not in the movie, the director had to do a photo shoot of the film, so that we might miss 80 minutes of useless time with nothing happening anyway. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it as a waste of time
