Why take a show that millions of us watched and loved as children and do a complete joke? They ask why Hollywood does not make money as before. Because they put out the trash and pay actors huge sums of money to be garbage men and ask us to pay $ 10 to see their garbage. TV show was that it was good people in bad situations where boys GOOD il came in first place. He was not a Gone with the Wind, but it was fun. This movie is garbage! Hollywood can not come up with anything original, so they take what was good, and to destroy it for some $$$$. I only hope that this film does 10x smaller than it should be done. The only one to have any fun with this shit guys who got to drive General Lee. The viewer is a victim. <br /> <br /> If you do not see it, watch replays a TV show instead. They still hold up 20 years later.
