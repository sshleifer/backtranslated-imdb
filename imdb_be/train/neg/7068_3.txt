Chillers begins on a cold, dark stormy night as the bus drops three passengers outside the bus station, a young boy named Mason (Jesse Emery), a college professor Dr. Howard Conrow (David Wall), and a woman named Sharon Phillips (Laurie Pennington). Inside, they discover that they had missed their connecting bus and rolled overnight. In the waiting area, they found two other people, Ronnie (Jim Wolf) & a sleeping woman named Lindsey (Marjorie Fitzsimmons), which currently have a nightmare ... <br /> <br /> While swimming in the pool Lindsay meetings and friendly guy named Billy Waters (Jesse Johnson), next time Lindsay to see Billy, he dives into the pool and then seemingly disappears into the air before it surfaces. Shortly after Lindsay discovers that Billy water died in a diving accident 5 years ago ... <br /> <br /> Lindsay wakes up and tells others about his nightmare, all the other answers, saying that they had also suffered anxiety dreams recently and decided to share them to pass the time ... <br /> <br /> Next, Mason, which tells the story of how he and his two friends, Scott (David R. Hamm) and Jimmy (Will Tuckwiller), are terrorizing during the campaign ... <br /> <br /> Then it is Sharon, whose story revolves around a newspaperman named Tom Williams (Thom Delventhal), that it is up to phones, One blink of an eye on her front door, but it actually turns out to be a vampire ... <br /> <br /> This is a twist near Ronnie and he describes how he discovers that he can return the dead to life, unfortunately, he brings punished mass murderer Nelson Calder (Bradford Boll) to return to murderous life ... <br /> <br /> Finally, Dr. Conrow tells the story of how two of his students brought the ancient Aztec god of war named IXPE (Kimberly Harbo ur ) back to life ... <br /> <br /> he then returned to the bus station for the last (predictable) twist ... <br /> <br /> Written, etc. creativity and director Daniel Boyd coolers are one of the worst horror anthologies I've ever seen, and I used to really like this subgenre. Boyd script is not enough, you need to films such as coolers for the job, you can see the final twist is a mile away and each story is really lame. The first of these is absolutely meaningless, and seems to have no ending & best of these anthologies are picky short stories that are rounded to the inexorable. The second story is predictable and, again, finishes without a win. This continues for coolers that every story is deeply unsatisfactory and does not have to look any remuneration for this. Character and the dialogue is poorly written, the history does not seem to have any original ideas of their own and the whole movie completely sucked. At least every story does not last long, and I liked the idea that the link segment. <br /> <br /> Director Boyd obviously works with a very low budget and it shows. All I can say is if you want to watch 15 minutes of an odd short story set entirely within the basin, the chillers for you. Stories are neither reasonable, scared or have any tension or create something. Having said that, it has a few good scenes & some amazing expertise shines over. Violence and gore wise there is not much going on in cooler, pulled out the heart, the decapitated head and bit off his hand like a bloody as it gets. <br /> <br /> Technically coolers poor material that will not impress anyone. The basic cinematography, bad music, cheap special effects and below average production. Chillers also has one of the worst closing theme songs ever, period. There is also a very low level. <br /> <br /> I'm sure a lot of effort has been put into a cooler as a low-budget film, and at least, the filmmakers have tried, so I'll give credit that, at least, but that does not stop me from I thought it was shit. Such anthology films like Tales from the Crypt (1972) Asylum The (1972), The Vault of Horror (1973), The House of Doctor Terror of Horrors (1965), Creepshow (1982) and Tales from the Darkside: The Movie (1990) are far superior coolers so watch one of those instead.
