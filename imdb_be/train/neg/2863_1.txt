I was glad to watch this movie for free, as I work in the hotel business and the movie came out recently in our movie library. Anything against low budget movies, but this film is not terrible acting and directing. As a film like this will ever be done. Director should be blacklisted, and for all the actors of the poor, it is certainly not a springboard into a career. Please make sure that you do not watch this movie, acting lame, the camera and the direction of awful. There are only a few movies out there that deserve to be called Â«LOW 10". Another example can be "Dracula 3000". People who make money with this film should give to charity, so that at least it is for a good cause. <br /> <br /> In this case, I'd watch it even 10 (or, at least, one more time).
