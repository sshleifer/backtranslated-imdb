Anemia is a comedy-drama, miserable, seemingly rushed all featuring Cher as a deaf housewife who slowly makes one of the hit-man who was hired to kill her husband. Palminteri as talkative mercenary, adapted screenplay with his own plays, with an unnatural set of windows and dialogue back and forth, that quickly tires the eyes and ears. Air gloom hangs over the entire project, and director Mazursky can not get Cher with its eternal fear (it is sluggish). In spite of all the best talents (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), "Faithful" is a fraud, no substance to the stories and characters that rarely come to life. * 1/2 ****
