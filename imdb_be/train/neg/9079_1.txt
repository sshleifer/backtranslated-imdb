What people are talking about here? I must have seen the other film than you guys. I was so sad that I left the theater. What is with this material. I only laughed once, and not even that hard. Who would have the green light to this film should be taken outside and beaten. Usually I always find something I like in a movie, but this is madness. "Slackers" makes "Not Another Teen Movie" looks like a classic. He ranks up there with the garbage as "body shots", "Con Air" and "Conspiracy Theory" as one of the worst ever. Avoid at all costs! I thought that the studio will distribute money to people as they came out of the theater as a token of their apology, but, to my horror, that does not happen. It looks like I'll never see that money again, or two hours.
