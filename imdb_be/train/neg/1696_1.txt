I hate to throw out these lines, but in this case I feel that I have: American remake The Grudge is by far the worst film I've seen in theaters over the past 5 years. There, I said it. And now that I got that out of my system, please, let me explain why. <br /> <br /> "If someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse born. The curse gathers in this place of death. Those who encounter it will be consumed by his rage." This is a prerequisite of Discontent, and I I admit that it sounds intriguing. Unfortunately, the filmmakers do not take it further. Those who are faced with the "curse" really consumed my fury, and that's all you get. you want more? well, too bad. Some critics and supporters point out that the sole purpose of Discontent to scare you. The problem is that if there is no plot to speak, scary images and sounds can only go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu, pulling George Sluizer and rework your own original movie (s), valiantly trying to build an atmosphere in the first hour ?? repeating the . same scene again and again and again and again This is largely takes place so: <br /> <br /> many people come into the house <br /> <br /> what a flash in the camera and / or a strange sound heard <br /> <br /> many persons go explore <br /> <br /> -Sound starts getting loud <br /> <br /> many people see paragraph yvid <br /> <br /> -loud yelling and / or cat screeching <br /> <br /> Cut the black <br /> <br /> Before viewers even gave a hint of the plot, it is exactly the same scenario unfolds 5 times during the first hour. The first time was in fact a few terrible. Each subsequent use was funny as the film went on. By the time the end of the film rolled, my friend and I were laughing wondering if this scene is over "with a loud cry and cut to black." We have never been refuted. <br /> <br /> The film has no backing of the storyline, and takes place in a series of vignettes that leave the audience mixed. I have no problems with nonlinear monologues if it is done correctly. The film jumps from one period to time, without rhyme or reason. I have not seen the film in this state, since the opening of the theatrical version HIGHLANDER 2. And that narrate Mars appliances of any kind a secret that the film could have possibly been. If you already know, the ghosts scared to death of two characters, as it is shocking when their bodies were found in the attic? And why should we care when a detective trying to investigate the mysterious disappearance, when we already know what happened to all? <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the green light to a second US version of THE RING made $ 15 million its opening weekend, The Grudge is nothing but disguised as imitation is calculated as the actual film. The worst things about discontent with the fact that he made $ 40 million its opening weekend and some people consider it a "scary movie ever made." I wonder what happens to those who are consumed by rage pay to see Discontent ?
