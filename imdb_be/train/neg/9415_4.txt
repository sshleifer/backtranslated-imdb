Heavily edited and often confusing, the original film adaptation of Man On Fire was at least ten years from the date when it was made, and the intervening years have not made it better. This is the kind of movie that the producers with too much money and too little experience to do, to attract attention and everyone else is doing just to pay off their outstanding child support or a drug dealer, a bodyguard of Scott Glenn is going out on a limb to save his 12-year-old charge, the kidnapped daughter rich Italian family. Interesting shot - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce - all made better, the action will happen slowly and rarely, and only in exceptional cases, a penalty by John Scott (part of which was in the last reel Die Hard) makes a positive impression. One case when a remake (made by Tony Scott, the original choice of director for this version) is an improvement.
