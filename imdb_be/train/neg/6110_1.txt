After all, Jane Parker, who had long lost father is an anthropologist (Richard Harris, in the worst role very controversial career) in Africa to study something or other. She tracks him down (how?), And he tells her stories of the natives of the giant monster, which at night howling can be heard throughout the jungle. It turns out to be very Ape Man (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the best dialogue of the film), who saves her from the bad guys, and falls in love with her, leaving them plenty of time in this agonizing few hours to frolic naked while horny monkey faces and cheers. I am usually very open to different opinions about any movie, but this is the only exception. This is the worst movie ever made. If you disagree, you have not seen. (Note: Newsday called it "intolerable", which is the best summary of one word I can think of Maltin Guide Film commented that they just did not think about the ranking below the bomb.).
