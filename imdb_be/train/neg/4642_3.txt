I saw "Rachel Garret," thinking that I would be in for a pleasant visceral ride. However, it was not to be. Visceral, yes, but it's nice? This will be a big, fat no! In fact, the only reason I gave it a "3", this is due to the fact that Gunnar Hansen is (very briefly) as one of the evil characters in the film. How did they ever were lured Mr. Hansen ... in this piece of work, I'll never know. History The idea is interesting, but poorly executed. pedestrian direction and acting mediocre. The only thing worse than that is the special effects. YIKES !!! I saw the best effects in the elementary school game. Come on, Mr. the W, it's time for a career change ... I've heard that they hire Diner Mel! There are very few, well-made, INDE movies coming out of Michigan, and ... "Rachel's Attic" is not one of them.
