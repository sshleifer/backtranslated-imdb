This little film was watchable little ordeal to sit through. None of the segments are not good, but at least, the first was a little funny, and the average was more imaginative. The final one was just brutal, and after sitting through two weak comedic shorts, and the third was really painful to watch. Even at the low standards of the movie National Lampoon, this one seemed particularly dull and joyless.
