I only watched a DVD 1. The program itself can have 10 minutes of good information; otherwise, this snotty putdowns religious people. It is as if the director Brian Fleming had only recently discovered how atheism and sarcasm, and feels with these tools it can easily hitting his opposition. <br /> <br /> In addition, Flemming roam widely in their personal problems, and they are taking over the cinema. He will never come back to the topic. <br /> <br /> Religious people tend to disregard the naysayers, if their objections to religion is obviously rooted in an abusive upbringing. Arguments against such persecuted people seem irrational, and therefore inconclusive. <br /> <br /> Anti-religious people will want more data. We do not need to say that religious people are nuts, more than American Jews need to tell you how annoying Christmas music gets to the middle of December. <br /> <br /> The best place Superintendent Fleming childhood Christian School, and earnestly opposed by the director of his motivation. This seems the most honest part of the film, and it was too short. <br /> <br /> If Fleming was a little more self-awareness, he could have a good story in it about his own (past and current) relationship to Christianity, and insulting the institutions that caused him in his youth. <br /> <br /> and maybe he could borrow his "Christ never walked the earth," the material to a more serious documentary. I'm not studying the works of Saul / Paul, to learn how airtight it's all there, but quickly scans Wikipedia offers most of these arguments are discredited. <br /> <br /> The bonus interview is pretty good, tho they do not support the thesis Fleming lot. Sam Harris is a good representative for the POV of anti-religious, and he does not go light on the other, non-Christian religions. Harris also has some good (and easy Google'd) interview on Salon.com, Amazon.com, and Samharris.org.
