This "film" is such a bad job! Nothing seems to even try to be realistic. The plot is weak and acting - unhappy, interesting actors around as in the production of the 1 st year, is trying very hard to act without a chance for all to begin with. That flop! Which is a waste of time, money and effort of all stakeholders, including the audience. Well, as in any thriller, is also murder, corpses and blood. Just imagine someone 5 minutes ago, I committed a murder with a knife, and walked calmly and smiling, not to mention clean as a whistle, as if slashing her throat becomes a virtual agent. In addition, this murder should have been done a tiny fragile woman on the high a strong man, and she cut his throat !!! She asked him, politely, leaning toward her? Much more of the same kind of stupidity that happens at the exit from the audience wondering if this is meant to be a joke, that just turned bad. Continuity is another huge problem, such as: the hungry impatient groom lying in bed, waiting for her virgin-bride to come out of the bathroom and after a long time, falling asleep (!?!). The next scene opens the entrance young couple in the reception area asking for directions spots scenery! Not a word about last night ??? Such a waste of time to even try and write about this low-low supposed to be a "movie."
