I sat through that movie tonight, forcing yourself to stick to it, even if I never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them, because the two wire Gerard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, were the major movie stars of their era, and I would like to to see them in the "something else", which it certainly was. They both gave excellent performances, but the unpleasant characters. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole movie on a shabby little town in Mexico, populated almost uniformly unpleasant characters (a doctor, of course, the main exception) that Michèle Morgan never sees Philippe, to fall in love with him ever It is not explained. <br /> <br /> This is supposed to be based on the work of Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could think that, if the work of Sartre anything like this movie, it has to be very mediocre attempt to imitate the master novel Camus Plague, which dealt with the plague in North Africa. <br /> <br /> worked well, but uninteresting movie.
