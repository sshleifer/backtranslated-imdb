This film is deeply disappointing. Not only that, Wenders shows only a very limited range of blues music, is its subjective and personal interest in the piece of music, which he brings to the film that you can watch and listen to absolutely sad. The only time the film is an interview with a Swedish couple who were friends with J.B. Lenoir and show their private video, as well as telling stories. Introduction Wenders about cinematic theme begins quite interesting - bearing in mind the culture of the world (or in fact, American culture) travels in space, but his limited views on the topic, as well as any funny or totally fascinating play stories from the 30's years makes this film simply as a sleeping aid. He. I expected more from him.
