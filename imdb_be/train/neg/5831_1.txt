This film is massively sad and pretentious. There is only one good when the sailor shaves Mr. Barney (think purple dinosaur less sham) eyebrow. Music inexorably faintness something sad that Bjork, someone with such inner beauty, was brought to a glaring falsehood in her art. tea service pump makes a beautiful ritual seems bland. mythology and culture are not respected in this film, they are lifted. Not only because of the Japanese culture, but on the other filmmaker ... (stay tuned) Ideally, "art imitates life" moment-the crew discovers a giant piece of sh * t. That and the audience found the theater. There are some set pieces are very structures and arts without heart --- it ?? prepare for spoilers, I'm talking to you MR BARNEY. <br /> <br /> The emperor has no clothes! Mr. Barney you were outted! I saw in Jodorowsky Holy Mountain. And your thin, fake BS curtain was raised. You stole your images your style and your ENTIRE CATALOG ART from this person. Now, when the Holy Mountain was released FINALLY, let's hope the powers that be in the world of art councils STOP FUNDING FOR YOU! Poor Jodorowsky lost in the financial battle with the Beatles as a lawyer when he is Lennon / McCartney in the film. And while BTW Jodorowsky is Beatle-YOU ARE THE MONKEES! Cheap thin soulless rip off just like an indulgent vulgar college freshmen. And by the way I'm a filmmaker. If you are interested in making a reality of the film, I legitimately fight you in a circle of protection Jodorowsky, you are defending an open theft.
