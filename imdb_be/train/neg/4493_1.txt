I tried to remove anything that might be considered a spoiler. I also believe that you have already seen the first film, or at least know the general nature, so if you have not some of it might not make sense <br /> <br /> The plot :. This film has the audience over the head with a weary philosophical rambling again and again in an attempt to get the theme across. We fell asleep again and again questions the purpose and destiny and choice, and forced to endure the long, painful sessions of vulgarity that contain them. <br /> <br /> Neo woke up from sleep, in the last film, Now begins the period of implementation of its own existence. There is a lot to discover in this movie, which I'm vague about so they will not appear as already spoilers. <br /> <br /> * If you are still concerned about the vague references spoil the film, Don "t read the following paragraph. * <br /> <br /> strength and weakness of faith are revealed. Strengths and weaknesses of love, and its temporary nature, as revealed. The interdependence of people and technology, and our faith in technology also shown. The importance of choice and experience revealed. Explaining further the things that are revealed to insist on, so I will refrain (as guidelines for writing the commentary asks). By the way, "he revealed" I mean pounded through our eyes and ears like nails <br /> <br /> Scene :. So how do you get Neo and the gang from the end of the last film prior to the next? In short, they keep the faith, as well as the use and abuse of over-stylized action and bullets while he was going out of fashion (and after this display, I hope that the movie-lovers and producers, so learn to appreciate the subtlety and originality a little more). More on that later. In order to not spoil anything, I will not say more than already made promomaterial: Neo is still trying to figure out the matrix, and it is looking for answers, trying to save people, and Zion, all while the villains are after him and his cohorts. Movie pretty much picks up where the last one finished <br /> <br /> The action :. While martial arts action and gunplay peppered his predecessor in several equal parts, this film focuses more on the martial arts than a skirmish, adding balls, sai, etc. into the mixture. The special effects are often used and waved in the face of the audience, it becomes very tedious. I discussed this film with your friends and colleagues, and almost all of them found some of the action sequences - especially "Smith fight," we have heard in the movies - too long and tedious. Now this is a huge red flag for lovers of action, because the end of the sequence of actions should either leave you wanting a little bit more, or all of the contents of a surprise that just happened. <br /> <br /> These fights scenes do not, they are overly stylized, over-the-top sequence, wooden and inspiration. In the first film, there was a real sense of frustration of some actions, feeling that the fight was for survival, rather than just look good (I honestly do not think that they will in any case Reloaded) in black and leather. Go watch Drunken Master or Iron Monkey after this film to remind myself that a good combat sequences - you will not regret it. Additionally, "Matrix" the ability of people in Reloaded is not consistent, and the fact that they actually is not consistent. The first film had its inconsistency here, but they were not too egregious. - unlike Reloaded <br /> <br /> The special effects are poured on and on and on. Every little thing that someone, be it a simple jump, tumble, spin, and in many cases are simply, are <br /> <br /> slow Moed, bullet timely, or overly accentuate certain destruction. This is a clear W Bros had a lot of money to throw at this film, and boy did they put it, with no real restrictions. Sharp editors could really help it, but the first film was such a hit that free reign was obvious, given that brings us. ,. <br /> <br /> The nature and dialogue: I more or less said that dialogue was tired and full of philosophical platitudes. Actors can not exactly bring a lot of depth of character, if the script and the direction of pushing a person of character progression audience, or ignoring it altogether. The viewer never gave nuance and substance, that they may contemplate the nature in themselves. <br /> <br /> effectiveness Keana is tough at best. Keanu good acting confused, and that's all he does in this film. He makes a decent attempt to show the passion between Neo and Trinity, but it falls flat. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Morpheus tries to do everything from Moses to Henry the V, and be as cool as a cat around. When the script he provides, it makes a noble attempt, but it also provides flat. <br /> <br /> Moss is not very believable either. Her gaze concern is always the same, just like Keanu, and the chemistry is not there, even though they are very physical scenes they fake it well enough. <br /> <br /> Hugo once again brought him a strange feeling of being Agent program, but he also suffered from the hands of the script. I actually find it to be the most interesting character of the bunch, but instead of it just make him an excuse for a huge, drawn battle scenes. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is beyond disappointing when you have good expectations, in and of itself, as a self-contained movie (which is not the way it should be taken), it's still terrible. I do not see the Matrix, how deep, but at least I see it as a nice SCIFI fuss, which has some interesting ideas, good actions, a few funny lines, and quite restrained symbolism and elusions amuse attentive. Reloaded fails on all these counts, and I really hope that W Bros will give us a better experience in third party. Of course, I do not have a lot of hope on the left, that after this film.
