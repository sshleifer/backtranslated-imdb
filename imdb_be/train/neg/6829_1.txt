I wrote at least half a dozen scathing reviews of this sorry little flick and not printed, so I have to believe that someone on imdb.com really loves this horrible film. The idea that a bunch of oil can raise a military tank, which is set in the desert for more than ten years, and make it a fighting machine again ludicrous. So this action and direction. Pass on it.
