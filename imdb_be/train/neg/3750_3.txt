I finally look at this experimental Lynch shortly after waiting for so long .... and unfortunately, it's not worth it! Even for the die hard fan Lynch, I discovered that it's really tiring .... <br /> <br /> nothing happens, there is a long, long, long painful pause in which nothing happens, the long, monotonous speech, where there is no said nothing, and it all ends with the viewer does not know, care, what the hell that was all that came before and what happened next. <br /> <br /> It was an allusion to Mulholland Drive - a blonde girl and brunette girl was very -esque Diane and Rita, and the moment of Lost Highway with hints of a significant event that occurred, but it is impossible to talk about clearly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is all very interesting and very boring, nothing happens, it is very forgettable, and I think I'll delete it from my computer and forget that I ever watched it. Unfortunately, David!
