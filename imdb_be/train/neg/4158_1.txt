This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen !!!! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie worse than this one !!! <br /> <br /> And I mean ever !!!! <br /> <br /> I 'm a big fan of "B" horror movies. As you can imagine .... I was exposed to some of the worst that the film industry has to offer. <br /> <br /> I'm lured to this film its title. I mean c'mon ... that a true supporter of terror will not be intrigued by a title like «Vampires vs. Zombies »??? Images of the "undead," fighting each other on the "undead" were dancing in my head. I thought to myself ... "I must see" !!!! <br /> <br /> Well .... I'm sorry to say .... "I wish I had not seen" !!!!! <br /> <br /> This movie title is very misleading, to say the least. There has not been a vampire fighting zombies. In fact, there is no story !!!! If you ask me what this film is all about, I can honestly say that I have no idea !!! <br /> <br /> There was no story !!!! <br /> <br /> There was no story !!!! <br /> <br /> This film absolutely has no meaning at all !!!! <br /> <br /> At the end of this fiasco ... I found myself feeling sorry for the poor souls who have invested in this project, because they certainly do not have a sense of business !!!
