Kurt Thomas stars as Jonathan Cabot any gymnast who trains in a special game, which includes a group of ninja hunt, but the Ninjas will not stand a chance, especially because Cabot is a gymnast! Taken as a whole Gimkat is a very bad movie, brutal action, the god-awful script and direction is really incompetent to make quality below human standards, but this film is so frightening it becomes very, very funny. I mean with dialogue such as "I know I will outsleep them!" Or, "Ha!, Your through!" Only add to the layout values, which receives more Gimkat. In addition, it is (wisely) is the only film that has a hero gymnast who finds things to swing on the enthusiasm.
