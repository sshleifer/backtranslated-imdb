Simply put, it should not be done. It is predictable and corny. On screen chemistry that made the first «My Girl», so magical nowhere to be found here, and which acts as a whole stilted and forced. Writing also leaves much to be desired, some of the "memorable" lines such as «earpeircing barbaric custom" is shocking. Where «My Girl" caused the sincere feelings of grief and some really funny moments, like many within «My Girl 2" tries to recreate the emotions generated by audiences, and fails miserably. Maybe I'll try to be hard on this film because of how big the first one was, but honestly it offends the original quality of the kind of nonsense this contribution serves up. Of course, it should be closer to the "Son of the Mask" as one of the worst sequels of all time. In both cases, the old adage rings true; "If it is not broke, do not fix."
