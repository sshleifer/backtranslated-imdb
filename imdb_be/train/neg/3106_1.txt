Every time I make a list of the absolute worst movies I've ever seen that this film is always on it. It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It took an act of will to sit through the whole thing, and I soon shed their own blood than have to sit through it again. <br /> <br /> What happened to him? Let me tell you a story about my trip to watch it in the theater. <br /> <br /> I went to the midnight show on Saturday evening. I only have in the theater itself, and a bunch of loud, boisterous and unruly teenagers sitting somewhere behind me. They were clearly not having a good time on a Saturday night, and came to this "comedy" for some laughs. Before the beginning of the film, during the preview, they were laughing and joking, and making loud comments, which have a great old time. This border annoying; if they continued their unbridled enthusiasm for the real film, I might have said something, but I felt a tolerant and cautious of their energetic fun, so I let her go. And they settle down after the movie started. <br /> <br /> Why am I telling you all this? Because you can judge about this supposed "comedy" effect that was not only for themselves, but this noisy bunch. <br /> <br /> During the film circulation, and not one person in the theater laughed. Not once. Not very, not noisy children. Absolute silence, except for the soundtrack. And when the film ended and the lights came on, all of us, all of us, they came slowly out of the theater in a slow, gloomy, absolute silence. It may have been a funeral. <br /> <br /> It was the effect that this "comedy" production. Do not laugh, not pleasure, but the absolute depression. It was boring, depressing film, not a tiny bit funny. Instructive, self-indulgent, it is depressing, but it's not funny. <br /> <br /> I think of Mel Brooks 'Blazing Saddles' to be short-listed for the Funniest Movie Ever. He still absolutely blows my mind that the same gentleman may be responsible for it is likely the least funniest movie ever <br /> <br /> In short, if you feel too happy to give this film the whirlpool; . Otherwise, I do not say I did not warn you.
