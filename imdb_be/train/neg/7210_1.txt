Once again, Disney manages to make a children's film, which completely ignores its background. About the only thing in common with these original cartoons and gadget names. The most glaring errors characters - Penny does not own the book, the brain has been reduced to a fantasy character props, Dr. Talon More pretentious than the evil villain, and so on, but there is more than that. Horror begin with the first minutes of the film - with the gadget as a security guard by the name of John Brown does not help to identify him as a classic Inspector Gadget. And in the beginning we see an open attempt to Disney to turn every story ever in a love affair between a man and a woman - they introduce brand, which only serves to make the film Disney compliant. Add to this the fact that the "Claw" seen in this movie and the classic Dr Claw almost diagonally, and you will see that it will not be anywhere close to the original story. What would help would be a better story to replace him - but, as you may have guessed, Disney failed in this too. The whole film is just a gadget acting silly for silliness and lust after Brenda. As if to add insult to injury, Disney introduced the "newÂ» Gadgetmobile - function does not look or think like the old Gadgetmobile at all, it's just a canonical "comic" figure. Disney is clearly recognized that the cartoon The gadget was a comedy, so they made this film a comedy, too, but they have removed all reasonable running gag (eg, destination paper exploded in the face of the leader) and replaced them with Gadget to be an idiot, then Gadgetmobile be clever, and " claw "window dressing. Someone has to say that Disney "children's film" does not mean "the complete absence of any use of the brain." The nut should be aimed at children of 10-12 years ... not children 10-12 months as the film. What would this movie should be, it is not, repeat, not the real Inspector Gadget. Because I love the old gadget, I hate it.
