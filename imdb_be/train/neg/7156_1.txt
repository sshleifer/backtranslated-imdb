Dooohhh! My Bwainn Hurrrts! Well, this is, of course, after this test the endurance of the film. How on earth, I was able to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's me !! Maybe I do not get a room movie ... or maybe I did not appreciate it claimed mystical atmosphere. In my humble opinion, though the film has the same mystical atmosphere, like a trip to McDonald's. <br /> <br /> Besides the characters were terrible, and there is more of a character in the cartoon Tom and Jerry. Yaarrrghhh! Why am I doing this? Why do I see a scar? That's enough to make one run away and join a monastery, or Foreign Legion !! YAARGH !! Absolutley terrible movie just about every way. In addition, it is not bad.
