Based on the popular television series of copyright works it is not a guarantee of success. Yorkshire TV has learned this the hard way, when in 1979 they bought the rights to the book credited Dick Francis, three of which were broadcast under the title «The Racing Game». Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley, a former jockey turned private eye after an accident in which he lost his right arm, only to replace it with an artificial one. Gwilym was suffering from an acute lack of charisma (and looked like one of the bad guys) while Mick Ford (who played annoying Chico Barnes) made me think about the ass horse, when he was on the screen. Within six weeks, is less than the dynamic duo is charged on the countryside, tears treacherous conspiracies to fix a race, as a rule, the same methods - blackmail, kidnapping, riders and horse doping. Yorkshire Television threw the money on the show, but to no avail. Violent, sexist, contrived and repetitive, it was quickly taken away in the courtyard of castanets.
