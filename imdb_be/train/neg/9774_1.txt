Hubert Selby, Jr., gave us the book "Requiem for a Dream" and co-wrote the film Aronofsky him. The film turned out at every level, providing an intimate and open-minded portrait of the horrors of life and character defects, which destroyed them. "Last Exit to Brooklyn" is still a vice and several characters who live life sad, but it hardly makes him the justice Aronofsky made. <br /> <br /> The film seems ridiculously anti-gay at times. Especially if homosexuality in the film is death. One gay character gets stoned, launched into the sky at high speed of the car, and the land of the dead on the pavement. Another crucified and more just beat. Another piece of exaggerated shock that can actually be convincing when it was done well, the union of workers of the scene literally do battle with scabs. Who would have thought, a drama about Brooklyners will feature action sequences and explosions truck? <br /> <br /> Directed by Uli Edel has a skill level as that of television director, but it is significantly lower than the cut for the actual movies. The film is awkward, he can not even seem to settle into genres. Lake useless given the role that any mannequin could be filled and only Baldwin seems to know how to look stupid in his equally poor parts. And then comes Jennifer Jason Leigh as our lead, disgusting prostitute named Tralala (believe it or not, I'm not kidding). Her performance is nothing special, and the fate of her character is dirty, to say the least. Inefficient use of color and composition, to make it look less than this, and also takes the "real" blunt more provocative bits. Failure.
