If the film is not rated by an independent and, for example, Hamilton, I expected out of the norm, cut out his heart to the violence. I know what good movies do not always contain blood and violence, but I read the reviews, I visited the website and I even convinced some of my friends have to pay $ 9.50 to see this god awful movie with me. If there is a festival called Horrorfest, I was expecting the horror, not Dawson's Creek with a hint of incest. My expectations were very low for this film, but it was little expectations for the film was shot in hell when I saw that the time has passed before we saw the first drop of blood come out of somebody's finger. There were too many plot holes and left too much to the imagination. I regret not seeing Happy Feet. I think that perhaps there was more violence and gore in this film than in Hamilton!
