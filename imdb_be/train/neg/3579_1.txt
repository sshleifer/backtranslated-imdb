Immediately after the rental and watch this movie a few years ago, a friend and I decided that he defined absolute zero on the scale of the film. There was nothing about the film, which could be made worse than it was. On this day, we continue to evaluate the movies, even very bad, how much better than «The Lonely Lady» they are. <br /> <br /> A long time ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote the script because, among other things, "of Last Summer" and "Diary of a Mad Housewife" and she told me that she was asked to write a script for a book by Harold Robbins' The Lonely lady ". She said that she had sent to the treatment, and it was rejected, because they did not think she understands the difficulty female screenwriter in Hollywood. Then she said: "I think they have someone else to write it." The interview was filmed before the film was released. She died in 1981, and I bet that the first thing she did upon arrival in heaven personally thank God for saving her from participating in the result.
