I think this film is a tribute to the first film of Superman, as well as how ugly and painful for a long time as the original. <br /> <br /> After the opening scene, which consists exclusively of turbid intergalactic visual, loans to pay tribute to the even-lousy-Offers-their time sweeping futuristic credit the original Superman movie. <br /> <br /> Then there are some more turbid material. Ma Kent see some muddy Ruckus on the farm and spend a good part of my life is slowly coming to some debris in a cornfield. Superman then sneaks up on her and falls unconscious. <br /> <br /> Next, we catch up with Lex Luthor in the scene of many dark close-up old lady as she was dying. We do not see the face Luthor before the end of the stage, an early copy of the movie disc, to leave no stone unturned beaten. Lex Luthor is a guy who does not like Superman, because he is not a man. In addition, he probably does not like people or, as the film sometimes has some story about Lex Luthor plans to kill most of the world's population. <br /> <br /> After a while, Clark Kent shows up so his old job (I forgot to mention that he was away for five years, a trip where nothing happened). Then he learns that Lois Lane has an illegitimate child and meets Cyclops. It excites him so much that he loses control of his super powers to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame. <br /> <br /> At this point we can see that Miss Lane on some aircraft, attached to some kind of a space shuttle. This is some important event on account of it on television. Then we learn that there are people in the control room monitoring the event. There are also people watch on TV and have the pilots in the cockpit. The film then reminds us that these people are involved sharp between them for most of the summer. <br /> <br /> As the events which led to the inevitable catastrophe began to build, I excused myself to get a soda. I accidentally returned the wrong theater and watched this movie about Al Gore, showing slides in full. I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns, but I once went to the Prairie Home Companion, which I watched twice in a row. Then it's time to stop messing around. <br /> <br /> I went back to the first theater found its place and looked up to see that Lois Lane is close shuttle disaster was almost upon us. However, it seemed like an eternity, so I walked around the theater, met a girl, married, raised a son and sent him to college. While visiting my son's medical school graduation, I remembered that I should probably check in on Superman Returns, so I excused myself and ran back into the theater, only to find out there was no need to hurry. It still takes about half an hour before it all went wrong for the shuttle lane. If they did, Superman saved all that was pretty cool. <br /> <br />. And then there podagovor where superman becomes really creepy and begins persecution of Lois Lane and her family with his X-ray vision and super hearing. He then tries to get her to deceive the Cyclops, which seems like a good guy. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lex Luthor is involved in some sort of competition to show their best behavior generic villain until the end of the movie, I forgot to bring home scorecards with me (they give you one at the door), but I I think that he had killed damn close to one hundred percent. I hope that he will win a million dollars. <br /> <br /> At this point, everyone starts to prepare for the big muddy finals. I think that, maybe, the projector was broken, on account of the film, it seemed, in some cycle for a while here. I remember how cloudy things grow out of the water, get sick Superman, Superman is getting better, go back to the cloudy things, he was again ill, do not expect that he is wrong again. <br /> <br /> Then Lex Luthor's unleashed his ultimate bad guy turn :. yelling at his girlfriend a little <br /> <br /> Then Superman died and came back to life. I thought the film was finished, so I left. <br /> <br /> Ninety years later, the nursing home where I lived felt a little cold. I realized that I left my sweater back in the theater, and I went to get it. When I did, I was a little surprised to discover that Superman Returns is not finished. I tried to ask some of the spectators, that I missed, but most of them were just skeletons with long white beards at the moment. <br /> <br /> I sat back in his old chair and watched as Lois Lane fumbled around for a while at home. Then Superman appeared and began to quote the beginning of the film, and since then I've already seen this part, I thought it was good to go. <br /> <br /> So my review of Superman Returns. <br /> <br /> on, and if you love jokes about people eat dog joke or a dog eating another dog, you will love this film. On account of there are two jokes like that in it.
