It is clear that breaks Ringu, Hideo Nakata (Ring, 1998) and Hongurai MIZU NO Soko Kara (Dark Water, 2002), with hints of Ju-On (The Grudge, 2000), but badly made Gore (green corpse with red eyes?) weak plot, and a weak topic (I think it's very difficult to find a picture message scary). It was two things in this film that made me shudder, and with unexpected hands, and after Oodishon (Takashi Miike another one, this is one of 1999) made me tingle all over in a few hours after seeing it and all the films that steals from the fact it was terrible, I can not see this film as anything other than a full house in the western popularity of large Japanese horror films. Two out of ten.
