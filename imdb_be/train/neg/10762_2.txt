This was the impetus for me to pick up from the local video store. Do not make the same mistake I did. This film is tedious, unconvincing acting, and even sad. The dialogue between the priest and his uncle especially poorly written and delivered; I cringed at every scene they share. Dennis Hopper makes a few sparse and usually acted independently dissected; his role was clearly not stretch it. And although the film is supposedly set in Puerto Rico, it feels much more like a movie lot in Hollywood; All of the main characters are the Caucasian, and some tend to speak in English with a pseudo-Irish accent. Odd. Anyway, if you see this on the shelf of your local video store, keep going.
