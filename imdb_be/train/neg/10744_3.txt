In the first, he was basically a giant rats, but there were some giant wasps and chicken too. This one, however, it's just a huge period of rats, and giant rats, and one little boy is really growing. It is one of this growing boy and the scientist who tries to help him, so he accidentally creates a giant rat-killer ... you know how it is. This movie has some of the killing and its moments, but I think it would be on par with the original, I just prefer some variety in their giant creature movies. Well, it's not ... I actually like "Empire Ants", maybe I just do not care about the giant rodents. On the whole, rather dull film, although it has a rather strange turn of events in this one dream sequence, which is really weird. I just can not recommend it.
