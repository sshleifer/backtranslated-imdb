When I first saw the cover of this film (giant bugchasing several nurses) and the name "Blue Monkey" I knew I was not in any big Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see Reylsbek this cheese ball Flick, who always does a good job in whatever role he decides .... FX quite banal, there is not too much of the plot, and I still do not know why this film called Blue monkey, because there is nothing to do in this movie with a monkey. But come on people, what are you waiting ?? It's actually not as bad as it seems .... If you like the old 50s-style black-and-white films attack error, this one is mainly an updated version without special FX Updates
