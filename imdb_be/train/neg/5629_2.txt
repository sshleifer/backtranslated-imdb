I just rented (yes! I paid money to see!) This film. OMG. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. As another reviewer put it, Ms. Colagrande, get out of the movies, please! Please never do, or appear in another movie! The lady has the charisma of a melon. No, this is not true with respect to the melon, which probably has more going for it. She does not know how to act; it affects disgusted look constantly (reminded me a lot of my always-aversion young sisters in European law). It is not charming; it is not so. There's no real story. And editing! There was not any that I could see! It is very bad when you watch a movie, just go through it, you press "forward forward" on the remote control, and still nothing happens! I mean! ..... I kept involuntarily shouted, "Cut! Cut! "What are they thinking? Well, obviously, they thought to make a film together and paid to make love on the screen! Quite a lot of them; quite a bit raw for the audience! I think I'm going to quit now ....
