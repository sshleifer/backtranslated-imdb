It's a big step down after a surprisingly pleasant original. This sequel is not as fun as part of one, and instead he spends too much time on the development of the plot. Tim Thomerson still the best thing about this series, but the joker to tone down in this record. Performances are all adequate, but this time the script lets us down. Action simply routine and the plot is only slightly interesting, so I need a lot of silly laughter to stay entertained during the "trancer" movie. Unfortunately, laughing a little, and far away from each other, and thus, the film watchable at best.
