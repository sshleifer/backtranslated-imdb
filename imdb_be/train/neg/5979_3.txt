Pokemon 3 a little more than three or four episodes of the series, strung together without the usual commercials. The history of a typical Pokemon (conflict, struggle, and resolution, where everyone is happy in the end), and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation. Some of the holes in the plot are filled (for the credits!) Without giving a reason, and it's all just a little too sweet. <br /> <br /> Why see it on the big screen? The only reason to be part of your child's world. Both my sons enjoy the Pokemon, and my shows interest in what they like, we are closer. Seeing a movie in the theater is still different than seeing it on the tube, and my sons will enjoy the full movie screen experience. I gave the film 4, mainly because my children point of view. <br /> <br />
