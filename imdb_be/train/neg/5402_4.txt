This film is so incredible; - the entire room chatter; the fact that a serial killer (vampire or otherwise) could fly around untraced and kill as many people as possible, as the film implies ridiculous. Himself a vampire would not look out of place in the film, Bela Lugosi. Most of the action is so wooden actors should be treated for dry rot. I'm waiting for the day when someone makes a decent movie out of a Stephen King novel (except, perhaps, waiting for me). This film suffers from the fact that do most Stephen King films - the lack of money, which is used for "special" effects, the poor actor, terrible response and dialogue. This film is a cheap, tacky and not at all what he is trying to do.
