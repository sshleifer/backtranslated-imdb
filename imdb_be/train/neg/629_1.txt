I desperately want to give this movie a 10 ... I really do. Some movies, especially horror movies so budget that they are good. Wise cracking Ninja effigy, which can realize ears of corn as a non-lethal weapon ... definitely fits the "budget for shine" system.

All I can really say, "You can dig" and recommend to watch movies such as Frankenfish, if you like this kind of hilarious horror. <br /> <br /> (What the hell are they smoking? "
