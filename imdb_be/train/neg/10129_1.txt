I can hardly find words to express how completely completely awful this film. I was sold on the promise of action, with Segal and stealth aircraft, which are usually made for an entertaining thriller. I can honestly say that I would like to gouge out his eyes with a cocktail stick, than have to see this movie again. The action was so badly that it was almost funny. The story was incredibly weak plot holes so wide you could cavernously F117 fly through them. The script was so poor, if I learned that the 10-year-old wrote, I should not be less than surprised. Direction and production as an amateur, I would not even hire these people to my worst enemies to shoot the wedding video. UTTER utter nonsense. Those responsible for the creation of this film has less of art, and they should be ashamed of yourself. Steven Seagal must never ever show your face in public, I can not imagine what made him agree to act in this, the worst film I've seen in my life.
