Spend time any other way, even the homework is better than the movie. Jokes are not funny, funny poems that Dr. Seus does not exist. Very lousy way to spend an evening. My children 4-16 laughed a little at the beginning of junior got bored with it and went to play Barbie and older left to play ps2 and surf the net. My wife went and made the dish. So I finished it alone. It was the worst "children" a movie that I have seen. If you want to watch the movie fun to watch kids Shrek 2, the film is fun for children and their parents. AVOID THIS FILM. It's not funny, cute sun, make-up cat on common good things in it, and you can see that on the disc label.
