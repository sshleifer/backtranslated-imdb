Well, what to say ... <br /> <br /> After seeing this film, I still wonder what the hell is the point of everything was really ?? V.Dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point ... I had to take my eyes off the screen, I felt physically sick ... Round and round and round .... You get the idea ... <br /> <br /> VERY VERY strange accents in many parts .... "Those who need to know, to knowÂ» <br /> <br /> Unless your getting in for free, or pay to watch it, or your partner about to you paint the house or something .. then forget about it ...
