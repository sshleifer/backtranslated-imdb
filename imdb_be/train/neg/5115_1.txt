It had to be one of the worst films I have ever seen, and I'm 64 years old and a football fan. I went expecting to see a football movie. About 10 minutes into it, I began to wonder how such a bad film (in particular, actions) could get to the theater. About half way through, I whispered to my husband that it was horrible, and he explained to me the facts underlying the film. Despite the fact that I was a little hurt (and I can see how some of them can be very offended if they were not Christians) in a sermon in the cinema, it was not so much. It was, however, a big deal to be subjected to such a predictable and unrealistic behavior and, above all, the quality of the action. This is a good movie for a church picnic, but to show up in the church hall, rather than in the theater. Should I go to church? Yes. Do I want to go to church, when I go to the movies? No. I would recommend this film? Absolutely not !!!
