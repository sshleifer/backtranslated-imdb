I started watching this movie with low expectations, in fact, I only noticed it because it was an adaptation SK novel (I have not read the novel). <br /> <br /> I'm glad that my expectations were low because the film did not have anything close to good, but he manages to keep you interested. What really pulls down the story is the work of the director and actors. The film is long, has no 'good' shots, and not scary, dialogs are not dumb shit and special effects. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is good in the fact that, as I said, it keeps you interested in (I believe that the book should be good), without using a lot of horror clich√©s. <br /> <br /> My voice is 4/10.
