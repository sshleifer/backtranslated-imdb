Paint by numbers plot and mediocre acting saved some true colors - and a few things that are really great and deeply felt. It effectively capture the subtle transition of girls into adulthood, and deals very sensitively and creatively with cultural conflict major family events. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the germ of a good film is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely intricate plot that manages to incorporate religious hatred, conflict over the project to build a road, the sex life of the secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man, who lives in the woods, a bunch of racist bullies, at least three different carnivals, tangled local church policy, and on and on and on. And all this does not even include the actual central portion, which is just about the hopes, dreams and disappointments of two girls (and entire families) at the turn of their lives. I was really shocked when I realized that all this must have taken place during one of the summer (and that so much of the film was achieved in 1.5 hours!) <br /> <br /> In the end, the film melodramatic, every part of the matter is predictable, basic life changing events occur, and then forget about 10 minutes later ... and some of these events are very unpleasant. The most shocking fact that one of the characters involved in the horrible crime (in a totally predictable "twist"), and then completely forgiven and forgotten the whole incident ever since. Similarly, a secondary character input to only the few minutes after death, and provide just one "turn". It's all completely mechanical, up to the final, which neatly ties all the loose ends (well, not all of them, just the ones that the movie thinks that you care about.)
