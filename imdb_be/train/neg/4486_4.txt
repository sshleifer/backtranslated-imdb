What the hell does it all mean? I've seen the Matrix and was amazed. It was the most spectacular film ever made. What ever possesed the Wachowski brothers to make this film for me. <br /> <br /> There's no plot, you can not argue with that. Basically, all this film was to say the load, and do not get me wrong, I have no problem with Talky films, but all the talk in The Matrix Reloaded was a meaningless load drivvle. Then they would fight sequence, which lasted too long, more than a meaningless drivvle, then another fight, which has lasted too long, and it all makes for the biggest anti-climax ever. A small bearded man talking load uncomprehensible bull for 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> In addition, Keanu Reeves gives his worst performance yet. I knew that he was not a good actor, but it's a joke. When you see his films in the manner he was with them, it would seem, he got progressively worse as they went along. God knows that his execution, as well as in Something's Gotta Give! Keanu Reeves: only plank of wood, someday become an actor <br /> <br /> After the splendor of the first film, it was a massive dissapointment .. If you have not seen the first film, which I invite you to look at, but do not waste your time with this complete bunch of crap. <br /> <br />
