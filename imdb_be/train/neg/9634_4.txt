Regardless of the rating I give BOOM only because of the excellent location and photos of Sardinia in Rome. Otherwise, it is only for hardcore addicts Elizabeth Taylor (its down phase) and Richard Burton (its miscasting phase). Tennessee Williams wrote "The milk train does not stop here anymore" and must be very fond of this adaptation of his play - but, apparently, he was the only one. Taylor reportedly hated him and Burton needed money. <br /> <br /> Regardless, it is a hill of beans with Taylor posturing and smoky in shrill manner, exploding on employees and poor exchange of baby talk with no less than the NOAEL coward, who seems to be an alien from another movie when he finally appears. <br /> <br /> it's so old-fashioned, it's probably among the supporters of Taylor, is considered a "must see" kind of thing. But if you can sit through it without a drink in your hand, you're way ahead of me. Unfortunately, this film, which meant the end of Taylor being taken seriously as an actress, even after he won two Oscars. For Burton, it was just as catastrophic and critics called it a bomb. Judge for yourself, if you dare.
