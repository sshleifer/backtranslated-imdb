Wow. I've seen some really bad movies in my time, but this one really takes the cake. This is not the worst film I've seen in the last decade - no exaggeration <br /> <br /> As a veteran of the US Army War in Afghanistan, I found it almost impossible to even watch this funny movie, not because. It brings back memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely no attempt to "authenticity" can be found anywhere in the film. Not so much as the tiniest little shred. It seemed that it was written by an 8-year old kid who got all their ideas about war (and the soldiers' behavior) directly from the comics. The film was made in Honduras, which was the key, but even this can not fully explain the terrible production values ​​of this cliché-ridden piece of rubbish. <br /> <br /> I could try to list all the endless technical shortcomings, but it would take almost forever. Since ancient single shoulder patches that have not been seen or worn after World War II, as well as tags character names as «ColCollins» (which have the character of "Colonel Collins"), which was actually spelled with inverted, mirrored «N "Russian alphabet (non-US) alphabet list just goes on and on uniforms, equipment, plot, and especially the behavior of the characters themselves -. each episode was simply overflowing with funny shortcomings, inaccuracies and utterly meaningless cliché <br /> <br /> None the story itself. no heroes had little confidence or credible. It was ridiculously children, in the extreme. It was obvious, the film, which was to apply strictly pre-pubescent boys, and I have no doubt that even they would find the film quite absurd. <br /> <br /> In short, this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities at all is a waste of time, I would strongly advise anyone reading this to pass this garbage by;.. it's really not worth wasting a single minute of your time.
