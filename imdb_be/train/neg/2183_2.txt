This film was really bad, you take it as a science-fiction film as a horror or comedy. All this is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The film looks (and) picked cheap, the actors do not have the slightest idea that the acting and the script makes it clear that at the present time, along with the shooting. Obviously, the monster in the closet was added, so that the living head was not scary at all He's even pretty- and they think that they need something more impressive; they are not here (makeup awful even for the end of the 50s, quite funny) <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows why a career director Joseph Green, as such, as well as a writer never materialized. he was very bad at both. The same applies to actors, presenters and support. <br /> <br /> «brain is not going to die» 's best achievement is a short time.
