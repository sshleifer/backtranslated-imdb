It was interesting to see this movie. Many people seem to be excited. I also have my beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I am open to any views or opinions. It does not matter to me if Jesus existed in the way it is written in the Bible. When Mary was a virgin or not, all other such pagan coincidences. What is important for me, the idea of ​​salvation, the idea of ​​love as the only way to find peace in this world. <br /> <br /> that made me angry is when someone accepts an offer, present it as a fact, but all showing the context it was written. For example, they have shown in this film the following sentence is great: "Those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them - bring them here and slay them before me" Jesus (Lukas 19:27) The fact that they are waiting for "t say you context. Jesus told a story about an evil king. There is no passage in the Bible where Jesus maintains the murder. He is love! Quoting the Bible is wrong, they introduce us to people yelling (pseudo-Christians), filled with hatred. Most viewers do not verify the information provided in this way, they begin to think, Jesus hate = = not good for me or for anyone else. This is pure manipulation of people. Please use your brain. Do not take it as a fact they tell you in this film. We are destroying our own base, our civilization, as we begin the dismantling of Jesus therefore, and the message he brought to us. You saw bough on which you sit.
