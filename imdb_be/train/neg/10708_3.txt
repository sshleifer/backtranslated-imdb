This film had the potential to be really good, taking into account some elements of the plot are borrowed from the sci-fi thriller Hidden. And Dolph always gives a cheesy reference to his role. But someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this. <br /> <br /> Dolph plays a butt-kicking monk (!), who travels to New York to get the key that unlocks the door at his monastery, which the Antichrist imprisoned for 2,000 years. He has to fight servant, who is a spirit, who jumps from body to body as well as the hidden and JASON GOES TO hell. Mignon, of course, he wants the key, so that he could afford with the Antichrist. Along for the ride is annoying woman archaeologist and once she and Dolph prosecuted by authorities minions of demons. <br /> <br /> When I make this sound interesting, forget about it. Walking is very uncomfortable and sluggish operating subpar at best, and the action scenes set bad. Dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue in his career. <br /> <br /> cheese factor really raises at the end when a minion army battle gun has monks in the monastery, but the rest of this flick is snoozefest. <br /> <br /> very bad, I really wanted to like it.
