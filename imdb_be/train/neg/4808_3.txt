Well, I've seen a lot of films associated with witches and the occult, but this was just amazing. The film begins as the cult of witches led to very bad Orson Welles, playing the role of the Constitution (if they could get someone that looked and behaved more Satanists) it just does not belong in this movie at all. But in any case, a new member of the coven takes stabs and a doll that resembles someone and making it there miscarrage. The lady that if miscarrage and her husband go to a place called Lillith on busness and the lady meanwhile sees the image of her sister or whatever he calls her and warn her to stay away from there, and will never use its authority there, or she will die . A pair after they get settled in a strange city discover that all the inhabitants of all the witches, and she becomes curious and afraid of their neighbors and friends. Then strange things start to happen, like a lady discovers burial taking place on the hill, suddenly disapears (which was terrible), as well as seeing the little boy who belongs to Orson Welles in playgroud, he later asks the house to help him back to life. The lady soon try to escape from the city, but only to find himself traped of its inhabitants and the authorities, and manifests itself by ignoring all that spirit tries to warn her about. This film is good, it has its moments of waiting, but it really could have done much better than Orson there.
