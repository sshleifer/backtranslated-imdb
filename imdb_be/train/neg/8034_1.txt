I know, grinding should always be a bad thing, but come on, this is hell? It's like a bunch of 10-year-old collected money for lunch and began to remove it before the end of his week. <br /> <br /> In any case, six young men, all go to the same house, to cut off screen.We have brainy one, whore, slut another, a black guy, a killer, stereotypes, how one gets that.After eaten by shaking the boat, the others all get prosecuted some guy who wears a mask of people in poor field a pretty decent murder rejected.There somewhere in the middle, but then he returned to an even greater sadness, and especially the false scares.Seriously, we actually we know that this can not be a killer when a person receives of because the guy really likes to take his sweet time for all. <br /> <br /> After each character you'd expect to die dies, the standard ugly blonde chick and her soon-to-be boyfriend eventually get captured killers (they are like, pushed down and then weak) and the killer reveals himself .I think that the authors of this film just took a bandage and a pen and put it somewhere in characters.The motif list just lame and do not even get me started on the goddamn secret.The killer then, of course, it will take way too long to explain all ( and then about ten minutes more, wherein he cuts his hand for some reason), and eventually gets crushed by a guy with a gun.Hey, entirely true! <br /> <br /> actually one of the worst films I have ever seen.I could enjoy myself more, watching Lindsay Lohan movie, I mean swear.I sure most 80-shredders sucked as well, but at least they threw in some-T & A.This film simply has nothing going for it.
