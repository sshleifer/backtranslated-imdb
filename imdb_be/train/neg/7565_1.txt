This film is the biggest waste of nine dollars that I have spent in a very, very long time. If you knew how often I go to the cinema, you would probably say that it's hard to imagine, but never least, it is not true! After watching the trailer of this film, I knew that I had to see it! If you're a fan of horror, mystery and suspense, why do not you? Trailer at least intriguing and exciting; Unfortunately, the film is not one of them. <br /> <br /> From the film, the script in action, this film is a complete failure. If you are reading this, planning to go to the cinema waiting for some thrills, mystery, action, horror, or anything other than waste an hour and forty five minutes, I'm afraid you will be disappointed. <, Br /> <br /> Â«Why is it so bad", you may ask yourself. Let me tell you. The film was neither mysterious nor suspenseful. Nothing about the film made me a little bit "on the edge" frightened or curious. The scenario was, at best, laughable. It has been many times in the course of the film, where the dialogue was just so funny, I started to write it as a comic figure out a few seconds later, it was not. The action was absolutely horrible. Like Nicolas Cage, but it was a mistake. Without exception, every performance in this movie was incredibly below average. Cinematography was terrible with not one moment of suspense or mystery. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can see at the end of the film a mile away. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually very severe critic. Honestly, when I go to see a comedy, I want to laugh, and when I go to see the mystery / suspense / horror, I just want to be surprised. This film was boring, poorly acted, poorly written, and the overwhelming frustration. Do yourself a favor and go see something else.
