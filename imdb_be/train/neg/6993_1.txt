What a terrible movie. I can not believe I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this remake. Tell me, please, why Ving Reims and Mehki Pfifer played a major role in this film? Mehki Pfifer largest in E.R and Ving Reims, probably did not know what he was doing. I feel terrible for them. Background music, I have to say did not fit AT ALLLLL with history, and it's amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no life in the creation of well-balanced and film. I hope that in the future no director as bad as it was one, could not break down in a large classic film. This film should not have been made in the first place. Advice to anyone who has seen it, please tell me I'm right, because I might not be the only viewer who does not like. <br /> <br /> BOOOOOO !!!!!!!! 10 -10.
