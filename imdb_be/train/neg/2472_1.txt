Anyone who actually had the opportunity to sit through this film and leave feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate the quality of movies. This film was an insult to watch, the direction was of high quality classroom film and cinematography. Blair Witch best cinematography, and I hate this step with enthusiasm! The storyline has the potential to be very intense very good film, but he fell from the first 10 minutes before the end of the film. Someone said that this film was about a child view, well, that's all well and good. But they still could have done better, that this scenario than what they did. I mean come on, the Indian in the shop. Or the child to look at a small idol and suddenly present, the Indian and the whole story about an Indian spirit called Wendy? That they mention the clerk and she accidentally says that no one except me, that works here, so you think, well horrible scenario ghost, but then it just swaps in the amount on the idol, and we forget about the young child, seeing this guy, It was so lame, that is beyond pathetic. The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital, but also with a sense of OMG !!! Why the hell did I just waste my time watching it !! This is a step that I recommend not to watch, there is definitely the best quality movies out there that do not insult your intelligence! Thank God, I never had to pay to see this movie, I would have demanded my money back! For those who are easily entertained by this movie .... it is very sad that you lower your standards to this level of filmmaking is really to say that it was a good movie.
