Scruffy filmmaker brainless comedy, which is supposedly a substitute for the "classic" 50s "alien invasion" movies, but really no better than they are, with the exception, of course, in a purely technical department (good makeup effects). And any cheating, what is worse than its purpose is doomed to failure ( "Casino Royale", "Our Man Flint" worse than almost any movie James Bond). After two hours of hearing screeching voices of foreigners, you will ask for some peace and quiet. (* 1/2)
