Firstly, let me say that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd; That's why I was curious to check it out, her debut role. No argument that her talent is evident in her performance perfectly. I believe I can also see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. Nevertheless, I like to think that movies are designed to amuse us, and that is where the film fails. <br /> <br /> According to the halfway point, I thought, "What else do we have to look boring shop girl standing idly around the abandoned gift shop, moving the product? "It seemed like forever! <br /> <br /> Then I thought, maybe this is one of those movies where the director is trying to lull the audience into a relaxed state, before you hit them with some dynamic event. No such luck. The film is still soft, sad, monotonous story all the way through. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying this because I'm an addict effect. I love all kinds of movies, especially romantic comedies. But I'm waiting to be entertained. <br /> <br /> Add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality comparable to a bad home movies neighbor. Depressing! <br /> <br /> I just do not understand how someone could like this film. Zero-entertainment value. The longest 114 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
