In 1957 (yes, this is the correct date) production J. Arthur Rank and James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfrid Hyde-White; it must be deafening comedy, right? Oh, it's just awful. This is one gag movie: Watch people will be shocked to see a small alligator. Music is thrown into the most obscene and forgettably. Jeannie Carson lively dancer and singer competent. But what is she doing in this film? Diane Dorsey here too, providing a so bold frames for use in the preview. Its action level is not bad, but it's in the film to provide a lifeline to someone. Well, we must do something next moaned during this film. The film is sold on VHS are now people on E-Bay. Save yourself the cost and waste of time. Comedy without laughter. Musical without the memorable song or dance.
