The film is worth watching only if you stop it in half an hour. It does not begin with a fun conversation at the bar, and makes one expect a good, funny story ahead. Well, I can tell you that it will not. It will deteriorate in a few minutes into the film that challenges your patience and your sense of shame for the actor to extend you probably will not be pleased to see. <br /> <br /> In an interview I heard that the director wanted to express in this film a sense of loss of identity, which, according to him, the majority of people in a globalizing world experience. I was amazed to hear this. Can I live in the same world in which he lives? OK a lot of people go in the same clothes as the mine and listen to the same music, and all, but that does not make me feel like I'm losing my identity. What Khrzhanosvky think that we are nothing more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch? Can I short-sighted or it <br /> <br /> Well my voice: a good beginning of the film saves it from getting 1 decent 4 my conclusion.
