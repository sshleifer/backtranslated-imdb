Having searched this film, high and low, I really found it, when I least expected it, playing on the Sundance Channel is very early in the morning one day. Why I searched endlessly for a small vanity project that Chuck Barris, which was made in recent years, the extinction of the TV show, I do not have a clue. The film just put random. The script part that deals with the week, that is. Of course, the highlight of the film sees the real artists who were "too hot for TV" or rejected for one reason or another. That part is still terrible, but bad mannerisms, which was nice in its own way. Now, when I saw that I was looking for so long, I'll watch it again in my life? Resounding NO !! Do yourself a favor and just look a lot better, "Confessions of a Dangerous" or find old copies of the actual show. Girl act where only fruit provocatively licking was fun, but you have to endure seeing Jay P. Morgon flash the audience is likely to make me sterile. Looking back, I'm so happy that it was a massive failure, as if it was a hit, would be "to $ 1,98 Beauty Show MovieÂ» and that my friends is sure to bring on the Apocalypse. <, Br /> <br /> My rating: D
