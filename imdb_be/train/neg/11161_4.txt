"Nacho Libre" (2006) <br /> <br /> Director: Jared Hess <br /> <br /> Starring: Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, Hector Jimenez, & Darius Rose <br /> <br /> Evaluation MPAA: «PG-13" (for some rough action, and crude humor including dialogue) <br /> <br /> Say what you will about it (I know some people who despise him no end) but I always thought that "Napoleon Dynamite" was a funny movie - not the bright brick on the wall, but a funny movie, nonetheless Jack Black is also very funny man -. annoying at times, and massively overpriced teen viewers who almost paklanyayuts Xia him, but it is ridiculous. There was rarely Jack Black comedy, which I did not like to some extent. Therefore, I was very pleased to hear that Jared Hess, writer and director of "Napoleon Dynamite," and Jack Black will be united film a Spanish monk who becomes a fighter in order to save an orphanage. Only my reservation that the story seemed a bit too thin. Unfortunately, one of my reservation was the collapse of the entire film. This story, if it were done as a parody on some shows such as «Saturday Night Live», or perhaps even «Mad TV», would have worked flawlessly. Unfortunately, the story takes place is too thin for the approximate half hour runtime, and this is one comedy joke falls flat. <br /> <br /> Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a pious man of the Lord. Feeling shunned the entire monastery, Nij (black), is now the convent cook, decides to follow his dream to become a professional wrestler. As the monastic finances hit a record low, Nacho decides to join the tournament taking away so that he can win a cash prize and ensure good nutrition for the monastery shelter. This story sounds so sweet and caring. It seems like a perfect movie for Jack Black. Look what he did with the "School of Rock" in the end. Well, much to my displeasure, this area is almost completely destroyed by the offensive and crude humor that just takes away from the heart of the film. This again is a way to show Hollywood that they feel that young viewers will understand just fart jokes and silly humor ?? Of course, as far as I know, maybe it is the general view of teenagers, as many seemed to enjoy this film. Watching obese women walk like a mouse on the floor, of course, make people laugh, but do not expect to get a reward for putting it in the film. Seven-year-old can make the same joke. <br /> <br /> performance in «Nacho Libre» is actually good. Jack Black once again proves that he is absolutely hilarious, and that it can make even the most stupid, insignificant line ever on comic paper. Unfortunately, this movie just was not enough for him. He did not give him anything to go on, and the only reason any of his jokes work because of it. I've never seen or heard well de l Reger, but now I can say that it is not only very talented, but she is also one of the most beautiful women to ever graced my vision. It just clicked in the role, and it worked perfectly well. Hector Jimenez, who plays bumbling His partner, Esqueleto, kept me laughing all the time. He has done a very good job, and it was very effective if the partner of Jack Black. Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named chancho, did not have many lines, but what can I say, I just enjoyed it. He was the favorite. Other actors have done their job. Unfortunately, they have been spent on such a poor film. <br /> <br /> «Nacho Libre" simply does not work. Its plot is stretched too thin. The heart of it all dirty on the zany humor and disgusting jokes that simply do not work. I rarely laugh, and if I did, it was because of Jack Black or any other cast member. And that brings me to the bright side, "Nacho Libre": so cast. This roll was just ?? Well, due to the lack of a better word, they were on. They all clicked, have excellent chemistry together, and pumped as much life as possible in the flat script. After Jared Hess in "Napoleon Dynamite" made me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the film, I was surprised to find myself so often annoying "Nacho Libre." Something's been lost, and I still do not understand what it was. All I know, "Nacho Libre" is not a good movie, and yet, because of his cast, he was quite useless. There is little reason to look, if only to watch Jack Black work. But if you're not a fan of Jack Black, then avoid this film like the plague. I like the black, but I'm done with this film and with this survey <br /> <br /> Final thought :. Yikes! This is Jared Hess strangely disappointing follow-up to its hysterical "Napoleon Dynamite" <br /> <br /> Overall :. 4/10 (C +)
