Weissmuller Tarzan movie ending is quite weak. There are some things that disrupt the movie. <br /> <br /> The first Tarzan spends most of the movie wearing floppy sandals. In my opinion, any shoe Tarzan, whether it be sandals or shoes, as is sometimes painted, takes away from the character, which is to be anti-civilization and the jungle. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the nature with Benji, as mentioned in a previous post, completely tear film as a comic foil. For me, his character is not necessary to the plot of the film. <br /> <br /> In addition, while more cuts Weissmuller Tarzan commanding figure, it is evident that he was not in his best form. Although in his later Jungle Jim movie, his physique was slightly improved from this film. <br /> <br /> Octopus battle terrific idea, but I think it should have been done in the previous film Weissmuller, when he was at his physical peak. Similarly, a battle that takes only 30 seconds, tops, it would be much more exciting when he reached for 90 seconds to 2 minutes, as a classic battle a giant crocodile in Tarzan and his mate. <br /> <br /> And while Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian, Mara overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye, it is not possible to save this last Weissmuller film - disappointing ending to a great run character.
