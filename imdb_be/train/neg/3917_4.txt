"House of the Spirits" is pretty awful. I live in South America, in a country that has suffered a military dictatorship as well as one film tries to describe, and even though everyone knows, the films may be far away from reality, this particular film belongs to the audience, as well as the ignorant and foolish. Things are not so simple and linear as represented here, and, of course, a political process is much more complex and interesting that the story in the "house ...". If you can not show that the complexity of the screen is better not to make a film at all. There are many examples of how policy can be taken seriously in a movie, not a lot of platitudes. In some parts, I felt like Carmen Miranda may appear in parrots and palm trees. If you talk about some of the things you should not only be careful, but with respect for the intelligence of your audience.
