It was nice to see the familiar figure again, but the story bothered me. We loved the Ariel in the first film, so why should the second one about her daughters? New characters were annoying, and I did not like this story. Worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not return as the voice of Eric! Disney, please stop remaking classic films with these shoddy fakes.
