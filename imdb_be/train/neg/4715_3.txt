I recently watched Johnny Test to try to find the humor in it. I failed trying. Cartoon Network, as a rule, tends to make them enjoyable show all viewers, but Johnny Test "entertainment" in the lowest form. Drafting incredibly predictable, and those who escaped the gag is not a lot of jokes at all. Kids will love it, and that's about it. <br /> <br /> At the present time, it does not mean that everything is bad. The original opening theme was actually very catchy, but for some reason they took his skeleton and figuratively broke his imaginative aluminum bat. It's a shame, because it was actually one of the best things he has going for it. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters could be very interesting in theory. With a little work, the characters could work together, but they are too one-dimensional. Again, this makes it easy for children to follow. <br /> <br /> The pace a little too quickly, as well. Episodes are too busy, leaving little time for a reasonable letter. It's a real shame, because there are so many interesting concepts that show display. On the upside, however, is fast paced will stop the child from the loss of interest, and this is really the fullness of the target audience. <br /> <br /> In general, the show looks very good on paper, but you can not be funny or interesting. This is the show I want to like, but I'm not in a position to. There's just so much that the potential is not realized. The kids will enjoy it, but that's about it.
