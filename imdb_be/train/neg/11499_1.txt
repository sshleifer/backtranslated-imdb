Gadar really dumb movie, because he says fake story.It too unrealistic and is a typical Sunny Deol film, which is directed to bash Pakistan.The purpose of the film is to mislead the viewer, so that they can think of Pakistan and this government is bad but trying to hide their own shortcomings are work.And songs and music from the film are all bad.Most probably Sikhs will love of film, because they are currently misguided.The movie sucks and sucks with vigor. I think that only Amisha Patel was good in the film. If I can give 0 out of 10 I would, but the most low 1.Please 3:00 save lives and not to look that stupid sad movie .Disaster.
