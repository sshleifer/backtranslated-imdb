I do not know much about Tobe Hooper, or why he gets his name in the title, but perhaps it should not be disturbed. As already mentioned another commentator, is actually not enough horror or sensuality to bring in fans of any genre. The plot is incoherent, the sequence of Sade are free, and most of the existing so-so. Englund makes every effort with a weak material and Zoe Trilling is very bottom, but not enough to carry the film. This is one over this tape. Evaluation: F
