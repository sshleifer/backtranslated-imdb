If it were not for some immature gullible idiot I know, insisting that I watch this "documentary" I never would have seen this comedy! This film is full of bad scenarios and ridiculous moments. One in particular, where the Afghan police / soldiers arrested Don Larson for filming on the streets while they allow the cameraman to conduct shooting for his arrest, and then drive off, still shooting is supposed to be in his plush hotel. Then there is a scene where the car crashed into another vehicle, which was upside down and parked nicely on the roadside without any evidence that as a result of an accident or explosion. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised it has now received a rating (5.8 / 10). I thought the IMDb users have more sense.
