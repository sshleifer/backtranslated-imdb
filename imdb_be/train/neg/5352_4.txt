Honey, I Shrunk the Kids franchise has been a huge deal, and not to mention very famous. I loved the Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, when I was little. It was the original story and had such a fascinating story! Sets were so strange and cast it seemed like they were enjoying each other's company. Now Honey, I blew up the baby was pretty stupid, so I think they would like to go back to the story that everyone loved. <br /> <br /> In fact, Adam rose slightly at the moment and my mother is going to leave, to leave their husband with their children. But when a favorite item Wayne is at risk for dust, he wants to reduce it and to keep it, but he and his brother get in the way. But if the spouses are returning after forgetting to give some medications for their son, they are caught in the car, and leaving their children alone at home! <br /> <br /> The plot is silly, but as I said, this is just a family movie that I think some of them may get hit with. The original Honey, I Shrunk the Kids better, I think everyone can agree. The third one was not so bad, I would recommend that, at least over honey, I blew up the movie Babe, it was at least a little more fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
