The second film in the box set. Initially, these bloodsucking, this movie was pretty average. It's kind of sad in some parts, but there are some good gore effects, but they are not great, though. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the year 2210. Vampires are pretty much taken over the world. V-SAN (Vampire sanitation) composition, which also has its own spacecraft and manages Churchill, who is passionate about vampires, receives a message from Earth and teams formed by Quintana (played by a very hot Natassia Malthe), a rookie officer Damian and rebels Roses and Romance (Roman played by Aaron Pearl guilt guilty.) V-SAN later met with the leader of the vampires mucous played by Michael Ironside from Total Recall. He has no plans to live in peace with the people, as it meanders on world domination. <br /> <br /> While the film was not a waste of time, I doubt that I'll put back into the DVD-player in the near future.
