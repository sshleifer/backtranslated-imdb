This is one of the most rotten movies 90s. I would not recommend it unless you have something better to do. <br /> <br /> This picture is of African-Americans as savage, uncivilized, violent, inarticulate, reefer-smoking psychopaths. Fudge (Ice Cube) and his team of sidekicks continuously disrespectful to the others in the dorm, and not only white people, but also Asians, and never disciplined for their actions. Despite all of that tolerance, they continue to whine and cry about the evil white oppressors who govern their lives and stand in their way. In fact, this effect Fudge, which causes Remmy for communication with the skinhead, drop out of college, and eventually kill her friend. <br /> <br /> Malik Skinheads is presented in the form of a hidden group of laggards who share a pillow from the campus and generally stay away from everyone else. They never compromise its music to annoy people and they do not tease the police. They commit serious crimes, such as rape and battery, but they are not as repulsive as a threat or as Fudge and dreadlocks (Busta Rhymes) is. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of stuff in this movie, which is almost offended me or made me giggle. Some of them are as follows. <br /> <br /> Fudge and Dreads are formulated in the form of university students in Columbus until we see them in the classroom, and it is unclear how they pay for tuition. One only remains to assume that marijuana smoke has something to do with your finances. Although they are students, that looks like a private university, they can not speak a single line of correct English. /> It turns out that drunk Kristen (Kristy Swanson) know why a drunken Billy took her to his house Their characters develop only through their obsessive nagging and xenophobia. <br /> <br. She even asked him to get the tires so that they can start. The fact that he penetrated her without a condom was the rape while it would be great sex, but if he had one handy. Later, Kristen guaranteed Taryn (Connell) that it is not liable in the matter, and, in spite of the illegally jumping in bed Man she was not ready to have sex and angrily took advantage of a sexual predator. Then after a week or so later, she met and slept with ultra-sensitive benefactor, who knew how to avoid rape and brought a condom. Director stressed contraception carefully. <br /> <br /> This film is complete and total waste, which makes black people look like injections and woman look ridiculous and fragile. actor Cole Hauser, Laurence Fishburne and accent are the only reasons I can think of is to watch it. Writer / director, obviously, a person of limited intelligence. Go ahead and limit their own, watching this shit, if you wish, but keep in mind that the neurons do not grow back. Just follow the tips at the end, and to unlearn.
