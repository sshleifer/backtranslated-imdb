"Cement" bad film of the bad cop (Penn) with a bad attitude and bad location, which is the bad guy in a bad condition before his cajones in quick-drying concrete. While we expect the cement to dry and the film to find out what it is, we occasionally snatch back in time, without rhyme or reason, so that we could watch the events that led to cement things. Sad junk Flick as a whole, "Cement" suffers from a lack of history, clumsy execution, and that the most common fractures in filmdom; there is no reason to care. time killer for those who need a homebody at best.
