There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? And why they're doing this movie BAD ??? The premise is absurd. The third action is one-dimensional. Special effects are exaggerated. And the film is one endless skirmish between some lousy shots Hollywood ever created. But then, if they were good shots, everyone would be dead within the first five minutes and there would be no film. It is a pity that there is not. It is tempting to eliminate it several times, I stuck with it, to see how bad it can get. I am glad that I did because (SPOILER?) The last line is the crown of all the stupidity sluggish, dull scenario.It not even worthy of a second indication state to be screwed into the third speed in the offseason. In addition to the general awfulness of the film, I am deeply worried about its effect on young viewers. Americans crank out crap like this and then wonder why events such as the Columbine happen. It's really corny movies on Brobdingnagian proportions!
