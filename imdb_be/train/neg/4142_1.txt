This is the absolute worst film I've ever seen !! There was absolutely nothing good to say about this film. I've seen some bad movies, but this one takes. There is no plot, and a big part of the movie you are either fast forwarding the film to make it faster, or you are wondering what the hell was going on because you can not seriously think that someone thought about this film, and you look at it. I feel sorry for those who have to sit through this painful hour and a half. Please take my advice i do not look this film, because I know you'll think this is the biggest waste of time you've ever spent in my life.
