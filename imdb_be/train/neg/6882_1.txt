I hated that Ms. Perez drew a Puerto Rican! We are not all the ghetto - and we speak Spanish-Puerto Rican sun! I can not speak for uneducated people you come across. But our language is intact, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is better economically than any other Caribbean island! I am glad that we do not like Cuba, the Dominican Republic and Haiti, free of American influence? Fluent in true poverty, rather than the US poverty standard. We are not victims, we are flexible, modest, honest and intelligent people. Our pedigree does include a strong African roots, but not the "blackÂ» roots- I do not have anything to do with blacks 9do studies). <br /> <br /> The analogies between Pedro Albizu, Che Guevarra and Martin L. King could no longer on the sign. <br /> <br /> MLK was a great hero of the true revolutionary and honest man, who saw the day when we will all be free. <br /> <br /> Che Guevarra helped create Castro in Cuba today, that is why the boat fulls Cubans to risk their lives to come to America-because Che is the best place for them? You have been a great, amazing, bright idea, but you are too much politicized it. We have so many things to be proud of people - not disgrace to our people victimized us. I do not Nuyorican and perhaps why I can not share your opinion. I'm Puerto Rican, I speak Spanish, I'm not a victim, and I was able to accomplish many of my goals in America. If there is a part 2 in the future - less politics more stories, more stories Triumph has a lot of <br /> <br /> Damaris Maldonado.
