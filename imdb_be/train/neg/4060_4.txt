Cat of nine tails (Il Gatto Nove Code) <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 2.35: 1 (Cromoscope) <br /> <br /> Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> ( 35mm and 70mm release prints) <br /> <br /> blind ex-journalist (Karl Malden) overhears a plot to blackmail is in the research laboratory of genetics and follow instructions from a fellow reporter (James Francis) to investigate a series of murders in the lab, unwittingly placing their loved ones to the mercy of a psychopath killer. <br /> <br /> I rushed into production after the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1969), Dario Argento conceived cat of nine tails as a thriller Giallo-in much the same vein as its predecessor, toplining famous Hollywood actor Karl Malden - fresh from his appearance in PATTON (1969) - and a rising star Franciscus (Gwang Valley). Unfortunately, with the result that the film - which argued that advertising was "nine times more suspenseful" rather than "bird" - a disappointing sequel, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too plodding, and pointless for the general <br consumption /> <br. /> Malden and Francis eminently watchable in nice roles, and cinematographer Enrique Menczer (dead ALIVE) uses a wide Cromoscope frame to transfer hi-tech world where dark heart Argento scenario unfolds, but the scene with the euro Starlet Catherine Spaak ( corruption) as Francis romantic interest is a little more than an unnecessary filling. Highlights include the memorable meeting with the black-gloved killer in a crowded train station (edited by ensuring smooth cult tall Franco Fratiselli) and night episode in which Francis Molde and look for an important clue in the coffin of rot and fall victim to the insidious killer intrigue. But, despite these flashes of brilliance, the film wanders aimlessly from one scene to another, simmer gently, never exactly suited to a boil. It is not surprising that the "Cat" was unable to repeat the stunning success of "bird" when released in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
