Shame Shame Shame on UA ​​/ DW for what you do! <br /> <br /> I was shocked. <br /> <br /> Do not take children to see this movie. Humor is not suitable for children - and they'll get bored and frustrated. * Of course we all have * read a wonderful book, children, Theo and of course, we have expectations ... but it's pure garbage. Dr. Seuss would have been ashamed, and, of course, never would I not have given his "fingers" on a vile attempt to cash in on a classic. <br /> <br /> What a pity. <br /> <br /> Spend your money on books. If you have a copy, and then buy the book and give it to the toys for Small program. This film is not worth the "free" viewing tickets. <br /> <br /> Stick to the book. TV cartoon version works well if you want a visual picture - save your money ... seriously. Save your money - it will be on cable Happy St. Patty <br /> <br /> Shame shame shame on what they are doing !!.
