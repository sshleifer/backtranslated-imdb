this family attempt to ABC's hit thriller "cheaper than a dozen" comes opposite number a template dialogue, shallow storylines and cheese return. Of the approximately two good actors among many Wanna-be, this film was the biggest disappointment. His Hollywood wannabe Ditto with the already bad story. Then, because they need a lot of actors, which means that they are likely to be more lenient. Thus, the current is not five stars. The plot moves quickly enough, and turns were poor and had terrible timing. Connection signs and "final relationship" was too soft and the pattern for me. Rid yourself and shoot something better.
