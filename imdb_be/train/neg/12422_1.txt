I made this film to see what could be bloody, the film does not stop action and got it too sentimental and super cheap low budget action-drama that makes kickboxers look nut. Reb A, and it is located in Vietnam and as Lou saves Reb from strabismus, he gets a bullet in the head that is easily one of the worst effects ever. Vietnam scenes are shot in some back yard, I swear! L is now brain damaged and Reb and he lives together and a private bar. Super homoerotic. Lou persuaded to fight in the cage for the money and Reb goes on killing spree to get it back. There's no good fight scenes in all punch two inches from the man. Characters faces change in seconds. One guy was bad and in the next scene he is well. Acts and music reverse some overly sentimental Frank Stallone sounding songs that would make you sick. I hated this movie.
