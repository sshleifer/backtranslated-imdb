I almost always was against the inclusion of the songs in the film. My belief is that the quality of the film will automatically improve if only a very annoying song will be dismissed. Nevertheless, the situation quickly changed after watching this terrible black (not songs) & the film, Page 3 (number of songs). While Black was weak in the extreme, Page 3 provides a fascinating history with some strong acting and the right direction. The songs were almost by accident and is mixed with the film is almost seamless. There is, of course, is not whether the woman getting sprayed with water for no apparent reason from mysterious sources of water and spinning wildly in the streets at night. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the bold and shameless approach used by the director, there was no cover up anything and almost every scene was entirely believable. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to the Hindi-speaking people, at least a little understanding of the life of Mumbai. The former, because the English subtitling was below par and contained many errors, which, at times, quite the opposite value of the actual application. Last, because you will surely appreciate the accuracy of the description, once you have lived by himself. <br /> <br /> I would definitely rank it as a work worthy of international recognition. Scenes from gossiping drivers were nice touch and at the same time he served as a source of genuine humor and a different perspective on the whole mess. The film does not fall short in a few areas, though, where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things that distract from the general direction of the film. <br /> <br /> I also thought that it was time of the sad scene was not done very well. It was a touch of fun to watch, and do not cause any feelings of sadness, and the whole scene, tend to come across as a bit ridiculous. These minor issues, though, because the film, as a whole, it is really a rare treat to watch. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a cynical, pessimistic outlook and refreshing one at that! Actors rather than "heroes" - this is the key. Opportunity to look believable person in an emergency situation - in everyday life. Behind the scenes look at the extent of corruption and a rare ray of hope for Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
