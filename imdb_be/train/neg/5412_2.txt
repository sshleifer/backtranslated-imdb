Pyare Mohan can be safely included in the black list of one of the world's worst films made by mankind. The film, one of the many disabled people are clicks that occurred after the phenomenal success of the black fraternity makes a mockery disabled. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are merely caricatures of people with disabilities. While Black reflects a feeling of pity and emotion of a disabled woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two Desperado's, like monkeys, who do not have any doubt about the disabled and bash half of the world to protect their love interests. Malik music well fair enough. Vivek Oberoi, who has made a promising start with Saathiya, unfortunately loses their eggs soon in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan was never acceptable actor and deserves to be expelled from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol just pretty girls in trouble, with nightmarish times in Thialnd anyone to save them - to the above except for the thugs. Bohm Iran, as a criminal Don Toni, more acceptable. Avoid film, if possible.
