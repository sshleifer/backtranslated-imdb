well. to begin with, the taxi driver is strange. This is not a taxi driver, or strange. it's bad. but I thought it was funny bad, which means that it had some redeeming qualities. as a dialogue ... wow. there was no more or less than any of the plot, all the characters were stupid, and the film was instructive. there were some places were I thought the film would be to dive in the type of violence is a taxi driver who would get a message at the end of the film in the head much more difficult. I can not even believe that there are 20 other people who have seen the film. yes, it's worth watching if you're a real boring, and you want to confirm the fact that anyone can make a movie, or at least you can try.
