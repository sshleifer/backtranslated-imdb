I recently watched this movie on DVD, and I have to say I was not impressed. I know that it is a taboo to knock independent films, but this one felt deprived of entertainment. <br /> <br /> The room was interesting, but its execution is justified. I thought, "Well, they're just getting into it, the story will pick up in the near future." Before I knew it, the film was finished, and the story is never raised. I can not say that I found that works all that impressive ever. It was pretty bad. Nya Star Wars prequel trilogy bad, but bad nonetheless. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that the work was, I believe, that two hours (because it is a safe estimate). Anyway, when the film was over, I felt like I deserved a recognition of the strength of will I find myself in a movie and do not stop retreating halfway. <br /> <br /> Again, I was very impressed, and eventually bored out of my wits. I'm not one of those who require swift action and explosions in the movie, so do not start on me, how to be a reason not to love it.
