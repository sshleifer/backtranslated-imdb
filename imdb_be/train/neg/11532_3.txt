I rented that movie that night, because neither my friend or I never saw it, although we have heard from a mutual friend, as "it was great." <br /> <br /> At the moment, I'm pretty conservative in their views, but I knew going in it would be rather liberal view of who sent it. I thought that before the film became Michael Douglas will play a sympathetic liberal favorite popular masses, and would not be boring conservative rival, his antagonist. But I thought that the one where the political statement will start and end <br /> <br /> Well, the plot was solid :. Single president falls to the lobbyist. Well, it has the potential, I thought it would be quite interesting, because the story was unique. But then the film became a liberal commercial. The film became more gun control and environmental protection, than it was about the relationship between the President and Sidney (Annette Bening) <br /> <br /> There were a few funny premise in this film :. 1) The character of Sydney to play the six-digit lobbyist, which is "closer". Can it be more volatile? She always was disorganized and seemed to be in fear of everything. Hardly "closer". I sales, and she could not "close" to sell a glass of water to the dying of thirst. <br /> <br /> 2) Second, is there anything more absurd than Richard Dreyfuss plays a right-wing fanatic? This is the most liberal people in Hollywood, and she plays a right-wing ideologue. Give me a break. I liked how he took his conservative character and made him a sinister, as far as possible. <br /> <br /> 3) We are at the end it was just ridiculous. The line of "I'm proud member of the ACLU transfer cardÂ» was a joke. Firstly, no president will never accept that something like that as an active member of the ultra marginal group. Secondly, why even bring something like. You just alienated from more than half of the film there is an audience that is moderate or conservative. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was great and unique. I thought that Michael Douglas was a good choice as president. But the film has gone from "movies" on the left wing of the political declaration, so the film is not a success. <br /> <br /> It's a shame to see a large portion of the ruined Hollywood to make their political views on the audience
