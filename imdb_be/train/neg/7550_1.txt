Okay, so I'm the original Wicker Man fan, and I usually do not like British films remade Americans, so why oh why do I put myself through the most painful experiences a movie sometime? I am not a supporter of Nicolas Cage and I had some kind of moment of madness, perhaps? The movie was terrible! Bit at the beginning with an accident / fire has no relation to the film in general, and female police officer knew where Edward is going, so a little bit at the end with two girls who visit the mainland, well, it would not have happened, how it would be investigated. History of The Wicker Man was not really explored - and I think being installed in the United States does not really help the whole theme of the pagan. This film was slow and did not contain any atmosphere or suspense. I must say that the best bit was the very end, when Nicolas Cage is on fire! I'm in a desperate need to see the original now again to clear his soul disappointed. I really can not emphasize how disappointing this film, please see if you: <br /> <br /> A) I do not like the American re-brand British movies B) a supporter of the original C) Nicolas Cage Hate
