Star Rating: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal record, had problems with alcohol and Now it formed the habit of drugs, making it paranoid and prone to violence in the family of his wife Valerie (Kathy Burke), who tries to keep the family together, but ends up leaving more litter. Meanwhile, her mother Janet (Laila Morse) knows son Ray, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and escalating drug addiction, which sends it to the rails. These films despairable characters as they tredge with their lives. <br /> <br /> It is said that the British seem to like being miserable, and that will include watching movies that entertain them so. Films such as Nil mouth to emphasize this. This is the story of a dysfunctional family, torn apart by crime, poverty, drinking and drugs, such as Jeremy Kyle lap, the three dishes. In addition, in essence, the story of the self-destructive people, three generations from each other and each other up, tearing families apart, and women try to hold it together, despite not being strong enough. If you take a little bit of what we are talking about the displaced, you can see that this is not going to be fun watching from the beginning, and it certainly does not disappoint in this. <br /> <br /> It is true that everyone was talking about performances, and guest stars, Winstone and Burke, do bring a lot of action. We see Winstone lose him and his wife by beating her senseless after some more coke-induced paranoia, breaking in the course of a telephone conversation with her, and the unleashing of a typical arsenal of F and t said when she refuses to allow him to see his child. In addition, in a private moment, we see Burke could lose his composure on the stairs, the full impact of the night before kicking in. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where there is no "plot" to follow, as such, a real life feel this hopeless life carrier from one day to the next. It was recognized by many (including BAFTAs!), But it was really too dark and bleak to me. I have no right to criticize him for it, knowing that I knew about it from the displaced, but, unfortunately, this is how I found it. **
