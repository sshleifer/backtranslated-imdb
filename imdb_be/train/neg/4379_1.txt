<br /> <br /> Okay, well I shot this film while I jumped on the bed covered painkillers, and let me say, it did not help any film. <br /> <br /> The film is about a man who buys a car, he is going through a midlife crisis, he loves the car more than anything around him, one day, when his wife decides to take the car. Since I do not want to spoil (not that there was anything spoil) I let your imagination find out «Zany» (and I use that word lightly) antics that follow. <br /> <br /> I had to fight not to sleep through the snoring sleeper minute movie, and I would say that if you are venturing into the movie store and thinking about the adventure, please do not, it's empty waste of the film that was printing. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I could be wrong ...
