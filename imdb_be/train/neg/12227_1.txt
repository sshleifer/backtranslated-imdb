This may be the worst movie ever made, and maybe worth a look just for that reason. Streisand ridiculously unbelievable, as a young woman posing as a man in order to study Judaism. Soundtrack tortuous, showing Barbara belting some of the weakest chatter ever put on film. And do not even get me started on the site. You really get more laughs from this film than in many comedies, because it is soooooooo scary. Streisand rampant ego, thinking that she might some way to lift this bitch Oscar height, led to the crash. I am sure that the novelist Isaac Bashevis Singer, hated the movie and never forgave Streisand. I can not blame him. This film is like watching a car crash in slow motion for two hours with a soundtrack of "The Sound of Music," played in reverse on an old turntable. It really is that bad. I'm surprised that someone from Streisand liked this movie at that level, which it is intended.
