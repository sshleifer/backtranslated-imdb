This is not entirely a bad film. Section (a new house built in the neighborhood seems to be haunted) is not bad, awful mood sufficient and valid in order. The big problem I have is that, being familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle (of Twin Peaks and other shows), I could not get over how she looks different with her, apparently new, big lips. I continued to look at them. They look so out of place on her face! They make it look completely different (and better). <br /> <br /> Gosselaar, the actor who plays Kim architect who designs and pours his heart and soul into the house, does an excellent job. And Lara (as the Col) is also quite good (but those lips!) As the owner of a neighboring house. Her husband, Walker (Colin Ferguson) is appropriate wood. Different characters, who live in the house, too, were in order. I especially liked the cake (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Amell), the first people to move into the house. The attempt to draw us into Wiebe fails general vicinity, unfortunately, like other neighbors do not particularly pretty. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the director could not make the "ghosts" the house is particularly ominous. Other films (such as The Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) it is possible to achieve this feeling of a ghost, but it just does not happen here. Nearest if Col draws house picture. <br /> <br /> Another thing that works for me is a plot twist that happens to Kim, architect. Initially, it seems, the victim of a house, as well as other (she sucked it dry inspiration), but later he seems to have joined forces with them in evil. <br /> <br /> Overall, not bad for a horror movie lovers, if you can take your eyes off those big lips!
