The only good thing about this movie was Goldie Hawn shot, standing in her small French cut bikini panties and struggled to hold a dozen other women corrupted by removing poor little cotton top, and she giggled and cooed. Ooooof! Her waist compete with Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen, and that shot nearly killed me. I have not forgotten about all the naughty Roladex hidden in my mind it as long as see it the other day on TV, where they actually washed her tummy in this scene, good grief, reminding me that the beauty of women Smokin Goldie Hawn was in the 80- ies. Kurt Russell had to have a merry life.
