I loved the look of the original Azogo with its combination of live action manga, causing the plot, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura rocks!), Editing, and not to mention the beautiful AE Ue, which filled the part perfectly. So I'm really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after finally saw him, I felt like I won the lottery and lost the ticket :( Azumi Azumi 2 picks up where left off, but it is quite two different films. the pace is much slower action is not as exciting and as well put, and there is not a lot of character development. this, apparently directed by the same guy responsible for the further reduction of the cost of the franchise monster TOHO (if possible!). I agree with some other previous reviewers who say that this vypushena Anaya opportunity. If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued the party. However, there are several beautiful Japanese forest scenery to look at while the slowly unfolding action, and we are introduced too short code bits, which quickly die from. Even the real bad guys are killed by too easily, without too much struggle. struggle Man Spider (right out of an episode monkeys!) in the bamboo forest was about ONL in memory fight. Whereas in Azuh 1 we had a climactic fight scene with a barrel of camera effects, Azue 2 brought us Azuy Cape camshaft !! Azoe riot at the end was inconclusive, but Aya still does the job well. She looks good in a raincoat ... but how did she get it from? I do not think I'll watch it again and again! ... what a shame.
