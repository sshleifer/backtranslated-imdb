While some of the scenes were realistic training, too many of them portrayed military trainers, ex-Nazi types. It is obvious that the people who wrote the play on the screen were either anti-war film type or write for that audience. <br /> <br /> I am a Vietnam vet, and even during this period, military instructors, who behaved in the way in which some of them would have done probably still serving time in a military prison. <br /> <br /> I really liked the scene where the "hero" and his friend (both private owners) sitting down in the office of the captain, smoking cigarettes and talking and arguing with the captain as if he was their friend. This kind of thing has never happened in training or in a formal situation, as it was for the purpose of the scene. <br /> <br /> In the end, I asked myself, "What is this movie?" as it seemed to wander around without a focus, but "I hate all the power." Thank God, I got it from the library and did not pay rent it out.
