Just what we need! Another remake of the old Hollywood movies with Eddie Murphy again miscast him the second time around after Nutty Professor (1996)! This shows why we're running out of special ideas for the creation of high-quality films, ladies and gentlemen! It has some signs of hope for its cute and lovely images of animals, which can act and talk to people. Things can only get worse, unfortunately. Bathroom jokes and sexual references kill this part of the "familyÂ» funfare instantly. Even parents and children saw the announcement trailer on The Family Channel, which was accompanied by a complete fear and loathing in the cinema. It is sad to say that this is a progressive pre-millennium era, but enjoy it while it lasts because things can only get worse with time. Most did not work out with a brand new DR. Doolittle. It is absolutely plotless feeling too flat. I hate that annoying voice of Chris Rock !!! We need more talented voice-over than a bunch of overpaid celebrities who do not want to declare bankruptcy. I have to agree in my local newspaper gives it Again, the original version was not good in the top five worst films in 1998, either. Murphy's next project may be Patton, if he is not careful!
