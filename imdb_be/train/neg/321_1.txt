Shecky, god damn legend, not to be mistaken. Until recently, I worked in the UK retail chain Hi-Fi and video works of their testing department. We would have to go through a lot of new starters, they will wait to see how the wine find various detritus, which returns as incapacitated in some of the shops. Now tortu ^^^^^ check the determination of the new employees, we would give them a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of the film, because every time when someone who bought a particular model GOODMANS DVD-player that had the movie as a gift, the round must send their DVD player ago, they never failed to send Shecky ago too. Our new staff will be forced to use only Going Overboard, to check the machine for any faults before they found a disk or two of their own to test with. <br /> <br /> Now, how and why this movie is so bad, where do I start? <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler, who can be so, so very funny, in Happy Gilmore, The Wedding Singer, or should have been having one hell of a weekend. The rest of the crew smelled, and it is with Billy Zane? Its culture in the name of some of the worst films of all time, and he's a decent actor. Crazy. The product quality is equal to absolute zero. <br /> <br /> I would be inclined to give it a zero if I could, because they do not even have the courage to call it its full name is "unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz 'on the issue. Even in this case, it is worth a look, so you can see how far Sandler came, and just how far he can go.
