I cheer for movies that fill the gaps in the subject area in the world cinema. So after watching the trailer for "Water lilies" I expected to like this film, because I thought I had stumbled upon something unique: a film that honestly reflects teenage lesbian love - a native female version «Beautiful Thing». <br /> <br /> The main characters of the young French women 15 years of age. Marie slim, discreet and rather tomboyish in a way; Floriane is output, sports and beautiful; and Anne loyal, plump and immature behavior. Erotic relationship between Marie and Florian always boils in the film, if not on the surface, and then a little later. <br /> <br /> «lily", however, is not about the dawn of lesbian love after two teenagers; it comes to sexual dissatisfaction, suffering, anguish, teens running on the cross-purposes, and - at least in two cases - a joyless, mechanical sex. It also proves that the writers and filmmakers have spoiled their own creation, when they become too manipulative. <br /> <br /> The extra features on the "Lord of the Flies," a DVD, directed by Peter Brook says, "begins with the cynicism of the French sex arousal," which means the French child is treated as an angel while they believe a teenager and an adult with the widespread cynicism. Part of the fall of this film directed by Celine Shiamma has swallowed a strong dose of cynicism. <br /> <br /> «Where is the joy?" I asked myself while watching this film. Thus, the first love can be painful and disappointing, but it can also be joyful and triumphant erotic fresh, life-affirming way. These positive aspects are absent from the film; There is no balance. <br /> <br /> Organically, this film wants to be a poignant celebration of first love. But Sciamma too impressed with her own cynicism and wit and ruining the film. Firstly, what is the point show the chubby girl nude? I know that there is an established tradition of elegant teen nudity in European cinema, as evidenced by such films as «The Slingshot; The Rascals; The devil, probably, little thief; heart murmur, one; Beau Feather "and" Europa, Europa is ", but this is a small copy of the author's invasion -" Look, the audience, I can do a film where I show the unattractive nude man. "Or no nudity or nudity evenly distributed would not be fair . by <br /> <br /> There is a scene in a club where Floriane and Marie dance that should continue, not only Floriane cynically manipulates Marie;. this filmmaker Sciamma cynically manipulates its audience <br /> <br />. perhaps the greatest betrayal of the authenticity and integrity of the organic occurs when Marie Floriane warns that she is going to ask what it is "not normal." Mary realized asks, "Who cares about that, right?" Then lie Sciamma plays with her audience and racing pulse of the film because the query is false Floriane, derivatives and substitute question - not a real, hearty question the movie, the character of Marie, and viewers who have invested their time deserve <br /> <br /> There are also two things that rattle false on the viewer's nerves: 1) since when did the French - with. all people - take a bath wearing bathing suits, and the tortoise in the bargain? 2) What is a teenager - of any nationality - would gnaw down the apple core that was thrown in the garbage to get the taste in your mouth <br /> <br /> The three main favorite actresses are promising, and when? they are the best vehicles for their talents, can become an excellent actor. Louise Blachere (Anne) is the best actress in terms of technology and can have a successful career in a supporting role. Adèle Haenel (Floriane) can become a leading lady, or a bomb, or both. Pauline Acquart (Marie) has intensity and magnetism that are error-free. In the future it could play everything from emotionally crippled librarian mysteriously sensual seductress reluctant politician riding a rapid growth in acceptance. <br /> <br /> In general, the "Water Lilies" was very disappointing. Honest filmmaker will please a real movie about two young women fall in love! No - not necessarily for this middle-aged guy - but a very young girl lesbians can have something of quality, they can watch and identify with. And so, to fill a gap in the objective world of cinema.
