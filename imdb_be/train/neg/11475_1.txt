A film that makes you want to throw himself on his sword. I saw schlock at the time, but after watching the helpless confusion, I do not think I ever can be seen as another film again. May God have mercy on the souls who made it. <br /> <br /> Premise- former army quiet studs underwear model type character (a good acting really) goes in search of the girls, who sent him a postcard Christmas while serving in the army of the Earth in its cabin a lounge-muesli The family, which is the right registrars. The family accepts it, and it takes 2 hours of our time for the chicks to see that he's a better catch than her liberal look, the French drink wine, PORSCHE management, loud cell phone talking, lazy city slicking, who looks Jewish suitor. <, Br /> <br /> Bad- 1d characters, 1d threads. Being hit on the head with Pro-war theme. Asner. <br /> <br /> well- commercial breaks were long. Peter Jason. It ended.
