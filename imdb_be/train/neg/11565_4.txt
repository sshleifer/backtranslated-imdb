So far, after two weeks with "Lonely Beauty" I'm a little disappointed. <br /> <br /> Some of the acting is good, as long as we have it is just a drama. <br /> <br /> I do not sure, people may feel that it is a fictional drama "actual" coverage "Thatcher" years -. that's fine, as a drama, but I feel like the book awards is still much better <br /> <br /> I wonder if the BBC will ever give us to follow and the next part of the drama and years, stemming from the "Speech only better" finish since 2006, and the fact that we are still waiting! this abya tsannem government, which is full of nothing.
