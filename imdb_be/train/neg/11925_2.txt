This is a very strange movie ... I was not sure what it was about some N London lowlifes find dumb child in the forest, they all think it is a kind of oracle, and somehow make them all, in their own way, to change something about your life which usually ends in disaster. The movie ended after about 90 minutes, leaving me feeling very unsatisfied, almost irritated the senselessness of it all. I did not care about any of the characters - none of them does not get a chance to endear himself to the audience <br /> <br /> What was the message.? Can I be dull? It was too weird. What happens to the runner? Emilio Why shoot a child? ... has not made absolutely no sense, it is meaningless. Can someone help me understand this mess the film?
