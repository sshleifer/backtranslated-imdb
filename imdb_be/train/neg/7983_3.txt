In general, long and filled with more plot than Swiss cheese has a hole! Directed and co-author says that he would like to mix genres - in this case, the drama and the comedy. Well, at least here, these two mixtures as vinegar and oil. To boot, not a comedy very funny and minors. In addition, the film is not very realistic. Freedom to take on the legal system in the commission of the French people against their will and apparent ease will disappear from the French hospital drugs. I watched this movie on my big screen TV at home and found that yelling at the film to move on. In the end, till the end, I quickly sent a long speech the final one of the main characters makes for a son of his former lover. By the time I was exhausted inappropriate confusing plot, which deals with a dead lover, false marriages and Nut ex-lover. Sometimes the plot leads to the families of the two main characters, and then back to one of them - either Ishmael or primarily Nora. The dangers of the audience point of view is constantly changing from Nora and Ishmael, by her former lover restricted against his will in a psychiatric hospital. There are probably two potentially interesting films here, none of which are well developed. Epilogue really wrap many of the sub-areas, and seems to want the viewer to believe that Nora-found happiness although, given her circumstances in real life chances are equivalent chance snow ball in hell. The actors do their best and attractive, but it is not enough to overcome the glaring deficiencies of bad writing, editing, and lack of focus.
