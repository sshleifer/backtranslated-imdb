I read a running man from the king of books, like Bachmann, and I felt for the main character, John and his family. This film could have been so much more. The problem? It was installed during a big action movie madness. I watched the movie and was in pain all over it. I do not feel the nature and less for his deeds. Yes, it was a funny scene (or ridiculous), but I think it did not save the movie in my eyes. If you read the book, you can feel the climax and fire in the heart of John, when he gets his final revenge. <br /> <br /> I give this film a low number. It may not have been so low if I had not read the book.
