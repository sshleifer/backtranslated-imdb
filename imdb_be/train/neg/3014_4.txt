I recently viewed artificially created landscapes on the Seattle International Film Festival. I was attracted to the film, as a photographer, because I like the familiar and Burtynsky works in the fan. While I believe that the film does a good job getting this message across, I could not help but feel that this was done as a complete afterthought to the photos and the next popular book Burtynsky. Obviously one of the reasons for this is the widespread use of still photographs that show zoom and pan through them. Despite the fact that this is a good effect when used economically, I felt that 75% of the film was the only footage of Burtynsky books (which I already have). This is probably an exaggeration, but that's how I felt. If you have a book or are familiar with his work, you might be better to skip this one.
