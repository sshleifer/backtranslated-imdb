Absolute rubbish, worse than the fight scenes than the 20-year-old Van Damme movie or American Ninja, etc. <br /> <br /> In fact deplorable acting rather than skill in the field of view throughout the film it as throwing wooden sculptures. <, Br /> <br /> Look at this just as really bad this film, it may be acceptable in the 80s, but this 2006 film, I do not much like this film, because he was not born in the 80- ies. <br /> <br /> If you are a real fight films, then check out Tony Jaa in Ong-Bak and the tread, are their own martial arts movies. <br /> <br /> laugh and look at it today you can see unintenional humor at how bleak it.
