It is a pity that even a talented director, Desplechin, could not muster a decent performance with Bleakly talented actress, Phoenix, Esther Kahn lacks the substance to pass a very short and precise plot. In an attempt to perform a concentric circle of the plight of the actor, performance and presentation is too flimsy and poorly executed, making any sympathy from the viewer. In an extremely long time, redundancy struggle Esther too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the storyline in frail frames catastrophic display. Contents inconsistent and gratuitous as Phoenix tries to execute Desplechin, as well as Esther supposedly trying to do the same. Never felt a convincing victory over the pain of Esther, we never feel the victory in the talent of the Phoenix.
