Nha get an impression of the other reviewers that this film stinks because it is a dual attitude towards the Japanese whaling industry (which is morally worse than the US or Scottish Haggis calla meat trade), it stinks because it is pretentious nonsense sort of step-up its own -this guff that gets the contemporary art a bad name. However, there are some stunning images, but there are excellent images in average trip by bus, if you use your imagination, so there's no reason to go and see this nonsense. What happens in the film is very slow and is often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a cat being gutted and then, just when you think it's finished, it starts again. I've seen it is in porn cinema in Rome, who was hired for the weekend to show the film works Barney, which is a wonderful and smart way to take back what was once a local pimped by dirty-old-timers men-in-the MACS team, but if trendy young things and a little older beard stroking Bjork supporters were to be honest, everyone can have a lot more fun if they just showed one of pornoes!
