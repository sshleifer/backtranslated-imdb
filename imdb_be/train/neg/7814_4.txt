After a long period in a space, seeking residues planet Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to the earth. He misses Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who was married and has a son with Richard White (James Marsden). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) plots sinister plan by using the crystals, which he stole from the Fortress of Solitude to create a new earth and plunge the United States. <br /> <br /> After so many wonderful Superman movies with unforgettable Christopher Reeve, or TV shows like "Lois & Clark" (and Teri Hatcher) and "Smallville", great hope has been created for the return of Superman in the version of Brian Singer. Unfortunately, the terrible story too long and sad, with many unnecessary details, lack of emotion and overestimated in IMDb. In addition, the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is shamefully ridiculous. Twenty-two years, actress Kate Bosworth is wrong miscast, plays the role of a permanent reporter, and an experienced mother of five years boy. Brandon Routh two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays a teenage Clark Kent in «Smallville». The character of Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski, really stupid cartoon. And last but not least, and despite the stunning Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey and forty-five years, so older and older than the rest of the lead cast. Banal conclusion looks like a soap opera, and it's terrible. . My vote is four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
