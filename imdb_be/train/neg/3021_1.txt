Tony Scott has never been a very good director, but every film he made after «Crimson Tide», it seems, brings him one step closer to be the undisputed worst working today (Michael Bay may fall into the same category, but at least its large, obtuse, mad eposes entertain on some distorted primally level). And, like other bloated biographical Hollywood movies ( «De-Lovely» and «Dangerous Mind Recognition", for example) life Chronicle pretentious, overpriced or open shallow ciphers according aura "mystique" of a society that thrives on juicy behind-the-scenes details, "the Domino "is a film that begins with a small capacity, and rushes that infinitesimal amount to sixty minute mark. From the already stretched time runs 128 minutes, the film feels like two times longer, and spend time with the characters is insulting surface and forgotten (as opposed to the highest "attraction Rules" Scott attempt tide hearing ironically through Domino self-satisfied, self-rich dyavchyna- voiceover pays attention only to the ignorant sledgehammer film) becomes an act of only a masochist could find pleasure. History? Spoiled upper-crust-baby Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley, in an ersatz-badass performance as fine as e beautiful appearance) patient in shallow lives of the rich and famous in Los Angeles, and accosts Rough killer Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez, to find a more interesting trade; on the way, there is a double cross, shootings, media attention (courtesy language cheeks . -in Christopher Walken, ringing in his trademark bad), and funny hints of romance Scott cut the film together in segments, which rarely last more than a few seconds, the scrolling permission to make a film neon-drenched nightmare that is frankly unpleasant to watch - if Scott to possibility shaky image frame, ghost it or deform it in some sense, it will be; but all this sticky stylistic overload overwhelms the little plot, characterization and suspense of the film is (not to mention for her EI value of "entertainment"). Most of the characters come off as either despicable or stereotypical, often two (watch the unbearable, a few minutes segment, where an African-American is introducing a new list of racial categorization to "Jerry Springer"), and I found myself wishing they would get a "tail" end of the coin our hero to the end. «Domino» complete, a heavy debris - all that interest in this personality Scott hopes to inspire his audience, he is lost in a sea of ​​neon claims migraine induces several minutes.
