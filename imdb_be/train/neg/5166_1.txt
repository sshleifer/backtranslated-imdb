Terrible acts lame story, stupid story, and just all around scary movie summarize this piece of junk. It was painful to sit through. Just awful. Do not spend a dime on it. Release should feel bad really put this film out there for people to watch. The film "horror" was not even in the slightest scary, creepy and disturbing. This is in no way a visually appealing. The action was so scared all the actors that any attempt to draw you into the cinema through dialogue completely destroyed at the opening of the mouth of the actor / actress. Plus the whole story, I do not know why someone would make a film with the story again. Do not waste your time and money. Even if it is not a free ticket to waste time watching this film one. You will feel more stupid than to view it.
