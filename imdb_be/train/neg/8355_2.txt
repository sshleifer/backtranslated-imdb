Wanda Nevada is pubescent fantasy film, using about 1979 ideas that are illegal for the novel 13-year-old girls. Script steps, and direction are uniformly awful. Action sequence challenge to the faith. The characters speak with a simplified diction one usually finds in the films aimed at the under 10 set, but also includes a few sexual references, related to the nature of the boards, as well as graphic death. <br /> <br /> The film wants to be a comedy, at some level, but never funny adventure picture, but the plot and the action fresh and the children's film, but enter pedophilia and child rape as a real possibility. He also wants to be a friend picture-age paintings, film ghost, an Indian spiritual film, travel, and Western. In general affect of the massive stupidity with an unpleasant twist. Wanda Nevada is a waste of time if you do not want to see a lot of amazing pictures of the Grand Canyon. That it is possible to do just fine.
