I love the cheesy horror. I do not care if the acting is sub-par, or look corny monsters. I liked this film, for the confused feelings all the way from the beginning to the end of the film, with the exception of. Look, I do not need a 10-page thesis or sign with big letters that explain the story for me. But Dark Floors takes "that this film about?" The thing is completely new (annoying) level. What is the film about? <br /> <br /> This is not only scary or exciting, but if you have half an hour to kill and / or you want to end up feeling frustrated and confused, rent a winner.
