Anybody can make a good movie CGI except for Pixar? I mean really, animation types obsolete by the standards of 2006 and even 1995 standards Toy Story. Or maybe they've spent all their budget for Hugh Jackman. . Whatever their reasoning, the story really so suck <br /> <br /> Anyway, Hugh Jackman rat - rat, which washed into the toilet. Yes, I know it seems a stereotype. But then a sewer imitated the way of London - to a degree. Add the promise of value (????) and evil (??) of the frog and you will receive an unsuccessful attempt to entertainment. <br /> <br /> I would like to say something to entertain me. Maybe grip in the film? Or maybe the relationship happily ever after, like a rat. But did nothing. It was a talent, but it exploded. D-
