Ugh! Where to start ... First, Campbell Scott nonstop Tosca becomes a real locking after a certain time (a very short time) as he learns his mount yearning, curiosity and anger. We just do not care! These characters are represented by the writer and director completely unpleasant, and in this lies the key. They did not give us anything to make us care if they adultery and whether they are or not is still in love with each other. If Scott quietly tells his wife: "I could kill you" in front of their three daughters at the dinner table, after the shock of his selfish bad time disappeared, I almost wished that he had - and then did the same smug, while discerning ghosts Denis Leary before, dragged into the Looney bin. Complete waste of time and maybe - just maybe - the resources.
