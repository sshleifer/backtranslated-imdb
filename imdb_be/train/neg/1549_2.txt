While Leon cute on SNL, he only for a moment. Like most of the scenes-in-movie SNL, it alone can not fill 90 minutes. It has some lovely moments (the ones you have seen in the trailer), but the actors are basically wasted. Tim Meadows is doing its best, but the plot just does not make a lot of high points. Ferrell has a cameo. Farrell can be a funny man alive ... but not in this movie. What a shame.
