First of all, I became dissy after watching this film for five minutes (bas-relief scenario reason). I do not think that this film has any goal. Bored from the first minute to the last. I do not understand why this film scores so highly. I gave it 1/10, but in fact it is no more than 0/10 the Wurth.
