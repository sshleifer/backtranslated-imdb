Turgid pace of the film overwhelms us any shocks which he can give. There was no real suspense. Most of the characters were tasteless. Thoracic Irish priest was lame as the love interest. Interest misleading. Girl, they have chosen to provide the sensuality of the film could be better. The central conflict of the protagonist was uninvolving. This film is completely devoid of positives. It's like a tedious exercise, someone who did not want to go to the gym that day, but did anyway.
