I know that the actors and actresses love to try different kinds of films - hey, no one wants to type - but Danny Glover, Brand Fricker (! Happy Birthday, brand) and Christopher Lloyd should have known better than that. "Angels in the outfield," another film in which all seems lost, until someone or something magically comes in and saves the day. Do I even need to tell you how it ends? The film just won over escapism (examples of high escapism are different sci-fi films from the 50s). If these films had some political connotations - or, at least, we were offered a new perspective on life - they would have been in order; This one is simply meaningless. Far closer to the devil than angel. Also starring Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey, and I suspect that they do not want to emphasize this in your resume.
