Okay, so I went into this movie really was not expecting much, I realized, in the action flick, similar to the afterburner. Some good cars some good girls some decent plot. Unfortunately, I have to say that this was probably the worst film I've seen this year. Do not get me wrong, the cars were good, and the girls were okay, but they put the movie together was just a crappy to put it nicely. History simply never done, you take care of the cast, and the film seemed a bit. Overall, this film is not the worst thing that ever far away, but if you are looking for a film to go into this weekend I'd pass this right now.
