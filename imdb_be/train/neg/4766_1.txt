You can tell that they spent $ 5 this.it making it a waste of time ... ugh .. there is nothing remotely good about this movie ... .. I do not know why I continued to watch this .. the chicken is hot. ugly actions .. you could do something and make better use of your time .. like watching TV playing dirty video game .. I feel robbed. .. just robbed my time. I've never done a review for the film before, as you can probably tell, but this film I felt that I need to save the poor souls who are going to look at it and looking at IMDb early to see when he was a decent and looks at the comments. -There was no action--not hot-not chicks- budget- -shittttttttttttttty acting- he yells a bad film. **** The entire film is in the room. ***
