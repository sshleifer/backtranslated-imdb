Despite the continuation of the more potent the original, but rather a comic remake of Friday the 13th for further escapades psychopath Angela, killing a teenager married to them, "immorality" in the camp. <br /> <br /> Pamela Springsteen (Bruce's sister) looks great. There are some pretty darn funny sex scene with some pretty darn attractive girls, but the film is so (unintentionally) a comedy rather than suspenseful, it's a bitch. <br /> <br /> * with ****. <, Br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated R for graphic violence and gore, nudity and some sexuality, language and drug use.
