Not only is the author of the film, Steven Greenstreet obviously idolizes Michael Moore, but he should also follow in his footsteps, using several tactics Agitfilm solutions Moore. Moore has experience in distracting the viewer from this focus, though, while Greenstreet clearly less qualified here. <br /> <br /> Being involved in all issues related to the question of Moore's UVSC, I was disappointed to see that the main complaints of the community - that Moore was paid was $ 40,000 state educational foundations Utah "s mainly assist companies John Kerry and advertise their liberal film - were pushed into the background Greenstreet while smaller issues were sensations <. br /> <br /> marketing method for this video was equally biased and objectionable ... promotion of the film, claiming that "the Mormons tried to kill Moore." Not only that, it's stupid, but it defames the main religion Greenstreet obviously have some personal problems. I followed very closely the visit of Moore, and all major news agencies said the visit Moore came and went without any precise security problems or incidents in Utah. <br /> <br /> Greenstreet has leaned on this film, to push his filmmaking career to the fact that he even dropped out of film school, to help speed it up. It seems to have been a serious miscalculation, though, as Moore's visit about 60 other colleges and universities across the country in 2004 were diluted interest in the fairly common event. GreenStreet assumption, that American audiences will be interested in this film because of the higher religious and conservative corners is not well founded. <br /> <br /> Even the title of the film, in a divided country, a few of the misnomer, since Utah voted overwhelmingly for Bush's re-election and, thus, seems to be more politically unified than any other state. The division in the name of the movie seems more points to the gulf that exists in GreenStreet ideological differences with his religion and the state. In any case, I believe, humorous correlation between the religious angle of this alleged documentary and cheerful disorder Woody Allen in Sleeper (1973), that "I was beaten by a Quaker."
