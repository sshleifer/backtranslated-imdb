I have absolutely no knowledge of the author Philippa Pearce, or any of her novels and when Tom`s MIDNIGHT GARDEN typical of her work, I probably would have had little interest in her books as a child. When I was a kid I wasn`t really interested in litreture, if it was not the soldiers fighting monsters, complete with tall bodies Count <br /> <br /> According to this version of the film Tom`s MIDNIGHT GARDEN I think Pearce writes lower middle-class children, as much of the story revolves around the protagonist of Tom Long's move into the house with a garden is not a sudden, finding metaphysical. Having your own garden there was no doubt that the representatives of the working class `t didn there in 1950, so I guess some chto` th class-ridden political subtext somewhere. There`s also an affair with a young girl named Hattie, but cynical again amoured children of love stories? Perhaps the worst of the criticism is very little in the way of excitement or adventure takes place in the narrative <br /> <br /> This is a children's film, which seems to be on its source. It `s harmless, but I`m surprised its rated IMDB voters. I wonder how many of them would have given him so many high ratings when they were 10-year-old who`d just seen Lord of the Rings trilogy?
