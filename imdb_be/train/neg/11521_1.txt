This film is really one of the worst pieces of garbage ever. It is really strange that something so terrible could be done. But, if you can withstand the intoxicating plot, character development, and the direction, you can get a hit from the soundtrack, which is so awful it's funny. The film starts very quickly and it becomes unwatchable. Someone should give those involved in this film some consolation, because their career was probably destroyed because of the participation in this film. If you eventually see this film seen him (I feel your pain), these words have come too late. For those who do, stay away at all costs or to understand that the movie is so bad that he will spend his life 2:00. Then at least you can clean or something while watching.
