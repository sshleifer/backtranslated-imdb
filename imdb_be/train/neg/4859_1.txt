You have to admire the director Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making: between 1985 and 2000, he made as many as 34 films. Unfortunately, when the zombies Bloodbath Trilogy anything to go by, they're probably crap (and a quick look at their ratings IMDb, seems to test my hunch). <br /> <br /> Part 3 sees a group of bad students establish detention bit more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead, who escaped from a top-secret military base located directly under their school. Working with koshmarnomom script Brian Eklund (which relies heavily on the liberal use of the F-bomb) director sheet provides another striking amateur effort featuring some mind-numbingly awful performances of his free throw talent, terrible visual effects (some shit CGI and then, that looks like a giant cardboard to space-shuttle) and its trademark low-quality Gore (handfuls offal pulled out from under his clothes the victims). <br /> <br /> And finally, after what seems an eternity, watching annoying characters run for their lives, and unconvincing revived people caressing the insides of animals Zombie Armageddon ends with a trip back in time / paradox twist ending that makes the viewer re watch a few agonizing minutes from the beginning of the film. Honestly ... once was enough, Mr. Sheets ?? what we have done to deserve to watch it again?
