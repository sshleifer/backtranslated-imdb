This film seemed too long to even just 75 minutes. The problem with films of horrors of the jungle, there are always too many shots of people walking (through the jungle, up the rocky cliff, a river or a lake) to the site since the work. The film is worth seeing for the funny and naked native zombies with a large convex, bloody eyes, which are always accompanied on the soundtrack to the heavy breathing and lots of reverb. Eurotrash fans will be entertained many bad English dubbing, free of female flesh and very silly tasks makeup monsters and native extras. Zombie / cannibal wave it was quite light on gore, but I probably did not see the director's cut.
