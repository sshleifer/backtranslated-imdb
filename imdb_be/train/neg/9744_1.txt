This is one of the worst things to ever come out of England, so that says a lot right there. Tension, when we need to find out is whether or not to stay Lembach strange, though. The advantage of seeing a good secretary, Sheila, it has become a picnic for the press underwear for a while after shooting doctor Rat Face. This film has several types of London too, although none of them are not good. There is also the point at which there is almost a car accident that gets your heart rate back below normal. There is also a clock that receives a teleport, and the fear of women do not get her watch back parallel to the horror of "The Sixth Sense," only much more dim and the UK. Add to frenzied crossfire between British police and the Dr. Rath, which leads to nothing, plus with an electric shock a lot of people as well as cats, and you have yourself ... mmmm ... British film. MST3K version is pretty good, although none of the records there.
