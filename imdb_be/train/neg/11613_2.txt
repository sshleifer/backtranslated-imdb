Scary movie with Frank Sinatra, Tony Rome. Here he is linked to the dead woman under the sea. <br /> <br /> Rome was soon hired to find out what happened to the woman. Naturally, this is a woman below the sea. Her roommate, Lane Kazan soon end dead on the floor. <br /> <br /> aging Richard Conte plays a cop and one in Rome. If a local club owner gets killed, the blame falls on Rome and there becomes an interesting chase scene. That's how bad it is a picture when you have to depend on the chase scene to put the action. <br /> <br /> Raquel Welch plays the beauty of her neck in the affair. Her acting is poor. <br /> <br /> Martin tapestry is a retired bully, whose son is trying to surpass it. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, you do not know why she was killed. I do not even bother to ask.
