Home Alone 3 is one of my least favorite movies. This is the cream of the crop, or S ***, if you tend to be more cynical, because it takes up (or down) there with things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it may even be worse than those two, because they, at least, two with breaks made me laugh at their stupidity. It just made me wince in pain and constantly popping when loans are rolled. No other movie has not made me wince in pain. Now I will show why this movie is so incredibly disgusting. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot ridiculous. It revolves around the chip in remote control car (?!) That is inappropriate and how these terrorists want. Stupid thing. <br /> <br /> The action follows similar to the other two houses Alones with boobytraps and all, but watch those boobytraps, made it, and not funny, incredibly frustrating to watch. I was not laughing (or even so much as a smile) once, and all the time I cringed, and I hope that the terrorists beat the child. Bird, rather than providing comic was unfunny and annoying. <br /> <br /> action, as has been done in a heap without a name, ranging from poor to atrocious. There is not one good performance here. Alex D.Linz completely unsympathetic and unfunny as a child, while terrorists operate (and, judging by their movie titles, see), they were quickly shot out ... and well, that's all. <br /> <br /> I can see some people say: "Man, this is not for children di≈ü it, man." Well, MAN, children are like this, but they can get a heck of a lot better. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story, before even considering getting it. Heck, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (who suck - to see these reviews for more) any better than this! <br /> <br /> So, in general, it is irreparably lousy movie. This is obviously processed for the money, since it is almost completely disrupts the first two; the only thing it is quite insulted the first two as well. Not a single person, a child or another, have to find a reason to see Home Alone 3. Always. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> 0/5 stars
