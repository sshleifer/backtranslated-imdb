Lack of content in this film impressed me the most. At first, I though people are going to compare it to Rock On! but I'm really surprised me to say that it was worse than the Rock On! So imagine the terrible story cast Ajay Devgan Hurdle with you have to be Salman and Asinou kidding. Music was good Khanabadosh track of the film the rest was bad! Vipul Shah is not still studying in Singh critically hit comedy King. Asinou Now .. where did it come from pity ASin fan out there, but she * d suck big time in this film seriously bad game, it does not look good at all overdose makeup! My final verdict is going to look Aladin with your family instead of spending their time here.
