Marilyn Miller made only three films to her untimely death - perfect by Sally (one thousand nine hundred twenty-nine), comedy HER MAJESTY OF LOVE (1931) and this trifle - Sunny (1930). It's pretty poorly in early radio and as an attempt to musical - though it has four dances, she sings only two songs (WHO, and one man alone?). The rest of the bill, including Spritely music titles will be thrown overboard, but we can hear in the background the last scoring mode. Miller looks overweight and amateur here - not star quality at all. Even her cloutish dancing. The film is very poorly written, full stock of lying and unfunny jokes and silly situations. If you are interested in Miller as a singer, all means check it out, but for the general entertainment, stay away.
