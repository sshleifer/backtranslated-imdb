This must be one of the worst areas I've seen. Close-up can be a very powerful blow, but if each scene is made up of nothing but close-up, it loses all its influence. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott has some very beautiful scenery to work, backgrounds Mexico, cantinas, a beautiful manor house, where he lives, Anthony Quinn and dusty town Costner Rolls later on his way of revenge. Unfortunately, we just catch quick glimpses of these places to cut the camera to picture big giant head. Even transient scene where Costner management alone across Mexico quickly cut to a close-up. <br /> <br /> The number is too dramatic and haunting, dictating all the emotions we feel. The story itself had to be treated much better. Among other things, too many people are popping out of nowhere to help Costner together - it's just bad writing. <br /> <br /> This is a typical thriller plot, but many others took the same room and do outstanding things with it. Costner's No Way Out was a somewhat similar story, but it was much better than the movie. <br /> <br /> The ending was completely disappointed and suffered from the melodramatic film scoring. This movie will never be great, but if we saw more Mexico and less than the giant heads, this film could watchable.
