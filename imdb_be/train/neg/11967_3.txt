Given the risk of showing same-sex relationships to the end of the 1980s, personal record could have done better to play a gay relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner), as a more experimental phase of life Cahill. <, Br /> <br /> I think that the creators of this film cast in same-sex relations between the two rather attractive women in order to attract viewers. Also consider 90 seconds crotch exposing several women jumping back on a high pole jump. This random scene had very little to do with the movie, and it seemed as if it was done only to keep the audience interested in the film is soft. I believe that manufacturers have tried to counteract the sad story and even more sad movie settings (in 1980 Oregon competition athletes). <br /> <br /> This review may seem harsh, but it's true. Exploitation of young Mariel Hemingway body and same-sex relationships ruined any credit, I would give this film. <br /> <br /> Pepper Thompson
