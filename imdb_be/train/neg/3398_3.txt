It seems that the purpose of the film was to show aggressive (mafia-like) nature of Russian, or, at least, of the Russians the opportunity to travel outside of their great country; it's too easy to rob a bank in England; and that the UK police are so inefficient that it can not find a man who robbed a bank, even if these items are leaving the country by air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and imaginary Russian colleagues spoke a language not yet defined somewhere, probably, say the newcomers in the Ural Mountains, but not be a Russian one. So Nicole, if you really want to speak in Russian, kindly go to Moscow or St. Petersburg, and to keep himself busy studying Russian grammar and pronunciation.
