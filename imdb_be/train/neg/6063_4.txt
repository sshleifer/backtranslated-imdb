"Masters of Horror" has proved itself a bad stage for "Posts episodes", and while the specific case can be made for Joe Dante «Screwfly Solution» (one of the best episodes of the series, period), most of the effort to make it come across, like an anvil heavy and unimpressive (did not discharge the horror more than the soap dish). And «Pro-Life» just melts reactionary views with ultra-violence; young Angelique (Caitlin Wachs), apparently passing through the timber, almost hit by the doctor 2 (Feuerstein and Vozhe Mark), which just happens to be at the wheel to run on the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angelica's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), a stone-cold, ultra-holiday movie, which will do nothing to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion. If nothing else, «Pro-Life» has accumulated some buzz for his controversial issue, but John Carpenter considers all this venture with a surprising indifference - he seems even less interested in making the film than the script itself (which admittedly poor); slowly walks does not build any tension, but simply have to mark brings the story to a crawl. Even when Duane and his sons storming the clinic, the gun, it's an incredible non-event; later, when the doctor tortured with "male abortion" scene comes off as gratuitous and unnecessary - effort to the site is guaranteed by the film. Poor performance (Perlman, unfortunately wasted here) was the result of the script and the direction Carpenter feels exhausted, as if the «Pro-Life» is the source of his subsequent hot food. By that time, the spider-creature with a human head and the guy in latex monster costume worn through the corridors, you just have to wonder what I was thinking minds behind this mess ...
