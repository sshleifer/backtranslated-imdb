I expected ALOT of this film. I wonder how Lee how Naustradamous like car√°cter, but instead all I got was a waste of time and a sad movie. I can not even explain the film. It was a wooden acting, terrible scenario of the parts of the Bible, such as hurricanes, tsunamis and earthquakes. But it was in the end! The rest I had to wait and hope that something significant will happen, but it is not. This film is about a couple who is trying to find out the changes taking place in the world as a place in China, where there was an earthquake, and finally in the monastery manages eight nuns and a priest. Monastery ultimately the key to misshappenings. The entire film missleading and sad. One of Fox worse.
