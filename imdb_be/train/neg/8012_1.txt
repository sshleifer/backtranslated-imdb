As a lesbian, I'm always looking for films relating to gays and lesbians. However, with this kind of crap out there. - it would be enough to keep any audience <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for something - anything - to develop the story, or just for him to make any sense. Neither happened. It was just a senseless scene, unconnected in any way with anything. The film failed to convey any stories or depth to the character. <br /> <br /> In an hour or more of this nonsense, I just turned it off. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this nonsense <br /> <br /> 1 star. - and it does not even deserve.
