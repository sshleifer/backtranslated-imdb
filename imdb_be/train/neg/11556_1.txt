Ah, these Italians! If we assume that the films of the aristocrat with amazing fetish, gothic castles were drowned in the atmosphere, and back-stabbing relatives are trying to get their hands on the inheritance is inherently interesting to all! If you've seen a movie of this type, you are basically seen them all (at MST3K favorite "The Screaming Skull" fits the mold too) ... and "The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave" is a pattern of -The-rooms, and boring as hell. Even juicy Erika Blanc contains wasted here. <br /> <br /> zero / 10 <br /> <br />
