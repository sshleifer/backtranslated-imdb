This film is probably the worst I have seen. Bad action, bad script, bad. Comparing it to basically two other films in the same genre, and about the same time interesting. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Gruner, 1993) seems to be much better and more reliable, and in history, and guiding and still is Pune, which sent the two, as well! <br /> <br /> the story is not original. The world is a terrible place, perhaps because of the ecological catastrophe or nuclear war, and people live in medieval conditions. A special breed of bots (cyborg) live on human blood and have a history of ... a cyborg have to get a lot of people to perform there "prophecy" and people need someone to stop them. One girl with a robot (Kris Kristofferson), built by the creators of the cyborg was appointed destiny to save humanity. <br /> <br /> In this film, the director tries to Hong Kong some stylish action scenes with participants flying high and jumping away. The film fails miserably in the attempt. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for the sole reason that most people will get a new "worst" movie to relate to. And fans of the genre, I recommend "Cyborg", as I believe that this is a very underrated film with fairly high entertainment factor. And if you can not stand Van Damme, and then check the "Nemesis". <br /> <br /> I appreciated this film 1/10.
