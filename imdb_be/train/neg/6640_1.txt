I find it pretty useless to comment on this "film" for the simple reason that it does not have anything to comment on upon.It similar to rotten eggs, that has nothing good to show the world exposure, because it rotten as other endless number of eggs was in front of him. But as a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance ... <br /> <br /> Filth, definitely the right word to describe this film, created in the same way as any other Romanian "film" Pintilie director who insists reflect the so-called "Romanian reality" after the Communist era (1990 to the present day). <br /> <br /> Do not, under any circumstances, recommended for people outside Romania, for others (who have recently found an amateur camera, the lack of plot, the absence of the director / actors etc as play, noise and g .d like to be fashionable and even art-like). watch and enjoy this "cinema" (as I know you will), but do other good intentions members IMDB grace entirely to write a review for online will misinform, irritating and eventually spend their time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the film (among others) has any meaning at all, teaching one sets an example for him. "If you do not make a movie"
