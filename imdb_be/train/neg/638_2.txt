Good Earth, perhaps the most boring film I've seen in my life. The plot is slow and lacking. Action is borderline comical. While I love Paul Muni, now I can say I've seen a movie that does not make it true ability of justice. The only saving grace I have found in this film is its cost of production. Using hundreds of extras for the film creates a very believable and interesting environment. In addition, beautiful effects are used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and were revolutionary at the time. Other than the cost of production, I can say a little more, that's good or entertaining about the film.
