David Mamet is a very interesting and very divisive filmmakers. His first film "House of Games" was the one I really liked, and he made a number of films with characters whose point of view of life changes as they get into difficult situations, and thus make the viewer perspective. <br /> <br /> For "Killer", which is trying to establish a name in the viewer's mind the usual crime drama. The main characters are two policemen, one Jewish and one Irish, who deals with racial charged area. The murder of the old Jewish shopkeeper who proves that ancient Israel's independence war veteran launches Jewish identity in the minds and heart of the Jewish detective. <br /> <br /> It was the film flaws are more apparent. The awakening of the theater and it is difficult to believe, is a group of Jewish fighters opera, and as a detective ultimately goes to the final rigid confrontation sorry. The end of the film Mamet, how clever, but disappoints with human emotional point of view. <br /> <br /> Joe Mantegna and William Mace give strong performances, but the disadvantages of this story is too obvious to be easily compensated,
