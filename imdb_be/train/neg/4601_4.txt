I am nothing of the writer or the director's earlier work I do not know, so I did not bring any prejudice to the film. On the basis of a brief description of the story in the TV Guide I thought it might be interesting. <br /> <br /> But the fabulously piled on implausibility. Every twist seems to be an excuse to attract even more bloodshed, hideous makeup or special effects. <br /> <br /> The number of turning professional and Kari Wuhrer seems worthy of an actress, but everything else was more than disappointing, It was positively repellent. <br /> <br /> I'm not the whims of the story, but I will give an example of what I think the excess of explicit gore. <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna is an isolated ranch and pulls the frozen body of his victim before (Wendt) with a deep-freeze. McKenna was killed Wendt biting a piece off his neck. Now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in the death of Wendt. (What the police are going to do, to measure its radius bite?) McKenna deploys Wendt head and neck from freezer bags it is, takes an ax and starts to cut off the head Wendt. Whack. Whack. Whack. Bat axes keeps chipping away at the neck Wendt. The air is filled with a grain flying frozen meat, one of which falls on McKenna head. (He cleans it when he did.) McKenna then receives a frozen head outside a small fire, it is built. He sits head on the ground, squatting next to him, takes a few photos of women he had just killed, and shows them to Wendt head. "Remember her? We could really do this if it were not for you guys, "he says to his head. "Duke, you've always liked fires, is not it?" He asks. Then he puts his head on fire. We only get a glimpse of it burning, but we can hear the fat sizzling in the flames. <br /> <br /> I do not want this kind of garbage to be censored. I just wonder who likes to see this stuff. <br /> <br /> There's no reason to go with the rest of the film. Well, I will mention one example of the "improbability", as I brought up the idea. McKenna was kidnapped and locked in a dark bare shack. He knows that he will be clobbered to death in the next few days. (He just invited heavyweights to do it.) What would you do in this Poe similar situation? That's what makes McKenna that it may be the last night of his life. He finds a discarded calendar pin-up girl on her and masturbates (successfully). Give the man a medal of Freedom! <br /> <br /> A monster that looks like a Pizza Hut thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks. The camera is often manual and wobbly. Dialog has the line, "Life is a piece of s ***. Or is it the best of all possible worlds. It depends on your point of view. "The use is made with a wide angle lens that turns an ordinary face into a gargoyle mask. House explodes in an explosive fireball at the end, and the hero, McKenna, walks to us at the forefront. <br /> <br /> Some hero he is, too. He first kills people for $ 13,000, hitting him on the head several times with a heavy statue, the potted plant, before finally tipping over the fridge on the body. (It bothers him a little bit, but not enough to keep him from insisting on payment.) Then, I hope that I have the order right, he kills Wendt, tearing part of his neck. Then he killed his wife first victim accidentally and blames him for a heavyweight, although almost any moral deduction they had nothing to do with him. He then burns the head honcho (Baldwin) is alive. Then, cut off two smaller heavyweights, he deliberately explode them, although one of them is not entirely unsympathetic. And we should be rooting for the McKenna <br /> <br /> This is not the case of cartoons, like the ones in the movie Dirty Harry or -. Bleed and you're dead. This is a slow and painful. The first of these - the murder for $ 13,000 - this is done clumsily enough to sound like that could happen in real life. It is not very easy to kill other people, as demonstrated by Hitchcock in a ragged curtain. But this scene does not place any value. <br /> <br /> Some people might enjoy it, especially those who are young enough to think that pain and death are things that only happen in movies. Some showy thing on the screen here.
