What a bad, bad film! I tried to watch without fast forward ... It's not possible. After about 30 minutes, I stopped the film, went on line to see how many minutes of the disaster was. (Only 84 minutes Phew!) It was strange, boring film. I do not think that someone can get knocked down, to hit a fluorescent lamp is much less gutting one !! One funny thing is that I looked «The Killer Cut" version of the movie. Box boldly declares that "the more blood!" "More sex!" "More than theaters of Terror!" Yikes! If this movie was terrible with all of these claims are interesting only as lame as "UN-killer C» was ??? If you want to see a great movie about the world of the living and the world of the dead to watch any of the Night of the Dead Living Series !!
