I have nothing against rapid fright-flick, but it's Stephen King origin nonsense too recently Washed too bright and modern. The plot of the new teenager in a small town, which is "Sleepwalker" - a sort of cross between a vampire and a werewolf - and which feeds on the blood of women virgins, asks more mysterious, ambiguous interpretations, this thriller is given inappropriately colorful appearance, with little or no atmosphere. Children predictably pretty and energetic, but a big plus Alice Kridge as the boy's mother; Kridge, of «Ghost Story», never broke out of the filler female form, and it is a great loss that she was not used more. Her performance is a terrible and intense, and gives a hint that "Sleepwalkers", may have already been a much better movie with a different focus and tighter side. This is also a more-top and commercial drive, with a rough voice that swings wildly from thriller to comedy drama. Stephen King is a cameo, as in real life, director John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 ****
