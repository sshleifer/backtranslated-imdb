This video was originally banned back in the UK, and authorized in November last year without cuts. <br /> <br /> He is a playboy Playmate of the Month in October 1979, Ursula Bachfellner. Opening cuts back and forth between Buchfellner and foggy jungle pictures. I'm not sure what the purpose of it was. It would be much better to focus on the bathroom scene. <br /> <br /> Laura (Buchfellner) abducted and held in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cleaver - The Beyond, zombies) sets off to find her and redemption. Of course, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to spend time productively, while another (Werner roll) whine constantly. <br /> <br /> sacrificial exchange goes to hell, and Laura runs into the jungle. Will Peter save her before the cannibals eat? Ah, yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think that this video is back! Muriel Montossé found Peter and his partner (Antonio Mayans - the Angel of Death) on a boat thief. Montossé very easy to strip. Peter leaves them and goes alone to find Laura, who was captured at the moment. They pass the time they had sex, and do not see the danger coming. Guts, who? Big fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman). <br /> <br /> The blood, decapitation, guts, a lot of full-frontal, some great writhing cannibals priestesses (Aline Mess), and the line, "They tore her heart," which is the oars, when you watch a movie.
