I saw it when he was in the theater, he started so violently that I mean in 1980, it was a bold film and special effects were great at the time. Now you have been to at least 30 or so, in 1980, to really understand this point, because the study of film historically not get into a set in the waiting time, as well as other related psychological factors.

In my experience, it was just not strong enough. My wife and I were well ... how can I say this? We were upset, I mean, we paid the money invested the time to watch a movie, which was excellent. "We both felt that we had been robbed by the end, which convinced us both, the production company should run out of money and could not raise enough to finish correctly. In fact, my wife said it best, it is not the end, it's just STOPPED!
