Della Myers (Kim Besinzher) is an upper class housewife, who lives in a private condominium in the suburbs with her two children and her abusive husband Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). Della gives all his attention to the twins, neglecting their house and her appearance and Kenneth upsetting. On Christmas Eve, she went to the local mall at night to buy wrapping paper for gifts, and they do not find a parking space. If she sees an old car parked in two places, she leaves a message for the owner calls "selfish jerk". If the shopping center is closed, the car della contains old driver of the car, and it is threatened by four punks ?? Chuckie (Lukas Haas), an African-American Huey (Jamie Starr), a Sino-US Vingh (Leonardo) and Latin Tomas (Luis Chavez). If the shopping center security guard to protect her, he shot over the head of Chucky, Della accelerates his car, trying to escape from the criminals. However, she breaks her truck nearby forest, while being chased by a gang. It takes a set of tools and hiding in the woods, fighting against the gang to survive. <br /> <br /> A couple of days ago, I saw the trailer for "While it was not", and I really like to watch DVD, Unfortunately, the trailer is better than the movie, and I'm totally disappointed that stupid and improbable collection of clichés. Della Myers presented as unprotected and careless housewife and non-existent, as a wife; mother her only interest in her family concept. It pursues four middle criminals, but it defeats them with the toolbar, which appears to be a utility belt Batman. Thus, the story is so absurd, that's annoying. A gang of criminals formed the favorite clichés of American films with African-American, Chinese-American and Latin American with the master, to be politically correct. Kim Basinger has a decent action, but their children are too small for the fifty-five year-old woman. . My vote is four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Enquanto Ela Está Fora" ( "As long as it was not")
