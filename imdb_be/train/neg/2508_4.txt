About the time they released the movie on DVD. I know that some say that the Security Council to rush release the film because of the Dreamgirls movie. But, as you can rush release of the film, which was cataloged since 1976. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with the DVD release of the film, there is no particular function, Sun 5.1 DD sound. come to the WB, you can do much better than this. sound and picture quality on this film needs serious help. <br /> <br /> Give up the Security Council is not the place as much time and attention to this film because it's black and my film is in the sales order. They could have kept the CD, which by the way dose not have all the songs original CD has. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this DVD to purchase. Yes, because it's a classic film. But the Security Council need to add some special features. Take notes from other movies group, The Five Heatbeats, or temptation was you can only view the performance and sound of both is much, much, much better than the DVD.
