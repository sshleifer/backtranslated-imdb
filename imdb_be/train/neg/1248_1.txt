This film was bad, because there was nothing interesting. It was sort of a remake, but then again, not really. I was very disappointed, given the tools that Tim Burton at his disposal. It was a beautiful makeup and CGI are available and a lot of money ($ 100 million), but you can honestly say that we got was as good as the original film, which was made for less than $ 6 million? Heck no. Thus, in this regard, that the film can not. <br /> <br /> At least in the original film, the Statue of Liberty scene was shocking, but there was nothing shocking in this film, even the end of the scene, because you could kind of see coming. And by the way, if you give it some thought, and I did, you can see how the end may occur. I just want to I had the time back that I wasted thinking about it. <br /> <br /> This film would be great fun when he stayed on the line of the first film and participated in "Beneath the Planet of the Apes." Here is how I would write: <br /> <br /> Spaceman (it really should have been more than Marky Mark, because he was not good enough to take care of the film itself, so I would put three guys) that land on what they think would be a different planet, faced with people (not MUTES), a city ruled by monkeys, hunted, made friends with some nice monkeys are discovering that they are on the ground with the help of find some ruined ruins eventually run into crazy mutants people living underground, war breaks out ie between mutant humans and apes, and then .... well, let your imagination on how you want to finish it. <br /> <br /> But my point is that, perhaps, there was much more to this film. Unfortunately, Tim Burton knows how to ruin a good thing. Consider what he did from the Batman series. He rotten director despite what people think. He is fashionable, so it must be good is thinking. Sorry, but no. If someone did this film, it would have been much better, and it would be much more fun.
