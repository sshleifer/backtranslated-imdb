Terminus Paradis was exceptional, but «Niki Ardelean» comes too late. We already have enough of it, and we want something new. <br /> <br /> Large Director should not have any problems seeing their time, rather than the rear. Why do people see in Romania only in the post-revolutionary country? <br /> <br /> We just were not born reincarnated, and no one gives a ** t more about old times. Most people do not remember or do not want to remember, and a new generation of consumers do not understand a bit of the movie. This should be the first day of the Romanian film is not the final song - priveghi! Maybe young directors have to take this step.
