I do not think that this film was evaluated correctly. I picked up a copy and blackout rated PG and R. records I would not recommend it for anyone under the age of 17 or 18, regardless of the boundary R is. <br /> <br /> Why? It contains a scene in the jungle with a few topless Indian women. I do not know about you, but this is not something for young children to watch. However, this may be the traditional "style of clothing" African (?) Indians, but ... I think that should give partial nudity movie rated R. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a movie lately, but I I think that otherwise it was fine.
