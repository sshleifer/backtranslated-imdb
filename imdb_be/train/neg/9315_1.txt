This movie was so bad! It was awful! It was awful! I can not stress this enough! Acting, directing, story, characters, and everything about it was bad! It was so corny and formulaic. Do not be fooled by a little bit, or slogans "of The" Texas Massacre "not funny." You 'kidding me her steps! It was funny. <br /> <br /> The first 2 minutes of the film is good, until it comes to the protagonist, Brendan, OK, now turn it off. What I got from the movie was a bunch of ugly, annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the middle of the forest and the clown who sings nursery rhymes kills them non-original and fake ways. <br /> <br /> This movie was a waste of my time and money, and it would be a waste of time and money, too! I fast forward through most of the film, because it was so bad, I just wanted to see how he died every bad actor, and it's still not right! Just looking at the cover of a waste of time. This is seriously the worst movie ever! Rating: not deserve.
