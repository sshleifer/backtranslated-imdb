During sleepless nights, I was crossing over the channel and found it embarrassing movies. What were they thinking? <br /> <br /> If it is a life after the «Remote Control» for Kari (Wührer) Salin, it is not surprising that it did not go nowhere. <br /> <br /> And why David Keith to take this role? It is pitiful! <br /> <br /> In any case, I have included the film closer to the end, so I did not get much of a plot. But it must have been the best part. This brake college kid brings home the girl vamp-ish ... this scene straight out of the comic book - or cheap porn. She calls her mother that preserves anal and kisses his father, "Oh, I did not expect the language!" Great line! <br /> <br /> After that, I had to see how it ended .. <br /> <br /> Well, of course, the bitch from hell has a hellish past, so SWAT team is up. And yes ... they surround it! AND SO SO! Child blowing her brains !!!! AHAHHAHAHAHA !! <br /> <br /> This is must-see TV. <br /> <br />
