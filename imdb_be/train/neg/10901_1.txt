Obviously not; As already noted, most of them are just a little legal guys rubbing himself. Maybe then it would attempt to sabotage homoeroticism? Well, maybe if not for the fact that never never never go beyond the most innocuous and non-threatening forms of male contact. (Which, fortunately not repeated around eighty thousand times.) Well, it's kind of a horror movie; she is trying to scare us? Niya, if the director did not mean to do it through sheer boredom, and a set of his "work". <br /> <br /> Never in my life have I enjoyed the movie less. It is most unfortunate and unnecessary thing I've ever seen. It's like Voodoo Academy takes the genre of horror, zombies, and a gay film, put them in a meat grinder, and then runs them through a coffee filter - only instead be the kind of filter coffee, which filters out the coffee beans, is the kind that takes all life, irritable, or in any way interesting. As a result of 74 minutes of the film is every bit as exciting as a glass of warm water - but without the ability to Rehydrate after your 10-day Gina drinking that inevitably come upon you, when you see the abomination of human effort.
