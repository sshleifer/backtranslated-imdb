This film, which was released directly to video should wear a warning sign that it is dangerous to human health and may expose the viewer to the terminal boredom. This is another veiled, evangalizing Â«Delight" religious film with good guys (faithful) suddenly disappears, and the bad guys (the disbelievers) that have been left behind. It's an interesting concept, especially because we see it happen during the flight under the command of an unbeliever who has a sinful relationship with flight attendant on board (it goes without saying that the sinner does not disappear!). Unfortunately, all the pilots being an unbeliever, the plane did not crash or film would be mercifully more. While it might be fun, no heavy religious intimidation, generally plodding film makes one gag acting awful and obviously computer-generated simulation of a very fake look. In addition, this is another film shot in Canada, which claims to New York. Thank you ... I just read the Bible.
