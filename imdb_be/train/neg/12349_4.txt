The real disappointment of the big visual master Ridley Scott. GI Jane tells the story of the first woman ever to go through the hellish training at the Navy SEALs. Education is the most complex and difficult to exist as an instructor in the film says O'Neil the lead character, played by Demi Moore. There's no particular message or a point in the movie, or I could not reach it properly. This may be some kind of statement about women's rights and opportunities, but it is sinking under the weary firefight scenes and silly at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> I really can not understand why so many use Ridley Hitting that last skirmish is mentioned in the desert? It looks sooooo stupid and annoying, and almost amateurish, so I would really like to know what the director saw in this technique. When I look at his latest film, Black Hawk Dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the battle scenes (which are many), and they are very intense and directed skill. All final in G.I. Jane looks ugly and nothing more, but stupid and mindless shooting and killing. <br /> <br /> This is the worst film by Ridley Scott, in my opinion, and there is no significant lines of which are known to the great director. Nevertheless, I am glad that I saw it in widescreen format, because there are a few great scenes and samples Scott abilities, but very few of them in this film. <br /> <br /> A disappointing and nothing compared to the classic (Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise, Alien and so on ..) of this talented director. So I have to give G.I. Jane 4/10.
