If you love movies like American Pie, Road Trip & Van Wilder; avoid it at all costs cinematic garbage. It unamusing, vile, fresh waste of resources that should never have been discussed aloud; much less, in fact, recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers. Easily the worst film I've seen in the last 18 months; mind-numbingly bad for only 86 minutes, this time. If it was a lot more I could not write this review without using profanity. Consider yourself warned!
