As someone who was in a checkerboard pattern on the incredible visual Â«Hero," I really wanted to see this film, which has been billed as the the same scheme, but it is better. He also showed an actress I like: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was disappointed on both counts. I bought a DVD of the film Supervisory multitudes, and it was a mistake. It was not better. <br /> <br /> I understand that these flying-through-air martial arts films of pure fantasy, but the story is stretched so far beyond anything remotely plausible it just made me shake my head in certain of disappointing, blind woman win hundreds of opponents? Unfortunately, it is a bit far. In addition, the main male character "Jin" (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so annoyed his dialogue, goofy look on his face and the silly laughter that he messed up the film too. <br /> <br /> Despite the excellent colors and strange action scenes, the story - me. - just did not have recourse to make his film should possess this film is not a "hero" of mine!
