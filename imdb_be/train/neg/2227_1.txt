Every once in a while, someone out of the blue looks at me a little bit to the side and asked: "What SNITCH'DÂ»? I know that they will immediately deal with barely concealed amusement + horror. You see, I was the cinematographer on the film. <br /> <br /> Let me explain some things about it "interesting life experience." <br /> <br /> Initially SNITCH'D one hard HIT was called, I met James Cahill in July 1999, the day after I wrapped TRIANGLE SQUARE, great little 35mm feature, which like so many indie features era did not have spread, despite the festival awards ... he fell eternal sacrifice the fine print SCG infamous trial contract Feature. But I digress ... <br /> <br /> I, even though I was on a roll, and when James asked me to take off his little gangster film in 16 mm, falling budget of about $ 25,000, not wanting to upset the pace, I took it. In the end, clerks, EL Mariachi ... I also believe that the myth then. <br /> <br /> Let's just fine it as a "film school" for many involved, including me. SNITCH'D was filmed for two weeks in August 1999, in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana, CA Cahill taught drama in high school in the latter city (yes, he's Drama and English teacher ... believe that while watching a movie or even watching the use of an apostrophe in the title), thus, places and actors. <, Br /> <br /> It should be noted in his cast had only known a dramatic appearance in Los Angeles Channel 2 Morning News weather girl Vera Jimenez, and more influence, Eva Longoria debut, who has just arrived in Hollywood, and he was as eager as I am to get the film under her belt. I must say, her professional dedication, focus, and "let's do it" attitude kept me inspired and it was predicting with its star-no-future. <br /> <br /> SNITCH'D suffered from poor optics, low light or electricity a few operators on duty boom and delivering uncorrected standalone duplication. None of this overshadows the actual content that speaks for itself. <br /> <br /> anyway, by 2003, the film was sold to a distributor (net loss, I understand), which for unknown reasons was not Eva photos on the box (up to him and the time she was ascending, working title), but who managed to get a clear image of what appears to be a real Latino gangster lend credibility SNITCH'D. On the other passion Cahill is an antique book dealing, apparently to confirm he thinks that you can really judge a book by its cover ... and how many have picked up this DVD, based on his sleeve. ----------------- After a year, Eve, now soap, and I met James in a single day, to shoot a simple short film he had prepared, SPLIT SECOND, I think they had never seen nor to play, despite the intention of the festival. <br /> <br /> 6 years later, I was hired to shoot another film called Cahill Juarez, Mexico. I though he developed a process; My participation was dependent on the casting, script, and control of the crew and the resulting movie actually looked promising in the daily newspapers, for what it was ... a cheap detective environmental massacres girls in Juarez; despite the statements here and in other places, the film has never appeared in any festival or place, though Cahill has repeatedly claimed that the film has a distribution and just waiting for release to coincide with the DVD release two studio pictures of the same subject, VIRGIN and the border town of Juarez.
