Unfortunately I do not miss anything? did I leave early? The first ten minutes of unusual (and false!) The stories I thought, "This is going to be a classic," But it was all down hill from there! Action was brilliant for what it's worth, William Mays is fantastic and just gets better and better every movie I watch it. But it never seemed to connect. I was waiting for the big moment when all the history between the connection and then suddenly..it frog rain ?? it was when the writer said: "I went to the deep as I can get all these stories together cleverely .... Oh sod it, I'll just have it rain frogs." I love smart movies, I love weird movie, but it was just amazing, and boring. 4/10
