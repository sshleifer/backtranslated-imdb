It really does not matter what Superman comics incredibly naive and their purpose for ten years. The important thing is that "Superman Returns" a bad film. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, a question for you Dear readers, how much do you really believe that Superman is defeated bald Kevin Spacey? Does anyone? Just as I thought. Quite a few spoilers here. So let's move on to some of the main issues now. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film looks like a commercial (in a bar scene with Superman / Clark Kent drink Budweiser only scene that looks like it's supposed to). Imagine a commercial Superman, two and a half hour long. Let us seriously is not "the Amadeus" or "The Departed." You really feel that this movie is too long. And the special effects are not so special, by the way. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the script is silly. Sometimes, even if something is acceptable in the comic, in the movie it looks ridiculous. And it seems that in this case. Of course, the dialogues disgrace. I can not believe that someone took the money to write them. How many times do we feed the villain speeches? How many times will be raped by the laws of physics? (Jesus is not only a question of strength of Superman, but also the resistance of the materials of his case.) How many times have Lois Lane will be fooled Kent? How many times Hollywood producers will seek to stories in comics bad? Since it is difficult to make a good story, why having a weak story for a starter? It just does not work. Guys, hold on. Try harder, please. Or just stay on this strike forever caregivers. I got the feeling that the WGA is a permanent strike. No offense. I do not question the lame money these people paid, but the quality of the product they deliver. In this case, there is no quality at all. (At this point you might ask yourself: is it so bad Yes it?). <br /> <br /> In the third place, acting poorly, which is quite strange, as Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects) is directing. Kevin Spacey plays, but it is only one. The audience probably not in the mood for jokes. The fact that comic book character can be developed into a real person, with a clear motivation, but with doubts, fears, some depth. In this case, no one has done this work, and the characters are not very interesting. <br /> <br /> In the end, all the efforts of the creators of the film turns into a parody. The second block is so bad that attracts attention, as there is nothing interesting happening on the screen anyway. The more they try (if they try), the funnier it gets (but do not laugh you might expect). <br /> <br /> The final conclusion? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This particular film, ladies and gentlemen, it is a camp. Do not waste your time and do not waste your money. Stay home, read a book.
