I saw this back in '94, when he was released. Apparently, because the pattern of Orion were in bankruptcy, I think the film has not been released a few years ago. <br /> <br /> I have a problem with remembering details, partly because I have not seen him for a long time, but I remember it as a very dull movie. I went on to discuss whether to withdraw from it. The store was not at all interesting or entertaining. There was a third-rate imitation of American Graffiti. <br /> <br /> None of the performances do not make it worth watching either. One of the biggest disappointments, starting with the local newspaper reviewer gave it high marks.
