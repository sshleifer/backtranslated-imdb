deadly beauty and deadly strikes Charlotte's legs to make the film better than it would have been so poor otherwise.The history and character of Charlotte dies a stupid way that you wonder if this is the end, they thought for this film. I wish someone could say that there is an alternative ending, but I'm afraid that's not true. As for the rest of the FTAA, so I would say that they just do not work very well; Although wine has to be put on a poor script.This film reminds me of Rush Hour 2, where Zhang Ziyi dies in absurd way, since she was the one who had stolen the show throughout the film. I could give this film 2/5
