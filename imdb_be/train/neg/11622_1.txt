Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love. "Wanders" is probably not the right word. I must say that it fixes the last girlfriend. He remembers the day when the relationship ended. Dream sequence only the absence of hazy transitions. He fondly recalls his favorite songs and the places they went. I am not an adviser, but perhaps it had something to do with a bad marriage ???? Dave goes to a support group and found a lady half his age (also divorced), who, instead of being "turned off" the horror of it, takes an interest in him. Did I mention how horrible Dave? Sometimes he refers to himself in the third person. He did not move his hands when he is, either. It's just amazing. Too make a long story short, Dave sites to track down Mary (an old friend of Gal) and kill her ... uh ... I mean, to oppose it. He does it. Which was really terrible. He believes that her married, but he still flies halfway across the country to meet her. He stakes out his house to make sure she was alone before he "falls" on it. He awkwardly with her conversation, ending with his preaching of the Gospel of Christ about 10 words or less, and flies back to the new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the movie mainly unintentional comedy value. I'm still with my wife entertaining impressions Dave .... Â«I heard another Dave & Mary songs!"
