Snow White, who has just been released in Locarno, where I had the opportunity to see it, of course, refers to the world-famous fairy tales. And this also applies to coke. In the end, the real snow plays a role in the Swiss Alps as well. <br /> <br /> Thus, all three aspects of the title is addressed in this film. There is a lot of dope on the stage, and there is also a pale, dark-haired girl - with Prince, which is to go through all the trouble to come to her rescue <br /> <br /> But :. This is not a fairy tale. It should be realistic drama in Zurich, Switzerland (on the slogan). <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is close to perfection. Unfortunately, weak plot predictable dialogue, for the most part, it is unrealistic scenery and mixed steps do not add up to create authentication. Thus, as a spectator, I remained untouched <br /> <br /> And then there were the clich√© that drove me crazy, one by one: Snow White a rich and spoiled daughter of the upper class - of course her parents divorced, and she was. I never get enough love from them, because they were so busy all the time. Her best friend, on the other hand, there are those who love and caring parents. They (steelworker and a housewife) live in a tiny apartment, poor and happy -. (!) And is aware of the desperate situation of their daughter is in a good guy (= prince) is the music from the French part of Switzerland says (which is considered less economically successful but emotionally as a fitter of the country). He has problems with his parents. They come from Spain, which does not seem to take his wild lifestyle - until my father is seriously ill and will be recognized by its great admiration for his son from his hospital bed <br /> <br /> And so it goes on:. Naturally , hard drug trafficker, bankers are heartless, the club's owner is a playboy and photographer, although the woman has only her career in mind when she puts Snow White to elaborate pornographic photographs on display (!). <br /> <br /> This overview does not need spoiler in order to allow you to add these parts to clear the plot. As I like other movies from Samir, for example, "Forget Baghdad", I was very disappointed. Let's hope that the next.
