I have heard many stories about the film to be more ... Well, I took my chance when I saw it at a cheap price on Ebay last month. <br /> <br /> I watched it, and I have only a few remarks about this: <br /> <br /> 1) scary story line, 2) Terrible action, 3) bad fight scenes ... <br /> <br /> I've never seen a worse film in my life so far !! If the plot is bad, than at least to make the fights a little more interesting. But both made ridiculously bad ... <br /> <br /> * The single positive thing about this movie (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick. God, she looks good in this movie. <br /> <br /> That's about it ...
