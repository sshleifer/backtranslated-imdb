I knew that the "Evening" was a girly film, so I expected it to be boring. Unclean teases on IMDb said that it was a "chick flick" but that your companion will survive. <br /> <br /> survive? Yes. I'm still here, but when the two of us left, we were amazed to find that it lasted only two hours - it seemed to be much more than this evening! I believe that for the Yankees, it should be raised or exciting, because we are talking about rich people who live on the beach - well, close to the beach, in a house with a wide veranda and lawn, but no visible lawnmowers. If this kind of thing impresses you, it may seem a little short film. <br /> <br /> There is a Monty Python movie about a knight who just will not die. He ends up in the writhing (why Yankees add a third part to this word, I wonder), the body in the road still shouting threats against his nemesis. This film is also about the kind of the living dead. Vanessa Redgrave (incorrect name for a serious body kit shown here) goes on and on dying while having misplaced guilt. She is not worried about was wide-eyed, gasping the prostitute, but is like a murderer. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that, as a girl of the film, there is a guy who should be the character Mr. Darcy / Heathcliff. I do not woofter, so I can not say that to be a good judge of such things, but tedious weakling who rolled out for this role only seems to have the rank of a minister in his favor. He Beskrovny calculate. <br /> <br /> As you might gather, the main characters is not much cop, but little control, it is strange to be much worse. There is a guy whose only task is to react to the news that his girlfriend belly. Fair enough, but it is not the role of Hamlet - why ham is so bad? Forgetting that it was a girly film, I thought he would be thrown out, because any decent friend would tell him that face-fungus flattered him, but then I realized that it must encourage it to grow. "Beard" because he looked worse without it <br /> <br /> I have not slept, seeing what the actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or loose and noting the interesting bits of scenery - if you are attracted to him, see if you You may find a stuffed buffalo head, just the kind that you would expect in a beach house. <br /> <br /> In addition to the obligatory wedding, there is only one piece of the action. You would think that they got it right. Unfortunately, however, hit and run accident is carried out on the car, which could not be there. If the accident is detected a cast wander about crying in nature that they can not know, is near (but we as an audience). If they have no idea that a person is a few miles from the site, why they wander aimlessly shouting at him? I believe that the director's excuse is that he must be half-remembered dream sequence ... <br /> <br /> Other landscape thing that caught my attention the copper bottom pots. I do not think that the technology to do this has been developed in the fifties.
