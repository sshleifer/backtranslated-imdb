Expecting a combination of SciFi and period film about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of computers, and so on, I was disappointed with this movie meaningless pseudo-science, and a mixture of real and fabulous stories. It seems that the author (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has no real understanding of mathematics, technology and history, which are the subject of the film, but instead works with a kind of vague artistic impressions of them. It hits a sore spot with me, because I have long been irritated by the tendency of art to shove on and horrible misuse of scientific terms and concepts degree of confusion, for example: Emmy Coer: Â«informational waves have a half-life" Hell, "I'm not quite sure half of life is better than no life "<br /> <br /> this film is really worse than not to entertain - is misinformed .. only merit I can imagine, for it is that it can attract the viewer to learn about the subject of so much distort. It is more likely, I think, facilitate superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement is indistinguishable from magic.
