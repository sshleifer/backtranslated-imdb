I saw this movie and I was shocked! Robert Carlyle Sun Hitler, he is a man who, unfortunately, is trying to be Hitler. The film is lying, it does not reflect the truth. In the scene were Hitler hit a guy with a gun. Hitler never hit anyone, he does not hit people with his fist, but with soldiers fists. Realize ?? Another thing: It's too obvious that Hitler, that evil, he was more reasonable than those specified in this film. No German would not accept him as a leader, because you can see that it is evil. Thus, the real Hitler showed his evil side of the people. <br /> <br /> Does anyone of you Yankees watched the movie «Der Untergang» or «The Dawnfall»? It is a great film, with amazing actors. His German film. I think the topic of Nazi Germany, should not be understood as a film of people who know nothing of Germany. People! Watches «Der Untergang»: <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful film about a very sad period of time for people around the world.
