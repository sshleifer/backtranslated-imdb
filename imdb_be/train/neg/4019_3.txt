Dakota (1988) was one of the earliest Lou Diamond Phillips, starring vehicle. This film is similar to the latest released film Harley. There are some differences, but they are both the same. I do not know which one came first. I believe that it will remain one of the mysteries of life. But they're both troubled "children" who are trying to turn a live round. Instead bike is one include horse. They are basically the same film, and they both cheesy as hell. If you are a serious L.D.P. fan, then I recommend you see both of them. You get some extreme posturing and robbery with L.D.P. If you play then go for it. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended, except L.D.P. fans !!!
