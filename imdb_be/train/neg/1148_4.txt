Pedantic, Ultra-production of which is trying to chronicle the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It starts quite promising, with more corresponding probe in the plane bombings, but a melodrama featuring James Stewart and his wife Vera Miles is just to get in the way (Miles had a habit of playing cool under duress wife, and her frayed nerves come here right on schedule). Esteemed director Mervyn Leroy helmets this adaptation of the book Don Whitehead, but, in spite of the talent involved, the picture is not impressive. Better performance turned in Murray Hamilton as a partner of Stewart, but most of the dialogue is inappropriate and stubborn Shagan causes the film to seem twice as long as it is. * 1/2 ****
