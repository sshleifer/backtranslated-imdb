Budget worthy of the actors ... who knew these things are important. Do not waste your time on this piece of junk. Effects of shit. Act that shit. The only thing that could make it even tolerate was a bit cheap T & A, and that gets wasted in the first 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The only even remotely redemptive quality of this film is very embarrassing blasphemy. That was how they found only 7 people on the planet who had never cursed before. Hats off! <br /> <br /> If you want to see some dude in a bad suit, just go back and look at old photos of prom. The only way to Bigfoot Flick will be of no use to have a big budget and some actors who do not come from Frogballs Community Theater.
