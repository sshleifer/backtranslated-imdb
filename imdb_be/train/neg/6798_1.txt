This is the worst movie I have ever seen. All participants must be confused. All. Ice-T pathetic dialogue is absolutely horrible, and Hokie sun begins to describe the performance of each actor in this film. Plot steals from strongly ordered, but compared with Air Rage, Oscar material is ordered. I've never been so disappointed when watching a movie. Rage of the air to be burned ash closed the dungeon will never see the light of day again. Anyone who saw it should take a shower and wash the stench awful movie from them. The best part of this film, probably comes from the ending, when rolled loans. It was easily the worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T must adhere to law and order, as well as other people in this film have to retire early or to commit suicide. In any case, they should never try to be in a movie again.
