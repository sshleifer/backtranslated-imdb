Its unfortunate that someone has decided to tighten the best horror movies of all time in my book. This poor copy of stealing a lot of material from the first three films reaching even replicates how a man dies, and what will happen in the future, the key characters and basically trying to squeeze in three films in one and fails. He can not even create a good atmosphere for one terrible (except with the odd exception, where a large choral music evokes memories of old movies). <br /> <br /> The only thing we can be thankful for the fact that there was not Omen B.
