Unremarkable and unmemorable remake of the old, well-known British film. While it may be too slander in common disasters (which it is not), he never builds any voltage and outputs it to the TV origin. Richard Burton sleepwalks through his role, and closed (in this movie) a person Sophia Loren does not show a lot of passion, either. (**)
