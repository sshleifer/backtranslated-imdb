Damn, I thought I had seen some bad westerns. can not exceed the same. Hell, I think I'd rather make my eyes open to the Trinity triple function to scream loudly. I do not think I'll be able to watch Ben Hur again without laughing my ass off. Just very bad. <br /> <br /> But hey, if you like westerns blunt with recognized stars in the things to look at to jump out of Gregory Peck. This is just as bad, but much funnier. 1/10
