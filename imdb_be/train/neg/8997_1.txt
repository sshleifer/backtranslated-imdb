This is the worst film I've ever paid to see and save "They saved Hitler's brain," the worst movie I have ever seen period. When this movie came out, I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV and therefore to anticipate what I thought it would be the funniest film that can be obtained, since it has no restrictions on improvisation television shows have to deal with. <br /> <br /> Authors should think we'll throw in some rudeness, some flatulence joke, a cheap sex and risky side hey, we break down the ridiculous comedy. The game show parody nothing more than cheap unimaginable ups on Let's make a deal with the stupid brutality. Sitting someone to take off with a single girl and her boyfriend was just a bad middle school humor. Stun advertising suitable for humor Seasame-Street. LA Metro skit was bland tasteless humor with bloodlust. French chef go blind constantly saying "no difference" was with a French accent, and you will get my point. <br /> <br /> United funny parody participation Chevy Chase, which lasted for a full minute. This means that you get 60 seconds of entertainment in this film. Oh yeah, I read the comments about the entire country to be stoned to death in the 1970s, and you'll enjoy this movie if you are high. Well, most of the country has not been stoned in the 70s. If incompetent writers buzz he had to sleepy sinus medicine. There were 4 other people in the theater, but myself, when I saw this movie. Of course, the word did not get out yet how bad the movie was.
