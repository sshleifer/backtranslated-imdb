I'm marking this as a "spoiler" just because some of my comments on the content of the show, not the content itself. <br /> <br /> As I read the comments, it is obvious that the Republicans something to endure the show, but despise him, while the Democrats seem to relish in his so-called honesty. One reader even (so it seems) really points to the fact that he believes that these developments have made or could have happened when Bush was in elementary school. <br /> <br /> But as content as I see it, trying to be neutral, it is that the group that has made the series must be actually really Bush haters. In the episode I've seen in the past, s02e03, he showed that the program was to collect long before McCain became the front runner in the nomination; because other former front runners are all featured. <br /> <br /> Another thing that caught my attention was the use of add-in closets. I thought that the series has to be done in Europe, certainly not in the United States, because I do not know of any US homes that do not have built-in wardrobes, and, most likely, in the homes of artists. <br /> <br /> As I watch the show, and I get caught up in it, I was surprised to see that there must be a tremendous desire to writers to do what they can to confuse our president. Of course, there is a problem, as most American would agree, but that's no reason to be so hateful in public displays seen throughout the world. Perhaps this trend has now been found that show and the network, so if Obama or Hillary came in, they will continue to produce and air the same "humor" about them? <br /> <br /> Just one more comment on the remarks of the commentator. Turn out how a change in the election in 2000, according to this writer, he was sure that it would be a very different president acceptable. Wow, wishful thinking on his part. As for the 911 events, I believe that it was set in motion back when Clinton was president, and I can not see, as if Gore had been president of anything would be different.
