This kind of storytelling is unacceptable only reason this film somewhere above 5 stars with 10 lines, because he got George Lucas behind it, and it has the word "star" and "War" in its title. It is an insult for the first-time filmmakers, and many others who were there made clearly superior to films with excellent plot, letters and actions, but do not get credit. This is a travesty. <br /> <br /> First things first. History. Anakin's evolution? There. Except for a small make-up around the eyes, and a little shouting, no. He becomes a young, stupid, brash Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader in one hit. A unique sequence of Darth Vader in the original series was his mind, he was good at almost everything he did, planning, fighting, you name it. Anakin's only fitting thing, which is perceived in the prequel trilogy, his consistent stupidity. He even loses his body due to the attack of the stupid audacity. <br /> <br /> What part of Emperor Palpatine told him the legend of the Sith does not point to the emperor as a sieve? Unacceptable! <br /> <br /> The fight scene is used too much digital counterparts. Each flying everywhere, like a teddy bear in the doll house for fun. Count Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, nearly every soldier had a rubber Digital Dual jumping around. <br /> <br /> In one particular fight scene, Obi-Wan and Anakin in the climactic battle, they both actually stop in the middle of the parries and Riposto, tighten swords several times until inches apart. I understand that fights choreographed, but is it just me shaking my head in disgust and sure. <br /> <br /> The writing was awful. All dialogue was extremely poor quality. Good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman have done everything we could have a line, but it just was not enough. I can not say enough bad things about this movie. Too many special effects, plot holes larger than the center of the universe, and does not look at any of the characters. This is the biggest mistake of the film: nothing new is offered. We know the approximate picture of the whole, all Lucas made was the color of it. <br /> <br /> We know that Anakin has lost a limb. We know that Luke and Leia's brother and sister, we know that Luke Skywalker's son, we knew that Obi-Wan and Yoda go to the link, we all knew. Nothing new is offered in this film. If this is all the supporters would like, it is ok, Lucas could not go wrong. <br /> <br /> But when Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader, and he asks, after Padme, and heard that she had died, he reaches out his hand awkwardly and shouts «Nooooooooooooooooooooo». This scene is B-movie scream the whole way, and I half expected to go Darth Vader "danger to Robinson, DANGER" at any time. That's what it is. A B-movie disguised as a huge budget and a fan of ultra-loyalists who settle with what is now, that the first two films, have pulled their standards up to the pit of the earth.
