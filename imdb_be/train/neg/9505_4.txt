I'm not going to criticize the film. There is not much to talk about. It has good action scenes of animals that were probably quite strange at the time. Clyde Beatty is not quite the matinee idol. He was a little small and not very good looking. But that's okay. He is a man that the lion cage. We know that if he can not take time from their lions tend to his girlfriend, he will end up on the island and it must save the day. Someone said earlier that this is a history lesson. The scenes in the circus have one more day, especially children, who are hanging around. I did not realize that even in the thirties, they sailed on three masted schooners. It looks like something out of 1860. I believe that this footage they had. Not surprisingly, it was not destroyed. They always talk about fixing it. There's even a blimp. This tells us something about the male female relationship at the time of its kind Giggly stupidity. But if you do not take it too seriously, you can enjoy to watch.
