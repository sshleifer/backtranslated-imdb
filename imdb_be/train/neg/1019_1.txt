Honestly, until I watched this movie, I have heard many people say that this film was a disgrace. I do not believe that with Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey took the role in this film and watched it yourself. Apparently, they were right. I was very disappointed and wondering all the time during the film -. Why the hell did I watch this movie <br /> <br /> Of course, I did not expect a lot from Justin, he really does not belong to the cinema / theater business. But Morgan and Kevin? I could not stop asking myself why the hell they have agreed to take part in Edison. Frankly, their role is quite silly. <br /> <br /> Well, you might think when players suck, then I have to pay more attention to the story. This is really a story is the basis for the film, but the guys ... believe me ... it's not a movie that you want to give credit to his story. Imagine a smart ass journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a history against the system and at the same time learning how to become a "real" journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). All this was supported by one agent who still has a heart for justice (LL Cool J) and a brilliant researcher (Kevin Spacey). In the end, they beat the system with a happy ending story. <br /> <br /> Lord, I could not even keep it. Just remembering the movie makes me sick already. My advise guys do not look at it! Please save your money and time for another film.
