I tried to love this movie, actually. Watching it all I can think, "That guy gives me the creeps, I would get a court order." He also called codependency capital letters. Was it in fact it before you make a movie? "Let's make a film that puts two chronically depressed, socially inept people in relationships that are deepening their isolation and encourage them to complain about how bad their life!" From what I've seen in my life is that in recent years, which is earth we find attractive as a potential partner constantly unfortunately. <br /> <br /> The mood of the film is clearly the 80-ish; pensive and slow. Do not get me wrong, the film has its moments, but very few of them.
