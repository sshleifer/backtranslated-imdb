The return of one of those films for this niche group of people who love movies, that gave birth to them and confusing at the same time. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays lame buisnesswoman, which does not kill vampires or undress at all throughout the film. I was willing to put up with it, but I was not prepared to put up with the worst editing or in combination with meaningless retrospection. The result is that it breaks her car over when she was young. Or maybe I'm wrong, and it was just a memory. With this film it is impossible to say. Can you believe the same man who did the Army of Darkness made this crap? A much better idea is to stay home and watch Army of Darkness on the Sci Fi channel. This film had it all: a slovenly, and zombie dude with a chainsaw arm. Forgotten is not even one of these things.
