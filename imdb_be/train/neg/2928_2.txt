I would really, really wanted to see this movie, and began to wait for months to get it through our account Blockbuster Total Access. When he appeared in our mailbox, I threw it straight into the DVD-Player. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed, unfortunately, in turn, made me mad. I will give a chance to any film, even if I want to get out of the theater / click "Stop". I watched all the way through, but did not get anything from him, but disappointing. <br /> <br /> The action was very, very good, but that was about it. Nothing is explained; while we realize that Mathieu becomes depressed and lands in a mental hospital or something, we have never been given to understand that his "fall". While we understand that he and Cedric fall, again, we do not see, it happened and why it happened. During an interview with Dr. Mathieu Cedric he reveals that he cheated on him once, but it was not a big deal. I wanted to see it in retrospect, but no - nothing. We also get tips that Cedric was the one to bring the Mat to the hospital - but then again, we do not see it <br /> <br /> I know that some films are "take it as it is." But this film honestly checked me. When Pierre, the former Cedric shows in the club and the problem begins, we see neither hide his hair almost to the end, and it took me a good chunk of time to understand that Pierre was the former. His personality in the club, and if Matt finds it totally different. I might not even be right in saying it was that confusing. <br /> <br /> The film expects you to know everything, and move with her disjointed, out of place and confusing pace. I can not keep up with films such as "Pi," "Citizen Kane" and other films that have a retrospective / flash-forward left and right, but CU entirely capture and hold style. At the end of "Citizen Kane," you know what is happening and to answer the main secrets. CU just leaves you hanging. He has air in his claims, "we're not going to tell you a damn, figure it out for yourself" presentation. It's like reading a book with the head switched around and pages are missing. <br /> <br /> Good acting, as I have already said. I liked the characters, but the whole thing was very disappointing.
