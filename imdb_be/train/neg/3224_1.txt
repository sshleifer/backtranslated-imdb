When I was a child, I remember watching it while visiting one of our "Uncle" Phil. We're back! The history of dinosaurs silly cartoon of a dinosaur called Rex (voiced by the wonderful John Goodman). He says a little boy dinosaur story about how dinosaurs are back on earth to live. He explains that he was part of the things that brought them back, along with some friends. Doctor / Professor of the villain of the film, I think that may have been responsible for them have them back, but I do not care about him. Children could, but personally it's too cheesy. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing. Too bad!
