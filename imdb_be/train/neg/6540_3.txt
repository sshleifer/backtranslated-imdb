I can not believe that so many have compared this film to Argento. His work is much more imaginative and vicious. - and much more fun, <br /> <br /> The director just do not have the ability to build a real strain. murder scene - and let's face it, this is what the genre is all about - are not interested. It was not difficult to guess who the killer is, and I do not really care when it was discovered. Cinema is not memorable, and so appreciated the gothic atmosphere of the 19th century simply did not draw me. Some of the actors are pretty good (especially the boss and sadistic girl who dominates his younger students), but they 're given very little in common. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are overtones of incest, sadomasochism and lesbianism, but surprisingly, they add a little spice or unknown. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
