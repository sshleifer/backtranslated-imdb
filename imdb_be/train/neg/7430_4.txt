In this "tense" thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays a gentle Patrick, who runs the leading ghetto children to "trust the courses." He romances a woman with a bog-standard mop-top mid-90s under the name of the baby, Eric. The woman drunken ex-husband soon arrived at the scene and began to fiddle with Pierce. <br /> <br /> At one stage Pierce innocently makes «vegeburgers». Husband included. Pierce resumed making vegeburgers. The husband then attacking Pierce. Small pieces of uneaten vegeburger call drop from the mouth Pierce. Fighting breaks, the sun showing results.
