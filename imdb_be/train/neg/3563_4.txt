Fot the most part, this movie feels like effort "made for television". Direction awkward acting (except Fred Gwynne) is overwhelmed and soap. Dennis Crosby, in particular, delivers her lines as she reads them cold cue cards. Only one thing makes this film worth watching, and when-Gage comes back with «Semetary.» There is something disturbing, watching a small child murder someone, and this film may be more than some can handle only for this reason. It is absolutely bone-chilling. This film does one thing right, but it knocks that one right out of the park. Worth seeing just in the last 10 minutes or so.
