I was a fan without a trace from the premiere episode. I really can not express my disappointment in the episode last week. This is a real problem that too many Afican-American families have dealt with and continue to deal with. The lack of media coverage in the crucial first 48 hours has been documented in a recent study. Law enforcement agencies, including local, state and federal also involved. What was the purpose of the subject of advertising, and then escapes to the final? It would seem that the TV can work with almost any object other than a RACE. It shameful.Get this together or not to explore it the next time.
