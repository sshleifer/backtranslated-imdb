I youngsters for a good novel, but this one does not qualify as good or romance. I had the story nailed before the credits have been through. With such bad dialogue, plot and character development, I propose to invest a half hour elsehere. I had to run out and rent Serendipity for a third time, so I could get the bad taste of this one out of my mouth.
