I love horror movies. I can even estimate the majority of cheese (before that, 9 out of 10 horror movies these days the cheese), but this was ridiculous. Terrible acts scared to write, quite hollow and incredible characters (without Meisner actors here!) And the complete absence of a sufficient number of bodies. I would like to save 79 minutes of my life I just wasted. At least, Crook brothers aptly named. The only good thing is the whole movie watching Alicia Silverstone wanna-be to get punched in the face. As it has ever done this Sundance quite incomprehensible to me. Most of the story was completely unrealistic, even chipper film standards. I mean, come on! Who would run out to get a cheap earrings 10 seconds after a horrible stalker guy just left his door? Lame.
