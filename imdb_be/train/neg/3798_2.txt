And it's the only reason why I have this DVD. Now I have not seen the first film Nemesis, but I check the information out of him, and then I say: What? Why? Because in the first film, Alex was a man. But then again, the first one was established in the future, so perhaps this is a completely new Alex scientist and just happened to Alex female at this time. Who knows, at least, in any case, it has not been considered in the film <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the plot :. Alex, still a child, then (or whatever you want, as it were, there are, in the future) escapes with her mom with a special time the ship and ends at 80 years in Africa. There's mom dies, and Alex (Sue Price) grows in the African tribe. Then the tribe gets cut cyborg from the future, and then Alex runs away i hiding, and finally it kills cyborg. So there. Sounds familiar, does not it?. <br /> <br /> Terminator is not the only film that broke here Predator gets its fair share, too, and I think the first film The Fly, the Vincent Price one receives a special allocation for giving a solid foundation to create your cyborg head . <br /> <br /> Let's see, what else? Well, the movie was pretty standard low budget flick, but it's really bad special effects for the film in the mid 90s. It would look good for a 80-Flick as ever. The biggest problem is the plot. Things just happen and the viewer a little interested. Nemesis 2 Sun crappiest piece of cinema I had the pleasure (?) To see, but it comes pretty darn close. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything about the action, because let's be honest: anyone waiting for an Oscar worthy performance here? Well ... at least I found Sue Cost hot in the amazonian warrior's path <br /> <br /> «real» Movie Rating A :. 2/10 There is not a lot of advantages of the most quality, and in spite of the very basic plot of the film is itself makes very little sense <br /> <br /> A movie camp rating :. 4/10 I received occasional laugh from pure hazard film, so it has little merit in it.
