One previous reviewer called the film "pure visual pleasure," I wonder if s / he saw the same movie that I did. "High Art" had to have the most relentlessly depressing interior, as the "Seven". One can almost forgive Sheedy and Mitchell pad for going to B & B for their first fold. Of course, before they do so, one needs to look towards the opium den, populated by people who probably will not be invited, but can somehow maintain a thriving drug addiction. Not to mention the icy gaze of the usual types of movies in / Boyfriend Girlfriend at the start, who know that they are going to be thrown somewhere over the next 100 minutes or so. The film also says that the nature of Sheedy retired from professional photography for ten years. What did she do, to retire at the age of twenty?
