In this amazing negligent apocalypse, the world suffers from a double plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be not too concerned about the Grade-Z film that exposes at least similar to the famous short novel Fanny than my mother's lasagna recipe. Sadly the staff are still working gas stations, doctors still make house calls and police officer show more useful with radiator fluid only when you need it. Story, and I use this term in a broad sense, it includes the father and daughter trying to rendevous with the "General", whose daughter is missing, in the church, to kill a vampire, which is very convenient, happens to travel with my father and daughter. I must admit that a moment or two of the humor can be found between the broad areas of unintentional humor. The film also boasts just enough nudity to a boy of fourteen interested. Anyone older than beware.
