Vagabond gives a secret serviceman tip about a secret service man in the presidential detail, who plans to kill the president. Nonsense. Like ass know? The script then calls the most detailed study of how the secret service, but who cares. Much of it simply slows down the movie. All chases going version of this film with the tedious racing cars of many films. Then, after a lot of athleticism is impossible, in which our hero beats and instruments from all his friends, we have a shootout in Toronto City Hall. Canadians are clearly marked maple leaves, but how do they get it? Finally, everything worked out. But it still makes no sense.
