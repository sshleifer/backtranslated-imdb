What a terrible movie. Rotten tomatoes were good for that too. do not be fooled by the positive comments; It was not terrible. It was not funny. It was not reasonable. It will not even keep your attention. I just wasted 2:00 of my life, which considered this shit Festival. computer generated monster it was interesting to see the first couple times. after about 15 minutes, he no longer entertained. dialogue was awful thing to be translated. Another negative that stood out was the idiot Americans. 3 shows and they were not lacking character, intelligence and judgment. Now I will write a few lines to inflate it, as we should have 10. Employees in the video store have slapped me for the name of the counter.
