"Envy" is bad for several reasons. Yes, there are unsympathetic characters. This is not a problem. This is something that they are not nice, and we do not care about them at all. "War of the Roses" signs unsympathetic character, but because of their own implementation, we have grown to at least find themselves interested in their fate, while in "Envy," the introduction of thin, the characters never believable, and the story makes it worse. <br /> <br /> Ben Stiller just pushes in his role, and I am a supporter of his work much of the time. Stiller agitated that it was released directly to video, and now I understand why. The film suggests that he is "best friends" with Jack Black, but the first five minutes we are shown footage that appears to show Stiller hates black. I thought that it will develop at some one-way communication (à la «The Cable Guy»), but he never does, and Stiller insists he is his "best friend", and I felt confused himself, he seemed refers to black as well, "poo." The film is funny, but it does not matter, because it must be exaggerated morality tale. Unfortunately, the message is lost in confusion. Walken gives a good performance, but Black excluded key and annoying (and I used to find it very funny.) no, it's not a terrible film, but I still can not believe that Bar th Levinson ( "Rain Man," "Sleepers") is responsible for it - this is not one of the worst films of all time, but it can certainly be a lot better, I want to Va is-Pu-Riza really exist - so that we could make the film disappear forever ....
