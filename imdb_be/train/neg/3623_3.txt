(In other words: BLOOD ZAMOKLI SKRYAT or demon) <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> It was a drive in particular, to the account with the velvet vampire. Spanish-Italian co-production, where the number of women killed in the village about the same time the local Count named Janos Dalmar seen on horseback, riding off with his "man-eater" dog him. <br /> <br /> townsfolk already suspect that he is the one behind all this and wants his castle burned. Murder first began in the time of Count Janos older brother, Earl, Igor Dalmar was badly burned and killed in a lab accident. <br /> <br /> The woman then Ivan (Erna Schuer), Igor hired before his death, to help it in his experiments he shows up. Janos agrees to hire her on the spot of his brother and together they are looking for the formula for the regeneration of dead cells. Janos wants the charred corpse of Igor to life. <br /> <br /> But, of course, Igor is still alive (though badly burned) and the persecution and murder of women in the village. We see its carbon baked faces appear at different points in the film, so we know that he is still alive, making it all seem a little too obvious. <br /> <br /> Igor meets with another fiery end when he gets into a fight over Ivan Janos, with a burning candle falling on the same bed, that Igor will come across at meetings is another, final character-baked finish. <br /> <br /> DVD retronositeleya taken from VHS sources and looks grainy and bad. Other than even scratchier trailers, no other extra not included. Although he has a good, awful Spanish castle and good atmospherics, I found it quite boring and predictable, without emotion or secrets at all. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
