How fricken Â»time we should see a ghost passing by in the background and reaches a maximum in reflection mirror? This was done in two dozen films in recent years, and four dozen times in this volatile, poorly made film. There were only two crazy moments to appreciate .... if ghosts rushed personal space of two characters. Speaking of characters, the acting was flat as Diet Coke in a 64 oz. cup I drew him. The side characters can be pulled from different cartoon Scooby Doo. He was friendly, at the age of sheriff. Kooky oddball was living in the wilderness stretching from Alabama. Lots'o'characters without any development. The most disturbing way was murdered child in the beginning. But rather than examine the murder of a child, that would be interesting, they just let us know that she was dead and her parents had difficulty reconciling her death with the public and with each other. When they reach the cabin, the scene .... rarely mingled with flashing images of a dead daughter interjected here and there. Oh ... and the terrible sounds were also exaggerated. You know what I mean .... squeaky doors that open by themselves, crickets in the woods, chatter chatter. Ooooohhhh. I have not seen that before. Again, you will see an amazing self-opening door in the movie over and over again. WARNING FOR DIRECTOR: terrible scene just terrible, if it is not repeated every 5 minutes in the same film. Think of these things, before shouting "this wrapper!"
