I'm a big fan of war films, and, as a combat vet Vietnam, have some experience with the technical details. I worked with a bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for him. Other vets and vets of Iraq, in particular, summed up inaccuracies in the film very well. Poetic license is one thing, but this film is full of imagination, and not bad because of it. No unit of neutralization, or any unit, never assumes this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes. Conscription compliance and because of the discipline, it saves lives. The opening scene is particularly annoying me. A guy with a mobile phone would be immediately shot. Shouting "Stop" kit is not an effective deterrent. It got worse from there. Scenes from a sniper were particularly egregious. As already noted, the average EOD guy does not know about, jack sniper, and I think that any Arab sniper, who is well really stretches the imagination. Abduction Arab businessman in some form of personal revenge will not be simple. Someone might shoot him, but this kind of risk is limited to the movies. I could go on, but, as I said, others have noted these things in detail. This is not a good movie, and if he will win any awards at all, it is a further reflection of why «La La Land» so named.
