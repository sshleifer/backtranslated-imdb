Do not get me wrong, it's horrible, formulaic film, but it is fun for fans of Jose - quite possibly the most intoxicating beauty ever adorn the silver screen. One poster said that it was unpleasant to watch - I wonder what his ideal woman looks - Paris Hil-whore? Blockbuster must ascertain subgenre to this type of film, like Fatal Attraction story has become a genre in itself. If Blockbuster take «Adultry» section? It will fit in quite nicely between drama and action sections, is not it? The film revolves around Jose, who spends the night of passion with an unstable boat owner who may have killed his ex-wife, who looks great, as Mrs. Jose. This slacker continues to haunt Olivia and, consequently, to make her life a living-hell. I like Olivia Hussey, but I have no sympathy for the characters in the film, who deceive their husbands, so I do not really rooting for Olivia to make it about that bitch alive <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE :. $$ (There is a small amount of violence in the film. Don Murray and Anthony John Denison participate in boxing if Denison says he will not stop seeing Olivia Murray's wife, because she is too good in bed. Olivia also gets to handle the arrow and can get pinch-round - I'll let you see) <br /> <br /> nudity: $$ (Olivia queen brief nudity and delivers little here she has a love scene .. Anthony John Denison, as well as a shower scene - a shot from a distance) <br /> <br /> History: $ (We've seen this story before - a hundred times more, and often does yatstsa much better .. the true culprit, trying to decipher why this movie was bad, is William Ried. Dialogue man is babble and moronic. man does not tell abilities and build Belie human reactions to other portable story. These people from the higher strata of society, as they say students medium -. the habit of sleeping during the English lesson I put on Riead Never-to-be-treated-Again list) <br /> <br /> action :. $$$ (action is not "call-in" as they say insiders, but was hampered by a lot of juvenile script Riead in. Jose refers to calling Jonh Anthony Denison "weird" and "crazy" on his face as he begins to pursue . it Jose, which is still beautiful, provides the best performance here, but Denison equal to the task of drawing a crazy, love-crazed stalker Don Murray was basically only there -. his character is not specified, and Edward Asner, actor stunning when something is given to a substance used in this bad film).
