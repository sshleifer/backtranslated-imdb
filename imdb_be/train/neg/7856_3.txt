This movie pretty much sucked. I'm in the army, and the soldiers depicted in this film is terrible. If your in the military, and you see this movie you will laugh and be upset about the whole movie because they acted as a team. It was funny. They acted like a bunch of normal people with uniforms of the Army to not knowing what to do. It was a pretty bloody film that I would have to say more. There were a couple of scenes where they try to make you jump. I would recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see violence, bloody movie. This will be the best film, and if you're not in the military. I would also like to say I liked the first better than this.
