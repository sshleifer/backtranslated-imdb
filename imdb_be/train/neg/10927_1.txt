Reviews of the movie lukewarm at best, while the expectations were sky high: big budget, so popular people pretty fun idea and the main actress of all love. The end result is a disaster. supposedly humorous journey of Alice Tremblay in a fantasy world fails in all respects, to entertain his audience (I did not hear any laughter throughout the presentation), after passing through this page thin storyline and one-dimensional characters without a single spark, sun sign of magic it wanted it was. 90 minutes of the film are sterile with some clunky direction and good actors do their best to come as the professional features, which, of course, may not seem a great idea on the set, not to mention the work. «L'Odyssée d'Alice Tremblay" is a collage of comic sketches associated with (very) thin layer of good ideas. Avoid or boredom will haunt you.
