This film is not worth the film was photographed. The dialogue is flat, filled with clich√©s and overused lines delivered amateur actors who sound like their first time to read the script. Shifting, shaky, the style of the film is a cheap imitation of the "Ring" type of visual effects. Symbols do not behave like a normal person. For example, a character who is looking for her twin sister in her home makes her way through the front door, crawling around the house all scared and crying, and she did not once call out the name of her sister to see if she is home. What? You would think that she had just buried his sister, rather than to look for her. Too many flashbacks to her childhood. Too many unnecessary retrospective is a typical sign of an amateur filmmaker. It's actually funny to watch numerous shots of women at the wheel of his car down the street, on the way up, around the corner, here, there, on the side view, a front view is now. Enough already. Do you think that you are watching a television commercial for Solaris! Scary movie. 0 out of 100. I'm sorry to anyone who spent money doing this film and watch it.
