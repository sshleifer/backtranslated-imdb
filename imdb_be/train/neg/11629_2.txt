** SPOILERS ** KHAMOSH completely unrealistic, not enough of the plot, and basically just forced to see the stars represent themselves. The most disturbing scene in the movie was when Shabana Azmi in the shower, and then we see her TV plays a shower scene with PSYCHO. This film is actually waiting for its users find the character Neysiraddin Shah has a good enough memory to remember where some shots were fired and how many! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER STARTS *** <br /> <br /> in the end, the murderer spills his guts to Shabana Azmi long enough to allow the character Neysiraddin Shah to run and shoot he! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ended *** <br /> <br /> this is a bit of humor (just a little) in the beginning to hear the director and the actors are members of throwing insults at each other and hear Shabana Azmi exclaim " Oh, sh-t! Â»<br /> <br /> generally ,! baaaaaaaaaaad film <br /> <br /> Rating: ** ********** with (2 of 10)
