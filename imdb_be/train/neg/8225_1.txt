DO NOT WATCH THIS SAD grounds for the film. I have spent time and money on this, and I'm really p ** sed off about it. <br /> <br /> action is comparable to a high school plays. The scenario is shocking. There is no plot. Twenty minutes from the end (I think that I should be rewarded for their achievements), I had a headache from all crying, weeping and wailing, five girls do. <br /> <br /> Most of the violence (rare for a film at the moment) suggested that instead of a graphic, but I found a character so damn annoying, I'd like to see them, and in fact every person involved in the creation this part of the s ** t die in the horrible way possible. <br /> <br /> I spend ten minutes of my life, saving you from a very poor 100 minutes of your. Do not do it.
