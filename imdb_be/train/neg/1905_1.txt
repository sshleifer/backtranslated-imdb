I am one of the biggest fans of silent comedians, and probably considered a Buster Keaton movies IMDb than any other person. Every film he has made since the beginning of his career in the early 30-ies of only two exceptions there I could see, so you can say I'm a big fan. It is because of this that I found this episode so painful and hard to watch. I loved the movie and the man continued to think Â«Buster, how could you?". Well, now that I think about it, I guess I can understand why Buster Keaton starred in this god awful episode Dark Zone. He lost most of his fortune after messy divorce in the early 1930s, and his film career in the long past as a leading man as well. Now, in the 1960s, Keaton need money and liked it a resurgence in popularity, so he whored themselves for those who are willing to pay. - appear in the Beach movie, and it's a mess episode long series <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the episode is that this is just terribly written and Buster deserves much better. The show is to be funny, but this is not the case and instead of respect for the silent films simply painful to watch - especially with Keaton put this silly sends a trip back in time, as all poorly executed farce. Do yourself a favor, skip this - it is a pale imitation of greatness that once was Keaton's career !!!
