This is it. This is one. This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. It beats everything. I have never seen worse. Pension trophy and give these people ..... there is no simple and does not compare. <br /> <br /> Even three days after the show (for some reason, I still do not know why) I can not believe how insane this monstrous film / was. Its so bad. So far from anything that could be considered the film, the story, or what was supposed to have ever been created and put into our existence. <br /> <br /> It made me question whether or not, people really do good to put on this earth. It made me feel disgusted with myself and our progress as a species in the universe. This type of film truly hurts us as a society. We should be ashamed. I really can not emphasize enough that our global responsibility as the people who live here and the creation of art, is that we need to prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own good. This difficulty. I do not know how on earth any of these actors, writers, or the director of this film is sleeping at night knowing that they had a role in the creation of «Loaded». I do not know what kind of hideous monsters like to watch these types of movies. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I love a good "bad" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love bad taste, they are fun. I tell all my friends to see them, because they are "bad". <br /> <br /> But it ....... it crosses the line "bad" in a whole new dimension. It's uncomfortable bad. This is bad, if you know all that needs to happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence before they occur; and not just as a second or two before, I mean, like, after the first 5 minutes before viewing. <br /> <br /> Each cheesy editing "effect" shamelessly used again and again to the point of nauseating. I really do not want to see the "shaky" camera "drug buzz rush" effect or hopping cuts or reject cuts or ANY Fancy CUT EVER AGAIN EVER. It thoroughly sad, repetitive and just to torment the audience. <br /> <br /> But ....... and let me be specific here, the most disturbing thing about this film is that in view of production, it appears that a few decent amount of money actually invested in the feces. I personally take over the shoulders of the director, if I ever see him and shake him into submission, demanding that he run home and swallow two gallons of Drain-O, or I'll do it for him. <br /> <br /> If we ever needed a new form of inhumane torture our prisoners abroad, they just keep showing this film in padded cell again and again. Believe me, I think they will be more extravagant methods of suicide after the 72nd time sitting through it. <br /> <br /> Stop these films, they are simply the most disgusting of all aspects of our society. Please. Stop. NOW.
