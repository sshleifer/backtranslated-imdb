I found a post in this film, totally terrible. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved this film I have rated it as 1 of 10 performance was Lacy Chabert, who I thought played a few individuals really well. It was for me, of course, the highlight of this film. <br /> <br /> Dina Meyer is good as always, but I found her role is quite soft, so I do not think we can say that its action was great. <, Br /> <br /> respect to the male lead, Armand Assante, his interpretation of the role reminded me mostly of doctors in hospitals cheese 1980 series. <br /> <br /> All I could live with. However, a terrible, terrible, terrible end / solution, the role of the mental and even the role of the psychic were only some of the worst writing I've seen in a long time.
