The main contender for the worst movie ever made. character Joanna flour seems to have IQ 3, which is only one less than the writer and director. The scenario would not pass the class letters high school; that the "joke" of the juvenile; banal concept. These performers were obviously desperate for work. I stayed up late just to see if it will get worse. He did. Life is too short to spend part of it to watch this movie.
