The main drawback of the film is its screenplay uninspired. He pulled back and forth between the vignettes of the history of Bettie and re-works of short films Klaw. While Klaw recovery is well done, there is no need to recreate them in the near entirety. Page Richards, actress and not a country, does a decent job as a whole. And, sometimes, it really has a great resemblance to Betty. We should also note some proper attention to detail. Costumes and clothing is well made, because some of the predetermined direction. Sets are usually few and feel stage-y, but feel the era. Sometimes surprisingly good light, and the color palette has been clearly thought out to give a general view of a vibrant, retro feel.
