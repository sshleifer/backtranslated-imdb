Obviously, I do not care about things Going (aka "Things to Come") as well as the majority of viewers. This means that there is a good chance that you will enjoy it more than I do. Anyway, you might find it useful to hear the movie, described from a different perspective. <br /> <br /> directed by William Cameron Menzies, who had as much experience as a director and even more as an art director is the film adaptation of HG Wells in his novel of the same name. In my eyes, it helps demonstrate why the great novelist may not necessarily be a great writer. <br /> <br /> The film opened in London in 1940 as «Everytown». War is brewing and citizens Everytown concerned that he can reach them. He does. And it turns into a long-term deal that basically destroys civilization. Wells and Menzies keep jumping forward in time to show us different scenes related to the war and its consequences. We see the two pilots, one shot down, coming to terms with the consequences of their military actions. We meet the post-apocalyptic community ruled on potential military commander. He meets people from the growing futuristic society. We thus see that the technology is changing. And finally we are accepted in the full realization of this futuristic society approx 2036 where leaders discuss the merits of sending a man to the moon. <br /> <br /> This may sound all potentially very interesting, but it just does not work as a movie. Structurally, the film is too episodic, with a little harsh to tie it together. In the third segment, I completely lost interest in trying to keep track of the characters. I was barely able to sort them in the first pair of segments. There is a constant parade of new faces. We do not get to know anything about any of them. <br /> <br /> It does not help that the individual segments, with a couple of exceptions, are generally uncomfortable directed and edited. In addition, they sometimes manipulative - can almost start to feel like a propaganda film. But perhaps contradictory segments is also a bit cold and dry emotionally. <br /> <br /> In fact, one overlong section is more like a video / industrial commercial. If features shots construction futuristic city, with lots of big machines, a lot of welding, and so on. At some point, the guy who looks like astronaut wave in the chamber after a futuristic glass. Music for this section is somewhere between militaristic and bloated horror account. I can not say that things cometh consists of bringing the material to the point of view of the drama. <br /> <br /> But the general outcry in support of the future, that it is "a film about ideas." That may be true, but there are some problems with it, if you look at this way. Firstly, it does not make it work in _as film_, ie, as a visual and aural drama art, and two, there are too many of the ideas presented here. <br /> <br /> The principle idea is that the war and what it does to civilization. It's a good thing to make a film about. It is also strange prophecy of the Second World War, as a future event was filmed on the script, and in 1935 (released in 1936). Wells has some interesting things to say about the war, some of which are contrary to the usual interpretation of the film. For example, the ending seems to believe that another war flares up, or at any time. The general idea seems a trifle pessimistic. Wells seems to show that the war is just part of human nature, which can not be cut, although this does not exclude the possibility of "progress". - actually, maybe it is fueling progress, at least indirectly <br /> <br /> This would certainly be enough for one film. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of ideas here. The scene between the two pilots is one of the most critical scenes in the film. We are talking about a complex dilemma. One pilot shot down another, but now comes to help him. But the pilot who was shot down carrying a poisonous gas, which is now picking up on the field. They can not even breathe the gas without harm. She comes. They have only two functioning masks between them. A pilot who was shot down offers his mask as he says he is still dying. What to do? This is not something that this very scene can be stretched to the length of the show, but the idea - a bizarre complex to help and trying to hurt each other in the midst of war. - enough to build a film on the <br /> <br /> Another example. In scenes with potential military commander, in a post-apocalyptic environment, there is an unpleasant contagious disease called "wandering disease" comes around. It turns the victims into a sort of drunken zombies. The usual procedure is to shoot the victims on the ground in an attempt to prevent the disease. This material is considered as if it were an afterthought. This is a great idea and deserves his own movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, Wells represents the future of society as having conflicting ideas of socialism. That was enough for his own movie, too. It is simply impossible to effectively cope with such a large amount of material in 100 minutes, especially when it has to be the essence of the film instead of the dramatic attraction. <br /> <br /> However, there are reasons to give things to come in at least one view. If you are at all a science-fiction buff, this is a historically important film. Given the background Menzies, production and set design are interesting, even if the film industry seems extremely outdated. It is also interesting to see how Wells was either prophetic or humorous retrospective of his "predictions". I especially enjoyed the vehicle on the moon, which was strongly reminiscent of Méliès 1902 Trip to the Moon (aka Le Voyage Dans La Lune). Just do not expect too much from things.
