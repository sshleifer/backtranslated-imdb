Facts about National Lampoon goes to the movies, AKA National Lampoon movie Madness: <br /> <br /> 1. bad movie, even the typical standards of the humorist. 2. It's not funny. 3. No one goes to see a movie. <br /> <br /> So, after I finished playing, I began to wonder why on earth it is called "National Lampoon goes to the movies", and why it was ever conceived, much less on actually I made. It would be a challenge Austin Powers "American guy goes to the movies. How lame. He was not an American, and he does not go to the movies. None of the characters in the so-called" satire "satire is not funny, and no one to go see films, which causes a little problem. I was hoping it would be something in the spirit of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it is not. <br /> <br /> this was the first film National Lampoon's Animal House when, although you could not tell it from the movie quality. Poor developed rough and amateurish by any measure, it causes headaches ?? is good sign for the 89-minute film, which, . Seems to be twice the length <br /> <br /> I've noticed a pattern really bad movies are usually renamed ?? and this little accident falls under this category It has two separate names -.. Probably try to help and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad it was panning from home video critics in 1982/83. "Hmm, the film Madness ?? I have never heard of this movie before! Let us rent it! And then, the realization: "Hey, wait a minute, it's only National Lampoon goes to the movies <br /> <br /> It was postponed MGM / UA, will never be released in theaters or DVD; sometimes he appears on television a few! time in a decade that has just one place, you will manage to find it. <br /> <br /> it is divided into three floors ?? parody of self-expanding video, oil and corporate ruthlessness and cruelty of police / cop-buddy movie (I think). The first segment of the stars Peter Riegert (animal House is) did not take place as the man razvodits camping with his wife and doing some other things. I'm not sure, because it was so sad, my mind began to drift. While the sex scene is not popped up. <br /> <br /> Part II of the exotic dancer raped oil stick ( do not ask me), who decides to become the queen of margarine, so it can cut off the supply of dairy products Oh It contains a funny line in the movie:.! "Only I can make love to my son! If you think that does not sound very funny, you're right ?? it is not. And just imagine ?? It is the highlight of this film! <br /> <br /> Part III is about a cop who chases down a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) only to lose composure and shoot the guy. He really has one funny scene, but he acted extremely excessive ?? Only Lloyd really has no humor, he plays his character dry and compassionate, but surprisingly unrealistic. The part where he suppresses his victim and gentle policeman stands, watching it all unfold, at least, cause a laugh or two. <br /> <br /> It is a shame to turn to a low level to watch is the throwing of a semi-famous names. The authors of each segment clearly believe that they are being very ironic and clever substitution of the so-called stereotypes ?? error in that the film becomes a great controversy in the use of a standard T & A instead of section; crude humor instead of witty dialogue; desperate performances instead of inspiring them. It is easy to see that none of the participants were not fascinated with the material, muttering their lines often so confused, they are rarely able to make eye contact with the camera. <br /> <br /> The film is not funny, as I said before. I laughed once, only a single line, and even then he was a half-hearted one. Two laughing, smiling, and very weak laugh. Compared with Movie Madness, a number of other worthy comedies, it seems like a regular laugh track. <br /> <br /> I like the series of National Lampoon vacation (or, at least, three of the four parts) and classic house for animals, but also their recent killing of those bombs to direct the video, such as Golf Punks ( this great comic genius Tom Arnold) provides a good example of why their magazine was published over ten years ago. He gets very old, very fast. <br /> <br /> It is sad to see a new movie called miners discharged from their "stamp of approval". It's like condemning a film before it even hits the theaters ?? maybe they should start not advertise his name everywhere ?? <br /> <br /> distributor: "This film is bad. He receives National Lampoon seal of approval. This will teach you not to do something so bad next time. <br /> <br /> Forget about the death penalty. Just stick to the pile of criminals in the room and get them to watch it again and again every day for a month. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I can not even begin to explain their rotten meanness. I give up.
