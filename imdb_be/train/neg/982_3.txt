The real star of this absurd story glorious technicolor. Visual treat eye, the film does not stimulate the mind and heart. I was intrigued at first, the idea Dietrich Boyer and leaving religion to "find" his ability to love. Below is a huge disappointment. Boyer is the only real player in the production and one feels his suffering. Surprisingly, wardrobe Dietrich overshadows its performance - sometimes its scary looking face - to numb the mask. As a monk, Boyer spent liquor formula monastery (which reminds me of a true story Chartreuse) - when he leaves his "marriage of God" response from the fraternity holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion. The viewer feels Boyer is well rid of her past. Nevertheless, the journey is worth all too predictable.
