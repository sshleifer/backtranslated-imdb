Full marks to the content of the film, as the Brit I did not know that there was segregation in the US Navy during World War II. Very bold attempt to bring this fact around the world. Nevertheless, the film is miserable, there is no direction, wooden acting and the script just one clich√© after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I sat and wrung from start to finish on a very bad road, it was put together. This could be a great movie, the story for many of us outside the US, it was a new, unique and interesting. The sad fact is, so that it was collected. Unfortunately, the real story, as that would change the attitude of people who were confused on a low budget, poorly directed movie. I just hope that some time in the future, one of the largest studios will take this topic and do it justice.
