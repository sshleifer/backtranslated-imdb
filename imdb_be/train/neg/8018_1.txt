Wow, I hated this movie. The subject should lead to a really thin film and leading actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to deal with this topic, but the script - even if it * was * a script - it's a mess. This is less than the movie a random slide show that is not going anywhere. I would say that this is going nowhere fast, except for the fact that it really is the longest 81 minutes you'll ever sit. As I have said, a good leading actor. So Faruza frame (SP?), As it is sometimes harsh, but, ultimately, those who love and host mother. The filmmakers have a lot to answer here because it's a mess. A real shame, because I really wanted to like this movie, but this is mainly due duplicates of the film that was never made. Skip this one - it's not even worth $ 6, I was lecturing for pay-per-view.
