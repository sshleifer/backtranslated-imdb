Wow, the spookiest thing about this episode was the price of the house 40 years ago. I preface by saying I am not a supporter of the episodes narrated. If history / actors / etc .. that are worth their salt, they should be able to pass most of the story, do not read it, reminded me of the characters, who can not think offhand, but rely on a teleprompter. Psychobabble was tedious and boring, but some people use these things, it's just not my cup of tea O. They could have kept the story, but at least it made it much more believable and interesting, if it comes from a psychiatrist or maybe newspaper reporter or something. Pathetic little things like Peugeot to be in the house, which has a special semicircle driveway, but he seems to have put the car in the tree he was standing under the ground, because there was no sign on the road or on the property. Sloppy editing, because it draws on the road (for what seems to be the 100th time), who exactly are these two guys that you see on 24m30s walked to the car as it pulls in the way of an abandoned house? Trolley large plan has also been exaggerated, as some Jr. High drama student demonstrating the zoom function on his camera for the first time. I could go on picking up each other, but that could get almost as much as the sad episode was. He kept dragging, and the true purpose seemed to use everything they shot footage of Elaine driving a convertible Newport. I expect to see Chrysler logo and a pleasant chime to play while the voice-over told us of 8 tracks player, automatic top, etc. The only good thing I have to say about it is that it just ends abruptly. No loose ends not connected, no explanation or terminated. Not that many have noticed, I suspect most of them have changed the channel or dozed off to the end.
