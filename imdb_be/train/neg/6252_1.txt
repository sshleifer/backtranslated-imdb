Ronald Reagan and a bunch of American soldiers in the North Korean prison camp. They are trying to ... We learn from the North Korean Communists are bad people ... We learn beard Americans are growing very slowly, over days of torture ... <br /> <br /> I tried to suppress it, but I finally burst into a laugh this film. It was the scene when Mr. Reagan comes out to tell the Communists that he wants to be on their side. He then asks for a bottle of cognac. Next, acting sober stone, he takes a drunken friend, Dewey Martin to get the sulfur cure a hangover, Mr. Martin. Of course, the North Korean communist Guard as dumb as they come. So drunk distract the guard while Reagan move to get something out of the box, which is located next to a pile of empty boxes. I'm sure he boxes should contain something; but, of course, Reagan makes them shake enough to find them empty. I have to laugh! I think that the "prisoner of war" will refer mainly to the families and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise, it is wasteful. <br /> <br /> * Prisoners of War (1954), Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Dewey Martin
