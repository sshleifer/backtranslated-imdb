Why oh why do people take the good stuff and feel the need to change it up a bit how? After reading the book on which this film is supposedly founded a few years ago, I can say that there is little if any of the original book. I went into this movie with low expectations - I knew it would be a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it is not even able to meet these <br /> <br /> This is not a prequel. - the only connection it has with the original name. This is not a story of Carlito Brigante, is the story of a very different nature, which was given the same name. They just completely spat in the face of every fan there Carlito's Way; adding insult cast Luis Guzm√°n, who plays a crucial character in the original film, in a different role. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be original, untouched material way the book Carlito - what I'd really like to see. I felt the same thing about Chopper - they have four books, as well as interviews on the amount of fiction, entirely fictional material, and could make a brilliant biography of the most terrible criminal world of Australia, but instead they did ho-hum movie about crazy, but strangely pathetic little swindler (although the performance of Eric Bana was spot-). . Now we'll never get to see the real Carlito initial rise and fall <br /> <br /> Three stars because, looking at it only as an independent film is not so terrible - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez Sun Carlito, but it can be good in other roles), and the story is not so bad. Even Puffy Combs satisfied with his role. But they did not understand the nature of the criminal world at the time (I'm a bit of non-fiction crime buff) - something that the original film and the book received the right (have been written by the then attorney and now judge Edwin Torres). <br /> <br /> The fact is, though, it is not a stand - this is probably the most disappointing prequel ever filmed.
