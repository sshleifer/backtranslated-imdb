I was raised in a "very Christian" household since birth. I was saved, before I saw the film and the rest of the series, and was forced to watch in the youth group at my church. This film was very disturbing. I saw him when I was about 12 years old, and literally had nightmares about it for years. Previously, I was asleep in bed and listen to the footsteps of my mother upstairs. If I had not heard her footsteps, I would sneak upstairs to make sure that it has not been captured. I prayed so hard every night for salvation, because I was terrified of Jesus to forget me. This is certainly not what I will show to your children until they are much older, if at all. It took me years to shake off the fear that this film gave me.
