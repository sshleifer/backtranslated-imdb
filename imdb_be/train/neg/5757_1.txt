The film was watchable while Nicholson was on the screen. Nevertheless, I had to fight against the handing out of boredom when the film depended on Meryl Streep wear scene without Jack; she was as fresh as could be. The relationship between the characters was not anything special; these characters are depicted before - and much better. It was like based-on-real-life scenario in the absolute worst sense: 90% of the daily life of a sad and not worth writing or playing. Why Efron felt her life and relationship with Carl Bernstein was interesting enough to write about it escapes me. Maybe she wrote it as a therapy - for many writers, putting the episode in his life on paper laxative. Excellent: but then why no one in Hollywood felt that story worth filming remains a mystery to me.
