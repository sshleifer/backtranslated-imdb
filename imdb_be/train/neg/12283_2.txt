College student Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi) suffer from nightmares basement living vampire in Alcatraz. He wants to cut off his hand, regurgitation worm ghoul did not explode his chest and be roasted over an open fire. After his friends see his levitation "6 feet" over his bed, helpful, occult-obsessed teacher (Donna Denton) believes that they penetrate into the Alcatraz-to-face with their fears. Of course, they are in the middle of the night when no one is around to help when the situation gets out of control! <br /> <br /> groups become stranded, brother Alex Richard (Tom Riley) becomes possessed and begins killing everyone, Toni Basil «Mickey" fame shows how the friendly ghost Semh Mitchell, a soloist of the group «Bodybag». It teaches you how Alex flew out of his body and makes rock music dance punctuated with the repetition of the nightmare shots to inflate out of work time. All victims appear as a prankster ghosts whether the character Griffin Dunne in An American Werewolf in London. The script full of plot holes, cheesy dialogue and lame attempts at comedy. Good FX performance and cool opening credits (as Ernest D. Farino) only things which are gaining any merit. Basil and Virgin ( «Whip It») to do a few songs on the soundtrack <br /> <br /> Rating: 2. 10
