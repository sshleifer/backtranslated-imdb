It was frustrating. He started well enough, but as he went on and lost all possibilities to soar, he fell. Maria Schrader acting is awful, it never seemed to mean what it says, or even knowing what she said, until she says. She showed no real emotion at all, and not for her favorite goy, or the story of her mother. When Lena, she seemed to be little more than an academic interest in the history of Lena. There never seemed to be a real relationship between Lena and her mother, but her mother seemed to be having a good time at the wedding, which is not very. The alleged parallel between the "mixed" novel of Khans and the attitude of her mother and her father was a cliche as they come, and failed miserably in any case. The wedding was very unconvincing and a blunt end. The culmination of the protest was not boring, and no matter what was Len did to influence the outcome, it certainly showed some difficulty feelings at the time, ghosts opinion, inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, none of the characters in the film did not have any depth or sparks. It was very hard to care about any of them, even a little Ruth. All of Luis was fun. (Why is it di≈ü it so when on the phone from the hotel? There was no context or interpretation independently for this.) If all references to it has been removed will not be noticed. <br /> <br /> The simple story made confusing bad character development (that is, whose mother, again ??) weak action and directing, that made all look like they are. You can almost hear "Quiet on the set! .... "I began to think that it was the guard 7, but as the film was released it quickly fell to 4, and then earn 3 after stupid wedding scene. It was about as cold and sterile film as I've seen. A terrible waste of a good story.
