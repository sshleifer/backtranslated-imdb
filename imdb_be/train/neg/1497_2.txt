Understand, I review a movie I saw. I understand that almost all nudity and gore cut from the film, so it is completely sterilized. Seeing names like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson attached, I knew I was not going to get the classic horror, but at least I was expecting gratuitous boobies and bloodshed. But no, it should be the most modern scolded movie horror films, I mean, it's easy to say that there is a much more specific scenes, but what if they cut or scene just completely ends right as it starts. As one screw to the cannibals and porn stars? I mean it would be a winning formula, it makes me wonder, when the director and his wife slept with any executive or something, because it's just amazing how much was cut out of it. Reading about it a few years ago, Fangoria, I was excited, it looked like a fun film, but unfortunately true movie locked in a vault somewhere, and we have to sustain this piece of excrement renamed the evil breed. Hopefully, unrated cut will be released someday, I think there is a good movie in this mess, but still capture the best twelve pack of Bud, because it is not the only way you'll make it through this film.
