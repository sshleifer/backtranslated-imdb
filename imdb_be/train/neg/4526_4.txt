Rather silly attempt mysterious thriller Hitchcock type improbable espionage exchange for archeology and based on Robin Cook's novel; By the way, I recently purchased another adaptation of his work - Coma (1978) - in honor of the late Widmark. For the record, the director of Schaffner just made The Boys from Brazil (1978) - just fantastic, but much more fun suspenser and, unfortunately, the Sphinx was the wrong step, from which it is so far an impressive career will not be restored. <br /> <br /> Despite the volume and decent enough shot, but it turned out to be a critical and commercial failure - mostly because the story just is not very exciting: in fact, it's pretty boring (weak attempts horror - archaeologist heroine having to put up with the burial of corpses rotting in abundance, and even an attack on a flurry of bats - notwithstanding). Lesley Anne-Down is a great leading lady stumbled on a lost treasure - it really was a hidden local sect, to prevent it from falling into the hands of foreigners, who have appropriated most of the country's heritage (under the pretext of culture) too long. Sir John Gielgud appears in ungrateful little early as the antique dealer who puts down on the way loot, and to pay for this "act of betrayal" with his life. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, it turns out that some of the characters are the opposite of they say - so obvious allies (such as Maurice Rhone), eventually exposed the wicked and controversial figure (Frank Langella, which I saw in London in early 2007, in the West End version of the «Frost / Nixon», which has now turned into a movie) is an antagonist of the Down to lover and back, as g determines to keep the wealth that belongs to the Egyptian high priest Menephta national treasure.
