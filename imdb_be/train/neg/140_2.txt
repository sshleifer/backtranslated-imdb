Valentine terrible movie. That's what I thought about it: <br /> <br /> acts: Too bad. Katherine Heigl may not work. The rest were not much better <br /> <br /> The history :. The story was okay, but it could have been more developed. This film had the potential to be a great film, but it could not be <br /> <br /> Music: .. Yes, some of the music was pretty cool <br /> <br /> Originality: Not very original. The name `Paige PrescottÂ» Recognize Prescott <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: If you do not see Valentine. This is a really stupid movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br />
