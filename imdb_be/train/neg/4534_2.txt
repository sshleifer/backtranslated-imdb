Book that this movie is based on a seriously changed my life. But to say that this film was a disappointment is an understatement. Action, directing, cinematography, and the plot was terrible. I would never recommend this film to anyone. I told countless people about the book, but now will speak to them all that they should definitely not see the movie! I did not expect the story to follow the book exactly, but they left too many key components of this book. The film tried but failed to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only humiliated the central theme of prophecy. Putting yourself in the position who have not read the book, I saw Celestine Prophecy hoaxy a bunch of BS I am totally disappointed Redfield how this movie turned out.
