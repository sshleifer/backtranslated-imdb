Well - if the cameo appearance of Jason Miller (looks even more eroded than he did in the Exorcist IV) is the highest point of the image that you have <br /> <br /> It's a little country, a little rock 'n' roll: mix two drunk with money who pull their child around with bog mummies dried (did you know that one out yet - dried in a swamp?) in the basement, Christopher Walken with a bad paint job, and a little girl who, might have been an interesting character, if they designed it <br /> <br /> I understand. - sort of - that they come back to visit their relatives. After that .... <br /> <br /> The problem: There are a few interesting flashbacks to what I have to believe her mother was killed as a result of the explosion of the car (I think). It is never connected to anything. <br /> <br /> The problem is: What do we need to grandmother? Now, grandma can be fun. She speaks Gaelic or Celtic, or something. Maybe you can do something about it. The best that they can do what she's got the tobacco habit. It's all <br /> <br /> The problem :. They throw a real running character as a husband. He is the type cast (he will sell his wife to the devil? Maybe he can count on the trust fund he manages it), or it is cast to the type (after all, he has a good haircut and nice clothes)? He drinks, he hesitates. He's not a bad guy. Not good. But dislikable. Why do not they do something with it <br /> <br /> No problem: the old guy shows up. Husband knocks him down. He comes back to knock off her husband. (This is a bit silly, but at least the character is motivated.) <br /> <br /> Now - it is an alcoholic, he is an alcoholic; it can only married her for money. Grandma closed the bedroom. Blind Uncle takes our heroine to the basement, to show her mummy witch (you following this?), Which can come to life. In fact, you know that she will come to life, the music swells. The little girl lives in the house, taking tea to her grandmother (unlocks the door to do this) and provides a grandmother with cigarettes. Periodically grandmother out. But nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The couple lost a child in the house, who, after losing her bedroom. Uncle slit his throat in a basement. The leading lady has a nose-bleed. Husband drinks. They both drink. In the face of all this, the terrible truth mentioned in the first over-the-voice - my God - abortion, when the leading lady twelve years <br /> <br /> Despite the ragged thread. ingredients, no one managed to get the story on the screen. . None bridge between situations entirely gradation from light perturbations to terrible fear, but a long slow scenes that go nowhere; Nbody, in fact, do not care about - and they had a place to go with this aspect - an innocent child in the charge of drunks, a grandmother who might be blocked because it is a monster, but no, it is the worst wine smoking. She has big hair, good makeup. <br /> <br /> In short, there is no plot. Just a little accident (predictably) violence in a dark library with the rain pouring in, and the sound track cuing us. You need more than a few drunks and Christopher Walken, to make the film. <br /> <br /> production values ​​were good. Oh. Nice scenery, good wardrobe. Operator, at least, knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I bought it. Poor me.
