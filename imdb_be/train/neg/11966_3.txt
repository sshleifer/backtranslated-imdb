Bob Clampett in the "poor fish in Porky 'is so-so populated by monstrous cartoon puns and one or two good points. Set in flogging fish Shoppe, "Poor fish in Porky" occupies an uncomfortable area between chernymom standard "n" White Spanking cartoons and one of the books come to life Merrie Melodies, which were popular at the time. Typically, many of the early cartoons Spanking, Spanking away from the star, being only a quite unnatural opening musical number and the climax of the film. For the rest of the time the star is a skinny cat, which sees the fish store as an opportunity for a free meal, but gets more than he bargained for. Unfortunately, the audience gets a lot less than they expected. As sometimes happens in the books of the series came to life in the spotlight is thrown on punning signs that might work just as well in non-animated environment. Laughs and poor, while only a caricature of saved Clampett energetic direction, there is very little at all to recommend "Porco Poor fish" in any of the other below-par early cartoons Pork.
