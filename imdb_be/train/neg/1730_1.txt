Firstly, I would like to point out that I only know the show because of my younger sister always watching. I believe that the most annoying program on TV. There's nothing funny about any of the "jokes" and canned laughter intolerable. Shaw will work much better if charged before a live audience. Thus, laughter will show as "unfunny" show. However, I give credit acting talents of young actors. It sickens me to think, however, that they will look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show. Show links well with the general irritable voice and style CBBC presenter. Why do young people today need to shout at me so much. That's all.
