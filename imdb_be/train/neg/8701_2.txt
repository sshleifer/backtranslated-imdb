This is probably one of the worst, "I want to be a low budget box office hits" lend dinosaur genre. The movie is so predictable, you could get away, make your own dinner, go to answer the phone or something, and when you come back you'll know exactly what happened. The special effects are so poor, you would think Lego bricks were used and "very fast" dinosaurs were so tame that makes the dog look like a super predator. It operates over cooked. They try so hard, but there just is not enough nature for them to get into the character, and for a scientist ... Come on, we know exactly what is happening place with a blonde chick with glasses. Stereotyping was created for films like this. If you want to see this movie, I suggest you do not as a serious mood as the cast and crew were apparently. And if you're really really into dinosaurs and know everything in the world to look for them, you can split the screen - the facts are that far.
