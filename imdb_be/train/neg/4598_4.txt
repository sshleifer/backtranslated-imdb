director producer wife in London, hopes to fix the American song and dance man in the lead role in her husband's last show with the familiar, the American girl who makes her living modeling fashion in the circles of the society. Unfortunately, the couple had already met them, a girl thinking guy actually show producer married his girlfriend (the fact that he does not wear a wedding ring should be baffled any misunderstandings!). Wafty Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical finally dragged back to earth Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott idiotic script, which is full of juvenile behavior. Astaire and Rogers did not just "meet cute" - they meet ridiculously (he tap dancing like crazy in the hotel room over her, and she complains). Audiences 1935, probably not all the same, these two were going to get together - as long as they did, and fortunately. Seen today, the central characters are, do not have the motivation to end up in each other's arms: he plies her with flowers (after being told his friend that he wants to stay "fancy free" in the department of love), and she gives him the gate turn, nothing that a bit of dancing can not cure! This glamorous couple are obviously unreal, like setting in London and Venice, but we are seeing simply because leads, Ginger and Fred. This is a fantasy for the poor ... those who do not mind a simplified plot down. Musical moments really break up the monotony of far-fetched scenario, but do not go beyond the environmental nonsense. ** from ****
