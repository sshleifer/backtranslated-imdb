I do not like the film, Joshua, actually. Maybe it's because I've seen the other, much better like a film called Orphan 2 days before, but maybe it's really just because the film was not very good. I go to the stairs. Of course, the story of the evil child is not very original, but it does not mean that the film can not succeed. This might be a suspenseful and entertaining and scary, but instead it has been slowly building, boring, monotonous and did not leave me to think, nothing more than "it was not very good," when it was all over. < br /> <br /> in the end, Joshua found motivation. I will not give that away, but the reality is that it does not really achieve their goals, since, in spite of Vera Farmiga, as his mother, Abby, disappearing about three quarters through the movie-you, all arrows point to her return home soon. She was placed in the psychos yatrychnae institution, because she loses consciousness, but then the father of Joshua / Her husband was accused of falsifying its treatment, which tells the audience that the Institute realized that she was not really mentally ill, and is currently dispensed from a medical point of view . .. So it should not come home soon, not Joshua failed? no, his mother will live with him and his sister, and possibly his parents in the near future? I question the Father, as his future is open-ended. <br /> <br /> In the end, I did not care about the characters. Evil demon child Joshua was not really scary. The storyline was moving slowly, and when he picked it up yet sad. Gripping down every time. When it was over, I could not believe I sat through the whole thing. <br /> <br /> 4/10 just because the action was good from parents, especially Vera Farmiga as a mother, but if you want to watch a film about evil "child" to see Sirota. Now, a film that took borrowed the concept and created a brilliant film.
