Maybe, as a former Muscovite himself, and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from throwing this film in a box "arthouse / festival shit." It's not the best film of 2005, and it's not a complete waste. It just has a lot of problems. I also sincerely I doubt that this film was banned because of any ideological "fear" or "conservative taboo" or some other reason, this film may be, on the contrary, it is called "masculine" and "uncompromising" abroad. It was It prohibited, as censors knew 99% Russian amateur movies would find offensive . M due to poor taste, which is performed at the time of the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull film <br /> <br /> So, we have a strong opening shot sound great design, great premise -. Laden with meaning and symbolism of use and occupancy. characters will constantly from the strengths of the film (not that the number 4 is a complex visual problems). for the next 40 minutes, we equally strongly settings. Funny and well written conversation between 3 bar (major?) characters, and we believe, the pathos of these people, great country of Russia, the human state and all that. Then the film starts to slow down. We begin to wonder what lies ahead -yawn-. <br /> <br /> The rest rather boring, to put it simply. Of course, the guy in the village draws deep, and there are some few funny moments. Good sound, of course. But the pleasure of this film, not to mention the plot seriously compromised EX problem. And it is the lack of scoring for sitting through all (nice shot) dire poverty and gloom, is that in the end will make people angry at "offensive" things (personally, the main offensive scenes bordered be submissive, that may be pathetic harmless drunks). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a nice movie where Russian gets unused for long periods of time (the whole film), look particularly national hunt. Much more useful post-Soviet material. So yes, 4 of 10 for 4, nice and symbolic my condition after mediocre film.
