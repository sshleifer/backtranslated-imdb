Also known in some form, as the "House of Exorcism," this dirty <br /> <br /> short film takes itself so seriously as to kill any fun <br /> <br /> all. <br /> <br /> spare area includes a European tourist Elke Sommer having <br /> <br /> chance to work with Savalas that looks like it devil <br /> <br /> seen in the fresco in the square. Sommer gets a trip to <br /> <br /> mysterious house in the country where Savalas happens <br /> <br /> Butler. There, she is mistaken for a long-dead, and real <br /> <br /> soap opera stage start. <br /> <br /> The husband blind matriarch of the house had to deal with a dead woman who was engaged to the son <br /> <br /> matriarch in. Spouses who have Sommer trip? <br /> <br /> Well, the woman gives the driver, um, "backseat driving <br /> <br /> lessons", and my husband knows and does not care in the end, <br /> <br / > most of the cast killed, Sommer is drugs and raped her, <br /> <br /> shoots, and the viewer is taken to a climax on the board empty <br /> <br />airplane...which have resembled the theater is empty <br /> <br /> thing played. <br /> <br /> alternative embodiment, the "House of Exorcism," there are scenes <, br /> <br /> added with a priest. <br /> <br /> VHS copy of this from Elite Entertainment, crystal clear . and <br /> <br /> There Letterboxed "additional" after the final credits; deleted sex <br /> <br /> and dismemberment scene <br /> <br /> Direction Mario Bova is fast and furious. but it is a scenario <br /> <br /> awful. There soggy ideas, abandoned plot and <br /> <br /> many facilities that do nothing more than push this thing <br /> < br /> in any direction forward. you have a life like mannequins <br /> <br /> burial practices, the blind matriarch does not work all that blind, <br /> <br /> Savalas and given the same candy he was «Kojak» (which <br /> <br /> haunting you baby?). <br /> <br /> project it seems that they had two stars name and then wrote <br /> <br /> script quickly, something that happens every day in Hollywood <br /> with 'visiting <br /> Now. Savalas looks quite lost, bringing it <br /> <br /> line haltingly, and wanting his character died in «The Dirty <br /> <br /> dozen.» Sommer runs and shouts, and breathes a lot, but <br /> <br /> her character is empty, I use the term "Symbol" freely. <br /> <br /> The only thing we know about her is her name. <br /> <br /> This is a real strange film, and your reaction to it can depend on <br /> <br /> how much you Eurohorror and Kojak. For example, I can not <br /> <br /> recommend "Lisa and the Devil." <br /> <br /> This is unrated, including all the extras at the end of VHS <br /> <br /> a copy, contains a strong physical violence, sexual violence, strong <br /> <br /> gore, poverty strong woman, man, poverty, sexual content and adult <br /> <br /> situation
