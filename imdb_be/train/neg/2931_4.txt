Cibitoke "The League of Gentlemen" follows the lives of several amazing inhabitants of the fictional village of "Royston Vasya." Various scenes are linked to each other their common setting. <br /> <br /> In the first series, sketch shows, the main theme is the new road to be built through Royston Vasey. Thus, more and more foreigners to visit the small town. But Edward and Tubbs, the owners of "local" store, which is really far from the city, do not like foreigners. Each time a visitor enters their shop, they would kill him. In my view, some scenes like the tasteless, and not funny, for example, if the pair absorb two engineers who want to build a new road. Edward drums while dancing half-naked around Tubbs victims. <br /> <br /> In addition Pauline lives in Royston Vasey. She works at a local center of the work. While Pauline hates people, it has to work, the woman does not want to lose my job. Therefore, if the unemployed person receives an interview as a firefighter, it does not allow him to go because he is not ready yet. <br /> <br /> Then Barbara Dixton, transsexual taxi driver who goes to a lot more information about "her" sexual transformation. <br /> <br /> In addition, a veterinarian, Mr Chinnery, always kills the animal, rather than to treat them. In one case, he comes to the farm and introduced into the living room where the dog is lying in his basket. The farmer goes beyond. On the assumption that the dog is sick animal, Mr Chinnery euthanizes it. After a moment, the farmer opened the door, holding a "real" sick animal, a sheep in his hand. <br /> <br /> Some more people are husband and wife, who visit their nephew (his friend killed shopkeepers, by the way). Couple very carefully. They have, for example, the towel in various colors. Each color denotes one body part. In addition, they have thousands of keys, marked with different colors and accurately classified. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the actors play very well. Playing a woman, scene becoming comical. Costumes fit for the actors too. Tubbs wear a scarf and some crazy characters such as Edward in unappetizing black teeth. The show has a lot of black humor, typical British. Scenography reflects the mood of the series. The village and all the houses look gray and collapsed. Around the local shop is often a mist, which increases the effect of threatening. Even the ominous sign of the village ". Welcome to Royston Vasya You never leave Â»<br /> <br /> While I think that the actors do a great job, this type series is not my taste.
