*** SPOILER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth, I do, and it does its best with an incredible role. I can see how this film that may well look like a script, but it is complicated, it is unlikely and ultimately stupid. I have seen the apparent death ending a mile away. Rene Z. tries with a guaranteed part, and as Patricia Arquette. The detective, whose name I do not remember (one that is not Chris Penn) is a big sweaty over actor. See if you are not smart enough to distinguish between a film to be so smart, you can not follow him, and so confusing, you can not understand. See if you love cheese camera work that makes you seasick. See if you like to watch Tim Roth is working with cumbersome scenario. See if it comes late at night for free. Otherwise, rent Suspects.
