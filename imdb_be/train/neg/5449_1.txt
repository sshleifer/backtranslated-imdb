The idea is to have something of interest occurs within the first ten minutes, to keep the audience hooked. Late Night Shopping is possible to avoid interest for much longer than that. When we get to the point, so monumentally idiotic, I kept thinking that I must have it wrong. But I did not. <br /> <br /> Sean tells the story of Osaka landlord, who rented the same apartment with two people at the same time, who worked in different shifts, and therefore do not realize that they were separated. His friend asks, "How about this weekend?" Sean does not have an adequate explanation. Sean then tells the story of his own similar problem, which is that he is not sure that his girlfriend is still living in the house as he works at night, and it works during the day, so that they never saw each other. This went on for three weeks. But his friend does not ask: "Yes, but as I have already said that on weekends you have to see it, then it does not make sense that you're going on about, Sean Are you on drugs or something? ..? ? "But let's be generous and assume that they both work seven days a week. <br /> <br /> We see Shawn checking, soap and towels were used. (In fact, oddly enough, it begins to carry soaps around him.) But what about the air conditioner and shampoo his girlfriend, Sanpro and moisturizes, toothpaste and toothbrush. Let's go to the kitchen. What about food and drink? Is there any missing? Is there some was purchased? The bedroom had a common bed has been made or not? There her clothes used and exchanged on the net? There is a laundry basket full? In the bathroom there is a place up or down? I mean, good grief! <br /> <br /> And top it all off Paul arranges to leave work early to see if his girlfriend still lives at home. Why did not he just call her? <br /> <br /> But it's even worse. In the last act, though nobody said Vincent, where the remaining groups are going it can not find them. Lenny's love interest and his girlfriend Shawn conveniently seem the best of friends, and was able to find a group. There is not even the smallest attempt to explain any of these highly unlikely coincidences. <br /> <br /> To be fair dialogue is OK, but not good enough to make up for weak characters or annoyingly lame stories. <, Br /> <br /> I heard an interview with one of the actors, and he did not promise "no weapons, no drugs, Sun corsets." I thought, "great." But after half an hour, hours of boredom, I yelled at the screen, "I want to weapons I want drugs, I want corsets !!Â» <br /> <br /> It would not take long to sort these issues but the official website of the director boasts that the film was not edited script. That's all you need to know.
