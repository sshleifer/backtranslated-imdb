Given that a lot of horror films based on the assumption that one or more of the central characters is doing something stupid at some stage in the proceedings, the girls in this film is to collect gold, silver and bronze medals at the ceremony Darwin Awards Olympic. Mentally retarded baboons would have made a better choice than they did, and would have cried a lot less at the same time. <br /> <br /> If you like movies with a grainy pattern, deliberately amateur camera-work (my '92 -Old grandmother has a video camera with the best results), the sound is very poor and not different plot / story, then this is your perfect movie . Also note that you must have the following: a woman cry for no reason, women whining for no reason. In fact, the reason and the logic does not appear much in this movie. For example: "We need to find Stephanie?" "Yes, I can not believe I'm talking to her, like last night, '' she called you last night?" "Yes, she wanted to talk about a date she got asked one? "" What? Why did not she tell me? " As our friend is chasing a serial killer with a shotgun and lots of terrible weapons, but I have a problem with the fact that she did not tell me that she was going on a date. <br /> <br /> Okay, so that the budget is small. This does not mean that you have to make it look like it is worth half of the budget. "Assessment" is interesting, as all - except for one - the tracks were written and performed by writers / directors of the film. In fact, it would seem that the entire budget was blown on the track sampling The Duskfall, death metal band from Sweden. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing of all in the entire film is the end of the letter to us with the ability to continue.
