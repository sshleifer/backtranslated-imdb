This film is 90 minutes Ramones concert with short periods of nonsense and absolute boredom. Which high school is anyway? <br /> <br /> If you is not the main Ramones fan, NO and repeat DO NOT waste your time like I did. This is completely unwatchable from start to finish. This film should be called Ramone Fever. All seem like they are in this film. There is no plot to be found in this film. For adolescents comedies go, you're scraping the bottom of the barrel with it.
