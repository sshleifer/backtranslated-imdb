It was the worst Christmas movie that I've ever seen. I took two young children to see it. It was the darkest, darkest does not plot- family money, Mom loses his job, his father was killed in the bank, bank robber stole a family car with the two kids in the back, and after a high speed chase, he went to the bridge and sinks them in the river. Mom is all alone. Not surprisingly, her Christmas spririt disappears. Christmas angels do not save children, drowned and Santa does not bring back the dead parents! I thought it was the worst message to send to children. It is better to tell them that no St. than to show them a film like this !!
