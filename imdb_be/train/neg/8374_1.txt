What is the film's vantage point, how is it? It's painful and embarrassing bad, not even in a way that allows you to make fun of him. <br /> <br /> Movies like "The Little Man" depress me. They represent the film at its most disposable. This film was made for a bunch of 18-24 year old dipsh * t fraternity boys who would go out and see it on opening night before word leaked out about how bad it was a studio, hoping, so that the film can quickly recoup its . investment <br /> <br /> One hundred other filmmakers with big ideas, probably could not get their films made of the resources were going to make this pool of vomit <br /> <br /> Grade :.
