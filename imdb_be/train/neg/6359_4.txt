Woody Allen, when his best, has one of the sharpest pens around. It can make a keen observation and wrap it around the strike line like no other. However, if he had his worst films can stink pretentiousness. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" have this stench from opening to closing. Customized one of his more intriguing ideas at the time. The four friends are sitting in a restaurant discussing the essence of life, whether comedy or drama. In order to help resolve the dispute, a person associates beginning of the story and asks the other two men arguing (a comic playwright, another dramatic playwright) story, whether it is a comedy or a tragedy. The two men then continue the story, and the film plays out the stories they weave. Now, when I first heard about this movie, I understand what they are saying exactly the same story, the genre (comedy or drama) just changes the way you look at it. Now that would be interesting. However, these stories only share one basic element and several side elements. They are completely different stories with the main plot of the differences. Drama is so strained and pretentious script, that it can only really work as a self-parody. If that was the point, it is not possible because these elements prevent the audience from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters. The comedy is a story that has moments of success, but they are still short and fleeting. Ferrell is obviously meant to be a backup for Woody, but he could play this character is much more believable without adding stuttering Woody and manual tongs. Woody is the best time to Woody. If someone tries, they do not play a character, they simulate famous actor. This type of thing just pull the audience out of history. <br /> <br /> My favorite Woody Allen movies make me leave the theater a little lighter in spirit than I went in. This is one I would get my money back.
