Well, when I came on board for this film, I really expect people to make fun of him. I was surprised to see that people over the age of 7 like it. I enjoyed the movie ... but just b / c I and my little sister (who, in fact only 10) ridiculed the whole. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, Jordan, but this effect was terrible. You know, the movie moves to the toilet, if the master can not act. And it's not even a good script or plot, to atone for it. I also thought that the character of Pamela was very lame ... border lining lamentable. <br /> <br /> Even with that being said, I thought it had some good actors, such as the beautiful Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. However, not enough to redeem the film <br /> <br /> Two things about this film that I just can not get through :. <br /> <br /> 1.) The fact that Spencer guy would fall for it, well, EWW. I looked at the date and whereas in reality he was only about four years older than her, in «Go Figure» difference seemed to be so much more. Jordan is a very beautiful girl, but the GF, it seemed like 10 or 12 ... she looked like a little kid! Jake Abel (Spencer), it seemed, as a college student. <br /> <br /> 2.) That is some way that Kristi Yamaguchi will only come to skate for one girl. I mean, I know that Katelin good and all, but it's still just seemed interesting unlikely that Kristi go to boarding school, who do not even have a scholarship for skiing, or the school will hire a skating coach with such compounds. <br /> <br /> This all being said ... it was not the worst movie ever knew, but it was not very good, even by DCOM standards, which I think is quite low.
