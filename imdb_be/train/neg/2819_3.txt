This site is less ungainly mess, which brings a little entertainment. There's basically no plot for a vague things about the cult that follows the work of De Sade, who for some obscure reason, feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archeology and kill her. I think this is pretty much it-, it's something out of the Gnostics, but who knows what the thought of the authors.

At least I got to see the movie from which "If you like a criminal, like me" bit by the Australian certification, management's estimates of the film, which was at the front so many videotapes ninety come.
