«Smithereens» is my native useless film, which is just hanging out among the cable channels that take up space like cheese dime novel in the public library. Paltry bit Trebukhov and the first force to a mediocre director Seidelman, the film is rich in bad acting, bad sound, bad camera work, and poor quality in all aspects of the film. Many of the best movies never make it to market and why waste it clicks like this to do, and never seem to go away is one of the great mysteries of life. (D-)
