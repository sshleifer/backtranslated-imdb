I have to finish watching the movie as soon as I start, no matter how bad it is. This film was painful to sit through. "Foam" bullet, a reporter from the "ninja" as moves, as the bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets, and only seems to hit an innocent bystander, a predictable outcome and bad acting was terrible. As a girl who is a reporter in her flat and friends comes from "what the hell are you doing here (holding the bat)" to "Hey, you're cute, I want to @ # $%! ??? "in 1.2 seconds .... Just bad .... Save hour and forty minutes to go and play with the kids (and dogs)!
