Like many actors / actresses involved in this project, so insulting film was even worse than if they used unknown .The main problem was that the film was obviously just a concept designed to appeal to baby boomers .In 20 or 30 Nbc years, it is likely to make the film as well as the beginning of the 90s. I can see it now black family, where children are involved with whether the riot's and a white family has a rebel children and listen to grunge rock music .The soundtrack will be represented by such groups as Nirvana, NWA, Public Enemy, Soundgarden and etc. .The film as it will be as bad as the 60s, and I guarantee you, NBC will do it .See the biggest problem with period pieces that have made a purchase online is that if you live in certain the period of time you do not think I live in the '60s or something fashionable retro decade while .next time someone does something like this, they need to give greater weight to the project there
