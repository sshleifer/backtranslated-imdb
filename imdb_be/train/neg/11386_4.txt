One of them with gratitude to God-e-nya-live some documentaries. This one tells the story of two warring factions in Colombia, guerrillas and paramilitary Medellin and surrounding nations. <br /> <br /> Weapons, drugs and death are rampant. The boys, no older than 22, and not in the middle of the war in prison. Girls ?? Sun women, girls ?? always react in the same way, if one of them dies, with tears and cries. You scratch your head; what they expect, really? I do not know what's more disturbing: night shooting and civil unrest, or that everyone just seems to passively accept things as they are. Or, seeing that the boy drink that is obviously not his first beer, as all that, 10? If you were to take these some of these young people with their situation and put them some place where they had the opportunity to do more, be more than many would choose not to stay? <br /> <br /> On the basis of this documentary, all I'm afraid.
