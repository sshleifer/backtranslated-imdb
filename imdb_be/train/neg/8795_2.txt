I have not seen hardly any redeeming qualities in this film. The only thing that I really saw was seemingly insane obsession with Quentin Tarantino for it ... There were some attractive women in this film, and perhaps this is one of decent quality. Overall, however, I found the film a surreal and funny. Manual production of the film in conjunction with slow motion and other cinematic tricks that I found awkward and giddy, even sickening. In general, the music for was terrible and repeated to the extreme, and remind me of the psychological warfare in the US armed forces against various dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> Various vignettes that made up the film are random in their location and unfulfilling and outstanding in their content and "conclusions". Depressing film (not true _film_, I leave life to this art), which left me with a bad feeling. Do not believe the different people that try and spin this as a "romantic comedy", although there is, of course, some elements of how this film will invalidate the content, form, and the conclusion of any association with the genre. <br /> <br /> I suggest to stay away, despite the seemingly overwhelming positive views IMDb and other sources of estimation.
