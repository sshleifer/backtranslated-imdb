I've seen this movie a couple of years ago. I could'nt sleep and there was nothing. So I looked into it. What really makes me it makes no sense, and that's why his anxiety. Richard gets tied up in wire mesh and Jarvis begins to do with Richard's girlfriend, while she is unconscious. Then Jarvis fellow troubadour playing some stupid song on his guitar. The next morning he shows the girl talking to Richard Jarvis and Trouby, and then it goes back to Richard and looks at him, while he was still connected. Then they play some happy music and the film is finished. I mean, what happened? Or they brake up? And she says these two guys (Trouby and Jarvis)? CBO confused and poor. I hate movies that are alarming and do not make sense. It was the worst movie I have ever seen, starting with version 90, Lord of the Flies.
