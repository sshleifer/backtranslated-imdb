It's almost the worst film you will ever see! 2012 Doomsday is now pulling the rug out from under it, for me. Props is a great example of what Frank Zappa once called "cheepnis. It looks as if the space scenes were made in 1950, the year the power plant, shortly before the demolition. Music really sucks. The existing wooden and ham. The characters they draw the shallow and unconvincing. the plot is predictable. this directly and blatantly obvious when they copy the methods and ideas from other movies. the quality of the direction of beggars belief. <br /> <br /> But you have to see it, if only to experience what must be one of the biggest waste tiny first budget ever. This is an invaluable example of stupid movies!
