Sam Mraavich should never be allowed to touch the camera again. If he does, he should be arrested on the spot ... at least for petty theft. Anyone who pays even a dime to rent any of his waste must apply for and receive compensation. It was my first innocently watching his "work" ... and this will be my last. Ed Wood now looks very good to me. <br /> <br /> When I return this piece of shit in the video store, I will personally ask for it to be removed from the shelves. An active supporter of gay cinema, I frustrated and outraged that this perverted, very mediocre man-child can not be allowed to distribute and package something like this, with coltish handsome on the cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, which, fortunately, there is no other credits IMDb), and an interesting synopsis on the back, which is used as bait, and then sell it as a rental "cinema". Believe me, it has no place being on any desk, anywhere; it's just not the film in any sense of the word. The attacker, irresponsible stuff such as this can only be a detrimental impact on efforts to promote and support gay movie (hell, gay rights in general!) For those who are tempting to rent it because of the cover, you will be disappointed. Tapestry is not so flattering look at the film as it is on the cover, and it seems to be one or two times without a shirt - that's it. Instead, homely Mroavich to put us his disgusting, sorry-looking donut nudity. <br /> <br /> This is the "thing" he "assembled" reverse Mraovich vanity project. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch (which, as I understand it, to put out such a sloppy garbage) terrible in this. Mraovich deliberately portraying a complete no-talent (in all areas), frantically trying to grab any "loser" note that he can for himself. He was sullen.
