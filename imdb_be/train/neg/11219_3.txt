It was a film about infidelity and revenge. Twin with a compound of "twin" feels that something is wrong with her sister. This movie took forever to set the scene. The plot is that many times it was done. The action was lousy for the most part. After the plot comes together, the movie ends. Laura Ashley twins who live with a hard father. The father seems to favor Ashley, so Laura gets the blame for everything. There is a promise that women will never be apart, but as they grow, their lives go in different directions. Ashley gets a job at the diner where she met Barry ~ d, a married man. Of course, nothing good will come of it. The fact that Barry was tinnitus was poor excuse for a way to track it down. I kept waiting for this film to better and there take a decision somewhere, but it never happened.
