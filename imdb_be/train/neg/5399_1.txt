SPOILERS Too often, Hollywood's adaptation of Shakespeare's entertaining part of the movie. Beautifully shot, they are well made and fidelity text. Films, including Bran's "Henry V» and 1993, "Much Ado About Nothing" powerful part of the work. Watching the "lost love in the Labor Party," because it is a huge disappointment for the expectations to be so disgusting thrown in vain. Unfortunately, "Love's Labor's Lost," it's awful! The King of Navarre (Nivola) and his friends left the drink and the woman for three years to concentrate on his studies. Plans begin to fall apart however, when a mysterious Princess of France (Alicia Silverstone) and her entourage arrived. Soon, love is in the air and the philosophy of mind the Prince. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, you understand that this film is not quite Shakespeare. Ably moved to 1930s music Ken Branagh, the plot is still there and the script remains, but now she was sacrificed in favor of heavy musical taste. Classics like «The Way You Look Tonight», «Let's Face The Music And Dance», «I'm in heaven," everything is destroyed weak singing and a strong feeling that they just do not belong here. <br /> <br /> In addition to the weak singing, we were also treated to a large number of awkward performances regular stars. Ken Branagh and friends can enjoy making this film, but they provide us with a stomach turning a collection of roles. <br /> <br /> The main actors of the eight (four men, four women &) are all equally dismal, and the only positive on their behalf is a significant improvement on the really terrible Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> In fact, only one person leaves a movie worthy of praise, and it is consistently excellent Nathan Lane. Lane has proven over the years that he is a genius of comedy and in this function he again adds air clown humor. <br large apple /> <br /> There's little else to say really. «LOST Labor of love" to be commended for soft Bran original take on an old tale. Unfortunately, though, this is where the positives end. Loosely coupled acted performed, sang and built, "Abandoned Love Labor's" perhaps the weakest adaptation of Shakespeare for the last forty years. Avoid like the plague, and never should have been. Poor, disappointing choice for Bran and here's hoping that his next effort better.
