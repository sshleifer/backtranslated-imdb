I've seen a lot of horror flick in my time, they are ridiculously bad, but none of them reach the depths that this piece of garbage humbles himself. This film made me angrier and angrier as I watched, I was trying to wrap your head around what this movie was about. Now, after I saw it, I understand - a kind of - what is happening and why, but the film itself is just too confusing to be pleasant, if you look at it. Yes, there are the usual scenes of violence gratuitious, one liners that show tremendous insight of the characters ( "Highway belongs to me ... I am!"), And poverty is enough to distract us from enough "plot", but still you will leave rest of this movie feel and taking advantage of the puppy, which is no longer wanted, and remained in a box on the side of the road. Blech.
