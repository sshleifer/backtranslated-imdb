In order to compare it with the old misery, low budget porn movie would be an insult to the old, low budget porn movie. Scenes animals do not have any sense, they do not represent the man and his crimes, even in the broadest sense of abstraction. Synopsis on the back of the DVD casing reads in part, "?? gripping retelling of the BTK killer reign of terror. "It is not a paraphrase. Retelling would suggest that you tell the truth about what happened, or how and why. None of these things are not true. I enthusiastically Studier serial killers and have seen some pretty bad movies about them, and to be honest, this is not one of them. It's not even about the BTK killer. To save time and a few dollars and rent Dahmer instead. That the serial killer film is accurate and truthful. However, if you just have to see this movie for yourself, check it for free at your local library, and even then, you will still feel cheated.
