Although I can not deny that his films are often entertaining, I have always personally felt that Martin Scorsese just a little overrated in their abilities. Its use is a flashy style in a good number of his films, seems to scream "Look at me, am I not a creative director?". His best film I've seen, this is one of the least added flourishes, a great degree of "Raging Bull." <br /> <br /> For this remake it seems it was common, though. Deaf films pass a parameter in 1950 it was so soft to be a distraction in itself. Melodramatic close-up, combined with poor imitation of the classical score "Psycho" is likely to provoke a grinning mockery than a sense of the atmosphere of terror. Account for "Psycho" was brilliantly care is a "tribute" just sounds shrill and annoying. Even actors who can deliver decent sometimes acting performances that just scream "caricature"; A notable exception to this is intelligent turning Lewis as the impressive teenage daughter family Bowden. <br /> <br /> The worst, the offender is surprisingly De Niro. Of course, it looks appropriately menacing, but as soon as he opens his mouth, that aura is simply dripping. Now I'm not an expert on the American accent, I first of all entirely come from near Manchester in England, "everything, but of course he could come up with a more convincing Southern prolonged than that? As he is a gifted physical actor, he was almost overcome this fatal flaw, but not quite. It confused me, as a supporter of Robert De Niro, to be wishing he was expelled screen, not captured in the performance. <br /> <br /> (Possible spoilers.) <br /> <br /> Over -The-top style of the film lasts a ridiculously overblown finale. If Scorsese know what to play down the situation can sometimes build tension as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and sound bombardment? I also thought that he was too respected reputation refer to the "killer-nya-dead-yet" a cheap trick that less talented people can hire <br /> <br /> In general, thoroughly ridiculous "thriller". Scorsese and De Niro did much better work together.
