I went to see this movie yesterday, and although I did not have high hopes for this film, I was still bitterly disappointed! I actually can not believe that I spent 96 minutes of your life watching this movie ... it was bad !!! The storyline was disgraceful and the action was scared (although they were big names such as Uma Thurman in it). The film relies heavily on its special effects ... but personally they did not have any effect on me. I honestly did not want the ID was not looking, and I strongly warn against all see this movie. It's a waste of money, and you will only end up disappointed later. My advice is to save money, go shopping, treat yourself, just go and see this movie ... you'll live to regret it lol!
