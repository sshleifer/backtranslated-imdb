Thus, the nature of Madsen - while talking with a woman from a television studio - rights: LAPD is a corrupt, violent and racist police. And this film does not change anything about it. Well, that's good cops, cops moral, even black, whow, a Christian martyr. But this tale, admit it. Really do not like. And the most important thing for lovers of action: shoot from this sad. It's just shooting and shooting and shooting. Nothing more. Play Counter Strike, then you at least have something to do. The only moral of this movie: LAPD is good now. No more bad cops in it. If you want uncritical euphemistic rollers for police and military service, watch this movie. It is the longest commercial I've ever seen. (2 points for the camera and editing).
