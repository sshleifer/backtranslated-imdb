With the bad contrived storyline, which does almost no point to poor dialogue and disjointed scenes to a final boring, bad acting (even Peter Falk can not find your way) "Finding John Christmas" better left lost. Statement by Ms. Bertinelli is without depth or emotion, as well as her co-stars, William Russ, brother Hank and David Cubitt as the love interest of Noah. Jennifer Pisana, like Soccoro, the daughter of a Pope in November almost unbearable to watch not to mention listening to the singing. But who can blame them with the material as it is. Scenario Michael J. Murray is a juvenile at best. <br /> <br /> Every year at this time I'm looking for television guides and look forward to some truly classic and inspiring Christmas holiday films appear on the small screen. Movies like "Miracle on 34th Street", Ernst Lubitsch in a beautiful "The Shop Around the Corner" and, of course, the version of "Scrooge" 1951. It's a classic Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" and «Meet John Doe». Hey, forget the classics. And what about the "Home Alone" and "Home for the Holidays" with Holly Hunter and a great performance by Robert Downey Jr.? <br /> <br /> My gift to you through consultation. Your time would be better spent looking for these films, you find "Finding John Christmas." Merry Christmas!
