Very bad game, and very shallow story. Not even a decent B-Movie <br /> <br /> The events that were suposed to be shocking as Geting people on board an alien spaceship was sad and very inaccurate. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw a star 5.0 and decided to watch it, because I love this genre, but it sucked so bad. <br /> <br /> Now there are actually very few good films in a foreign subject, I think most of them are low-budget <br /> <br /> I give 3/10
