Is this film a joke? Is it a comedy? Of course, this is not a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is a certain sense of humor, but in very few cases, the poor action, mismanagement, and a monstrous scenario had the audience laughing out loud in a movie. The plot is acceptable - a promising young artist only peaking shot killer, he walks in by mistake. Killer sees a young artist he works portfolio book and decides to visit an exhibition of his work. The exhibition assassin meets a dead artist's sister and they end up falling in love. It's all very predictable things and the end will not be anyone to guess how this is so bad script. The film takes place mostly in and around Vienna, Austria, and shows what a beautiful city it is. Do not waste your time on this film, though, if you do not learn how NOT to act, direct or film script!
