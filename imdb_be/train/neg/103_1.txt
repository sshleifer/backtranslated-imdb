Not wanting to be a grouch, Brad Sykes meets at least two of the saddest and clichéd movies I have ever seen - this is one of them, and Camp Blood be different. <br /> <br /> terrible actions, not print, and everything about this movie screams "seriously, you could have done better myself." Maybe it is a challenge to all to saturate YouTube with its own zombie related shit? <br /> <br /> I bought it for £ 1, but remember that you can not put a price tag on the 71 minutes of life. You would be good to avoid the turkey, even at the price of a basement bargain.
