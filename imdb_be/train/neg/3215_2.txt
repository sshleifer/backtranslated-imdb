The film has a nude scene: A man who is sitting on the edge of the bed, with his genitals exposed smack dab in the middle of the screen. This is a fairly long scene. What's the point? I almost think it was supposed to be funny, but we have seen it with my mother, and it was not funny to have that looked at us for what seemed like a full minute. <br /> <br /> The film is cold. None of the characters does not appear even pleasant. Toto cute, of course, but it is the nature of the unfortunate girl. <br /> <br /> I really would not recommend this movie. I expect it will be fine and fresh, but it was a frustrating experience. Interestingly, when the director was very upper crust formed by a French family, and he is looking at these characters. <br /> <br />
