First, the film was not true to the facts at all. I just saw a documentary a few days earlier, and the movie has not been anything like it. First of all, Nash was a genius in mathematics, and that's what the film had to be about is not a story about a man who has been cured and who have found love in the end, and so on. Also, there are many scenes that were just plain wrong - the scene where he rode a bicycle on the campus occurred in his early university years not after it. In my opinion, Russell Crowe does not fit into this part at all, since it does not look clever / individualistic style, so he really could not play one. It would be nice if it would be focused more on the math (similar to Pi), and not over dramatize lovelife. At this level, ABM was too Hollywood-ish and too superficial to be great. Personally, I think he lost his mind and is not paranoid, and he was on to something, as people of this caliber tend to know more than us "mere mortals". 5/10
