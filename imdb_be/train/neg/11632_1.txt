I watched this movie on screening Sneak Preview, and I'm glad I did not pay for it. This movie is just disgusting. His full penis and fart jokes and assumes no honor in the workflow (for example, in the shootout, "Little Germany"). I made a small list of things that I enjoyed in the movie .. and a lot of things I do not agree. <br /> <br /> 1. penis Dave Foley. 2. fart jokes. 3. feed joke. 4. Man was pussy. 5. a lot of Gary Coleman. 6. 7. The Taliban again deride Bush .. We realized it idiot .. move on. 8. Dude has blond hair. 9. Plot. 10. Murder of minors 11. Uwe Boll was in it. 12. Most of the actors were just outraged and there. <br /> <br /> Now for the (somewhat) good <br /> <br /> 1. Dude uses the cat as a silencer, as in a game. 2. A lot of action. 3. Crotchy did return (and a cameo from nearly producer) 4. hmm .. I do not have to pay for it. 5. There are a few "what EF" moments <br /> <br /> Ball has done it again. He took another crappy game adaptation movie. Kudos to you, Mr. Ball. 2/10
