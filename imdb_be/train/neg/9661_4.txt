I want to say that acting is bad, but I think it was the director's what made it so. I never thought that much of the Highlander (the same director), but that one could be blamed for the 80 years. <br /> <br /> This one, however, has no justification. People shot at the exit of the trench with a man in front of him? Those sorts of errors, along with an unclear line of time, strange battle tactics and dramatically unsatisfactory poor visuals makes this sub-par film around. <br /> <br /> Then, as many others have commented, it is all the American garbage. German general being almost scared he was captured American private. Be prepared to swallow a lot of it, albeit in small doses. <br /> <br /> In summary, not terrible, but it is definitely sub-par film about the war in all aspects.
