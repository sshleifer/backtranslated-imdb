William Russ is the main character for this made for TV movie. He left his family behind and start again only to pay his debts. But he tries to stay away from his family. That's where Peter Falk (Columbo) comes to play multiple roles, to persuade him to return home. <br /> <br /> The history of average, and they actually managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use it in a fairly good degree. But William Russ was not really a star. Nevertheless, it appears that his actions are still in order. <br /> <br /> I found the delivery, and the story is very cheese in how everything was predictable. In fact, in the last 20 minutes I almost dictate word for word, before it happened. A good film should never be. <br /> <br /> In general, it was sub-par film. In letters to the classification system, it will get the «D».
