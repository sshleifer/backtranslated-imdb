Gods ... where to start. I was only able to digest the first 10 minutes, before I turned it off in disgust. Besides the actor, who plays Robin Hood himself, the others were just terrible. And I can just stretch my suspension of disbelief only so far. <br /> <br /> Since the opening of the first episode, I lost count of how many errors the plot holes and terrible costumes were there. He started with some poor farmer tries to hunt the deer, to feed his family. All is well. Nevertheless, the poor blighter was mostly deaf, because a handful of soldiers in full armor on horseback, could get close to him within about 10 feet. <br /> <br /> Then he runs away, he goes on to them 10 feet behind him to fire, where you can not even see them at all, as soon as they again about 20 feet behind him. Then he ran into the bushes, and immediately beaten by two soldiers ... who just seconds earlier, jumping horses, dozens of feet behind him. <br /> <br /> Â«armor" on the soldiers so painfully obvious tissue, which they tried to make look like chain mail, and failed miserably. Not to mention, leading soldiers 'armor' is located at a distance of about 5 sizes too big for the poor. Seriously, he looks like he's a little kid wearing too much armor father! Finally, Robin possible to shoot around 5 perfectly aimed shots hands around a soldier, in the span of about 2 seconds, from what appears to be curved bow. No man alive can do these kinds of shots in the short period of time, with contextual rifle, much less a bow. <br /> <br /> After that, they run away soldiers and stop to help a surprisingly well-dressed and clean "peasant" with the digging of the pit ... that all nobles were willing to do all the time, is not it? How is a poor excuse for a series of ever getting a second season for me. Costs of production (at least for what I saw) must have soared in the tens of dollars (or euros) ... <br /> <br /> Seriously - I think Lyceum class drama could put for the best performance. It was so bad, even this terrible version of Kevin Costner's Robin Hood was better. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend you skip this freak and go to rent or buy a mid-80's "Robin of Sherwood" series. Much better written, acted, costumed and produced. <br /> <br /> shame, the BBC ... shame ...
