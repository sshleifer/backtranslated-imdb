Going into this movie, you know that this movie has six technicians in a sealed laboratory invisible maniac. So you guessed it right, who will live and who will die. The survivors eventually exactly who you would expect them to be, so there is no point for the plot twists in there. <br /> <br /> And if you are not sure if this B-movie, or a movie that just happens to take place in the laboratory with a charming story, Devane plays a role :. Instant status of B-movie <br /> <br /> The film promises at the beginning. In the laboratory, we are introduced to an invisible gorilla, which is becoming increasingly tough. Ooooh, premonitions. The best scene in the entire film, when the lab team is doing the gorilla again visible. Great special effects. The same, if they do Bacon invisible. <br /> <br /> There are a few bare chest, really lame dirty joke, and quite absurd insults to give this film R-rated, it really is not needed. <br /> <br /> returns for the last time for a thriller was not really any surprises, except when Shue makes like MacGyver in the freezer, which is more "Whaaaa? Well, there is one more surprise. That's when Caine (Bacon) in elevator shaft. it was strange, but just because you're screaming at the television, Â«Noooo! you're already dead! The end of the film! Speaking of yelling on TV, that's all I've done for the last 25 minutes or so." Put F # @% boiling points! Instead of their infrared goggles on so that they could see it, they try any trick in the book (fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems ...). <br /> <br /> The story really lost it in the end. But the special effects were good; that's the only reason I give it a 2/10.
