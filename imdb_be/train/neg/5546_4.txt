This film is a sort of sequel to «White Zombie», as it is done by the same person (Halperin) and features a zombie. Halperin, George A. Romero the time, failed to deliver with this, however. <br /> <br /> We have a person who can control the minds of people in Cambodia, as well as the quest to destroy the source of its strength so zombies can be sent free of charge. Furthermore, the love interest in evil. <br /> <br /> If this film is really great, it's in the images. Cambodian temples and dancers are very good and the zombies look very powerful in their large numbers. Unfortunately, we do not get to see a lot of zombies in action and a love story, it seems to play too large a role in the horror film (though it has a valid reason for site later). <br /> <br /> I would like to see some 1930s zombie attacks pathetic urbanite, but this film just does not deliver. And there is a strong villain (as Bela Lugosi) does not expect to fight against our heroes. And the use of Lugosi's eyes? Good effect, but it is misleading, because it is never in the movie ... why not restore it with the eyes of a new actor? In general, a film that could be a big one with a small number of scenarios and re-treatment may be ever powerful remake (especially if they keep it in the same time frame of the post-war). Hell, if they can fix, "The Hills Have Eyes," that this film has hope.
