Strictly routine on-the-numbers Western (genre director Andrew V. McLaglen main support, so it's no surprise?). Army Col. Brian Keith spars with bland bandit Dean Martin, who had just stolen the wife of Colonel (Honor Blackman, who never found his niche after playing Pussy Galore in "Goldfinger"). Fist fights, shootings, robberies and Stagecoach Denver Pyle in a supporting role ... in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Speaking of low monotone throughout, Keith gets worn with a prostitute (which is something of a shock after its launch on TV «Family Affair»), but otherwise respectable talents of this low-rent of material waste Keita. This is also bad news for Dean, who does not seem to notice or care. Hack direction, bad writing and a few unfunny attempts to lowball humor. * From ****
