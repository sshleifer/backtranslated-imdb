What a load of rubbish .. I can not even describe how awful this film was. Rating is here is really hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Especially if you enjoyed the first ginger snaps. The first one was well written, well directed, well-executed .. brilliant film with a fantastic atmosphere and aesthetic. The second was Â«alrite'- decent as an independent film, but certainly not to the level of the first third ... is an insult to the series, period. I appreciate movies: 10, 6, 1. This is so bad <br /> <br /> Oh, and yes, it does matter in the past, the sisters also called Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... all tangled in. with some semi-appraisal Native American mythology. The sisters have no real story, or the progression or even the exact ratio ... They're just trying to survive and to be "together forever". This is about as deep as it gets. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that the girl agreed to be in this pile-of-the-line, after reading the script. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing, setting actions were terrible- people who appear from nowhere on a regular basis, as the girls turn around and have a well thought-out candles installation mystic Native American woman was just sitting there, intending to go in speech. Sets were terrible, could not depart from the fact that it was all apparently based in a set that does not really help. In addition, the series was snow outside the camp, but it is not inside the (..on included). <br /> <br /> Arrghh ,,, so bad! I was really hoping that it will be at least as good as the second.
