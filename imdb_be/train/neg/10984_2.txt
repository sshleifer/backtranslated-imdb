I watched this movie for two hours and it does not have the slightest idea what it's about. Someone was killed, or maybe they did, and maybe somebody did it, or perhaps they did not. It brings back memories of the good old days (the bad old days?) When all CBC Canadian films were bitches. Recently, a bitch was an exception, but it confused mishmash of trendy redneck feminist mind reeling flash backs and mumbled dialogue replenishes lost time. I have never found the book easy to read Margaret Atwood. The film continues the great tradition of the Canadian. This is not just to look at. Maybe fashion people in the chi-chi cocktail Toronto will pretend to like it. Our people in the outback a bit less pretentious.
