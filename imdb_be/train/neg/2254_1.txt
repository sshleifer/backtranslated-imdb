Well, people, I swear ... it has to be one of the worst of the showbiz movies that have ever been made, but I laughed myself silly (which may be why I liked it). Basically, it's all about sex, sex, and a way to get their personal 15 minutes of fame. I have already said, that sex is a serious problem in this film? If you have a thing going for bizzzzare characters and light entertainment, watch this movie if you get the chance (and did not have anything better to do). <br /> <br /> *** Warning spoilers !!! *** The funny thing about the film was the guy who asked Jerry if he could marry his goat (!) On the show and flashing his wallet with his love photography. Troika of bad taste and enjoy!
