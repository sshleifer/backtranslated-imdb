This should be one of the most defiantly stupid movies I have ever seen in my life. Just when I think I saw a stupid scene in the story it is even more stupid and more bizarre scenes. I think that transvestites poodles did it for me, or better yet, speak the language of her ... or maybe the guy to get the virgin mother statue mounted on a jeep windshield caught in his throat. Decisions, decisions ...
