Well, I did my best to highlight the fact that the sale of EVP as a real movie basically lied to me from the get go. I figured, what the hell, I do not believe in vampires, but I still loved Dracula, so that I could live with it. <br /> <br /> However, even if that made the film just is not very good. It's competently made and acted, but it does not really grab you at all. There are a few "jump" moments, and I just looked at them and thought: "Yes, I did not expect that" really does not jump to a lesser extent <br /> <br /> In addition, the resolution does not make sense.. If the force behind it is able to do what it seems to be, then why the hell it is you want to use a proxy server? in addition, at the end of the signature was absurd. They obviously put it there as part of the "give confidence in the film, claiming that it's all real "thing, but for it to work it really should be at the beginning. but they can not put it in paragraph Kamchatka, because then they give away the plot ... sticking it in the end just made it stick out like a sore thumb.
