Wow, I just saw it as a TV with "scary" movies they show around Halloween. Was it a rating of G? There was nothing to make this film is terrible, it is worth watching. In addition, other people say that it is cheating, but I do not think so. For cheating, you need something called "humor". This low-budget crap festival have no humor, and it does not make sense, either. You basically have a dumb looking monster (the man in a rubber suit), which comes out of the closet that kill people, I think, as you've never seen a monster raping someone or some bloody consequences. Rotary newspaper reports that the men were killed by a monster, so I think it's good enough. <br /> <br /> The military is trying to kill the monster can do nothing that is not much more than a man. They have a very bad end. Then the military will escape! Wow, did this film to make the US military look pathetic or what? Monster, while it is difficult to kill, does nothing but spin and moat. O, and sometimes a second head is pulled out of its mouth and cries. It was a little interesting, but a total of alien robbery. <br /> <br /> What's the deal with the scientist who plays the xylophone to attract a monster? It was hard to understand a lot of dialogue due to poor sound quality. Also, why the monster to wear around the main snotty guy so long? Why did not the monster to go to the toilet when he had the chance? Why do I insist to make sense of the senseless?
