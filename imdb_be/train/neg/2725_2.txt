Pride gringos Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is a Mexican-American «Border Cop». It serves as a father to young immigrants Denis De La Paz (Benny Romero), who wants Mr. Savalas be best man at the wedding of his future. Savalas is tough, but the boss Eddie Albert (as Commander Moffat) may be tougher. Tough is that you need to stop the smuggler Michael W. GAZZO (like Chico Suarez). Unions may be afoot. <br /> <br /> If you have found an opportunity to a hearing "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas' pronunciation curses be repulsive, you should stay away from the" Borders ". If not, you may not have the stomach for a "realistic" cow slaughter scene. Although it is not ultimately worth it, Mr. de La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (as Leina) steal the show. <br /> <br /> ** Border (1979), Tony Richardson ~ Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
