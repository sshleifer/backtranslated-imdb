... and I really gave it a ZERO on my personal scale of 1-10. I attended movies since 1952 and has seen more than 1,000 in the theater (I do not evaluate the films that I only see on TV). It's the only movie I've ever rating of zero. <br /> <br /> My wife and I took our four children (then 15 years old, 11, 8 and 6), and even the kids thought it was awful. In fact, it was my daughter (currently 26), who warned me to this site (surprised that the film has received an overall rating 4+). <br /> <br /> Animation dinosaurs looked amateurish at that time (and even worse in retrospect) that acts (in particular, Sean Young) is brutal, and the storyline is just silly. <br /> <br />
