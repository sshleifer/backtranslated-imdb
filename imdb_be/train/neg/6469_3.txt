When I was younger, I thought that the first film was really good as a child, so I decided to see a sequel. This is an example of why some movies do not have to continue, because the first film, as a rule, it is best, and it is. Basically now, Ariel and Eric are married they have a daughter, who is not allowed outside the home because they are worried about his sister Ursula (octopus legs villain of the film is one), Morgana, who falls into it. If a child comes out, she asked her sister Ursula, to turn her into a mermaid like her mother was. This makes Ariel back to the sea to find her. The same good voiced, it's just a story that could have a little more thought. Adequate!
