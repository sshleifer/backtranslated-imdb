I do not see the appeal of this series (which is supposed to be science fiction). It is actually just a "let's see what happens soap operatically this week," and, the Cylons are involved through the memories. <br /> <br /> Cylon «baby», which keeps nailing the other guy is pretty lame, it's pretty obvious that T & A was added to the show. Every time it pops up I am embarrassed to have to go WTF. And do not even try to Bullsh * t me of "story arcs". <br /> <br /> It is abandoned, in a soap opera with some CGI. This is not science fiction on the side of the original building. <br /> <br /> This series is not all of it works out to be. If you want trendy, edgy, quirky, nervous, confused editor is cracked camera work, this show might be for you. After Botany seems to rave about this show, this clearly indicates that the views of vocal botanists have changed TNG Picard.
