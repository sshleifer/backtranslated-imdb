As someone who loves the chase scene and was very intrigued by this fascinating true life fairy tale, I was optimistic heading into this film, but too many obstacles put in the way of a good story, he was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> bad. - I am a supporter of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he played, but his role in this dull one as an insurance investigator <br /> <br /> dialogue rather insipid and Kathryn Harrold real garbage in your mouth. From what I read, there were several directors replacing each other on this film, and that's too bad. You can tell something is wrong with the story. I could not get "participation" with the image of Treat Williams Cooper, either. He was supposed to be exciting, but it was not in this movie. It is also a kind of a sad commentary that the guy in the commission of a crime is its native "people's hero", but I admit that I wound up implementation for a guy too. <br /> <br /> It was not all disappointment. I can not complain at the scenery from the lush green forests of Oregon in the desert in Arizona. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this movie again and made to do better, because it is one of its kind in history.
