I do not know how to describe this film. This is definitely one of the strangest films I've seen in a long time. It is very disturbing at times, but sad and elsewhere. Dental torture scene is very complex and can involve anyone in the baked blood and splatter. I have found that keeping their teeth during some of the above scenes. The clever thing about the film is that it plays with our fears and dentist so it is quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> humor of the film somehow hidden and can not be recognized by all. But if you are a lover of strange and amazing entertainment and teeth getting drilled dust is only a movie you are looking for. <br /> <br /> If you read the comments and feel somehow attracted to this kind of entertainment, give it a try <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (maybe a little too weird for my taste)
