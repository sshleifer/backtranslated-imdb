WOW, this movie was so horrible. I'm so glad I do not have to pay money to see this horrible film. it was like a history nut went to drink coke! preview of it did look decent, but it was really bad. I will say the idea sounds well, but come on. it was really very bad. If and sat down and thought about it, you would also understand that this was unreal. back in the day and thought that they had all that material to work with. It was not like Ben Franklin sat down one day and did the damn puzzle. it was very funny, and you want to see a bad movie, then by all means go see it. All and all a terrible film may actually be on my top 10 worst films I have ever seen.
