This movie is terrible. Everything was done before it. There is nothing original. I can not stand it when writers do not come up with their own stories. <br /> <br /> The girl makes a wish on her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult. Hmm, it sounds a lot like a movie in 80 years under the name of Big. What's even more annoying actor Jennifer Garner. She does not act like she was 13, she just acts like she is stupid. <br /> <br /> Since you can guess, the whole plot. She gets a good job, and it so happened that she was one of 13 works with it. Wow, how great! But no one .... it is bad and turns to him and trying to get his job. But, of course, she would win in the end, when it comes to the "big" ideas. <br /> <br /> There's also a dance scene in the film that I have seen a thousand times. <, Br /> <br /> I hate this movie.
