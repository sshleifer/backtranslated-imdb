And when I look at Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I like the brisk, irreverent humor. But this woman is so darned B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying, and yawn worthy. It is also completely lacking in anything at all it was with a sense of humor. Indifferent as she tries to put her lines just dead on arrival because it's just not funny. I watched the two segments of its program and was ready to novocaine. <br /> <br /> Damn, my child (age 19) saw her on a promotional campaign Comedy Central, and said that she was "dumb chicken." I thought it was a compliment. One, where it says: "See my show, or I'll kill your dog," is actually true I know that she wants to be a comedy She just comes across as a perverted nut case, I just do not want to see her... around my dog.
