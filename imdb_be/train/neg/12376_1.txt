This collection really sucks! <br /> <br /> I rented it, thinking that I would really like to enjoy a good fight. Man, it sucked! Quick cuts, flashy, very annoying speaker, and fight them themselves were heavily edited and shortened (I'm thinking especially Jet Li's fighting in Fist of Legend and Jackie Chan's fight with a drunken master 2). <, Br /> <br /> And there is the matter with these contentious streetfighter? After all, there is "cool" about it? I saw more interesting fights martial law! <br /> <br /> This is a collection of silly acronyms for stupid people. <br /> <br /> Do not ever buy this movie! Do not encourage the people who did this shit to do more shit! <br /> <br /> Instead, go buy movies were fighting with and WATH fighting in their uncut glory!
