Not being familiar with the US television stations, when I clicked on it in the cables of my relatives, at first I thought it was a low-budget sci-fi film, and then a couple of minutes, I began to think that it might be a smart satire on the worst excesses of the Christian fundamentalist and then it dawned on me - good grief, these people are serious! It's been a while since I've seen anything so unintentionally hilarious. I hesitated about writing this review for fear of offending the believers, but then I saw the other reviews and thought, hey, they can take it. Hard philosophical riddle: how to make a film criticizing the films actually showing that it is criticizing you? Answer: do it in such a way that the only people who will appreciate the people who hate the kind of movie you are criticized. I suppose some liberals (ugh! Spit it out, if you say that!) May resent the contempt filmmakers for those in the audience, not obsessed with J **** C ***** myth, but I'm useless " t mind - it was so damn funny!
