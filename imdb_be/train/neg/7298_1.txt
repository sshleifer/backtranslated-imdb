NO redeeming qualities can not possibly be expressed. I wish I could get my time back. good skull face a really smiles brightly at the camera when the disease has already sown enough havoc on ill-informed scenario. I was ((spoiler)) glad to see all the characters are dead or seriously incapacitated to the end, especially the party poopers, what to drink juice is spoiled on the way to the intended sunset. Eli Roth is really shining moments, perhaps ten, putting forward a theory of how well smoke weed in the woods, while others actually the villain on top of beer consumption. in general, I found most of them are meaningless, though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity, happy to see the demise of the actors, so, although wanting to travel was not (probably should have to be put in place in order to watch TBS late night, ugh).
