Aaron Spelling production is made for Western television, which receives very plotty for seventy-three minute film. He plays as a possible unsuccessful pilot series. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Clint Walker US Marshal Dave Harmon, who wanders in the Yuma, Arizona area with time to kill one of the brothers of the local bump ranch that on the trail ride. <br /> <br /> Walker takes another brother in prison. Walker also meets the "cute" homeless Mexican child who sleeps on the prison. One night, Andres asleep, when the villain, and another man wearing a blue army to take remaining brother outside and killed him, pinning the murder on Walker. Not good for the first twenty-four hours on the job. Walker visited local army fort, and tormented by the commander of the chain. Bump hear about the death of his brothers, and goes back to the city in time to get his chain irritated as well. Local indigenous people receiving cheated in the army on their beef, and get annoyed in chains. Taking into account all of these circuits produce irritating, Walker still has time to attract a local innkeeper. army guy involved in the murder of the end of the dead, a local cattle buyer involved, the Indians do a lot of talking neuverennoga, and the climax is unlikely showdown as Walker must prove to the town that vile cattle buyer had a boss, someone we suspected as being too helpful all together. <br /> <br /> There is a half-plot associated with the death of Walker family in the hands of the army of raiders, and I think it would be a force behind the series, he was picked up. Instead, the film is cut off, and I kept waiting for the scenes of an exciting episode next week. Due to the attenuation of non-existent commercial breaks, Shagan everything away on this and his story jumps into seizures. <br /> <br /> Walker beautiful, durable and has a voice deeper than good. The rest of the cast is full of TV actors you've probably seen in other television films. Most of the action is pretty lame, and violence is cool. The first brother gets killed midtorso shotgun and falls without a scratch on him. I did not expect that "Reservoir Dogs", but this is not a film to be used to teach children about the evils of guns! Speaking of children, here is a Mexican kid from "cute" to "aneurysm causing irritation" very quickly. <br /> <br /> If you do not like westerns, you do not like it, "Hume." If you like Westerns, then you still do not like "Yuma." I can not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is not evaluation, but includes physical violence, and gun violence. <br /> <br />
