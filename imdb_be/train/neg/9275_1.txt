Omen IV (1991), was poorly made for T.V. cinema. With the 80-ies have been completed, I believe that the leaders experimented in methamphetamine (the drug of choice for 90-ies), because there is no other reason to explain this travesty. Why do they even bother to do that? TV movie? What they are thinking about when this one came on board the idea? Perhaps they even think for a second that this film will be hooked like. Perhaps they thought that this might make it as a series? We will never know. But I know one thing. This film was the main reason why I've never bought a trilogy Omen. They should have knocked a few bucks instead of the "extra" drive. <br /> <br /> Omen IV basically the average American family is a remake of the first film. Instead of snot-nosed punk kid, we get a ghost girl who was a total freak everyone around her. If the family were stronger parenting skills, none of the demonic events that have occurred in recent films would never have happened. These parents must put their foot down and make some real discipline! <br /> <br /> We do not recommend, it is better to avoid at all costs!
