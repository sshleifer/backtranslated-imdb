There is a significant moment in the * * Surviving Christmas that almost makes it worth the pain :. James Gandolfini cracked shovel over stupid head <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck This film is another unfortunate example of James Gandolfini that proves that a great actor, he while simultaneously besmirching his career, speaking in this film. <br /> <br /> Young and rich EXEC ad, Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was introduced in the belief that one should never be alone on Christmas. (And there, from the beginning, this is the main problem with our suspension of disbelief in this zany film: how many people from the social status of Drew, in 2004, to really care one way or another whether Christmas is performed alone or with family or half with fifty dollars to a prostitute?) storyline finds Drew bribe the family to spend Christmas with, provided that they pretend that his own, insensately ignoring all signs to the contrary, that his money bought the emotions he seeks. <br /> <br /> For $ 250,000, surly shuttle driver of the truck, Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and his disheveled wife, Christine (Catherine O'Hara), agree to be a special Drew family, against protests from their son Brian (very dimensional Josh Zuckerman) and daughter Alicia (very soft oriented Christina Applegate). Drew then spends the rest of the film allegedly recapture their youth or - something. Added to this film are twisted and illogical as his dry throat plot. Richly open psychosis, Drew plaster fake smile on his face and blindly remain in denial against all the insults that he had bought the Valco family to escape <br /> <br /> The question is :. If Drew pay this people to regain some semblance of a happy family emotions, how psychotic he must pretend happiness among their burrs and distress about his presence? This is not the case, Valco family hiding their true feelings and pretending to be happy, and around Drew - three of the four members make it explicitly clear that they despise it. He is so ignorant that he can not see that his money does not buy his "family" atmosphere, it has been vaccinated, believing the truth in the first place? As with all films of the battlefield, one question is * four * writers could get so tangled in their narcissistic dreams appear in the credits sequence that forget any semblance of plausibility, or intelligence. <br /> <br /> director Mike Mitchell, who was responsible for * Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo * - stop right there. Nuff said. <br /> <br /> Gandolfini and O'Hara somehow manages to shine, proving their mettle among this mess. Christina Applegate is a willow, and mannered and light and fire in all the right places, sarcastically Drew cutting into small strips carcasses for most of the movie, and then makes a turn around and fall in love with him, because the script tells her. <, Br /> <br /> And I would not go so far as to say that Affleck is a bad actor, but John Schneider is best to look over his shoulder. There's a whole new level Desperately Seeking Talent in the city.
