I saw his film at the festival Ann Arbor Film. I am a student film at Michigan Univeristy, so I know something about the movie. And the film Crispin Glover outrageous. He mainly operates retarded. Not only is the Shirley Temple Antichrist (which I will admit it is a bit funny) saying mentally challenged, to kill each other, but there is an obsession to kill snails. Crispin also plays with the idea of ​​being in love with one of his actors, it is how they are mentally retarded. PETA and human rights should be in this whole affair. This is not a "counter-culture", as stated by Crispin Festival Ann Arbor Film is maintenance.
