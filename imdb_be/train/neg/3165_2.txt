this movie was terrible. I thought that with all that is worthy of some actors, it would be better. Do not waste your time. Eva Longoria Parker was terrible. it should follow the desperate housewives. Paul Rudd becomes B actor. mess he made into a movie, I could never be your woman had been the epitome of what I say. and the lake called she was pretty, but definitely in need of some more acting lessons. look just like the sky with Reese Witherspoon ... it was a little bit better. or any other ghost movies. you will be grateful not to spend your precious time. PS I love you, too good of a serious romance! time to start watching movies with a rating of more than 7 out of 10 and listen to people who have already seen it.
