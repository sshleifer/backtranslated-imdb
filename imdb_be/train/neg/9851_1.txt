Even worse than the worst David Lynch's «confusathon», «Brain Dead» makes no sense. Shamefully wasted talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton), bounce, they in the cartoon "Tom and Jerry" on acid. There is the development of a minor nature. He just does not begin to climb in the "national scale" as ends up in total chaos. Nha drawn into it because of the above-mentioned fine actor. They do not give anything to work, and you'll be surprised at what is happening throughout the intolerable 85 minutes. I strongly recommend avoiding «Brain Dead» at all costs if you do not scatter your brain into complete nonsense. - MERK
