Oh, what a terrible film. <br /> <br /> The production was so cheap and disgusting ... Remember the shot of the "natural", where lightning strikes a tree (lights leaving a stump) that Roy Hobbs makes a bit of ?? Well, the producer of this film used the same scene scenes prefix where the branch of a tree crashed into a house. <br /> <br /> I wonder if they have paid to use footage from The Natural, or do they just hope that there is no one to watch the movie to take him? <br /> <br /> Then, at the end, where they received trying to get away in a truck. This more efficient in the cabin. <br /> <br /> Really bad film, really bad film.
