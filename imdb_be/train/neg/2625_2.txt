This film is terribly acted, written, directed and produced. But it's so old-fashioned it is actually a half-watchable. It SEMI watchable. <br /> <br /> The storyline (what little there is) makes almost no sense at all. Character Barney drum is the only real comic movies and what gets tired after approximately 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Many of Canada's supporting cast can be found in television commercials .. None of them did not go to anything else that I'm aware of. And of course Sly Stallone is even less talented brother well ..... = \ <br /> <br /> Overview: It was shot almost entirely in and around the small village of Claremont, Ont. (About 20 miles N.east Toronto) I learned a lot of landmarks / crossroads / building. I think that the drive in the scene was filmed in a real demolished "Oshawa Drive-in" just before it was demolished.
