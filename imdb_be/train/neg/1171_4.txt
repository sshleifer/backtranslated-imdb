I can hardly believe that this inert, strutting and bad put the film on the film director, the other work I quite enjoyed. Experience transferring royalist (and there is no other word but "strong" will do) left me in a vile mood, the state released only read IMDb user comments for ali-one hundred and twelfth For not only Romer tried (successfully) to make us see the world through the art form of the 18th century in France, but as Ali showed revealed (due to alienate his audience) the effects of both class consciousness and revolution is inspired by dislikably eyes elite women of her time. The director has done something, certainly heavy, but I question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so - for us to look sad results of their work.
