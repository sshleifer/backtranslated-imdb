I watched the cabin on the lake this afternoon in the US. Considering this film was made for television was quite interesting to see the sequel. Thus, I tune in airing this evening and was very disappointed. I knew that the film is not much, but I did not expect to be surprised when using a DV (digital video). The film would have been bearable if it were not for these matched digital images, which seemed to come from nowhere. I was expecting that storyline is tied to the use of these arrows, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (NOTE: The following possible spoiler !!!!) Open ending in a cabin on the lake was acceptable, but an open ending for funny. I can only foresee Return Returns to the cabin by the lake for hours being able to eat when the film was screened against anything, but at 4 o'clock in the morning infomercials.
