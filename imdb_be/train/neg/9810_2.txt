It's hard to criticize this film, because I do not like the story itself, and no amount of good action would not have saved him. Think of "Raising Arizona" with a median strip. Acting is passable, but Jennifer Tilly way over the top (still not enough to make a good film camp), as usual, coming in somewhere between «Misery» and sarcastic staff DMV. Other actors have their eyebrows knitted constantly frightened, or from stress, their parts or the whole stress is a futile exercise. A real underestimate a few hours of the film. Daryl Hannah spends most of the movie crying too hard to understand. I would like to tell you how it ended, but I came out, I'm sorry.
