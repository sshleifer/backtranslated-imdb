Dude, really !!!! where you guys have been in the last 20 years, it is shocking to all kinds of ways, the horror? This is a joke, there is nothing wrong with a low budget, but it's a laugh, if you want to take a look at the classics, Oddities Todd Browning, victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, an immortal monster, Ernest Tesayger, Paul Wegener's Golem and passengers Ghost Train, you can not compare it, it gives it a bad name, bad acting, bad ScreenPlay etc. The total waist of money and free time, watched a lot of movies are my favorite horror all the time, I'm really speechless, nothing more to say, please do not make an effort to see something Daft please note
