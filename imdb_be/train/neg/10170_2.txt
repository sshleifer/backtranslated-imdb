Only a couple of days off the championship game, but in New Orleans, not as it should be. From players with family problems to drug overdose gambling problems before the killer on the loose, life gets in the way of what should be a memorable, great time. Can all be put back in order and stop the killer before the big game is broken? <br /> <br /> Despite what you might think when you first read about the Superdome, this is not football movie. In fact, football is nothing more than a tool of the conspiracy and after thought. Instead, the Superdome is another one of those crappy soap opera-ish 70 made for TV movies of Hollywood and populated those former people who never will. The cast sleepwalks his way through things with no one really does not look good. Example of best (or worst) Van Johnson is in a very small role, looking at the whole lost, why he was there. The plot is dull, uninteresting, and unbelievable. Donna Mills as a hit "man"? Yeah, right! This is about as believable as the case she has a liqueur soaked David Jansen. In the film, as there are no steps. Trying to get four or five story lines in the film that the flow zaps the Superdome, you may have had. In the absence of drama or suspense in sight, the Superdome ends up being a very bad example of 70th made for TV movie. The only thing for me was the voice of the work to the end of Charlie Jones - I miss listening to sports. Eloquently, he overstates the intrigue and deceit on-air in New Orleans, pure cheese in the best possible way. <br /> <br /> As with most people who saw the Superdome, I also did so gently Mystery Science Theater 3000. This may be one of KTMA sharing episodes, but it is one of the best examples show an early start. So even if I only appreciated the Superdome 2/10, I give this episode a generous 3/5 on my rating scale MST3K.
