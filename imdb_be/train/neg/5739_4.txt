The small town is attacked by hordes of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is a lone avenger and a ragtag group of survivors. <br /> <br /> Released in 1993, "Darkness" was something of a cult following after the release. It's easy to understand why something is loaded (and I mean uncontrolled loaded) with blood, and it is the energy and enthusiasm, as well as in other entirely extrabudgetary click horror cult as «The Dead Next Door» and «Children Ravensback», on actually quite contagious. <br /> <br /> while this may be true, it is, unfortunately, not enough to save him. The film was shot on Super 8, so that the image is grainy and dark, which makes things very difficult to see (it would be great if obscured protagonist terrible mullet.) In addition, the grating soundtrack consisting of annoying Casio keyboard and even more annoying Death Metal (seriously, it does not click with them horror budget and poorly Metal Death?) while one does not expect Oscar worthy performances, which operates still strictly amateur hour, the actors sometimes seem almost scared or confused instead threatened. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure that the proponents of budget-nya gorefests will love it. Everyone else, though, wish there was a little more meat on the ribs.
