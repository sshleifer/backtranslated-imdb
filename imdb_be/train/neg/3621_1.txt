I hated this show when I was a kid. It was the day when the kids show characters were actually accents, not just soft, general, General American dialect, we are accustomed to. Jack Wild was a British accent and was Pufnstuf south. As one of the others mentioned, though, I never really understood what was going on with the witch, who wants the flute. It has always seemed strange to me, probably because the flute is just annoying me and I would not go to any trouble to take it! <br /> <br /> Just a comment on the similarity Pufnstuf in the early 70's McDonalds advertising what others have said: Pufnstuf thwarted McDonalds. At the peak of the popularity of McDonald's, TV shows (or, more precisely, their creators) have sought to license McDonalds characters for their shows, but when McDonalds gave the TV show a slightly alter the character and gave it as their own. They even hired former employees of an advertising agency McDonalds and voice actors to do a TV show. McDonalds sued and won.
