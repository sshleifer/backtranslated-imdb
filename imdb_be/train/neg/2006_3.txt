It would help to know why it took so long for the book as a movie-ready "asÂ« The House Next Door ", which will be adapted for film or television. The book was copyrighted in 1978. One of the reasons may be the problem of designing a "house." The house in this life the film really so ugly that I can not imagine anyone buying it. In fact it is so unbearable that someone will probably come and destroy it as soon as it was built. <br /> <br /> I'm not happy with the horror genre of books, but this was hard to hide when I came across it about ten years ago. The main characters are not the people to look for anything in the occult life, and this is one of the strengths of the book. They are not people who conclude that the architect was a demon type .. (or the devil personified) without witnesses and analysis of the events described so well in this book. Nevertheless, this gloomy most of the book, and I do not think that applies to people who work for entire life. Maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in the following years. Better house..better music..a better script and darker lighting ... will certainly help.
