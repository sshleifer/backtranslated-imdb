Before watching this movie, I could say that it was a complete copy of Saw (complete with a box-like space in which they are located, and a black guy wants someone to break his arm to get out of the cuffs). Name MJH the film, as a rule, turn me (ugh, can we say, GROSS?!), But I would still like to give it a try. <br /> <br /> Since I was a little concerned. Actions absolutely horrible, and I found that to laugh at nearly every reaction of the characters (especially the man who played the «Sulley»). MJH was even worse, but I continued to watch. <br /> <br /> However, the ending was the biggest joke of them all! I seriously sat in shock thinking, "That was the end? It's a comedy! ". <br /> <br /> I thought it was a bunch of crap it was funnier than «Scary Movie» cheats and that's really saying something!
