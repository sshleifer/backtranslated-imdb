Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover, and soon learns that his uncle comes to see a new wife and baby Ollie. The problem is that they do not exist - Olli obviously made them! Thus, it is to him and his friend, to find a woman with a child who agrees to put his family. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly unique story idea, as I have seen at least a couple of other silent shorts with this exact subject. The best of them was Bobby Vernon DO NOT KID ME. It is much better than too much - probably a lot of it was because of this decade made later - when the comedy has become a bit more complex and relied less on meaningless farce. Now I'm not against the physical comedy, but in some slapstick films, people start shooting guns wildly, hit and push each other, etc. with little provocation. Unfortunately, the end is too much, this is exactly what they do. None of this does not make sense, and it was as if they had just run out of story ideas. <br /> <br /> In general, not exactly a milestone in the field of entertainment. There just is not enough bribes to win his view, if you are not intrusive silent fan like me.
