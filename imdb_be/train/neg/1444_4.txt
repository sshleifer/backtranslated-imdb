The film is very long and, unfortunately, quite different from the novel. If you want to watch a movie, do not read the novel first, as it will shock you. However, the cinema was in order, and if you are a person who loves the adventure genre, which explores Africa then go for it. Actor's speech adequately, however, many important events, which are present in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was in search of his missing brother, and not a lady in search of his father. Gagool was cunning and was killed in the cave, while here it has been shown to be a good man, who chose to stay with the new king.
