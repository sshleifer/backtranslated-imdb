Despite the rather bad reviews, I just had to give this film to go ?? it does, in the end, HK star super-beauty Shu Qi plus 6 other eastern beauty as a team all the action cat-burglars. Of course, it is worth checking out? Well, as the baby-holidays go, Martial Angels is hard to beat. Eye Candy high quality. Shu Q looks fantastic as always, and the other girls, rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang caught my mind wandering in particular. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if one is to judge the film for any other potential advantages, it is an absolute bitch! History of weak action and special effects stuff completely helpless. Director Clarence Fok and producer Wong Jing gave us photogenic actors and little else. <br /> <br /> If Shu Qi is the only reason you're thinking about seeing this one, you'd better watch Sex and Zen 2 again!
