So much hype with making wannabe Indiana Jones, if you have an actor who threw it into a fictional man with adventure books, which does not want to go on an adventure ??? Whoever wrote the screenplay for Jake SPEED was probably fired, but for some reason, perhaps, this film is very lacking risk! This does not mean that it does not have any action, but to look at the dark side of the picture. It does not bare any resemblance to Indiana Jones, or other thrill adventure containing climaxes and deliverance and JAKE SPEED has been raised in such a way with the help of intelligent propaganda to make me and a few others interested in it! Also, I have never heard of this guy, so who needs his attention?
