Disappointing, predictable film in which a woman (Mc Tire) travels with his daughter from state to state because it can not maintain a relationship and find happiness. In this genre «Anywhere But Here» starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman gave a much better understanding of the relation mother / daughter. With better as a good act.
