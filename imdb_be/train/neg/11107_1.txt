It was a terrible movie. There was no story line whatsoever. To top it all, when they could not explain the blood and the blood (the only good part of it) ... they threw in a few foreigners! I hate it when the director (or any other) that are run out of ideas, and then blames foreigners! Watch this movie if you like. But do not say I did not warn you. Two things: How Vinny can say "welcome" if he did not have language? Sorry Mr. Jones does not have a big role. The second thing that bugged me why we showed Vinnie Jones boils and cutting them and putting them in a blue liquid, they do not have any role. Why not? I did not want to show something, and this has nothing to do with the storyline at all. Shorter. A bad story. I would not waste my time - I would like watching mirror instead.
