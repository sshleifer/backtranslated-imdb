This movie is terrible. Decent fight scenes or not, acting is really bad, you can say that they read their lines off the map. With painful delivery line for everyone in the cast. Think about watching a high school play and cringing at the apparent lack of smoothness when the actor interaction (strange pauses between the lines of a different nature, in conjunction with the delivery line hasty others). If the movie had all the activities, it may be excusable, but a lot of the film includes a portion configuring and Family Guy style, irreverent cut souvenir (Oh, wow, they are poorly made). I believe they are trying to have fun with them, but he went out again into piles of high school students / college entrance goof off throughout the day, trying to create the funniest Youtube video. <br /> <br /> Now the fight scenes. They are not so bad, given the level of quality seen throughout the film. Nothing big ever, certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters have stated (nothing like Drunken Master). Fights are extremely gradual feeling with lots of cuts at different angles with clearly different entities positions involved. <br /> <br /> In general, the only reason to watch this movie if you are a friend of the guy associated with this very, very cheap products. That guy you may ask? Oh, the same guy who wrote the director, producer, and looking at this masterpiece of high school.
