IT did not make any sense, and it was so awful ... I think Hollywood has a lot of movies like this ... you should not do it to look. cutter or people eater, I have to say ... it made me feel sick! oh! The film is about people who we do not know, but to feed themselves with the people! they have teeth blah-blah-blah ... not that familiar with? I can bet on it, did you see him in another film. the cast was so great, but I think the script was really awful. and I must say that Bradley Cooper was totally awesome ... he's so talented ... In fact, I said terrible, but I think it's because of the terrible scene ... let me explain. Have you ever eaten a language? but in the movie one person did it! it was really horrible ... in any case I think that the film will be as good without that awful man eater or cutting scenes ...
