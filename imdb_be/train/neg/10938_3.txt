I did not expect so much going on that it is, but still left disappointed. This was my least favorite production Halestorm I saw. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but I chuckled only 3 or 4 of jokes. It's really funny gag to see the fat man eating donuts and offering again and again? What's the janitor in heaven scene? Fred Willard was fun with some of his co Christopher Guest, but it did not work. They have spent the entire budget for a "certain" actors appear in it because there was no lighting budget. It looks like it was filmed with a video camera and most of the scenes were very dark. Is it assumed that a lot of film to show who actually shoot and make the basket as opposed to cutting and editing of the ball swishing through the basket? I try not to be too critical of the low budget comedy, but if you want to see something funny go to the real church of games in basketball instead of the movie.
