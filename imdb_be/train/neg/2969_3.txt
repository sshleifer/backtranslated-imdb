The story is very reliable and powerful. The technical side of the film is pretty good .. even directing it. The main problem with the cast that made this film in almost a member of the local and regular clich√©s with great lack of influence and even more lack of experience. Apart from a small role as a father, Rafael (played well by Assi Dayan), all the other actors were, unfortunately, not in their power. The role of older blind man plays Taly Sharon, was fresh, but without any tension as the leading role. Therefore, the figure she acted was an easy and low-profile. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal for the real movie. But this is a good point to start with and make a big improvement in the future.
