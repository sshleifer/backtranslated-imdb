I do not know that it would be so cool about this movie. Even worse, why someone has to worry about seeing this? First of all, there is no history. It can be said that even without the history of cinema can be worth a look, because it is some kind of a strong sense (laughter, crying, fear, ...), but, in my opinion, this film does not do anything. <br /> <br /> You just watch the image of +/- 2 hours. There are more useful things to do. <br /> <br /> I think you could say that the film is an experiment and bold, because it lacks all of the above. But this cost 2 hours of your precious time and 7 Euros for your money? For me the answer is no.
