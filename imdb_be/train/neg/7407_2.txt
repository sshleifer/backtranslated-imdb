First I watched 6/18/2009 ?? 2 of 10 (DIR- Pete Riski): Weird psychotic film about a girl with autism, which is being tested at the hospital, food flickers, and then all hell breaks loose. I honestly do not know what were the intentions of the directors on this. What do we get for a further 1 hour and a half (at least, it was no longer) was twisted horror / Twilight Zone / zombiefest / ghost movie that really ultimately does not make any sense, even until the very end. Initially, after the power goes out, you do not have enough in the hospital for a small group of marginalized including girls, and his father, with the exception of. There is the typical annoying character, creepy old and a typical tough guy like many scarefests and, of course, a young girl, the protagonist gets involved. Random things are starting to happen at different times, as ghosts and monsters appear, suggesting that time has stood still, and dead people, as this small group trying to flee, that they are in. Of course, the autistic girl is the center of something, and I really hate the way they used the girl's illness and hinted that she was the cause, and put him in the hospital, where people care really lame. We will never find an answer to what happens ?? which is very strange, so please avoid this dog. If you do not want to be crawled, and stir for one hour and a half, it's not for you or any of moviegoers. Which is a waste of time ?? really !!
