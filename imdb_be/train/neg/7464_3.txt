I have not watched the whole movie. I could not watch the entire movie. I stopped the DVD after watching for half an hour, and I believe, who thinks to look at yourself is to stop yourself before you take the disc out of the case. <br /> <br /> I love mafia movies and tragic and comic, but Corky Romano can only be described as a tragic attempt mafia comedy. <br /> <br /> The problem is that Corky Romano is just trying too hard to make the audience laugh, the story seems to be the basis for moving Chris Katan (Corky) from one scene to another. Corky himself totally outplayed and lacks finesse and gullibility - all his strange mannerisms come across as contrived - Chris Cattani obviously "acting out", rather than taking on the role - it bounces you out of the story. Each scene is quite predictable, "a comedy event" that will be on the set, obviously, as soon as each scene is introduced. In comedies like Mr Bean disaster caused by the title character is funny, because you can empathize with the characters motivations and the initial events and situations, the character ends up in an entirely wired. Peel but gives the feeling that he was purposely screwing in a desperate attempt to draw laughter from the audience. <br /> <br /> If Chris has not played such a foreign character (who never actually does not connect with other movie characters) and whose behavior is completely inexplicable (for trying to draw laughs, except) and the comedy scenes were not so predictable and stereotypical - all the jokes seemed too familiar), this film might be watchable. But this is not the case. Do not look.
