Star Rating: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night Monday Morning <br /> <br /> James Dial (Snipes Wesley) is hiding at his ranch in Montana after a failed known terrorist attempt to seize. Then he came back the agency to go to London to go yet. Its purpose was accepted there and is under heavy police protection, but they do not want it to just grab their Man-they want it removed. Everything is going well, but then becomes a mission failed and when a senior police chief, Windsor (Charles Dance) is killed, blame falls on the feet of the dial. Hunted like an animal, he takes refuge in a nearby house, and moving closer to a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett), which deals with the problems of their own and became his unwitting sidekick as he goes for the release of his name and work, who betrayed him. <, Br /> <br /> This last Snipes straight to DVD Trick came out of nowhere, with a minimum of publicity, even for something as small time (I do not remember seeing advertisements or trailers for it anywhere.) With that in mind Snipes and after the story in the DVD Duff efforts, it may seem as one, to which Snoop Dawg tell you to drop like it's hot. But I had to give it a go anyway. It is not among it worse, but it does not reach a little higher than the standards of some of his best of them (the detonator 7 seconds, says it all, really), either. <br /> <br /> This, at best, a little anxious, with minimal action, blame everything on the path of dialogue and cold Snipes is not quite at his best in the lead role. In addition, in the main supporting role, it is quite understandable Dance showed up to pay checks as well, and it is usually one that none of the actors are not going to yell at the hills about any of them separately. <br /> <br /> It says a lot that just before the end of a "contract" that keeps you interested, Snipes's end Sony and with him to stop any further sub nominee militants EL DVD. **
