Gadar is an example of one of Bollywood's worst inflated films ever. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers to make the film relevant period gives a trash film. The songs were boring and not a song you want to listen to in the car, the total volume. Sunny Deol known for the manufacture of abnormal films where he knocks 100 bad guys on his own. He even begins to metal prison door (Indian) and kicks the car is moving away (Teesri Aankh). I can give another 50 examples of shameful actions Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people know this already. Sunny gives a lamentable spectacle once again repeating the same type of role. Man claims to be fighting for his country to pieces, with violence. Amisha Patel's hand dead sexy with an amazing body, I would love to the bone. But even she could not save the film from disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes, as it usually does in this film, she does not. Maybe because it plays a Muslim, but she does not act like one in the film. Overall, this is a bad show all the way, I'm sure it will appeal to some people who like to see the Bollywood actor knocked 100 children. Give me a break.
