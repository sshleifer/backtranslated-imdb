Some people do not like animation. Personally, I think that animation was absolutely amazing, considering, if the film was made. There are many old cartoons that I just love. My problems with this film animation entirely, but mostly the way it was built. The characters are all just ... well, pointless. And for this film, they should not be. Apparently, all in LOTR have a problem, limping (for beginners). Just as they did in the whole annoyed me. My two sisters and I laughed throughout most of the film. I think if a lot of people have seen this before seeing newer, they would not have gone. I am glad that I rented it and do not buy it. There are a few movies that give me a headache. It was one of them. However, this is not the worst film I've ever seen, but it ranks up there. Or there, depending on your point of view.
