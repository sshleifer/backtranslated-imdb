The main plot of this movie is not bad. The lady makes it big and returns to his alma mater to love. But despite the good operating Robert Young and Eve Arden, the film mess. The blame for that I place on any Joan Crawford or director or both, its performance is just awful. Instead of being a real person, it makes perfect embodiment of a deer caught in the headlights. In other words, she was staring into space and has a "Honestly I'm SOOOO aback" expression. After a few minutes, he really began to annoy me. Now it is, of course, not only Crawford movie I do not like her performance, as she did more than her share of replays - in movies such as Johnny guitar or many of her later films, such as a man possessed! My advice is to try a different film Crawford - there are, of course, have been better.
