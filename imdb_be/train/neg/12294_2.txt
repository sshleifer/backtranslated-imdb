I watched this film exclusively for customization. It was filmed in the old hotel that a friend owns shares. The plot was predictable, was acting mediorcre at best scares are all gross-outs, entirely genuine scares. <br /> <br /> I do not remember much of the story, and I think it's because WASN Â»so much of one to remember. They have not even used the hotel to it's full potential ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula. During low tide, you can walk about 1/4 mile to the bay, which is really an awesome sight especially in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The best way to see this film with remote control in hand, so you can fast forward through the action (and I use that term loosly) stage and pause at the beautiful surroundings!
