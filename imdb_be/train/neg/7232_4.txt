I thoroughly enjoyed the graphic novel Bilan, when he came out, and I was amazed when I saw the trailer for this film, and even more so when I found out that Bilan directed it himself. The film, however, was a major disappointment. Visual nowhere near the rich and the rough texture of the original works of art and history is an understatement. Bilan, it seems, has decided to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and it does not do a very good job at it, either. <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel of friendship-hate relationship between Nikopol and Gore. They were both of them at the right time and place, we are forced together by circumstances. First of all, they were funny and cute. Not so here. Nikopol has no tangible person in general, and Gore pompous idiot who just wants to fuck. Despite the fact that the film is French, Horus should not be! <br /> <br /> We have all seen the movies, we enjoyed, but would not recommend to anyone for any reason. I would not recommend Immortel anyone, except perhaps as a warning not to overestimate their talent and resources. Bilan is a master storyteller, but obviously not the master of each visual environment.
