Corky Romano has to be one of the most jaw dropping and awful "comedy" ever made. <br /> <br /> Although sometimes funny Chris Cattani, who took a very funny performance in a fun "Undercover Brother" his character crust so stupid and so unfunny, which is a shame, as the premise of a great idea. To bad they ran out of them if they were on page 3 of the scenario.
