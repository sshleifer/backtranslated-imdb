My God, if this was the Â«Run, Lola, Run" adaptation of Persuasion? It was awful. It's bad enough that the "writer" (and I use that term very weak) cut and paste dialogue from one character to another, often completely out of context and to hurry the story along: but Anne Elliot running from place to place in search of Wentworth near the end of paragraph 'The play was an abomination! Austin must turn in his grave. Neither respectable young woman would not have done in such a harsh manner. And the actress who played Mary? Horrors. Needless to say, if the rest of Austen remakes are a bad thing, except they will be a new generation of observers. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a perfect version of the (otherwise) wonderful novel, receive one thousand nine hundred ninety-five Roger Michell directed version starring role Amanda Ruth (whose expression one can speak volumes) and Ciaran Hinds. That's fine.
