After a day at work, I sat down to rest and movie channels included. The film was a guide and it sounded interesting, so I tuned in just before it began. The first 30 minutes was enough to make me interested, but the lack of acting ability from Jamie Foxx, and the slow movement of the plot forced me to get up and find food during the movie. If there is any credit to be given to it should go, David Morse, who at least tries to make the movie interesting for the action in this movie. In general, do not plan to impress your friends by choosing this as a renter movie night.
