I have no idea what on earth, so i abroad, might, perhaps, did Sam Mraavich to believe that it would be a worthy project to undertake. Ben & Arthur is one of the worst movies ever. In fact, I see no reason why it should not be # 1 in the bottom 100. For although I have not seen, for example, SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2 (# 5 at the time of this publication), I would venture to think that this film is much better than occurs early, because even in fresh dismalness at least, child geniuses, professionally made. On the contrary, everything and I mean everything, in this film, totally unprofessional. <br /> <br /> The film is designed to attack the alleged bigotry and hatred of the Christian right against gays. And I emphasize the "intended." Not only is it entirely fails in its purpose, it also leaves an ugly scar. Instead of creating a convincing and realistic portrait of a gay couple struggle against a society that largely opposes them, it creates a tired, dull stereotypes of each party involved. Ben and Arthur, the namesake of the pair, the two are portrayed as crude, sex starved and hopeless romantic cardboard cutouts to the marriage, if the laws change to allow them to do so. It meets with the opposition brother Ben Victor, a Christian minister, who, like all Christians (as the film would have us believe), loud, prying, stupid, and violence. He tries to kill Ben and Arthur after his association with them to get him kicked out of the ministry. Just as in real life. And if you think this is terrible (it), you have not seen it all. <br /> <br /> actors (?) It is possible to completely eliminate any trace of confidence in the film, saying their lines as if they were home narrate comedy YouTube videos. But even Daniel Day-Lewis and Marlon Brando as the title characters could save this clunker, as will still be an issue with a completely meaningless and laugh induces dialogue that fills every moment of the film. Each scene has at least one inconvenient or absurd citations. For example, in one scene, Victor tries to complain not able to have a niece or nephew because his brother homosexual. But instead to reflect this idea clear that he spits silly, quite confusing, bland-sounding line, "You know that I'll never have any nieces or nephews, well, because you are so F *** ED UP! "<br /> <br /> even more shocking is the complete lack of production values. Yes, I know that this is not the Dark Knight, but even amateur filmmakers need to know some basic special effects and editing. For example, six red dye points cake is not enough for a realistic gunshot wounds. People do not teleport around the room in between takes. And the objects do not fall FORWARD shooting! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on Ben & Arthur. I do not care if you're 7, 17 or 107. I do not care if you're gay, straight, bi or indecision. I do not care if you are a "n left wondering. "I do not care what a pathetic reason may have to be tempted to buy this pile of manure. Stay away, far away. Only redemptive quality of this film is its ability to be used as a frisbee.
