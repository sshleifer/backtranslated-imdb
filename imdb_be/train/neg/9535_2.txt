Believe it or not, this film is less than the number of three.it slower acting is worse, and the story is very weak.there little good to say about this fight scenes movie.even duller than number three, and I would have thought that impossible.this very slowly 90 minutes.painful, in fact.i delayed it until the end, hoping that he would get better.if you really want to see this movie, you should try to find cheap car it.it hard to find (for purchase, ie, ) and probably for good reason.like number three, this film has nothing to do with the first two.it same name only.anyway, most I can give a Best of the Best: Without Warning is 2/10
