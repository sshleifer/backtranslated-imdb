I never considered myself a lot of "student" when it comes to watching movies, I watch them, form an opinion and that's all. Frustrated but changed all that. This film is without a doubt the most inept attempt to create a movie I have ever seen. Every child who is swinging up at the University of thinking they are going to be the next Spielberg or Tarantino must be passed this film with a textbook titled "How not to make a film." Not only is there no story to be had, the filmmakers were not even competent enough to make the film worth watching. It's been a while since I've seen, but all I can say is, watch tracking shots overhead in the opening scenes. They never ends! It's almost like your teeth pulled out, not so much satisfaction i.
