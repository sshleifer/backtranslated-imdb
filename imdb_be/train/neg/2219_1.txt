Perhaps one of the most overpriced so-called horror classics ever, Halloween really memorable shows Michael Myers and some great decreed Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> However, it rewatchability coefficient is very close to zero, since there unforgivable amount of time spent on dullness / climax to real events. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of film that you can get away from the popcorn and do not miss anything. <br /> <br /> As it spawned so many sequels, I will never understand. <br /> <br /> Thank God, Rob Zombie remakes it. And in general, I hate remakes. <br /> <br /> Of course, it will more than make up for all the random time filling in the gaps with some bizarre points of interest, the original is severely lacking. <br /> <br /> This is a film, we feel that we should love, just as we were taught that we should enjoy Dickens. <br /> <br /> do not think that it's a classic.
