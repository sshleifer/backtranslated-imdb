There are exactly two good things to say about the "Fantasy" (as mentioned in the previous reviewer, and): <br /> <br /> a) extraordinary poetry inspiring beauty After Derek. It has the shots in this film, where she gives even Catherine Zeta-Jones a run for their money, and this is high praise indeed. Her nudity is short and restrained, but just by looking at her face enough. <br /> <br /> b) The Greek island setting, with its sun and the crystal clear blue water. <br /> <br /> Other than that, there is no story, dialogue pathetic and sometimes unintentionally funny ( "He touched you where you are a woman!"), and the character of Peter Hooten is a slimy jerk. After all, naive replays her character, but then again, when you have to work with the dialogue is bad, it's unfair to blame the actor (the fact that she continued to speak the name of "Damir" in almost every sentence is a major irritation). Oh, and while the film is on a Greek island, the Greek word is hardly to be heard - apparently everything, from children to the elderly, says in English all the time. (*)
