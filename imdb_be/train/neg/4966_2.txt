I understand that this film was made on a very low budget, but that is no reason for the ugliness that is Grendel. Deathstalker, Throne of Fire, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, Invincible Barbarian were made on shoestring budgets and poor special effects but they still managed to create a cult classic, adding some half-naked women warriors and a good sense of humor. Primitive costumes, dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel's potential to be a very good low-budget sword and sorcery film, but the creators have completely destroyed this possibility using extremely bad effects CGI and colorless characters. Compare this movie Beowulf (1999). This may not be Citizen Kane, but it is a good example of how entertainment budget sci-fi / adventure film is low can be made using a reliable special effects and attractive characters.
