Please humor me if you will be in for a minute, until I read the back of the VHS Alley Cat boxes. He says that: <br /> <br /> In this part of town, each street is a dead end on every corner something to buy- in every alley die- another way to survive, you have to be the best - just like Alley Cat. Alley cat- this lady has the night. On the streets, where even become victims of predators, she knows how to survive- crossed, and you run out of luck. Alley cat- It awakens the animal. <br /> <br /> Now, is not that one of the most touching advertisements you've ever heard in my life? Whoever wrote that must be crazy, when they thought that such a horrible description may tempt us to view the video. But unfortunately, depending on how the faceless man was responsible for the unfortunate use of English does its job very well .. the film is placed in a small plastic case as bad as it sounds, and then some. <br /> <br /> Karin Mani plays a major role, and the script is basically saying to her during each specific stage or in) to pout like a goldfish b) kick ass male or) Show her feminine "attributes". No complaints about the latter, but in terms of the other two .. let's just say that it is not a lot of actresses, and even less convincing as a military expert of art. But even Meryl Streep with Cynthia's body (which is a scary thought) did not manage to save the film. Deploying a sad story beyond belief, how do we get a clumsily directed sequence battle after enough, stopping only for hysterical courtroom antics and sometimes gag induce a love scene with the name of wonder, Robert Torti. The camera-work is also to be on the same path of shame, with too many unnecessary close-ups and continuity errors galore. <br /> <br /> part, I think that really sums up the scum-bucket up film, where our heroine is raped, and manifests itself testifying before corrupt judge while its rich child rapist Leers on it out of the box. Not only that it receives from impunity, in spite of the overwhelming evidence against him, but then she was jailed for daring to protest against the sentence before his honor. Behind bars, then it is a group soul, lesbian crush a couple of cats-fighting and a good, sweaty game of volleyball before being released on bail to continue their struggle. This section does not have ten minutes nothing to do with the rest of the movie, and the script grinds to a halt, to cover it. I can only imagine that the producers wanted to add a little more T & A in the mixture, and came up with this unnecessary podagovorom as a means to achieve this goal. <br /> <br /> What kinds of questions arise, whether it is exploiting the film, or serious drama? No, not my answer is .. it's not sleazy or camp enough to appeal to supporters of Troma style of cinema, and it certainly does not make the class struggle as a study of one woman against the system .. just because it is so badly done. So, who on earth would like to see it? Crazy, I guess .. or IMDb reviewers who remain till 3pm and watch any old rubbish on the field, trying to sleep. Unfortunately, at this time I could not then, and horror will stay with me for some time. Do not make the same mistake I did. There are hot milk or something .. 1/10
