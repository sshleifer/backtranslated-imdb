It's almost like two movies - one competent and interesting, and the other stupid and clich√©d. It's really a shame, all the problems have not been developed with the written form, but given how quickly the majority of B-movies were written and done, it's not so unusual. It's a real shame, though, as it might be a very good film. <br /> <br /> First the good. The film is original and includes a WWII code-breakers. This is a very exciting and I loved watching the leading men (Lee Bowman) to pass through its paces, as the master code switch. In fact, the first two-thirds of the film was very good. But bad now, the film just went on too long and has lost steam about 50 minutes. In addition, the role of Jean Rogers as "kooky girlfriend" should be regarded as one of the worst written and distracting roles in film history !! For every rational movement, made by The Bowman, Rogers idiot then intervened to screw things up as a native "to mislead the help of comedy." If its role was written properly, the whole film would have improved greatly! Instead, he watched her, it's hard to understand how we actually won the Second World War !!
