I usually tend to like very low budget Gonzo movies but Darkman III so badly unengaging, I feel nothing but contempt for him. <br /> <br /> It looks and feels like a TV show, and a particularly bad one at that. Sets few flat lighting, evaluation and disparate effects, and film school operator is 101. There is no plot to speak, one-dimensional characters, and the actors sleepwalking. Most of the actors look like they should be doing soft core porn ..... In fact, the only award that I have received from this disorder has been spotting strange squint faced Roxann Biggs-Dawson (B'Elanna from Star Trek: Voyager) without Klingon makeup bumpy head. Her skin tone about two shades lighter than the Voyager; or it was bleached down for this role, or darken for Voyager. Very strange, anyway.
