Arg. Shuffling dinosaurs back to another piece of our common sense in the all-terrible third film. At this time, the European terrorists (Irish, I'd say) hi-jack an army convoy transporting the uranium to be. They tug at the shipyard, open the car and discover our old friends in carnosaurs. Pandemonium come visit when the rubber Dinos gnaw terrorist police and several Marines. The whole film seems (again) to a large extent inspired by Alien (as was carnosaurs 2) with a pathetic marines passing through the "claustrophobic" shipyard? guns at the ready. This is the third opus, probably the driest and ungoriest film from the party, only one splash of blood, if the rubber breaks Dean Marine head off. Dinos are stiff, shuffling creatures, as usual, and the T-Rex sounds like an angry elephant when she growls (he, too, seem to have no eyes). One of the goofiest scenes of the film, when the cops arrive on the spot: they enter the building, where a hijacked truck saved and hear some strange noises from the other truck. Opening it, surprise! Rubber Reptile Gang pulled away and devour them. Why Dinos were closed in the second truck after the flight of the first? As they closed in as the door of the truck may only be locked from the outside? What's the point of shooting this scene ???? Oh bother, who cares? Both thumbs down for Rubber oversized iguanas.
