Do not be fooled like I was in a "light" Reviews cited on the DVD box. "Dick's interesting." "Seriously scary Freakout." And worst of all, "flush with JAWS." This film is neither of the above. <br /> <br /> As a rule, I do not care to write bad reviews for movies, but I can not believe that this one is resting on a comfortable 7 to IMDb. He does not deserve this. <br /> <br /> After a so-so opening day monster attacks created, what else, the chemicals discharged lazy scholars, this film does not go absolutely nowhere, and he goes there sloooowly. In principle, and incredibly, she caught a monster (I'll give them points for good design things, but this is not not the creation of WETA) and its half-comic family to spend an hour-and-a-half track it down ... in the sewers, others Han river. Their quest lacks any uncertainty again, someone called it on par with Jaws? -And by the time they find it, you realize it was all a lot of sense. In addition, a large majority of the film tend to government quarantine, which ends in a funny scene with Man spitting in the gutter in front of a crowded bus stop. <br /> <br /> Blech. It was bad. I'm not kidding. You want to see a rotten monster movie? Rental Deep Rising. At least, you will save 30 minutes of your life.
