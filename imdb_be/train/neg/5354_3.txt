Lack of good land, lack of decent IV, the lack of good cinema, the lack of decent-looking special effects ... need I go on? The review may contain spoilers. The actors seem to be reading it the line, and not very good at it. Most of the "actors" act like they were in the second class of the game. History seemed to be written by one of the above-mentioned second-graders ... it's really not all that confusing ... it's just so simple and DUMB that people think they have to be something missing, so they think it confusing. Nope it's not, it's really as easy as you think. I realized in a "film" that, as I know it's smelly! Most of the film just people sitting around talking (read their lines), trying to look ominous. The narrator was irritable. "Special effects" were laughable. I like low budget movies. I would also like Carolyn Monroe, Tom Savini, Jack scarring and Michael Berrymore ... not only in this film ... You can say that they do not pay or have not paid much, because neither their hearts nor their talents were in it. I love Tony Todd ... however, it was only appropriate in this film. In fact, the performance of Tony Todd is the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony just in it for as long as two minutes (seriously)! I would suggest, to fast forward the DVD in a two-minute segment of Tony Todd. If I went to the theater and pay more than a dollar to see this "film" I would P.O.'D and demanded a refund. I hope that the people who did it do better next time.
