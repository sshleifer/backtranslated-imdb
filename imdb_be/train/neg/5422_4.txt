That the "noise" can not do is make us understand his character. Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who can not cope with the intrusive noise of the city more, especially car alarm. This is an amazing idea for a movie, which has about the same credibility as creative «Death Wish». She is smart in spots; in particular, a scene in which our hero tries to read Hagel, "I am too stupid to be understanding of this." He read and reread the paragraph in confusion, we read it and do not get it either.Just the car alarm is extinguished. Throughout the film is the constant intervention of anxiety and hustle. Although, in general, it does little to help us understand the character that allows it all to destroy his marriage and is pulled from the side portions, rather than dig deeper into his person. <br /> <br /> The film-making itself is also not paying attention to notice their own sound problems, poor editing and seeing a boom microphone. No, the "noise" is not all bad. William Hurt, at least colorful. At the very least, the end does not fall flat. In general, it is the logistics point home, one you probably have not thought about. At least, I had not. Although the whole ninety minutes long, it can not end earlier. History was delayed and seemed lost, as soon as it started. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you can see at the festival, but it probably will not be picked up for distribution. Check it out on DVD, if you are really indifferent to someone involved in the project. Otherwise, skip it.
