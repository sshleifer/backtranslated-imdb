I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart. After seeing it, I could just go back to the store and try to get your money back! The only reason why I gave the film 2 instead of 1 is that the story has a few new elements of the story, even though he actually never rises to the level to be interesting. This film has all the characteristics to be done to drive the market in the cinema - an ultra-low budget, amateur actors and a liberal dose of sex (for the early 60-ies of the film). In fact, I think, perhaps, the only reason the movie was made in order to make a quick buck because someone knew some strippers they could be used as extras. The film is about a doctor Wacko, who wants to transplant the severed head of his girlfriend on the body of an unsuspecting donor. Most potential donors Skanky strippers or model - whose only real purpose to tickle the film as they take off most of his clothes. However, they hold too much to make the film worth even looking at the naughty bits and the film is not quite terrible enough to deserve to watch a bad movie lovers.
