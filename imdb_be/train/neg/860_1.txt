Kubrick meets the king. He sounded so promising in the spring of 1980, I remember. Then came the film and Kubrick were sectarian disputes with sectarians King still. <br /> <br /> The sectarians King said Stanley Kubrick took a big horror story, and destroy it. Kubrick sectarians give a damn about the history of Sun King. They talk about the Steadicam tracking shots, angles.This film camera, they insist: It should be considered on their own. As it happens, both camps are right. Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> If one views it solely as an adaptation of the novel King's "The Shining" is really a failure, missed opportunities, a series of unsuccessful narrative gambit. <br /> <br /> I blame that on screenwriter Kubrick. Author Diana Johnson (author of Le Braque, L'Affaire, Le Divorce, etc.) has a reputation as a novelist social mores. Maybe she was chosen for its subtle understanding of the marital relationship and family dynamics. But a small blue collar town of Sidewinder, Colorado, does not exist on any map in its Francophile universe. <br /> <br /> Kubrick Anglophile probably found it congenial, however. He, of course, is a real filmmaker. And consider in fact, his screenplay for «The Shining» - with its hodgepodge of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernatural, reincarnation and understand - simply does not stand up to logical analysis <br /> <br />. I am willing to consider Kubrick's "The Shining" on their own terms. I am even ready to accept it as something other than the usual horror film genre. But it can not, as a naturalistic study of isolation, alienation and madness either. Successfully parsed anyway, the movie pretty much falling apart. <br /> <br /> A real horror Overlook Hotel? Or do they exist only in the mind - first, as a visionary nightmares suffered little Denis Torrance, whereas hallucinations of his father? One notes how every time Jack Torrance speaks with "ghost", it's actually looking in the mirror. One notes, it looks like a frozen-trimmed hedge labyrinth symbolize Hotel stunted, tangled psyche Jack. Very deep stuff. <br /> <br /> But if in fact the "ghosts" is sheer pure manifestations of growing madness of Jack Torrance, who was captured by Jack lets out of the kitchen at the dead bolt in the closet went on foot, so that he can go its culmination ax pricks? <br /> <br /> and can explain to ANYONE with a straight face that the black-and-white photographs ( "one thousand nine hundred twenty-one" helpfully labeled) with Nicholson as a tuxedo party -goer, that pops out of left field and the hospitality-point wall during the last seconds of the film? We must seriously conclude that Bad madness of Jack Torrance implies certain "past life" experiences? (And if you swallow that, because if people need to be reincarnated to be exact physical replicas of their past selves?) <br /> <br /> Perhaps Kubrick does not care about his storyline. Maybe, just I wanted to evoke a mood of horror. In any case, the film is trying to hedge its bets plot - have both a way, the rational and the supernatural. As a result, the history of the disorder. This film is not improved with age, and it certainly does not improve with repeated viewings. <br /> <br /> I do not deny that some moments of fear, claustrophobia, and the general horror scattered around this long, long movie. But those blood gushed elevators O », seen several times in small visions Denis, absurd and ridiculous. And the infamous tag line, Jack Torrance ( "Wendy, I'm home!» And «Heeeeeere John!") Just pierce the dramatic tension of the film, and to scatter his narrative energy. (I know: I was sitting in the theater and hear the audience laugh comic: "Ugh I am glad that we do not take this stuff seriously!") And finally, Kubrick completely at sea - or a very cynical - during these scenes, where Wendy wanders around the empty hotel, and her husband is trying to wipe their son. Foyer complete mummified guests, all were dead in their party hats? Yikes, now I'm really scared. <br /> <br /> Given the brilliance of Jack Nicholson for many years, we can only assume that he gave the only kind of eyeball rolling, wiggling his eyebrows, scenery-chomping performance that the director wanted. Performance Shelley Duvall as a sort of female version of Don Knotts in "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken," best hushed <br /> <br /> This film simply does not work -. Not as an adaptation, but not on their own terms . it probably deserves 3 out of 10, but I give this one because it was so badly overestimated in this forum.
