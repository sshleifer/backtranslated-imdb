Most students find themselves lost in a bubble of academia, cut off from the society in which they live and study. Their conversations are held with their fellow students and teachers of the college. Documentary Stephen GreenStreet is a prime example of a disillusioned college student who will judge the whole of society on the basis of limited contact with a small amount of its members. <br /> <br /> documentary focuses on a small group of people who were presented as representing large groups of people. As usual, the people who scream the most get the most media attention. Other than his misrepresentation of the society in which was set a film documentary was well done. My only argument that feelings and din, depicted in the film have been attributed to the entire community and not individuals who expressed them. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is important to consider the dispute, as it makes people aware of the differences between the political point of view, but it's ridiculous to involve the entire community of people in the actions of a few radicals.
