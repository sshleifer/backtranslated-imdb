I must say that there is nothing wrong with low-budget films, so that's not my problem to him. My problem is that I felt like I was looking at home movies of my next-door neighbor. IMO all just seemed like it that the guy wrote a short story, I grabbed the camera and started shooting. I understand how hard it is to be efficient to do, but if I pay to make a film, I expected to feel like I'm watching some type of professionally made film. <br /> <br /> John Schneider has a great job, a great actor, and it was good in this movie. Other people were not in it. I understand how it is supposed to be fun, and cheaper to use friends and family as cast, but it does not make for a convincing acting. It would seem that he was shot, he tries to give many of the scenes more interesting look, but if the letter, the plot and the action there, to begin with, the type of style is not necessary, and it is a distraction. <br /> <br /> In addition, from a technical point of view, he had digital artifacts everywhere. In the first stage all these wonderful cars, when they made a slow scan of them, they were to move back and forth just a little bit. The problem is not in my view the equipment, (Benq PE-8700 84 "measured diagonally), but somewhere in the production. I have never seen such an artifact in a professionally made film before. Then the sound came. It sounded like they did not do any voice-overs, which can be good if it did not sound like the track in this film. it sounded like a built-in microphone on the camera.
