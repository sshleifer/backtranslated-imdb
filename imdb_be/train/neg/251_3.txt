I was sooooo excited to see this film, finally, after reading the book this week. My 13 year old son was looking forward to it too. I rented it and pressed down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on the screen. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed. This film turned from the book several times, than it is forgivable. George C. Scott's a great actor, but it seemed that he was completely in character, only about 20% of the time. Rest of the time he was very flat. <br /> <br /> I understand that this has been done in 84, the CG effects previously, for the most part. But it looked very much the quality of B-movie, especially the meeting with Jacob Marley <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment was that they came from one of the most moving parts of the story :. When the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge on hurricane tour of the world, watching the people in the most severe circumstances that are still light and the love of Christmas. <br /> <br /> I recognize that Mr. Scott did a good job with the "reform" Scrooge at the end. This is a refreshing image. <br /> <br /> I wish Bob Cratchit was depicted as little more than for ragged and down-trodden. and Tiny Tim ... oh, do not even get me started on the poor child actors ...
