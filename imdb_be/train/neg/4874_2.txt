Sorry, no animals, no Eddie Murphy had something to say worth saying. This film is just bland. <br /> <br /> Children's movie? Well, if you're trying to get them to take a nap, then maybe. It is only 90 minutes, some painfully poor eye mouth animal animation quips that's not funny. And lips sync'ing makes the old Godzilla movies look brilliantly done comparison. Meanwhile, Eddie "Pluto NashÂ» Murphy on UAV suppressed underestimated delivery who is ill experience. Apparently, he's trying to change his old manic person, but to what? In short, all the magic and wonder of 1967 the original version is lost in this rethinking, or what it is. City wants to intimidate some forest creature, and blame them for the bad things. No really. And Pluto Nash is psycho-babble with them. Things chain together with some stale jokes dull uninspired conclusion without any surprises. <br /> <br /> Take 67 movies. Or some old Yogi Bear cartoons.
