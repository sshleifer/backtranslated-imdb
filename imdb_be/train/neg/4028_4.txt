It had all the makings of a very good film - good actors (Robert Loggia, Helen Parker), a good story (the mysterious rocket from outer space threatens to burn the planet) and a lot of footage (if the Air Force jet was a film shoot missiles, it has been used). Unfortunately, it has destroyed too much melodrama and impossible time-line. <br /> <br /> As for the movie launch of the space, which is attacked by the Soviets and inadvertently diverted into low orbit atmospheric. At the age of five miles and at a speed in excess of 4,000 miles, it starts up the exhaust gases of a million degrees, burning everything to the ground, including glaciers, Distant Early Warning (dew) line databases and Eskimos. <br /> <br /> Every attempt to destroy the rocket fails. <br /> <br /> A first disadvantage of this film appear in the early stages. While we do not expect much from a low-budget movies, some things can not be forgotten - as a little research. For example, the Soviet Union and US fire against ballistic missiles that home in on a rocket with unerring accuracy. However, the first successful missile defense test had not been made up in March 1961 Russian Year. <br /> <br /> There is too much melodrama. Dr. Loring (loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) played with his novel about the same wood as the house. Parker's character screams and b-Hoos for the victims of the loggia she was to audition. Loggia of the heroic, like a bored businessman. Scientist (Phillip Pine) hams it so much, he does look like William Shatner theater. The bus driver constantly puts the end-in-the-world shit in every scene. The only good actor, narrator of the film, played by actor Lawrence veterans character Dobkins ( «Naked City»). <br /> <br /> All of this could be overlooked if there was a timeline. After the rocket sent the information to Washington, the Pentagon leading scientists in the group. The total (Larry Kerr) announces that a rocket hit in New York in the 63rd minute. After that, there is a discussion of scientists and there is a lull death, as the word sought after, to see if the rocket attack on the Russian side and, if the answer is not required. <br /> <br /> The film shows the war as a completely mixed. Civil Defense people leave work and go to their places. Eight million people climb loss repositories, and school buses pick up millions of children (and we'll see whiter New York, I've ever seen, but look 50 years old sci-fi movies have made it seem that it was standard). The press was kept in the dark for tens of minutes. Then, incredibly, the man in the Pentagon reported that a rocket hit in Ottawa, Canada in 51 minutes! All of the above activities took place in 12 minutes! Then, to add fuel to the fire, as the loggia is thinking about ways to stop an alien missile. He slowly produces plutonium clientele, loads it into the jeep and takes it from DC to long-distance missile base, to put it on top of the rocket. Along the way, he lost his way a wild driver, breaks down, and then stolen. He finally gets back to the plutonium and wheels to the ground to arm the rocket. Again, it's all in the same 63-minute period. <br /> <br /> The film also irritates the viewer, making it seem as if in Ottawa can be saved, only to show men, women and children to get fried. The rocket then said five minutes to get from New York. Loggia even on the basis of the control (4 more miles to go). He gets on base and the coat of arms of rockets, two-minute countdown and then announced. All within five minutes. In Barro New York had at least scorched. <br /> <br /> By the way, the missile is destroyed, if you have not guessed. ABM warhead destroys the basis of a massive nuclear explosion of plutonium. Five seconds later, the explosion dissipates and clear. Yes, they have caused a nuclear explosion equivalent to 100 Hiroshi on the outskirts of New York, and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The film has all the elements necessary to be a good B movie, but wasted them. Loggia played his character as convincing you not care that he sacrificed himself in the end. You do not care about the other characters, even insinuating scientist plays Pine. Voltage to be moved along the film just was not physically possible in the time line allowed (it still would not be today, even with Jack Bauer). <br /> <br /> This film is very difficult to find. As far as I know, he was not republished in any medium and for a good reason. I do not know when the film is meant to be, or if it was a standard practice, but there is a scene where the government directs all the best scientists, military and business people into the deep seekers say they are too valuable to lose. There are no women or minorities in the heap. Harry Rhodes, the only black person in the film, and it gets a little short playing the piano. It was worse than the "27 days" where an alien gives five earthlings are given the chance to save or destroy the planet, and it does not include any black or Latino. <br /> <br /> I saw it on a special night SCI- Fi on Turner Classic Movies, and I do not expect it to show again. If you find a copy of it somewhere, you can put it on Amazon.com.
