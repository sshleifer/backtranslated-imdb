Hooper is not funny, not fast paced, not romantic and Non informative. There is no real drama. One would think that the film is about the greatest stuntman in the world will have some sort of drama was an attempt, but it did not seem real. No study of character, no lessons were not learned, do not even look like the actors having real fun, they were just trying to act like they had fun. There's no reason to watch, if you do not like to look at Bart and want to get the occasional glimpse of Sally. Prancer horse was fine, and did what he had to do. In fact, Prancer was the best actor in the film. Smokey and the Bandit was such a fun movie that I was ready to love Hooper. This movie was a real disappointment and a waste of time
