Seriously, what is it? Hooper made such classic films as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, he did this god awful movie, what happened? He dipped into the crack a little too much? This film is about some dude named Sam, who has an opportunity to set things on fire, (Firestarter, anyone?) The action was godawful, the story was rubbish, and the special effects were very poor, they looked like something from the 70s. Van Damme should not be happy that Derailed is no longer the worst movie ever, and that was the end? He began to glow blue, it turned into a glowing blue clot sucked his girlfriend a fire, and the film ended. What was it? And? When the movie ended, I was hoping that the DVD will Spontaniously Combust, to save me from the pain. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this film. <br /> <br /> I do not think obey, you will thank me later.
