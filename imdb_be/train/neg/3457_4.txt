This film was made and cast from my hometown. I remember the hype around it and all the hype about Ringwald was in town ... <br /> <br /> Scene ... <br /> <br /> In fact, 20 years after the movie "put to rest" without being finished, a group of students of shooting to complete it - with disastrous consequences. It would seem that who do not want the film to be completed. <br /> <br /> The plot far-fetched. We must remember that it is a comedy, and, therefore, should be taken slightly Tounge in cheek, but he did not have any real oomph. Symbols mainly transperant and little information that you get on them you just do not care, it does not seem to matter. This emphasis strange hearing how Australian Kylie again and nice to see a child, when I went to school with in the main role. But this does not save the film at all. God knows why the creators thought that they would get in Ringwald. Perhaps due to the nature of the film (a kind of tribute to the 80th movies / bad horror movies), but in fact the Australian actor would have done just fine. <br /> <br /> As for the casting of actor concerned many seemed to rubble. Some of these children (especially the two main Chics - they played the "director" and "producer") looked like they were trying to act. It is never a good look. In addition, the images were rough feeling about them. For light possible? Just not as smooth as the one used. <br /> <br /> killer. Lord. Can this be less scary? There are some factors impact, although somewhat rough scenes. I did like the movie, but it was not great. This went on for 90 minutes, but could go for less money. Perhaps if they were covered with a scenario, it would be better. They had to kill a lot of characters - but no real build up their production of sacrifices. Maybe if they killed fewer people, and actually focus on the frightening atmosphere, it would be better. <br /> <br /> Now I know that it's a comedy, and the elements have been funny. Or so unbelieveable they were funny. But I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> LM.
