One of the other commentators have pointed out that they are almost out. If I was not with my wife, who wanted to stay, I would have left. It's a shame, too, because I think it might be a good movie. But this is easily one of the worst adapted screenplay I have ever seen. He does not start anywhere and is not going anywhere (I would say that is going nowhere fast, but it really goes nowhere slowly ... painfully slow). From time to time there are hints that something interesting might happen, or that there are potentially some depth at one of the characters, but that's all we get - hints. There is not a win or a revelation in the whole film. Not that I need a slippery site to have fun ... I love a good study tortuous character as much as the next indie nude. But these characters are added to anything. Throughout the time of the film, you do not care what happens to one of them. In fact, you almost start hoping that they will die, because at least death can be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unpredictable that one might think that this in itself would have been convincing, but it is not. Instead, Shifty, noir-Esquire characters acting in a cool fashion, you just recognize it immediately for what it is: a bunch of talented, but actors miscast brooding and raising an eyebrow reading strange dialogue without a hint of context. All this for two perseverance, painfully slow hours. Awful.
