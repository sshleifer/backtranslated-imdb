I can sit through this movie once, but I doubt that I could make it through the second time. Moderately entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The pleasure of Matt Dillon (I think that's something about Mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious action Micheal Keaton. This is not a fun romp Love bug was, but it's watchable. One of my main detractions from the film was the fact that the coat of arms has become a R2D2 tricks for the most part. I was bored with spotlight effects eye on for the second time 30 or so long they were used, and the bending of the front wing caused the same reaction to me. Go it with your kids, that is, "one figure bracket" children and does not expect much from this film. <br /> <br /> _X
