Good idea, poorly implemented. Despite the fact that it was possible to sum up 99% SciFi Channel movie, it really applies here. I love movies where the good backstory slowly revealed, and I like fighters, and I like all of the main character, so it would be great. However, despite some good performances, this movie can not be due to poor writing and directing Bill Plata. <br /> <br /> Another review has made a good point you need to know where you're going, so you can get there. This film does not. It is put together in such a haphazard way that you know the word "second draft" is not in the vocabulary of Bill Plata. There is one scene is not needed and can be removed and no one noticed. This scene even starts and ends with them at the wheel of the car, so that you can cut from one scene to the next car and never missed a meaningless scene in the middle. <br /> <br /> This film also had a strange habit in explaining some of the details while more to explain to others, some to the point where you can guess the whole "conspiracy" front. He also had a habit of interruption of the fight early, probably because they could not afford it. There are also some ridiculously bad scene where the "story" is revealed on the computer and the final battle with conveniently placed "toxic glue" (seriously, what * is * that?). <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie, because it is right. She still manages to escape from his person «Roswell» several times and make for a good hard Belarus (but not always). John De Lance plays the same character he plays in everything he has ever done, so how to play Q back to ST: TNG, so there is nothing new <br /> <br /> In general, I I gave the film a rating of 4/10 ..
