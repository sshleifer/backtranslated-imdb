Rounding out the 1929-30 all-Talkie "Our Gang" release schedule, "tough winter" has two story lines. Firstly, Wheezer and Mary Ann, one on a winter day at home, decided to have some taffy. Little Wheezer relay directions Mary Ann with radio cooking show. Problem: Wheezer relays the information from the various shows and Mary Ann finishes to put soap in the mix! Funny moments arise when the rest of the gang shows up to pull the iris - and eventually get it around the house <br /> <br /> In the second scene deals Stepin Fetchit, neighbor / laborer from a gang, and its interaction with the Gang. <br /> <br /> Â«tough winter," to my knowledge, has never been shown on television, even though it is available on home video. The reason for this is a characteristic Stepina Fetch showing runs slowly and the slow moving nature. "Our Gang" producer Hal Roach called Fetchit "seasoned comedian" and used the recording of "Our Gang" as a pilot for Fetchit comedy series, which never saw the light of day. It is understandable that Fetchit characterization is offensive to many people today, which explains why the film was shelved. <br /> <br /> Although there are some funny moments, both Fetchit and butterscotch, a "hard winter" is the perseverance and twisting forces. If one positive came out of this film, it was the fact that Hal Roach Studios growing confidence and experience in the creation of the radio. The sound in the film is good, and some of the sound effects used very funny. For this reason, the film is partially paved road to the beautiful 1930-31 "Our Gang" films. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
