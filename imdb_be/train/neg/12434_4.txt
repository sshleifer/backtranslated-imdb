In 1987, John Hughes wrote and "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," which was hilarious and poignant comedy ?? the best thing he ever did. Ten years later, he again reduced to recirculation section "Home Alone" in this second sequel, that is not connected to other films, but equally uninspired and sadistic. Four scam ?? that's for sure, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for the introduction of this revolutionary change in the series! ?? that the electric chair with metal chairs, clamorous with rods and blinded with paint, ha-ha-ha-ha haaaaaaaa, while the new baby is even less charming than Culkin. One might think that the withdrawal of almost all the key players from the first two films stop Hughes fossilising with the same old routines, but the only surprise is that even he has not appeared for the "Home Alone 4".
