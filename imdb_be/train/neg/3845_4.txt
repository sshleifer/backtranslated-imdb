Although Bette Davis did an excellent job, Mildred, I felt that the film was not the best I've seen. At the end of the film it left me with the feeling that there was something lacking in it. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis did a perfect job, though, and she made me hate her and feel sorry for her time. Leslie Howard has done very well, like a lover Philip Kerry, and I'm so sorry for the whole movie, because in love with such a terrible woman. It's such a boring thing, when one finds him / herself in love with a bad seed. And especially if it's someone like Philp Carey, who is a sensitive man, though pathetic. <br /> <br /> In the end, the effect was that it was not until the end of the story. The ending scene was particularly good, but I'm not one to give it. Although others may find this a good film, I was the one who found it so-so. I have to recommend this film to anyone who likes the bad seed, so they can see what can happen to them when they are in love with this terrible man.
