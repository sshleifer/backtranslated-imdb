It can be a little tough for me saying that, but unfortunately so far in his career, directing him now. Just look at what he as done so far. They barely make it past the 3 star mark. <br /> <br /> Why do I have to watch this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg. Lucy was outstanding in this film, her performance is the whole movie. I hope she gets a "blockbuster" and breaks into the big league of actors, it clearly has the skills. Greg was not so impressive, a typical TV acting style. <br /> <br /> The film is surprising is classified as a horror. The only "horror" have short memories, and they last for a maximum of 2-5 seconds with a small amount of blood in them. I personally would not call it a "drama / thriller." <br /> <br /> But no matter how interesting the story is actually bad directing, editing and action (appart from Lucy) destroys it. You do not get a real connection with the actors, something which is very important in the history like this one. You just sit there watching the feeling nothing. It's like watching a bad TV soap .... in fact I think that television soap would have been more interesting <br /> <br /> My advice :. Stay away from this movie ... or better yet, just stay away from all involved with Michael Hurst.
