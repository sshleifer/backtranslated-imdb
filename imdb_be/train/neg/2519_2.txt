I actually pay to see this movie in the cinema. <br /> <br /> He will receive a 1-rated, but the fight scenes between the robots is all right, and there is a surprise. <br /> <br /> I understand that some movies have larger budgets than others. I have no problem with that. Unfortunately, science fiction movies, probably the most affected on a small budget, for obvious reasons. But one of the ways you can not, this film is the fact that almost every piece of each set of kinds of cheese and cheap. I mean, they could not even do it "look" okay? <br /> <br /> The other main reasons for this film are terrible when I watched the movie now, and know what to expect, I could just enjoy it for the cheese factor, but at the time, I was expecting a good film and did not have a clue about how awful it was actually in the end. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the experience was completed only in 85 minutes.
