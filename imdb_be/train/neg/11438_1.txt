If ever there was worse than comedy "Gray MattersÂ» I do not know about it. "Funny," The premise of the New York Jewish Comedy brothers Sam and Gray mistook for a couple and so decided to fix Sam's with a friend, only to find that Gray is equally attracted towards its goal - Charlie. Revelation that Gray secretly gay apparently only a surprise for her. There is a deeply offensive sequence weddings, deeply embarrassed "drunken act" by Moynahan and Graham, and the work to be confusing forest around the world for his woodenness Tom Cavanagh. Sissy Spacek shows a complete inability to do comedy and I want to cut it out of her resume. Molly Shannon plays a home is one of the lumpen carelessness. Only Alan Cumming speaks with some credit, but serious underemployment, and gave nothing with which to work. The whole catastrophe cement whimsical eye-rolling performance Graham climax with the penultimate scene where she wears a comic hat and coat, despite the scene is set in a lesbian bar. It is strange that this film was released one day he does not have a softening and should be avoided at all costs.
