Points is a good thing came to Brando as a farewell speech, because I do not want to think about it go for free money. Not that his supporters should remember him. <br /> <br /> Brando in recent years is more like Orson Welles and free money is a kind of film Welles would do, looking to finance their own work. Brando superintendent of the local prison, which is in the United States, when it is in a small rural area, as a rule, is the largest employer in the region. This gives the one who is responsible for a lot of influence. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it has one weakness, he embarks on his two twins only girl otherwise known as the daughter. Even if they get pregnant at the same time a couple of losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden Church, their hearts still belong to the Pope. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid, because Brando willing to give them a job in the prison, where they work in conditions not much better than the inmates. What you need to do, but to commit robbery of the train that passes through the area every so often the book used the money that will be burned by the Treasury. <br /> <br /> While the Free money there are some moments of humor, most of the time, it's quite a talent of all participants. Some of them include Donald Sutherland as well as the corrupt judges and Mira Sorvino as his stepdaughter, but straight arrow FBI agent. <br /> <br /> Of course, these people and other actors need to work with someone who many rate as the greatest American actor of the last century. If not for the presence of Brando, and it was about 40 years ago, the money will be available to play in the drive circuit in a red state America where the public can see how they are to be a satire. <br /> <br /> Or a weak attempt to make fun of them.
