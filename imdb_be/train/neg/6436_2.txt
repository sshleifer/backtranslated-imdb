I am a good person, so I gave the film 2 instead of a 1. It was, without doubt, the worst film I've seen in a long time. There was very little story and deeply interesting areas that have been affected by the fact that Jesus can really wanted us to know, were silent, and instead we got a heavy dose of visual sadistic punishment inflicted on our heroine (Arquette). All of the crucifix in the first 15 minutes it would be more humane as her character and audience. The action was just there and it was uninspired direction. And if I saw another drop of water or a dove flying toward the camera, I may have started to scream louder than Patricia.
