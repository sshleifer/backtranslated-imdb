Act well, beautiful women and beautiful men, so if you are looking for well-operated soft porn, this film is for you. Otherwise, you are wasting your time. The motivation of the main characters, in particular the eponymous lead, often a mystery. She could have simply told the truth - the truth, as presented in the film are not necessarily historical truth - and her lover would be deprived of the time in prison for a rape he did not commit. Was it to protect her father, who left unprepared, as it was when he impulsively triggered malicious lawsuit? Was it to protect itself, its reputation suddenly concern when unthinkable only her art, it seemed to matter? During the trial, this strong-willed woman turns into a mess in front of his eyes. On the other hand, her lover, who starts off as a narcissistic jerk becomes selfless hero during the trial. At least, his motivation is clear: he is sacrificing himself for the sake of love. Naturally, since no good deed should not go unpunished, we are told that she would never see it.
