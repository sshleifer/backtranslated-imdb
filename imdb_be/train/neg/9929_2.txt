Watching it, how to get the mackerel slammed in your face over and over again. Even when you thought, "This is a mackerel, of course, can not come around again," * slap * was there. I'm not sure what they think. It's kind of pilot I watched and asked: "And the actors know what they were convicted ships destined never to be in the series?" Not just black stereotypes, but the Swedish and Indian as well. And while the Â«Blazing Saddle" made these stereotypes in a mixture of comedy and embarrassment, these stereotypes were only very offensive. There was no story line, ending slapped on, and the jokes are not. However, if you are a student of comedy, watch the pilot, to see what you should not do.
