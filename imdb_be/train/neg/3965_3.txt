I think I agree that a lot of comments here must be fake. Even if the film is not necessarily a bad thing it is defined below average. «Dark Remains» Ghost mainly film with putting your own spirits and bad emotions chasing you. The film begins with a 2-story freely between the membranes that even later, are not connected with each other. Couple loses a child who is slashed in bed. They move in a country house, to leave the past and guess what ... a haunted house, look. From here on Dark Remains starts very slowly with some scary moments in reality (first performances ghost good and sequence torch also worked very well). Well, then ... The woman's daughter sees a ghost, the other ghosts of people killed in road accidents are or suicide, a person tries to solve the mystery of the house by a woman gets depressed, there are strange neighbors. Its pretty much all it was, but the premise with their own emotions is good, so that you are waiting for a twist. There's no twist, you just confuse the ghost stories of the history of the house, a strange neighbor, is absolutely senseless horrible prison and the dead daughter is thrown together with a photo-idea, which reminds me a lot of "pit." End of funny, because when you start and end of the movie is slow and piano music with its pretty lame to include some ghosts treasures at once, which look like a zombie movie, of course, only to return to the slow pacing and piano music. <br /> <br /> To make it short ... Dark Remains could be a good ghost horror story, if the script was not trying to go anywhere and come nowhere.Too many mushed together stories that just do not make any sense and contrary to the basic atmosphere of the film. And next ... please do not use an abandoned prison again. He was so worn off, and in this case does not even make sense at all. "Hey, there's this horrible prison in the mountain, allows you to shoot there." I think a lot of the ingredients in the dark remains were thrown into the mix as it is.
