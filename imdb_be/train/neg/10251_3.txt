A good deal of running around. Poorly conceived the enemy with very little difficulty. Scientist working in communication signals sent into space and receiving them, and is caught with aliens. Together with his beautiful wife, he breaks into their territory and are secrets about them. It becomes very treacherous in the process. Of course, he is given little choice in any case. There is a scene where he gives them what they want. This stupid movie with a lot of long stretches where little happens. The plot is not technically bad. It's just that we, as a rule, the next car, the journey through the forest, exploring the structure. This is what all the editing. I believe that history will not support the more. Not so much here.
