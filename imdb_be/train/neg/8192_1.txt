Well, I have to say that this film was so bad that I would go if I do not consider it to work. And worst of all, I would like to see it so much that I went all over the city, I paid $ 10 Parking twice because the newspaper ads were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy, he always does - the only time I've seen him play someone else was in that movie with John Travolta. In any case, the plot has the potential - it sounds great in preview, but it is filled completely ridiculous, predictable weaknesses of the turning section. And I was hoping that this will be one Christmas movie, where Christmas Waits' t have to be saved, and that Santa is not needed replacdmetn, but no. The only cool part was on a sled, and a small child bladck was the best character. I am sure that this film is great for young children, but for adults it is so lame that it's hard work, to sit through.
