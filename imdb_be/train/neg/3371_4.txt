Awesomely unlikely and silly trash that at least have some soothing, crisp posting pictures, but it is too incredible to generate much in the way of tension. I was kind of hoping that Stanwyck Sun make it back in time because, in fact, it has been difficult in the wet, in more ways than one, a husband, and she was an idiot child as well..why NOT escape from Meeker? But the nagging question remains..what kind of tree was that supposedly made from a piece of rotten when it pulled entirely swim? Stanwyck, always impeccably professional, doing the best she could with the material, but it is worn out.
