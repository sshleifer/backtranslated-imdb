In the US, very few films have been made about Rome that has not been established during the time of Julius Caesar, or shortly thereafter. sword and sandals epic Hollywood generally have a Christian theme, which makes it difficult to get in early Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule, and encountered some resistance in Hollywood, because it did not have Jesus in it) . <, Br /> <br /> It is interesting to see at least one picture, which not only holds until Caesar and Christ, but is set when Rome was only one city among many on the Italian peninsula, and only to overthrow the hated King Tarquin and formed Republic <br /> <br /> However, this is not a historical film. This Basques, and while the cost of production is not rock bottom, acting and characterization are cardboard. I can only imagine that the dialogue was similar to Italian, but with wooden English dub is very old-fashioned. I got some good laughs out of it in the first place. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many films of this genre, having missed most of the films of Hercules' 60s. It's funny to a point, but as the film goes, he gets a few sad <br /> <br /> One thing is certain. And if I saw this film when I was ten, I would have loved it. At this age, I went to do something with the Romans and swordfights it. So, at least, the film brought some memories of childhood.
