obviously have some talent attached, Maria Bello is always great. but it just makes me sick you time to reflect each character as someone to be hated, and exploit, then anyone can make a movie out of "interesting" stories. Well, I hope they get it out of their systems. unfortunately for the spectators, NO insight, no sensitivity, no context, and not really human. that everything would be fine, except that it has no humor, no horror, no context, and nothing constructive to say about this story it's trying to say. bad things happen, you sit and look at it, you do not care, so what? 99% of the time, "based on a true story" is unintentionally warning audiences. this means that the director and screenwriter are lazy and captured some of the events that they had heard of somewhere, so they just throw them on the screen and wait for that "real" nature of the story, to make the viewer feel something without filmmakers to to do any work. I hope they had a great time making this film. It stinks on ice.
