Um, my friends and I saw a movie based off the name alone. It's cute, though obviously he direction-- story and you know where the film will be in the first five minutes. My main argument with the story is that while it remains tolerant consistent, they never explain a lot of things for the characters. Alcoholic father, the mother overwhelmed, stressed-out sister ... it's a bad family, but aside from accidental mention of the sisters do not have any resolution. I was also confused as to the stage with bottles ... it seemed pretty random. <br /> <br /> Writing is a side issue ... the children were not bad actors, but the script left a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, that would be nice niche film was pushed aside for one or special effects, lame script and defiantly obvious plot.
