The site for the descent, if it really can be called a story, there are two notable events. One closer to the top - one at the end. Together these events constitute perhaps 5% of the total time of the movie. Everything (and I mean _everything_) mostly between full force director to fill minutes. I like shocking movies, I love dark movies and I do not get bothered by rough scene - but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy / dark (literally) of the scene without the storyline you have another thing coming. Rosary Dawson, one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here. And no, she does not get naked, not even in the version of NC-17, which I have seen. <br /> <br /> If you have a few hours to throw away and want to watch "The Descent", take a nap instead - you are probably more interesting dreams.
