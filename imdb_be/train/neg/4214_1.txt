Just spent a few hours watching it, and 80% of the time in complete disbelief, I can give this garbage turkey of the year award, is not a problem. To say that the story was incredibly a great humiliation. Frankly, I am lost for words to describe this is a complete tripe. Not only do the characters entirely without any semblance of originality (this sort of thing has been done much better in dozens of "serial killer movie"), but the action was heavy. For those who pay to see this, I hope you get your money back, for those who are paid to do it, I hope that you will give your money back. Believe me, people who have a lot of new releases that are out there much better. Go.
