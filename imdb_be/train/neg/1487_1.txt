Thanks to this film, I can now answer the question: "What is the worst movie you've ever seen?» <br /> <br /> I can not even think of second place, and I've seen some really bad movies. <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing works in this film. Name one element of any horror movie, and this movie fails. Frankly, I've seen better on YouTube. Here are some typical dialogue: <br /> <br /> «? Steve" "? Steve" "? Steve, it's you" "Steve, I'm not kidding," "Steve, this is not funny!" "Steve, are you there?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?" <br /> <br /> "ARggh !!!! Ahhhhhh !!!! Nooooooo!"
