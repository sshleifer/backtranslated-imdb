I must say that it was the worst movie Priyadarshan (releasing together much better kyonki, which was also his directorial venture), it does not contain any specific storyline and just focuses on the body show debuted on the actress and some silly comedy sequences. I think Priyadarshan is too much repeated in his comedy movie just as Govinda and David Dhawan has been done in the past, after giving some good artists, they went on to lose audiences.So it will be good for him to concentrate on the script and try some changes in his direction.Give us more herapheri-x and malamal weekly, instead of giving a dud as garam masala!
