Blazing Saddles! This is a fight between the two estranged brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), both of which can start a fire in the mind; they square off for the differences in childhood, with a nutty-free love Debra Winger caught in the middle. Directed by Glenn Gordon Caron (television talented for "moonlighting") suppresses dark textured comedy in the script Vince Gilligan with a presentation so slippery, the film reminds record with overly enthusiastic student of the film on the grant of fifteen million dollars, he has a prickly power large commercial functions, but formless style is not producing anything of the characters, with the exception of their kooky oddities. It's not even the characters, they plot the function. Slightly released in theaters, the film is a disaster, although, strictly as an example of the content of style it will look good. Winger is the only that stand out in a cast that looks really puzzled. * 1/2 ****
