This movie made me go. The name was perhaps the greatest idea I've ever heard. I thought it was an independent film about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the United States and a group of lonely survivors, unite, and plan to take out the zombies. DEAD wrong! It's about a psycho cop with a weakness for the murder of her female arrests gets what's coming to him as a zombie women package rise from their graves to get the proper place. As you can see, there is nothing about the nation or district involved. Where to start with the severity of the cinematic disaster caused by our nation. <br /> <br /> First, zombie woman look like a Victoria Secret model with dark eyeliner and pale face. Zombies, but meaningless, intelligent discussion, cannibalistic killing machine who eat from their primitive most basic needs? These zombies are women like walking and models of the runway, they say, as if they are in poor film noir, and do they act like real zombies. Of course, the absorption and killing there, but where disorder and a horrible deformity? Despite the fact that this is a very interesting concept, and perhaps most satire on the zombie genre, he makes fun of this genre, and asks the question, "why not be a zombie beautiful Vixen killing machine?" I would say that this film will be considered very bad indie film that was produced and made garage addicts. I would not recommend this movie to anyone that loves zombie genre too much, it is an insult and scary ?? even.
