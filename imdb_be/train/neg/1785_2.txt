.... And after watching this pile of crap you will not be surprised that it was not published <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> This is a terrible film by any standards, but when I show that it is one of the scariest movies that has the name of Stephen King in the credits you can begin to imagine how bad it is. The film begins with two characters staring open-mouthed at the scene of horror ".? My god What happened here "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />" I do not know, but they sure hate cats "* <br /> <br /> camera on the outside of the house, where hundreds of cats stretched dead and mutilated. Boy this guy is right and who is doing the cat hatred and subtraction, as it must be the police. Oh, wait a minute, he was a policeman, and when the film begins with a police officer making an oh so obvious observation you just know what you're going to watch a bad movie <br /> <br /> The reason that sleepwalkers it's bad that it is very illogical and confusing. We at NES tse all find out the title of monster need the blood of virgins in order to survive they are not better looking virgin in the middle of the west of the Bible Belt, and not the American coastal town Having said that, at least we know the motives of monsters -.? This is the only thing we know. we may never know how they are able to change the shape or able to make cars become invisible and that the banks with the end, which seems to have been stolen from the terminator. Monster mother walks murder several police officers with their bare hands or blowing their release by the police hand gun (!), But if it is a monster breed safe from police firepower so why beings need the ability to change shape or become invisible? The death of beings equally badly thought out, as there is a massive attack killed domestic cats. If they can be killed by cats, why not kill all the monsters cats that lay around the garden? There was a whole horde Moggies sit around, but monsters have never thought about killing them. I believe that this is so the production team can come up with the ending. It was then that they started to film my complaint lies <br /> <br /> We were treated to a few scenes where the famous horror movie directors like John Landis, Clive Barker and Stephen King even make cameos. I think the reason for this is because every time struggling unknown actor read the script, they immediately decided that no matter what, they will not appear in the movie is so bad Stephen King had phone to his friends terrified to fill out the cast. That's how bad it lunatics <br /> <br /> * Incredible as it seems, it's not the worst line in the film. The worst line - "This cat saved my life"
