Serial killer dies in a blizzard and gets mutated into evil twin Frosty the snowman. Then goes on killing spree. Interesting story. It sounds scary. And it's scary. If you are five years old. Otherwise, it's kind of cheesy. I saw it on cable, and I'm glad I did not pay money to see it. It has all the charm and style of a low-budget film that can become a cult film. I'm sure he has a loyal fan somewhere. I'm just not the case. Despite the fact that I did not like the movie as a whole, there were some scenes which I found amusing. Such as bath scene and the scene after the explosion, with reference to Picasso. In addition, it was nice to watch the many ways the characters are trying to kill Jack, and he just does not seem to want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" good low-budget B-movie comedy, but the bad low-budget B-movie horror.
