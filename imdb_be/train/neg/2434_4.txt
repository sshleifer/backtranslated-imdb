Realistic film, of course, except that the characters are not like scary. If Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels bad ... but it does not look like. That's why I do not like his performance in this film. Meanwhile Berenger plays a soldier again. Nothing good thrill, realistic sequence. Not always shooting, then there is one big thing. Good shot. I hate the sequence of the helicopter, because only one terrorist killing almost all marine bunch ... I give it ** and a half out of *****
