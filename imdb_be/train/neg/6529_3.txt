This film is funny and painful at the same time. «Cinemagic» almost gave me a seizure. Despite the fact that they have in mind, «Cinemagic» not some innovative technical procedure. It was "designed" by accident, and they used it, because it is masked by the fact that they are "monsters" have been so stupid, that look. I also do not think it's a coincidence that the writer Sid «Pink». <br /> <br /> This film is good for a laugh, if you really are looking for a film shot for 9 days at $ 200,000. It is entertaining; at least I can say about it. Bat / rat / spider nail.
