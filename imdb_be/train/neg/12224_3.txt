Barbra Streisand directs and stars in this very Jewish history. <br /> <br /> In order to have a chance to receive an education, Babs enthusiastically disguises herself as a boy, which is not the most difficult, as it already looks like a boy, anyway. In her new school, she meets a lot of classmates men who have no problem at all, believing that it guy. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the best of the many moments of unintentional humor when male friend Babs' thinks she's a man, but his fingers, "it" on the ground, sitting on top of "his", and looks lovingly into their "own" eyes .... * laugh * <br /> <br /> mediocre film. Conspicuous history of anything particularly interesting.
