After I watched this movie, I came to the IMDb and read some of the reviews that likened it to Lost In Translation LITE. When I read that I immediately observers could see the point. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bad attempt at a similar theme. Interestingly, the film format is almost identical, but PACING incredibly different. "10 Items» sent to the viewer through the time line of the film 1 a day, while a better plan «Lost In ...», seems to stretch for a few long days. <br /> <br /> I m sure some people will see it, because he has Morgan Freeman, will be disappointed. I think his best roles are now-a-days supporting roles in major blockbusters, not starring in the sub- $ 10mil film in limited edition and indie films.
