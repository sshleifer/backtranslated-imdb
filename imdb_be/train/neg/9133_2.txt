This is strictly a review of the pilot episode, as it appears on DVD <br /> <br /> TV moved from his life in 1981, so I have never followed a series or any part of it. - it means that I have immunity to the nostalgic charm that is Moonlighting have to most reviewers. <br /> <br /> (possible spoiler warning) <br /> <br /> The pilot combination is your basic "caveman meets fluffballÂ» yarns, where the "magic" full-blooded man, he manipulates a vicious woman in realizing it really wants and needs. Premises that "wit" script based on, must have felt stale around 1950. It also contains some extremely bad in writing, as in the scene where Maddy demolish the furniture instead of shooting the villain, strictly in order to prove to himself inept woman has It needs man's help. <br /> <br /> I often feel that Susan Faludi is responding in the male chauvinist plot in just entertainment, but in this particular case, I'm with her - Moonlighting a clearance stamped on it. <br /> <br /> In one sense, however, this DVD is a must for all serious fans of Bruce Willis: In addition to the pilot, it contains a screen test, Willis landed a job. Both functions show the extent to which Willis strange acting abilities developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, in the country). Impressive! <br /> <br /> Appraisal (I _am_ Bruce Willis fan): 2 out of 10
