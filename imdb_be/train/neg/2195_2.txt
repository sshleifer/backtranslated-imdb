Brain It would not have died a horrible piece of film that rots from the opening credits. It has all the classic signs of being unwell: unbelieveable story, horrible acting, sets, and low-grade lighting. The plot is as follows: If the doctor and his fiancee get into an accident, she gets beheaded, and he raises his head and takes her to his laboratory, where he sets up his head in a pan with a special liquid, which keeps him alive. Bet Virgnina Leath, who played her head in a pot had to spend a lot of time to wear this uncomfortable pan around her neck and squatted under the table. In any case, the doctor tries to find her a new body, and employs two strippers that she could choose one to her new body. Bad all the way through, so badly torn Mystery Science Theater 3000.
