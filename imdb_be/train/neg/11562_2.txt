A wealthy widower Steffna (as Alan Cunningham) is a sadomasochistic lover, and a British Lord. He brings a sexy red-haired woman to his castle, where he whips and killing them. Black-loaded stripper Erika Blanc (Susan) runs off temporarily. Mr. Steffen's wife pursues "Evelyn", who died in childbirth. As therapy, he decides to marry again, after a meeting with pretty blonde Marina Malfatti (Gladys). By the end of the film, they had to dig a few graves. "The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave" is a great title, at least. <br /> <br /> ** La Notte Che Evelyn USCI Dali Tomba (1971) Miralem ~ Anthony Steffen, Marina Malfatti, Erika Blanc
