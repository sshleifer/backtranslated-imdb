Not because I thought Caligula have to exclude the film halfway through .... but then this, I was only 15 minutes, when I reviewed. Unfortunately, I did it all the way through. Make sure that you do not know. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that fear is the Cradle Mountain or shocking or frightening or scary or sexy. Is that not any of these things, but he so desperately wants to be all of them. Instead, it's boring, banal, ordinary, predictable, and without exception poorly executed (shot on video, high school special effects, there is no point even the main visual narrative, the dialogue barely audible ... not that it's worth hearing, though). <, Br /> <br /> This film is proof for the argument that even straight to video distributors must draw a line in the sand somewhere.
