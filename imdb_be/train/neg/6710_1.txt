I have seen more than 1,000 films, and this one stands out as one of the worst films I have ever seen. It's a shame that they had to tie the trash to the angels 1963 song "My boyfriend Beck." If you have to make a choice between viewing the film and painful dental work, I would suggest that dental work.
