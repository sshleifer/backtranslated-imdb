I hated it. If you think that all the south stupid, morally bankrupt, silly, tough, a religious nut, or a child molester, this film may be for you. Every poor and seemingly ignorant. In one scene, two older men talk in a general store and one mentions that he molested a set of sisters before they could tie their shoes. The man seemed to be proud of my actions, and another man, apparently took this as a normal part of life. Very good. A teenage girl walking on country roads in search of his sister, and no one offers to help her - despite the obvious lameness and lack of food and water (without a backpack, etc.). Strathairn character is not only completely disgusting and slimy, but he showed that the religious believer (typical for Hollywood) reflects the vile nature of Christians. The scene in the film is very similar to the end of the Cape Fear (one of DeNiro) - Bible verses, which gushes the bad guys. I'm from the Great Northwest, but I found this film offensive because of the wonderful people that I know who is NC, WV, AL, MS, Kentucky, Tennessee, and etc.
