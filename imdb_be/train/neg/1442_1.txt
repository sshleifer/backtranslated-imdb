This is the worst imaginable shit. Haggard novel is very interesting and dramatic. The creators of this movie is not worthless to follow him closely. Well, the old stories are not saints, and to make free versions of their fine with me, if you have ideas of their own. If all you can do is to change things and replace them uninteresting and watered down clich√©s should adhere to the original. If they did, that this film would have been at least twice as good, even with the worst actors, and when shooting in the studio with huts made of cardboard. But there is no representation at all just tired. It must be purchased or viewed only by collectors of Victorian novels made into movies. <br /> <br /> Just a hint, not a spoiler, I think that those of you who have read the novel to understand what happened and what you can expect if you decide to watch it on TV, or - God forbid - to spend money to buy it. Gagool old witch villain in the book and a precursor of Gollum was transformed into a beautiful gal!
