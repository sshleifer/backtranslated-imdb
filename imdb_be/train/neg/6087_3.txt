This film was not nearly as dreary as I expected it would be. There are a few seconds of brightness in this somewhat idiotic hardcore UFO conspiracy paranoia festival. Most of the action is mediocre, but fairly typical for the 1970s in the style of the material has a lot of pregnant pauses. Photographer and model witnessed some strange habits in the forest and soon fall victim to the same habits. UFOs spotted, more people disappear - but it's aliens or ultra-secret group of our government's cover-up guys? Quickly enough, the reporter and the "UFO" (apparently modeled on the character of the writer and director) are drawn into the unraveling of grief and become a target for ultra-secret agents, which are terrible, they are unlikely and stupid. Then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The film is, as expected, has the same meaning as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but it is worth to pay tribute for yourself so seriously. OK camera work for the low-budget film, Shagan pretty good, stupid and ridiculous scenario, and there is a continuity problems that are fun to watch. That a few seconds the light I say? Honestly, I can not tell you, without writing a spoiler. Suffice it to say that at the end of the film, at least, should fast forward if you can not take the middle.
