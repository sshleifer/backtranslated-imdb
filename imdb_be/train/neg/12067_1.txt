Do you know that the movie will not be good if John Carradine says (aka reading the script and plot synopsis) on the funeral procession of his character, just 5 minutes in the movie. The narrative of the last will and testament of his character. He states that his estate will be divided between his 4 children and servants. Children must share $ 136000000 equally, but if it dies, that share is divided among the remains. When all the children have to die, it will be distributed among the servants. In order to be eligible, they must live in the family estate for a week. It sounds like the plot of a typical reality show. <br /> <br /> There is little subtext, as in nature deans. They are powerful and highly unhappy family, but the real problem starts with the drowning dog. Since the opening voice-over, John Carradine you expect this film will lead to Machiavelli cat and mouse with the turning end. <br /> <br /> This journey painfully slow and pointless. We trudge through the minutes of watching people sitting around, playing pool, throwing darts, misuse "through a bowl of fish" shot, dramatic conversation between a man wearing a silk tie, constant quarrels, ridiculous circus music, bizarre Flashbacks remind fake-German expressionist aesthetic horror 4th grade and heaps dramatic replays. All this inevitably leads to the expected and ungratifying end. You will be happy, still alive, but the pain may be too great to bear alone. The proportion of children share. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
