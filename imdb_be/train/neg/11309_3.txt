Bad plot (although good for B-movie), a good fast paced fight scenes, at most 5 out of 10. But something has always bothered me about this film: how come never says Mariska Hargitay? In the TV version, she shared a few intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, even kissing in the garden. However, in the regular (video) version, the majority of her scenes are cut out, and she never spoke at all. It bothers me because it not only removes the female (although template) point-to-review for the film, but also makes the last shot, it seems terrible. This film would have been better if they had kept her in the scene, because in those scenes, at least, it has a face, one that undercuts any Speakman said.
