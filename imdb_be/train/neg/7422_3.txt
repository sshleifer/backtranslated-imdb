Well, I could nt get into the story, but that's just me maybe. Sluggish camera-motion at times, however, this film was magical vintage quality.The current is genuine and sometimes entertaining with a random chase sequence featuring scantily clad ladies, which was nice. The culmination of the confused and inconsistent, but ... wrong riveting, Thanx in Stella Stevens. <br /> <br /> Tricks interesting, especially because of the 70 Las Vegas background. There are a few jerky hand-held camera movement at the end, that keep me guessing for a while. But I do not think I'll be chasing DVD just yet.
