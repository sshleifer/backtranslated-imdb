Sadly Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) get an advance on inheritance. They use the money to go traveling. Their life has become more interesting, as they begin a relationship with an exotic Betty Amann (Mr Kendall) and single Percy Mormon (for Mrs. Barry). But they are boring as they were before. Perhaps tired of director Alfred Hitchcock is trying to revive the well-titled (cited in the film, from Shakespeare's "The Tempest") "Rich and Strange", ordering some camera tricks. Opening a tribute to King Vidor «The Crowd» is the highlight. Low temperature steam can be dining in Chinese prepared by the cat. <br /> <br /> *** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) ~ Alfred Hitchcock Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Mormon, Elsie Randolph
