To be fair, they did what they could with a budget of five shillings and sixpence, but the dialogue was more than 9lbs with emmental cheese and CGI was a bit old hat now. maybe if someone from the actors were not so perfectly carved out of granite that would make the movie a little better too .. To say that it was awful to do this film the wrong service, if you want to see something that is absolutely disgusting you have to sit down and spend a couple of hours of your life watching "crescent" that is, against Su numbingly awful it really well (several large alcoholic beverages are deriguer, though. Either way, I enjoyed this film and it should be worth a look, even if you do n e have seen just about anything along the lines of "Jurassic Park, The Lost World," or "Apocalypse" is not expected.
