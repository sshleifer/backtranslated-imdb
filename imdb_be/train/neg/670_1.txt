Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow), who chases psycho killer tries to kill her on her prom night. And thus killing her family, friends and her enemies. <br /> <br /> Now, before I begin, let me say, you're tired of the movies rated PG-13 horror that were not terribly lately. Are you tired of stupid dialogue girl "Oh my god" and talk about girls' stuff. And you're really tired of the girls in a relationship, and then cry. And the last thing you're tired of the US remake Asia, Japanese and Chinese films. This is largely sums up the prom night, but I still have not been made from the review. <br /> <br /> the only reason to see "Prom night" is a crack of laughter murder. If not, then do not see the prom night. you You never see the kill only hear the cry, and you will see the blood on the wall. and by the way, the deaths are the floor tarats like 24/7. So not only do not they scary, but it is offensive. By the time I met throwing I think I was ready to give up. Too much girl talk, talk too much guy and a lot of "Oh, damn. this is our final evening. I understand that it's fun, but seriously it's too much to ask, do not focus. <br /> <br /> If I had to put the prom night in the list of the worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films, I would be the first too. I would not be surprised if it gets released on DVD cheaply and quickly. Seriously, do not waste money or time for the faint of action, cheap scares and "Night, to die for" watching the film. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. (PS If I could give the film zero stars I would).
