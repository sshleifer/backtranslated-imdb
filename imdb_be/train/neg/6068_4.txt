Vodka Lemon charming, but very unevenly Arminian film that will delight and some other boring. Although it is well handled, the movie has no real "Zing", relying instead on the many scenes that seem commonplace discerning art-house audience. The film contains a few moments of pure cinematic brilliance, unfortunately, they deserve a film worthy of their genius. Too dark to be a black comedy and serious drama to light, Vodka Lemon will leave a lot of opinions disoriented and end up dissatisfied. You may laugh, but these moments will be few and far between on the background of the sea washed away the snow filled landscapes and seemingly endless series of bus trips. Noble effort ultimately made due to the lack of narrative cohesion.
