The fact that a large part of the budget for this allegedly went on the list of heavy-duty cast should not matter when it was staged with flair and imagination, some sympathy for the satirical intent of the original. Instead, we get ridiculously bad sequence of songs and dances depicting picturesque beggars and whores, and the final disposition made by the left, to show the action took place on the stage of the music hall, appropriately enough for the production of which is greater than Lionel "OliverÂ» Blair than Brecht. Acting talent shamefully abused: Migenes and Walters are good, but do not try very hard: Migenes at least, has a beautiful voice and a certain feeling for the material. Julia looks perfect as Mack, but struggles with nature, a straitjacket on fake juicy accent. Peachum Harris strikingly brought Polly brutal. Adaptation of the text, script and music are often uncomfortable: it was a bad move on bowdlerised primed film version of the Broadway Blitssteyn Mark, but at least his words were singable, unlike most that are interpolated in the gestures of loyalty. And the attempt to overcome the low budget shooting in claustrophobic corners on the sets of fog enveloped lit in bright blue and orange, as though some bargain Storari fails completely - the film looks cheap, the bad and carelessly done. Disgraceful.
