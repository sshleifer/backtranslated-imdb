The mystery is solved very early, and the film becomes a direct romance. I almost stopped watching it after 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and at the first break. My husband, who is a fan of Hallmark & ​​Lifetime, gave at the first break. <br /> <br /> Forest River is a company town - the main business Aikens decorations that make all sorts of holiday decorations.The patriarch company recently died, so that the company's future may be in question. We soon meet Noel, who would prefer to be on Wall Street than Main Street, and mysterious Justin, who gets a date with Noel after a big snowman is pumping in Justins car accident. Once we meet Alison Aikens, doing due diligence to the Council, we have our plant history. <br /> <br /> If you can not beat all the story arcs of the first commercial break, you have not seen enough this type of holiday movie. Maybe it's a good thing.
