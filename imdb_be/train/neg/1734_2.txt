I'm a big fan of old westerns, and I do not believe that Hollywood is able to capture its old glory. But even Rhonda Fleming and Stewart Granger can help this film in 1957 which bears almost all the banal characteristics westerns reformed disappointed was a good guy. fell, but a virtuous woman, bigoted citizens, who should refer to the arrow in order to save, etc. I can not help but notice the author's name and the young "actor" who plays the son of Granger. Any nepotism there? I've seen better acting in high school plays. Chill Wills plays a cartoon characterization of cold Wills. Have I reached the 1,000 words yet?
