This film is bad. I do not just mean "bad", as in; "About script was bad," or; "To act in this scene was bad" ..... I mean bad as someone should be held criminally responsible for the imposition of this unmitigated pile of steaming CRUD on an unsuspecting public. I will not even call it an explanation (earth ??), if I can refer to it as that.I can think of only one other time in more than 40 years watching a movie, I found the need to vent spleen in may to a movie. I mean, after all, no one does not go deliberately to make a bad movie, is not it? well, yes. it seems that they making ... and guilty persons writer / director Ulli Lommel. But the worst thing is that actually Blockbusters rent it for your customers! Please note. Leave that shit where it belongs. Hang on a shelf gathering dust.
