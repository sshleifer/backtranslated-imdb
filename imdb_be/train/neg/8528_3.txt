What is written on the poster: "At birth he was given 6 years to live ... At 34 he's taking a journey of a lifetime." Ami American-born Israeli, who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy disease at the age of one year. At the age of 34 years, after love for him 22 years caregiver not going well, he decided to come to the US to face the doctor, who said that he would only have 6 years to live. He wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive, and the weight of 39 pounds. Why? Your guess is as good as mine, even I have seen this film. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this brave to live if all that he can move his left index finger, but why he had so much anger towards the doctor who diagnosed his illness 34 years ago? His doctor just said to my mother that on the basis of medical history, the people with his illness would not live long. What is the point of it appears on the old doctor's door for? Why is tracking down the old doctor in the US is a journey of his life? There are so many things that we could be interested in the life of Amy: how can he do these animations with movement of just one finger? How can he go through daily life while totally dependent on others? He lived with his prediction of a doctor? How does he deal emotionally when other people look at it as look at a strange creature? The film does not tell us any of this. Instead, the director got a van and set up a trip to s, to point to the door of his old doctor to show him that he is still alive. I thought it was a joke.
