Science film fright work well it must be truly original and very good retelling. This film is neither. Of course, there are pseudo-original twist that guy is killing people because of the toxin and not due to illness, but it is very slight twist. There is a government conspiracy angle, the Crusaders hero who has personal experience ... <br /> <br /> And one real drawback of this film is that the contaminated person has no pathos. Although the character of the script to be someone who should feel sorry that he is not. Without pity the movie makes no sense. The other characters are stereotyped because they are funny. In podagovorah they are confusing and annoying. And the saddest thing is that the film is too flat even have pretended like material. To make a film of 45 minutes is short, and it may be worth a look.
