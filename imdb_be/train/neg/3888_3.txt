I began to melt, so I'll make this review short and sweet as possible. <br /> <br /> There's this astronaut, and he goes into a spaceship with two other guys, ya know? Except something happened that exposed him to radiation, and then when they come back ... well, it does not matter what happened to the other guys, but our astronaut began to melt! No, not just burn, but MELT! As in ice cream cone in July! Well, OK, maybe not so fast, but I know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he gets all red and sticky, and the fact that it melts makes it really wisely. I believe that he also checked the "melting man" leadership, because suddenly he knows that in order to keep from completely melts, it should eat human flesh, so he starts to tear people apart. <br /> <br /> There are other characters, but in the movie where a man melts and thaws and melts (and melting), you really need another? What is important is who he will chew on, and what will be left of them? How long it will take just melt anything for him? Why this film was made in the first place? Where did they get the money? If you fall asleep while watching it? <br /> <br /> I almost melted, but I still have enough time to tell you that this film is terribly boring, despite the fact that the idea is really cool and kind of gross. Makeup neat, but everything else ... SPLAT
