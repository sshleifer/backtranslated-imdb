Störtebeker really one of the worst TV mini-series ever made on this planet <br /> <br /> Act unbearable and historical background, mostly nonsense :. Just two examples: Visby was shown as a village of three houses, instead it was the main city at this time, it's best days have already passed. Second, never Hamburg would not be the city, taking care of the pirates in the Baltic Sea. Hamburg did not have access to the Baltic Sea, the main town at the time was Lübeck <br /> <br /> But the worst thing that :. Direction! As an amateur, this guy would be allowed to direct a film like this? Impossible! There was not a single credible scenes it fights were funny, and I could not help but laugh at the most severe stages. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how a major television station could be so incompetent.
