No matter what anyone tells you, that is not the mere fact that the word "ownership" in the film circles - such as "? What possessed you the green light to this film," Religion has nothing to do with him, but common sense does. That is, if your head is clear, and you are of sound mind to make a decision. <br /> <br /> On many levels, I tried to rationalize, where this film will entertain .... or even interested in the average consumer. Star? History? The unique idea? Buddy movie that kids will love with a dinosaur and a black woman? Oh, my God! I am sure that, when it was the "idea", it sounded good. But somewhere in the development process ... someone had to show where this idea could not be translated into a part of the entertainment of those who would like to see or pay for ... if they were not very deep under the influence of alcohol or drugs and saw the others could not see. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's a complete mess. Mess, a mess -. (? What story) sin and confusion <br /> <br /> Who cares about the plot and others. Whoopi got paid, but I would be embarrassed to take it. I very much hope that she fired her agent / manager / publicist on this course of career. Obviously not, she continued to make more bad movies. And more bad films. Garden.
