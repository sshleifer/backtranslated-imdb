It is a shame, a shame that the outstanding actor, such as Joseph Fiennes afford to be cast in this part of the unfortunate stupidity. The film was not only bad, but down right awful and not sacrifice quality. The plot (there was one?) Did not seem to go no where. Russian played stupid to kill or be killed game and other actors should be invalidated for their pathetic performances. I gave up about 3/4 of the way through and turned it off. A "1" for the terrible only because there is nothing lower. Do not waste your time on this, you will not miss a thing.
