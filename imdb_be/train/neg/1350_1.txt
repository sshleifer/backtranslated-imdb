This film basically deals with the inspectors nuts arch-nemesis Dr. Clough, who has returned after many years to this peaceful city of Metropolis. Clos plan is a foil Gadget once and for all with the help of a new "coolÂ» crimefighter, to help destroy the popular gadget. Unfortunately, the film fails miserably, the series was great, but it was revived after almost 20 years, with tragic consequences. Without the voice of Don Adams as Inspector Gadget, he just does not cut it anymore; Dr. Claw is not only visually less scary, but it sounds like a wrestler with a cold, frightening than its original self. Of course, this is a children's movie, but the plot is so painfully weak (forbid I mention the animation), it pales in comparison to the original series. Someone decided updated Penny, and bring her up to speed two decades, it now has some quasi-punk rebellious style of clothes and do not play half of the role that it did in the series. In Gadgetmobile negotiations, as well as including an angle station, which focuses all the talking cars. Maybe I'm just a kid who liked to show who's grown weary, but I thought it was a live-action version was more pain than I could, but now they go and the spring of this complete erosion of the quality of the TV series to the deputy. This is more than I can take.
