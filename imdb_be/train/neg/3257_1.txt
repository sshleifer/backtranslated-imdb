After seeing the movie first question that arises in my mind was: Is this to be ironic or not? Having read a few comments about the character of Doc Savage and the comic book series, I knew that this film was not supposed to be ironic. Thus, the story tells us about the US-American super-Doc salvation South American republic from evil. It sounds like a typical story. But it comes so unrealistic way that it becomes funny. Mandatory end of the battle shows the worst presentation of martial arts I have ever seen. The film may be of interest to designers of low-budget film as a bad example.
