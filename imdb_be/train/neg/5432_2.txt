Battleship sinking ... He survived, hanging on a nearby raft, do not sit there doing nothing until we go to every one of them minds to a series of long flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Even if the name of Noel Rabbit is the only one that you have noticed in the credits, all this cinematic in it due to Lean. And technically, it's very good. David Lean films just knew from the get go. There are many moments where he studied Rabbit dialogue ranks second visual sense of Lean is central. Try soldiers got off the ship closer to the end, and that the whole scene; tracking shot toward singing hymns, the scene where we are inside the house, which gets bombed. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. It is completely wooden, Sun showing emotion, nature and mankind. You can see it in his eyes that he is not really listening to what the other says singer, he is just waiting for them to finish so he could pop out its own line. <br /> <br /> 7/10. <, Br /> <br /> His episodic, slightly repetitive, and retrospective crush history: no history of central, they advance, just to give a general understanding of the characters. However, its interesting movie worth seeing - and a good debut Lean. It is not very deep or penetrating the film, and it's definitely a propaganda film, but it is also a showcase Lean editing skills - it's all about how the pieces are put together.
