How could 4 of 16 previous voters give this movie 10? As can be more than half of voters precede give it a 7 or higher? Who is there to vote for? I can only assume that it is primarily children - very young children. The fact that this is a bad movie in all respects. History stupid; acting is difficult even to think, how to act; characterless characters; and the dialogue is terrible. I saw this one rainy day on the channel Sci-Fi. The sad case, if it ever relay, I suggest you read a book instead.
