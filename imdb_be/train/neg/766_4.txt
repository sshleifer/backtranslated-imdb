Every time a person familiar story Columbo plot (colorful murderer commits a crime, the killer smokes Columbo, Columbo becomes a pest in the process), the authors somehow never able to match the quality and interest of most of the traditional episodes. This episode deviates in an extreme case, and the result was a major flop <br /> <br /> Believe:.? Columbo is not worth the villain to the end !! <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was tempted to turn it on for about two-thirds through. <br /> <br /> So, the victim, the self-appointed reviewers, we do !!!
