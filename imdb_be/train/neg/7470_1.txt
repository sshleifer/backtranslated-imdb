In São Paulo, the upper middle class teenagers Cristiano Chico and Gabriel just entered the university and on the eve of the class, they go to a party with drugs and booze. The next day, after their classes, Cristiano date of the previous night came to his house and three friends rape a girl. Girl dies, they panic and decide to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother arrives, startles with Gabriel and rolls on the stairs, breaking her neck. The trio decides to lose and burn the corpses in the landfill, and at night other tragedies. <br /> <br /> controversy and the infamous «Cama de Gato" is overpriced pretentious crap about youth alienation, and by far the worst Brazilian film that I have seen for many years together. Deep, dark and tragic story is really black humor comedy of bad taste. The script is not funny, blunt lines and dialogue, and sad, manipulative and silly scenes from interviews with teenage morons at the beginning and the end. Acting is not terrible, apparently, with a lot of improvisation, but not talent, and I was disappointed by the presence of long-term Kaya pull the trash. Luggage framing, cinematography and publication are amateurish and very low quality. The sound is terrible, and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses say (probably a plus, since this film sucks). Gang bang is very realistic and is used to promote this mediocre film in a very poor marketing of sex exploitation. . My voice is one (terrible) <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ( "Cat Bed")
