Vincente Minnelli films usually worth your time; Meet Me in St. Louis, Bad and the Beautiful. I was waiting for this movie with a great interest. But what a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Some ran to a scene after scene do not go places fatalism. Sinatra is a sad sack, returned from the war to find disappointment of family relationships, Floozy disappointment hangs on it, disappointing lives in digging like Hal convinces him to finish his frustration draft letter. The film has a great dramatic finish in which disappointing villain catches Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens. Sequences for tensioning filled, but Minnelli Sun Hitchcock; He becomes so draw pretty colors, it does not see, the scene is wheezing cliche and the characters are so thinly drawn and poorly developed, we do not particularly care what they shoot. (Especially MacClane) But this is the only real movie project. Otherwise, we look at constipation characters standing around bars and lounges Getting on your nerves one each for two hours. Hell is other people, apparently. <br /> <br /> There's nothing going on in this movie. The dilemma of the soldiers returned to the displacement and indifference after WW2 handled more deftly in "The Best Years of Our Lives." And any of the two products of Inga, "Splendor in the Grass" and "Picnic" covers the despair being trapped in dead-end of the city, with a much more poignance.
