Maya woman without any interest. She just wants her life and wonders why she does not feel fulfilled. This could be an interesting topic. This must be a good story, a good setting and good dialogue. It does not have any of them. This film is very sad. There is only the length of and not just menopause climaxes.The not Shah Rukh Khan. But even though I'm a big fan of his, I could not stand this film. Even he can not make this movie, which comes out. The film is not as bad as the «King Uncle», and if you are in the Arthouse fan or as it slowly, you could possibly enjoy. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it is not eye-catching. My advice: Either do not look.
