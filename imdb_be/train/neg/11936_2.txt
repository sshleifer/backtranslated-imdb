This film is really abnormal. There really is nothing good I can say about it, except for moral truth manifested in the climax of the film in relation to people in the area involved in the fight against crime. Besides all this, the film had nothing: no good shots, no good action, and is not a good scenario. I give this film F and 2 out of 10.
