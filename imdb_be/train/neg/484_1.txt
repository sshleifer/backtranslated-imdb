I felt disgusted with this film. No, it's not because of the graphic scenes of sex, it was because he destroyed the image of Gentileschi. This film does not have a lot of truth about her and her work. It shows a piece of art that she made (Judith Beheading Holofernese), but it shows that, when introduced as evidence in a court of rape, when she did not dye her first Judith for a year after the trial. <br /> <br /> I do not know if you got it from the film, probably not, Tassi was not a noble character. He raped Artemisia. This is not love, it was rape. He did not claim to make false accusations of rape, to stop her from suffering, while she was tortured. According to transcripts of rape, he went on to say that he never knew the flesh wormwood (he had sex with) while she says over and over again, "It's true." <br /> <br /> I urge all of you people to go out and find the real wormwood and see what it is really about. Nha base their knowledge on this fictional film. I encourage you to do some research, wormwood really has an interesting history behind it and some of the amazing works of art. <br /> <br /> If you do not see the movie, but to know the true story of Artemisia.
