The story was different angle that intrigued me enough to buy a previously viewed VHS sight-unseen. It was a mistake <br /> <br /> In what could be a very good story. - of people severely injured in the hospital, as well as their different personalities - quickly turned into a very layman soap opera with unlikeable characters <br. /> <br /> we have "Blossom" (William Forsythe), the stereotype of a racist white man, who says that the F-word every other sentence and so mean they did not give it a name in the film. He was very fun to be around. Then, there are «Raymond Hill» (Wesley Snipes), fast-talking womanizer. Snipes should like this to quickly say "hip" arrogant role because he has played in some of them, as in the "white men can not jump". Then the sweet Helen Hunt plays "Anna" that great caring, loving person who has false romance with the lead character in the movie, "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). <br /> <br /> Yes, it is a touching, feel good type thing. It just makes my heart melt seeing these lovely people. But if you are one of those who love raunchy symbols indicating unscrupulous people in this sloppy movie ..... you might actually like it! Add a dose of Hollywood political correctness, and there you go! What more could anyone want?
