A film about Sir Christopher Strong (MP - Member of Parliament - played by Colin Clive) and his love affair with Amelia Earhart as the character played by Katharine Hepburn. Until they met, he was very devoted to her husband, but when he met a strange but exciting Hepburn, he "could not help themselves" and they fell in love. You can tell because they watch a lot of space in and talk endlessly about how painful their unrequited love. Frankly, it's terribly dated and almost impossible to watch a movie. Part of the problem lies in the fact that during the Pre-Code, movies idealize adultery were very common. In addition, even if you take it morally suspicious object full richness of dialogue to make it sound like a romance novel of the nineteenth century ... very bad at it. Sticky and difficult to love the characters (after all, the wife of Clive nice lady and made no any harm) make it one big waste of time. On the single interesting aspect of this film Hepburn wears a suit in the early scene where she is dressed in a suit moth! You have to see it to believe it - and it looks like one of Bugaloos (a little-known, but fitting link).
