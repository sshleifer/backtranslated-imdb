World's biggest inside joke. The world's largest, most exclusive joke. <br /> <br /> Emulation cheeky humor and "everyman" of office space, the film driving appeal of this movie in the ground, making the humor in such a way that it will only be correctly assessed the referents of writing a book. Spectators are asked to take on the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary and then empathize with the painfully stupid hero. <br /> <br /> The entire film focuses on the legal secretaries to find free time listening to music and writing a novel while working. It is his goal. You can not imagine the slap he said to the audience when (about halfway) they learn that he had a job that fits all three of these criteria, and then transmits it UP! Director and screenwriter (Jacob and Josh kornblut Kornblut) to completely remove the motivation of the audience to empathize or even find entertaining character who previously relieved that he complains about their absence. <br /> <br /> Besides the main stumbling block, a legal secretary insider humor fails, because they need to be explained clearly the audience every time they happen. Without these derogations, the audience would not notice anything particularly surprising. Humor is only effective if it is not necessary to carefully explain to the audience that it's ridiculous.
