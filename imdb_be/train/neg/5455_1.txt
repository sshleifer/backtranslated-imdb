I saw this part of the work on the film festival in CA. My God, that was the director thinking? Film professor should use this film as an example of what NOT to do when making a short film. Firstly, this project has absolutely no sense. The film is set in part in «Waystation», some stupid unleavened bar in the middle of nowhere, where in fact nothing happens. <br /> <br /> action goes bad. So bad, in fact, that I almost thought it was a comedy. The leading actress Julia Reading step following procedure in the majority of amateur porn. There are one or two decent performances, including children, who have played James, and Fenner, but this is how the director had no clue on how to work or use it tragedians. The only thing worse than the action was a dialogue, which borders on the absurd. The author (who I believe is also the director) writes each character as they audition for villain of comic books. <br /> <br /> The total cost of the product is quite good, but to be honest, with the film's bad it's easy to lose sight of it. Posing pretty good, although Waystation looks like a normal bar. Costumes and makeup all right, and I understand that the production is working with a low budget. It's just when the characters speak, or they are trying to push the story forward, the film unravels in shit manure. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is god awful. It's like a director / writer watched a lot of sci-fi movies and threw him a favorite of all the parts in a blender and come up with it. My only hope is that he used other people's money for it, because if he used his own, he has a total of suckers.
