This documentary is based on the grounds of incomplete evidence, in which Brian Fleming, perhaps deliberately holds back important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most important mistake is the one of the first: His requirements concerning invalidity Paul's testimony concerning Jesus Christ, ignoring the basic facts, such as: ** The existence of certain doctrines formulated as part of Paul's epistles. These creeds testify to the fact that most of the central claims of Jesus had already been formulated in the statements of faith, perhaps, for a few years after the death and resurrection of Christ. ** Indication of early Christians can not simply be thrown away, as a simple fantasy. There were really a lot of people who claim that the Messiah at that time, but only one of them was Jesus. Why? Because it would be stupid for those who have really believed Jesus was the Messiah, and go die in these beliefs, if they knew that he was not resurrected. ** Even if the Gospel of liberal, we are still talking about the accounts of Jesus written during the life of other witnesses, which would indicate an inaccuracy in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospel was written much earlier. <br /> <br /> What I'm talking about the fact that documentary Flemming is incredibly biased and self-serving piece of work, Hodge podges various arguments and evidence in order to serve his anti-Christian views. Do not be fooled by a bad consequence.
