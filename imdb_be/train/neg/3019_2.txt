as you can take it a hard life, charmingly violent bounty hunter with a serious history of * this * accent? This is absurd. In addition, the visual style and directer sickening stunt plot small, dull, confused gangster movie rehash and acting is unconvincing. The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the movie, and is told in flashbacks fragmentation - mainly from the sequence - it would seem, just to keep you well and confused. The film never shows you the things that really did not happen, and then says "what really happened, happened" - see (visible) with the murder of (fake) "first lady." What we saw in the first place, wrong sequence of events, then? <br /> <br /> Terrible choice in casting, tangled, messy site and headache, to induce the director's style. 1/5.
