If you've ever watched the Dukes of Hazard, you know that you never had to worry about drugs, profanity or crude behavior is seen by young children. If you've seen the movie you know that this is no longer the case! This movie was terrible! The main characters are doing drugs and think that it's funny and cool, of course, is not what I call entertainment. They have a great show and just turn it into garbage. Daisy, which was a bit flirty full show now looks and acts like she relies on a street corner to get paid for their services. I was so excited about seeing the film before it was released, 15 minutes in the movie, I was ready to leave. I was thinking that it was better, but instead it got worse with each passing minute. I wish I had never seen this film. He smashed a good show, and there was nothing left but a terrible taste in my mouth when I'm gone. Do yourself a favor, go see something worth your money, because it is not only a waste of money, but to spend 2:00 of your life, you will never get back!
