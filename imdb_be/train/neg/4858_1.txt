Why someone would do this piece of film waste in the world? The first two films were BLOODBATH zombies are stupid enough, but this takes the cake for the worst of the trilogy (probably for all time). Todd Sheets another director, but not a writer who is not positive or negative, given that he is just as worthless as the guy who wrote it. Drawing too much depends on the f-word used somewhere between 200 and 300 times nausea. Operates on the same level with the last two films BLOODBATH, so naturally, it is some of the worst I have ever seen. The special effects are better than the last two, but they still look godawful. The plot has become too complicated for its own good, and it was about a government experiment gone wrong and made a zombie. Also featured is a cryogenic frozen mutant zombies and school children who know how to travel in time, which leads to one of the most idiotic endings I've ever seen. After the movie, he goes to the bills, which is strange, because the whole film is the exhaust vent. Only to see it to make fun of him, because if you go into it with a serious mind, you could probably kill myself <br /> <br /> My rating :. BOMB / ****. 95 min.
