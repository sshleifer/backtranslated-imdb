I've seen this movie years ago, a group tradition Fast Forward Festivals Film, where we intended to take a bunch of B-films and vote for the one who chose the worst. <br /> <br /> In the night we watched it, it was recognized as the best, due to the similarity of the plot and fun costumes. <br /> <br /> This, of course, silly, kitschy, cinema to watch a full understanding of what you are watching a low-budget fluff. Personally, however, I would not recommend additional substances ... this movie will leave its own mark on you. <br /> <br /> He made quite an impression on me that I actually tried to get my hands on a copy within a few years. <br /> <br /> A good choice if you are setting up to watch bad movies. It is a pleasure, and I remember the cheerful music ...
