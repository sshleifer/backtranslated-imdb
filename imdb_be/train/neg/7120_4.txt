I first saw this movie on MST3K. And although I was laughing my ass off at the jokes, I do not particularly think that this movie was so bad. Of course, it was a bit difficult to understand, it is obvious low budget, but it was very Hitchcock-like story, and I can honestly say that when I saw the version without the MST3K, I was really entertained. The film calls for a Hollywood remake.
