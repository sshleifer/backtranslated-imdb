As you may or may not have heard, there is no actual collision between vampires and zombies in this movie. Then you might ask, why the name suggested such a thing, but in fact it is a kind of way, because nothing about this film does not make sense either. There were absolutely no story or plot, the only thing going on. Action was incredibly bad, worse than bad SafeAuto advertising. <br /> <br /> Not only there was no struggle between vampires and zombies, but I think there's only one scene with a zombie, even in it. Their make-up looked as if it were applied to an 8-year-old girl. The scene was completely random and absurd, and showed one of the characters, who are fighting against the zombies away with a brush cutters (I'm not kidding), but they used a chainsaw sound effects. <br /> <br /> This was undoubtedly the poorest film I've ever seen in my life. The only thing that I did not completely make fun of all the person responsible for the production of this film, if I knew that it was made entirely of 11-year years. <br /> <br /> In fact, though, even with all the criticism I offer here, I would suggest watching this film solely on the grounds that it may well be the worst movie ever, and because of this relatively comic. Even just counting flaws in it should keep you entertained.
