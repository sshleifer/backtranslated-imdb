I made this film about a month ago, when I did not have nothing to do on a Friday night. All I can say to describe this film is useless "waste" not to act so badly done, I've seen kids in high school do a better job entire cast, it seems that they do not simply read their lines with no feeling no emotion and no place to grab a viewer. On another note, the special effects are incredibly bad, and it looked like it was filmed with a camera who can buy Radio Shack. <br /> <br /> clown did not seem to cover each video. Heck, he does not even appear in the film until near the end, and all that he does it hum songs and walk around a few annoying characters. There is no real murder is not specified either so it's not a real slasher or so as I saw him, I asked a few things: 1. If there is a "serial killer Insane ClownÂ» is not a serial killer, who kills the clowns? 2. If your friend is gone, why do not you go out into the woods to have sex, not to look for her? Boring actually. <br /> <br /> 3. Why is it that the only real action sputtered in vain at the end of a sudden? Is cast finally decided to show effort in your work? This film is so boring as they come. My advice is to avoid it in order not to rent to spend an hour or two of your time laughing more than crying.
