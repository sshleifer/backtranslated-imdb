I ended up watching all of this (very long) film because I was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivety it. It seems hard to believe that so many famous people (Anthony Quinn, Laurence Olivier, John Gielguld, Vittorio De Sica, etc.) b willingly participated in this farce. But maybe in 1968 people were really * so naive? The plot seems to be written in some Latin American Marxist priest confused with the agenda. There is a superpower conflict and Russian are actually good guys to be good and spiritual man with the General Secretary of the Communist Party, which, suddenly, after 20 years, to see the light and feel obliged to ease his guilty conscience, to release prisoners from a Siberian gulag priest. The priest quickly becoming pope a series of accidents. We are allowed to see the secret Vatican Papal voting process, which is depicted as the most pious hillariously shape you can imagine. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the Communists in China reached the usual socialist economic miracle hungry half of their country to the death. In order to solve this little hiccup on the tireless shining path to communism, they want to start a nuclear war (in order to fairly distribute the wealth of the Western capitalist China's poorest workers). <br /> <br /> Our good old comrade general secretary gets a little worried and calls the Pope shortly before his coronation, to ask him to broker peace. They meet with the Chinese leader Comrade Peng, who looks and acts like a 15-year-old boy. You roll on the floor laughing about the fact that people in 1968 thought the Chinese look. Comrade Peng requires that Western capitalists should pay (which makes sense, after all, not always the capitalists must pay for the madness of socialists?), And that the pope must sacrifice something, also, for the common altruistic deeds of equality and social justice. <br /> <br /> So if Dad gets crowned in Rome, he promises all the richness of the Catholic Church the world to feed our poor Chinese brethren in Christ. And so, he saves the world from nuclear disaster. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are also some minor sub-plot, which, unfortunately, give little to redeem this incredibly bad movie. I would give him three Oscar for nonsense. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony Quinn looks very unlikely, as the Pope. It is much more plausible as Zorba the Greek.
