Back in 1967 a director had not the slightest idea of ​​the galaxy, far or near. He is trying to finish a film called THX, etc. the short is to reconstruct the history of a certain George. I am sorry that there is only the wit to protect it. This is just a publicity promo for the director, actors, and others. et al. He has little intrinsic artistic value. This pamphlet. Leading plays George, is very good, as the nature of Leia and Darth ersatz character. Everything else is clearly commercial waste. What a waste. However, he got the job, I think. The rest of the movie is just treading water, to kill time, I think. brochure only.
