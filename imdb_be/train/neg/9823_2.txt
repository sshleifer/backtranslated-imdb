There is an interesting discussion in this film. Is it to be a moral person well enough or do you need something more? <br /> <br /> The film teaches that without God's guidance, being morally good man is not enough. There is a line at the beginning of the movie "You and I can look at a man who is morally good, but they both knew that he was going to go to hell." <br /> <br /> While I'm not a Christian, the discussion on this subject throughout the film was exciting, but not as much as the film is intended. I left the film with a strong sense that being morally good * * is sufficient. Arguments and discussions presented were heavily biased, so they crush themselves in the mass of their own ignorance. Fanaticism can be a powerful thing, especially if inferenced in the minds of the ignorant and uneducated. As a character in George Carlin dogma said :. "Hook them while they are young» <br /> <br /> The basic premise is very interesting too. Bible Scholar from the 1890s trying to publish a book that says that morality without God in the order as long as the moral sense. You just tell your child not to steal? Is it not to steal, because God says you are not? (Without bothering raising that tell the child not to steal, because, well, how would he feel if it was his marble that has been stolen?) <br /> <br /> The author, Carlisle wants his school recommendation help sell the book (to spread the world). Nevertheless, it is necessary unanimous agreement, and one of the scientists who opposed it. He brings in a very interesting discussion at the beginning of the film about morality for morality against God according to the argument. To prove his point, he makes a time machine (to put in the movie just to make the story work, I fine with), and sends Carlisle in 2002, to see where the teaching of morality without God will lead us. <, Br /> <br /> As should be obvious, he has his own opinion, and changes that he sees, and reversed itself by the time of his return (he's back, it is not really a spoiler, is the bible movie after all). <br /> <br /> As for the film, as the film itself, it's pretty slow and pretty bad acting. What was * nya * need in this film, is that it produces two "bad guys" who want to try to find out who Carlisle, even tho he can not hurt anyone who has committed a crime or something either. What happened with the film just shows the view of Carlisle, showing his view of the "sin of the world", and return it with a new perspective? <br /> <br /> In addition, there are several points in the film, who claim me, I'm happy that I'm not a Christian, or at least someone who says. "It's God or nothing" Three towards the end of the film, but bothers me .. First, when two «bad guys» Carlisle corner right before he jumps, Carlisle makes it * only * really despicable act .. he fakes his jump time is coming of Jesus, and makes it so that the "bad guys" (which also are Christians by the way, oddly enough), I think that they just missed the rapture. <br /> <br /> Secondly, after Carlyle returns, he finds the boy in which he scolded the beginning of the film is not about theft (but without mentioning God, the kid holding the marble and escaped), and tells him about this time, that stealing is wrong, because God commands it. As Carlin quotes above, scaring the child's religion is a faux pas in my book. <br /> <br /> Finally, an epilogue. Another tactic of intimidation. Carlisle asked the inventor, how far in the future could go, and he says that he does not know .. epilogue shows how he is trying to distort the Bible in the distant future (starting in 2100), and he does not .. it keeps the decrement of the year 10, and try again, and by the gradual disappearance, he's like 2030 or so. Throughout the film, Carlise remembers that he felt the end of the world is going, because the world was rich in sin and the loss of the name of God .. scare tactic was in use for thousands of years .. you would think they enlightened times, the church would have enlightened as well. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I saw this movie. While I was confident in the fact that, being morally good enough, now I know what kind of fact. Worth a look if you're not a Christian, to confirm you are happy not to be as ignorant as the people in this movie.
