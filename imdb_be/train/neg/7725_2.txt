This film is one of the most unintentionally bad fighters ever got into film. Dolph fucking Lundren with Japanese accent is ridiculous enough, but add a truly banal action to each connection, an eccentric and over-the-top villain in the cliched love interest story and one of the worst endings of all time, and you've got yourself quite a bit of suicide induces a treatment for people who I love my life and still look «Showdown» never supposed to kill himself with a blowtorch. <br /> <br /> I do not know if it's just me, but the whole homosexual subtext is neither too thin. There are constant references to the male genitals, but not women, either. Brandon Lee and dolphins talk about each other male parts, but in fact, before you go on a suicide spree, Brandon says Doly, "If we do not do this, I want to tell you, you have the biggest e - - I have ever seen "<br /> <br /> now, this is what a normal person would say to another person in an action movie is not less, and you want to be your _dying words_ ?? <br /.?? > <br /> Later, there is this gem: <br /> <br /> Dolph (relative villain): "I would like to cut some part of his anatomy," Brandon:. "Man, you have the mount. »<br /> <br /> As a guy in RuthlessReviews.com said:" Unfortunately, Dolph does not react with "I have a fixation I have a fixation You're the one who decided that his last words should be about?! a soldier, I'm just going to chop his ears and nose, man. " <br /> <br /> It is relentlessly silly things and a lot of fun, if you are someone who likes to get root canals from unlicensed dentist without Novocain. This is approximately the same level. Great fun for the whole family!
