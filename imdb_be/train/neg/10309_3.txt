"CIA Codename: Alexa» is an absolute horrible rip off of the classic film by Luc Besson «La Femme Nikita» (1990). The film is basically about a woman who is taken in and trained by the CIA and is forced to make a secret mission for them. (Pretty much the same story structure La Femme Nikita) current combo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst in the history of cinema. Lama "actions" just a bad Steven Seagal incarnation. Watching Orenthal act in this film is a painful experience. <br /> <br /> The writing and acting is so poor in this film is sometimes funny. There are so many blockbuster "Convention" in the film is funny: do not need a car explosions, people flying through the glass window, terrorist, bad tails, etc. Score recalls by David Michael Frank for "Hard to Kill" (1990), which promotes the theme of the film Steven Segal. There are many martial arts movie, and it's very well done for a low-budget American production. Mindless action and over the top acting never allows, and I must admit that I was slightly amused. <br /> <br /> Lamas had the appearance of the star acts at the beginning of the 90 years, but it is, of course, no action stars, so it makes soap operas, but not a blockbuster. My recommendation is that you miss the "CIA Codename: Alexa» and check «La Femme Nikita» instead.
