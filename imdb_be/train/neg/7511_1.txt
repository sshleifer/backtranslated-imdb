It was one of the funniest and poorly directed films that I have seen in a very long time. I never liked Spike Lee, but thought I would give it a try: a bad mistake. The film should show how the Son of Sam's real-life murder of a neighborhood affected the summer of 1977; that he really was the center around the most boring characters, I doubt that anyone cared whether their drug problems, marriage problems, and so on, etc. Scenes depicting the murder of just that, and nothing more; shooting, and then he returned to the Saturday Night Fever! What is even more ridiculous is the choice of Spike Lee to show as a reporter in the film: Spike, believe me, you do not Hitchcock, not stay away from the movie, it makes them worse. The silliest scene was supposed to be a dog speaks in a dull voice, which was depicted in the scene in front of him, where he was to be shot ??? Spike, what were you thinking when you did this movie? Without thinking my guess. People who think that they will see the crime drama, take my advice and do not waste your time and money on this loser. You better watch Jerry Springer in this case! Waste film, I gave it a 1 out of 10: a horrible rags.
