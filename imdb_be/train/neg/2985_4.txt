When I finally had the opportunity to watch the zombies 3 (Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe) on the import of Japanese Region 2 DVD, I was blown away by just how entertaining this zombie epic is.The transfer only the immaculate, as good as it will ever be look, if Anchor Bay Sun seizes it.The gore really stands out, as it should, and you can really appreciate the excellent cosmetics and dismemberment fx.The terrific.It sound is also only 2 channel Dolby, but if you have a receiver with Dolby Prologic 2, you can really appreciate the music of the cheese (actually a very good estimation) And effective, although a cheap sound effects.It never sounded so good and excellent shuttle service adds to the overall enjoyment. <br /> <br /> I never realized how much blood flows in this film, it is extremely hard with a burst of shots to the head, explosion manure filled mega acne, Cleaver to the zombies in the throat, a woman burned limbs (as is this did'nt burn guy too), intestinal munching zombies and more children, I lost track. <br /> <br /> This is certainly for fans of hardcore zombie action, especially Italian kind.There is somewhat different set of parts and cinema can be found, I think people do not give him enough money, when you see the net printing, and not some monstrous pirated copy, it's a completely different experience. <br /> <br /> This film never allows for a second, and I understand that this is inconsistent across all sites, horrible dubbing, acting tough, and this feeling of disrespect is celebrated in grand fashion, but that's part of its charm. <br /> <br /> For me, this is one of the best horror films ever, you can not make a movie is bad, so good on the random genius purpose.It in higher order.If they played for a laugh it would have been disaster, but they played straight as an arrow, and the result is a great cult that the fingers of his nose in any and all of the traditional standards of cinema. <br /> <br /> A ton of action sequences, exotic locations, excellent scenography, well, sometimes GRE in film, fine cheese and inconsistent action, but still an interesting story, great effects makeup, a beautiful woman who can push example, great music, and sometimes cheerful, sometimes terrible, but always interesting zombies.How you can go wrong with this film, it has it all, a cult that stands the test of time.
