This is a bad B movie tries to masquerade as the study of sexual addiction, but it's really a poor excuse for a sexploitation flick. The story revolves around Seogo Horn (subtle name) played by Michael Des Barres. Sammy restaurant owner with an ignorant wife Grace (Ryazanov Arquette) and a small child. It has a sex addiction and should have meaningless sex every five minutes with any woman in sight, that consent (and, of course, every woman on the planet finds him irresistible, despite the fact that he looks old enough to collect Social software). <br /> <br /> the story focuses on a conversation with his therapist (Nastassja Kinski), where he describes each of his sexual exploits through flashbacks. This is nothing more than a convenient point for the parade of serial sexual acts, which consumes at least 75% of the time display. <br /> <br /> it's hard to know where to begin to criticize the film, it's bad. Production values ​​are sad. The film was shot on video with an expression somewhere between a TV soap opera (at best) and an amateur porn flick shot in someone's garage. Directing Joseph Brutsmena badly with poor lighting, uninspired framing and mismanagement actor. Scenario insipid and meaningless dialogue and vulgar. <br /> <br /> Women are usually portrayed as a sex obsessed nymphomaniacs simply waiting for an addict like Sam to come and rough them while feeding their insatiable appetites with some impersonal intercourse, as an example, Grace's sister comes to a disturbance report Semy that she knows that he sleeps around, and she was going to tell his wife. His response to this is to throw it against the wall and began to rape her. About three seconds later it has illumination and it instantly turns into one of his sexy students, begging to give her more. Just as they finish Grace enters and tells her sister, 'Oh, great to see you, must run to pick up the Temi "and my mother's words of negligence Sammy. loyalty bond was sealed with a good robbery. Lot spoiler here, because it is so typical of the film evidence that anyone who has seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it. <br /> <br /> Sexual depictions of everything is exaggerated, mechanical and simulated so bad that they are more ridiculous than erotic. Most of them are made of both parties fully clothed. The current miserable. Michael Des Barres is the full depth of a puddle of rain. He really seems to get in the pushing and the profanation of sexual parts, but when it comes to actually act with Arquette and Kinsky, he goes with the flow. Ryazanov Arquette closest to the actor in this film, giving a moderate performance and looking really hurt when she finally learns that her perfect husband depraved animal. Nastassja Kinski is too good-natured, as a therapist, but at least we've got some action going on here. The rest of the cast is simply a collection of high body doubles, to which they provide food for thought line, as `hit me more is that the best you can do? and `O God ?? YES. " <br /> <br /> This film is one of the worst I have ever seen, a dubious distinction, given the thousands of movies that I watched. I gave him a very rare disgrace his rating 1/10. It could not be seen for three hours every meal.
