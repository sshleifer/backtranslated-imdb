Bartleby is a terrible production, although not as another reviewer put it, because it «unfilmable», but because this version does not support the spirit of the book. It tells the story, almost painfully so. Watching this, I could turn the pages in my book and follow, which is not much fun when dealing with adaptation. Likely see the 2001 version of Bartleby involving Crispin Glover. This version, while humorous, brings new details of the film, keeping the spirit of the novel. What is important is the spirit, and not trivial things such as setting, character names and costumes. The difference between these two versions of the movie, like night and day, tiring, and fun. This version is a lesson about what can go wrong if the adaptation handled bad, painful, stupefying schlock.
