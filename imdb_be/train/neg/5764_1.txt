Scary Movie 3 stinkfest so it is difficult to put it into words. This makes films such as Malibu's Most Wanted look like Oscar material makes it easy to say that. <br /> <br /> The original Scary Movie was a lot of fun, one of the best 90's movie parody, based on a great team that previously rocked our world with Dont Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood. But what the hell happened? After the tragedy, which was Scary Movie 2, I thought that the cast and crew changes will help matters, but it is even worse. <br /> <br /> In the 20mins I would have smiled twice. Not one laugh, jokes were recycled and originality was not, apparently, is not a factor. The fact that at the moment in writing, most people on the site, voted it 10/10 made me feel physically ill. If there are more clicks, the school rock that actually have jokes that are choking * * It's funny, who spend their money on a scar as it is necessary to examine their heads. <br /> <br /> no star / ****
