This is probably the most boring movie ever. I'm really looking forward to seeing this film gave actor / director Roman Polanski. I think I'd like to see Three Amigos, than ever watch this movie again. He went quickly than DVD-player straight into the garbage. My apologies to those who seem to like this movie, but you probably liked New Coke, as well. I am at a loss why anyone would like this movie, it is slow, boring and has no real plot. Waiting 105 minutes for the movie to start. I understand it was done in 1976, but it was the epoch of bad television all around. Thank God, and drive the company into three left with stoplight glasses and Bay City Rollers. Well, just my thoughts.
