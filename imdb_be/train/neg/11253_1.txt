Visually interesting, but falls flat in the originality department. It's tedious Excercise technique wears thin after the opening battle. Jude Law has the charisma of burnt toast, but in his defense, this film contains some of the worst dialogue I've ever seen on the big screen. In fact, the script is so poor that he continues to take you out of the film, and made me think about work, bills, my dog, etc. There are many moments that scream Bluescreen. Paltrow, as wooden as they get. This could have been saved with an instant dialogue noir or above the upper camp. My only complaint about the technique is that the film Black & White (sorry, computer) would have helped, because it looks like Turner painted black and white. Just a big stupid clich√© mess. I'd rather break my hip, than to sit through this test of endurance back.
