I thought that any horror film with Orson Welles in it would be weird. Necromancer sure was, but it was a little too weird for its own good. The film does have a horrible feeling, as it has to deal with a bunch of Satanists / witch in a small town and a young woman attempting to avoid them. Director, though, seems to be deliberately trying to confuse the audience by means of flashbacks and dream sequences. By the end, too many questions unanswered. To make matters worse, since the story is so complicated that it is quite difficult to implement for any of the characters. It seems strange that Wells would agree titled this film all the more that it is not so much to do. Maybe someday they will be releasing a tape of outtakes and blunders of this film. Now that would be really fun!
