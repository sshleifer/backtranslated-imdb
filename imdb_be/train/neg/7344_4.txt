This is the story of a young woman seduced and then dumped her older married lover after she gets pregnant; she avenges herself against him and his entire family, through black magic ?? are disappointing, it does not make itself, but there is someone else to do for her. Good value for the production of a Thai horror film. But the soft scenario never generates suspense, director of approaching the material is completely arbitrary, and the final act of losing the audience sympathy for the victims, throwing logic winds. At some point, the character has a great opportunity to just shoot dead thief, and instead she gets up and runs away, without raising the gun. Bad writing ?? you're soaking in it! <br /> <br /> Some Gore unsightly effects, including really bland late-term fetus of a corpse, and one guy is dying on hundreds of live eels escaped from his stomach. It recommended only for genre Completists, who just have to see every horror film made in Asia over the past 15 years.
