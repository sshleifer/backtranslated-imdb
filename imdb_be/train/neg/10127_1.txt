This show made me feel physically sick, and totally detached from British society as a whole. It is programs such as this and Blue Peter, which is pretending that there were / are no class distinctions in the UK. They always say things like; "Go into your attic and you can find it .." or "Go to your backyard today and ..." - what about us "mean-spirited" working-class children who have never had a "loft" and "backyard", which was no more than 1 meter of the balcony on the 14th floor of an apartment in the Council? Public service broadcasting - yeah right! And on top of that it was terribly upset to see this stupid, middle class-to-Backside their own children to mess around with bits of old plastic having "fun" ... do me a favor, and "why don" t you "go and cut the wrist or make coke overdose on "mom and dad" money ... you make me sick
