I am grateful for one thing and one thing only - that this woman would be thousands of miles away is now on a completely different continent !!! Hooray !!! This program is summed up quite simply as Victoria Beckham became obsessed with a receding yourself and your family in the media for the sake of self-promotion and "f * Cking Brand Beckham. <br /> <br /> A few years ago I used to really as "Posh and Becks" I still very much admire the talent of David, but I have no respect for him any more. how can you respect someone who has the hand of his wife put his ass to work with him as a puppet. <br /> <br /> It was clear that Victoria's hand was only a premature departure of Beckham with Manchester Utd yted and now the same thing has happened to Real Madrid I hope Beckham can live with the fact that, although he may be earning squillions pounds -. He sold his soul for the American Buck and end his days playing for a team that will struggle to get promotion from division in England (no offense to America - but in baseball and basketball you exclude - football you) <br /> <br /> anyway - I digress. It was years since I've seen such a top, completely false performance of "Posh" - this creature topped only during its crawling worthy of red carpet appearances next "fiasco" Rebecca Loos, when instead of throwing all the cr * p in David he deserves, she desperately clung to his hand, trying to save millions of pounds of money COCs her marriage began. <br /> <br /> All of this PR was miserable. Why can not she just go in there quietly support her husband through the biggest mistake of his professional career, and keep her head? When she became so full of self-importance, she feels that the movement in America has to be shrouded in this huge fan fare? <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw a documentary by David Beckham last night. At least he kept the piece of affection and obedience. Two things, his wife could do with learning <br /> <br /> Another thing Victoria. - you complain constantly hounded by paparazzi. Little tip - stop tilting them about their whereabouts stupid woman <br /> <br /> Good luck !! America.
