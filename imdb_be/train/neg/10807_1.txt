This film successfully proved that we all know that professional basketball players suck everything except the game of basketball. Especially pat and act. I can not even describe how bad this film really is. First of all, is it just me, or what an ugly baby you have ever seen? I mean, its teeth can be used as an opener. Secondly, why gin would like to pursue a career in the music industry when, in spite of the fact that he has magical powers, it sucks badly when creating music? Thirdly, I read the Bible. In no case form or another has been told that Jesus made gin. Fourth, it was dealing with all the bad special effects? I assure you that any box of intricate brake teenager with a computer can make a better effect than that. Fifth, why the ending suck so bad? And what the hell, Djin? And finally, the one who created this nightmare known as Kazaam should be thrown off the plane and the Eiffel Tower, because this movie is to take the word "suck" to a whole new level.
