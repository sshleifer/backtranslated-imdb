The rest is a kind of "we know what we know, because we know that" the film that Christians (and most any other naive people) to help them feel that they are "the THINK" and "I Believe" (not " LEU ") is right. But, at the same time I feel bad for young children, because it is not well-made film. this will not help any communication. I am working in a video store, and I know the only reason people went to see this movie because they were religious, and they thought it was. No one on this earth who think that they edayuts what will happen in the future, it is wrong if they do not think they know what they do not know. I've had just about enough (but only after I had too many) of these people walking around their noses in the air thinking that a movie starring a semi-talented television actor means something above me. <br /> <br /> please, if you love yourself, you will stay away. I refuse to go into details about it film (not because the AI ​​did not see it (because I did), B-it was too shocking etc. my atheist-I to deal (because it was not), or CI really don 't have anything to say bad about this (because I do). The reason (which is not a word anyone who helped make this film understand) that I want this film out of my head, I want it to be done with my head, I wish that I was watching all of this with an open mind my head, I want to understand what Kirk so proudly and coachly gives at the end of the film out of my head. I just want all the things that were in my head before watching this movie is there anything directly related to this movie, which floats in my head off! My anger peaceful ends. I'm sorry that someone in this world, went to the theater to see this movie that could happen in the future (but will not), if they could give that seven dollars, plus any number of people, animals or the rain forest charity. but if they did that to "believe" when they could not in the fact that it is real, that they may have what we have. Leaving ZERO (with ****)
