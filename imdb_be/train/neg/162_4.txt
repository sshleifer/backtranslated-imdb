a film that tries to be much smarter than his creators are capable of producing. twists and turns miriad movie plot of "surprises" in a desperate attempt k√©p audience guessing, punctures Offcourse "plot" with steam room scene they thought would help him along. <br /> <br /> James Belushi involved in this pseudo-intellectual trying to sleep and simply passes through the film. the same applies to the other "actors". The plot is quite silly and tacky. whih in itelf not as a crime, but to the end, huge plot twists get very tedious and boring. <br /> <br /> However, the film does manage to generate some interest in the middle. all worth a lazy hour really sad day, but do not worry if you miss it. <br /> <br /> 4 pretty lame!
