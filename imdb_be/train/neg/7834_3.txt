I usually do not write reviews, but I can not understand why this is rated so highly, and would like to give a warning to fans of horror, since I can only assume that all these high ratings were given to the average viewers. <br /> <br /> I just watched the first two episodes, but these two are so cliche, it was not even funny anymore. the same old stories, you probably have seen / read a couple of times already - living toys, evil things from other dimensions ... and it's not just that these stories are not innovative, they are also pretty bad versions of these clich√©s . I would like, such as "Chucky" and "Silent Hill" on these two episodes at any time. and do not even ask about the visual effects ... those in the first episode in the order, but those in the second ... awful. It seems to have gone not just any student film project. blood or blood ... ... uh ... nothing worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> This can be fun for some ten-year-old kid who probably have not seen / not read many horror stories yet (although I would recommend "for the faith" - that is, what I call the mystery of a decent TV show). but for the adult horror fan worth nothing. I gave only 3 points, because there are actually some interesting cinematography (especially in the second episode) and some good action.
