DR. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas / (2000) ** (out of four) <br /> <br /> If you want to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional Dr. Seuss classic fables, does not see "Dr. Susie How the Grinch stole Christmas. " If you are old enough to read this review, you are probably too old to get any kind of pleasure from this film. It contains a lot of flowers, creative design and production of a creative set and costume construction, load joyful noise, and the characters are made to look like a real inhabitants of the fictional village of Whoville. Unfortunately, this is where the positive end elements of the film; the rest of the product is not that other, as an excuse for Jim Carrey cluck on the screen, giving a devilish smile, all the time to jump through too wide script with nothing much to do. <br /> <br /> Many people know the story of how the Grinch stole Christmas from Whoville, so I will not waste your time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read. However, I will say that the story of the film is made in three main acts; Grinch and working out of installation for the festival Whoville, and Dr. Seuss middle of a robbing Who's on their Christmas. There are a lot of familiar names in the credits here, but not a familiar face. As in Â«Battlefield Earth," I just do not understand why manufacturers will hire expensive actor would simply their identity shielded from unrecognizable makeup and costumes. Regardless of whether there SNL Molly Shannon as Betty Lou, wife of Bill Irwin, later played Lu Lu, the father of the little Cindy Lou, played by Taylor Momsen. Jeffrey Tambor is the mayor of Whoville, Anthony Hopkins gives his roaring voice of the narrator of the film, and Christine Baranski is a lonely lost lover. <br /> <br /> The Grinch in the filmmakers are trying to prove the originality of the story, adding unnecessary podagovory and focusing too much on the little Cindy Lou. Scenario Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman just feels like he always goes to the cinema landscape; there is little if any focus of director Ron Howard and the script is predictable, too broad and unnatural. The only character given any difference here Grinch himself, all the other characters are puppets of the plot, shapeless and uninteresting. And the dialogue overzealous and too corny to be anything but miserable. Example-Grinch: Oh, who-manity <br /> <br /> redeeming factors of the film leaves a gifted director Michael Korenblit, costume designer Rita Rusk and rich makeup department. "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a very good type of product. Sets and the atmosphere created by the directors, detail and creativity; this is how the public attends the world, as in a dream. The people of Whoville plastered with makeup, to the point where we can not tell the actor pronunciation sadly line. While dazzling, I really can not give credit to the performances, as they watched sob expensive technical department takes its place. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey is one actor who I can talk to. His performance, which virtually destroys the film itself He is too selfish, like the Grinch, too exaggerated and comic, to history, to be anywhere near the work known as Susie. Surprisingly, there are a few funny moments due to some cunningly clever sequences, does not laugh does not come with an idiotic stupidity of Jim Carrey in. It's almost like the film was written specifically for Kari overplay his part. This factor results in a film to the wild, but brainless comedy, which is only a pale shadow of the original Christmas classic "How the Grinch Stole Christmas". <br /> <br /> After this film, historians should check the coffin of the late author, Dr. Seuss may have turned in his grave. <br /> <br />
