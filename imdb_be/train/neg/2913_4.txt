This, of course, very pleased to see improvements in the Turkish film industry, however, I would have expected something a little more creative on the toga Gokbakar. from the script, which I believe it is wise not written one, as some might think. especially cheesiness of the dialogues, which put the audience in a position that, as if they were not smart enough to understand the situation, which in many cases makes the film unbearable. it also has an obvious ending; You can easily guess the murderer from the beginning. the weakest part of the scenario is that the inability to seriously mentally ill to act like normal people, as professionals once !!! they ever look for opportunities to patients who are on heavy medication, act like professionals, and use all the medical terms that even normal people can not use ????? !!!!!! as in the scene where the staff was to find the most dangerous patient, without any weapons to defend themselves, were another amazing film point. and that scene was so suited to the name «Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir» !! It is not only weak part of the film. there are also many preciosities in the film. Picture of the most dangerous patient has been twinned with Hannibal, and the emergence of Togan in the end, obviously, the biggest mistake that he could do in his first film! fuss about the greatness of the film and interview the actor gave the only people to be curious and get them to see. Gen is common frustration. I would wonder if Sahan was not that famous, toga will be able to shoot the film with this much of the amount of the budget ?? I hope toga understand that it is not fashionable to play the role of the director, as he said in an interview. It was Hitchcock who made it wisely and Night Shyamalan continued his successful! he must be aware of the fact that he did not even Hitchcock nor Shyamalan !!!! hoping him to be more careful and creative next time in this great industry!
