I was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in North Carolina. Instead, I watched a man who Rues the fact that his great-grandfather lost his tobacco empire in the Duke family. And it went on and on. If Mr. McElwee family prevailed over the dukes I doubt that Mr. McElwee will have no problem with the dead from diseases related to tobacco. I grew up near the area where the family Mr. McElwee beginning of its tobacco business; I was expecting a more constant attention McEwee his family. I knew very little about the history of tobacco in the NC economy and the implications for the state's economy by tightening tobacco control. Numerous references to the film "Bright Leaves" ridiculous - So if Gary Cooper played the grandfather in Mr. McElwee? or the viewer get any understanding of tobacco role in the economy of North Carolina show old movies fictionalized film clips? I did not.
