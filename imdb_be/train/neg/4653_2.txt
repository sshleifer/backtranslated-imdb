vampire henchman wants to name her after falling in love with a prostitute five dollars in this very low-budget horror-comedy. I can not explain all the positive comments in this film. I chalk it up to a mass hallucination, but it does not bother nor less. One redemptive factor (and this is me being very generous here) may be a grandfather, who is the only floor cute character in this whole mess. Do not waste your money and time. In fact, here a word of advice, if Troma puts it on DVD, but does not do it yourself, in all probability, this shit <br /> <br /> TROMA DVD Extras :. Comments with Omar and Kirk; a second commentary with broskomami and crew deleted scenes; bloopers; Troma interactivity; light march; Clip from "Horror harder"; Theatrical Trailer, Trailers for "rowdy girls," "Teenage Catgirls in the heat», «Cannible: The Music" and "The Toxic Avenger 4» <br /> <br /> My class: D
