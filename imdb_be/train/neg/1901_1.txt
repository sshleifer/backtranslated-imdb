This review may contain some spoilers. <br /> <br /> A remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie Gone in 60 seconds starts well. In fact it is well acted and the plot moves very well. Even big-budget Hollywood does not change the fact that the original story was more believable. For those who do not know the original story was thieves working as insurance inspectors. Who would suspect. But even with the change almost every aspect of H.B. The original Halicki, in the remake of the film is very good, until we get to the final scene of persecution, some versions of 74, who made it big. One in this release are divorced, only 10 minutes, and it culminates in a monster special effects that takes all the plausibility of the chase. If the initial chase was very believable, the star was the stunt driver who did all his own stunts, modification provides a flat in the last 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to view a classic car chase movie, the original fine in the bargain bin at your local rental joint and stay away from the new remake.
