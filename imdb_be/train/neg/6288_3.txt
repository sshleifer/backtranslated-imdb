After reading many of the comments here, I'm surprised that no one recognized it mostly overlong remake Twilight Zone episode from 1960 titled «Mirror Image» starring Vera Miles. Rod Serling did a much better job of creating an effective ghost stories for 24 minutes than Sean Ellis made in 88 minutes with this tedious repetition. A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and inexplicable end, but in the film, should be a little more substance and history should make sense. Unfortunately, the content and meaning of the two things that are not in «The Broken». Yes, he has some moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. Some additional remarks: although this is clearly a modern history, not a single character in the film has a cell phone! And even if the traffic accident of this event that gets the story takes place, there is never any reference to the insurance company, the person who was driving the other car, or the police would be required to report. My advice is to skip this channel and watch the original, as well!
