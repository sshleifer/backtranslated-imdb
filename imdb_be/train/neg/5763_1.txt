<br /> <br /> Â«step towards Hollywood veterans?" (Wayan Brothers were 'asked') is what Hollyweird demanded and what he got. However, like many of its recent decisions, this one was a huge mistake. <br /> <br /> The director is so out of touch today's audience, trying to regain the physical shortcomings and plugs in place of amusing dialogue simply a natural disaster. I knew it, the audience knew it and he knew it CAST. <br /> <br /> What a shame, why did they ever consider changing directors? Not only that, but two Wayan brothers played as two of the four main characters, without them it just a farce and sad. <br /> <br /> SP <br /> <br />
