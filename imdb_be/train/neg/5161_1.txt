My life comes to saving animals. I do volunteer work with a cat rescue organization. I am a vegetarian because I could not even kill an animal to maintain their lives. I can not even kill a spider, I put it outdoors. The scene in which the children throw stones at the bird until it dies, with early to participate in the attempt to be accepted by the other children, made me sick and haunts me still. It just proves to me that people are helpless in their need for acceptance. The ending - the adoptive parents take early - not redeem the image of animal cruelty. Why would anyone want their children to see this film?
