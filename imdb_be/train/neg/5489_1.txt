The story is similar to ET: unearthly run on the ground and trying to get back home. At the time of his stay on this planet, it will create a friendly relationship with people. <br /> <br /> But, unlike ET, which oozes drama, comedy, poetry, this movie is just fun. It's really clean production Dysney :. Its primary audience is children and movie more more visual than the message <br /> <br /> So, you will find some funny scenes (the first sighting of the city, "space" parasitic toaster) and cast experimented with special mentions in "Doc", which rejuvenates the sign of "the Mac Fly", and Hurley, which seems to be open to the auto-derision. <br /> <br /> Ice on the cake: the main title has killed Danny Elfman, and, like any other great composer, you recognize his "voice", before he even credited.
