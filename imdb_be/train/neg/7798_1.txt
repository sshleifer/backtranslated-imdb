This review is based on a redundant Shock-O-Rama video released on unbecoming world in 2002. How bad is it? It's terrible that "1" is on a scale IMDb - but it's much worse than that. It's nice to think that the original German-language press can improve the situation - comedy English dubbing is not funny - but in truth, it is one of the worst amateur films of any genre you're likely to see zombies in the film, as slow and clumsy, as always, and they do not seem to have the ability to talk or think about anything beyond their next meal. However, they are also smart enough to operate a chainsaw and malicious enough to know that Western taboos about the genitals, without a doubt, brighten their dinner table conversation. George Romero's Land of the Dead zombie postulate people, retaining a bit of social cohesion; Here, zombies are not more than a blank canvas for the perverted fantasies Andreas Schnaas director. Through without saving social value, and even worse, completely absent, as entertainment, Zombie 90 is a bad joke on those who spend money on it.
