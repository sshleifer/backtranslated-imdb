I understand that some of Ben Stiller movies or be released this year, but maybe he should insist on quality, not quantity. <br /> <br /> I was stunned at what the filmmakers thought passed for comedy «Along Came Polly". <br /> <br /> Stiller is Reuben bars, unattractive and is one of the worst performances of the year. Stiller schtick becomes tedious. He certainly has comic talent, but he needs to either find another chip or break, find some stuff, which is really funny. Because his films are in pain without a sense of humor to painfully bad. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is a shame because it is a kind, intelligent actress with a promising career. As long as it continues to do more films like «The Good Girl» (in which it is terrific) and less as «Along Came Polly," it will have a career of which she could be proud of. <br /> <br /> Aniston is desperately trying to overcome the limp material with which it works, but it is a challenge for any actress. Except for a few moments with Alec Baldwin and Ruben boss Stan and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Reuben's best friend, Sandy, there's nothing funny about this terrible movie. Other recurring characters, including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, annoyed. Azariah the emphasis is not only foolish, it is terribly unfunny. <br /> <br /> The premise «Along Came Polly», of course, has shown promise. Unfortunately, he needed a writer who could actually turn it into a good comedy, instead of lame, stupid, sad reason for comedy.
