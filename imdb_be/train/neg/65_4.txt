I do not quite get the rating for Amati Girls, and I think I was really kind of giving it a 4 out of 10. What could it be otherwise remarkable history with the actual set of more or less decent actors has become a common farce in my eyes. There are so many clich√©s in this film, women's hair is just awful, and most of the scenes in more than unrealistic or appear fake. There's no real passion in this film, but a bunch of actors more action on any restrictions that it hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad really touched, so it's just not good in my eyes. Watching this, I could not believe how something like this, I did it on my TV in the living room in Switzerland. But .. maybe it still was in order, and it just got lost in the translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the most amazing films I've ever seen, and it is certainly not in a good way! Sorry.
