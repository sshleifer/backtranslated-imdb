I can not understand at all, why are so many fans of Godzilla think it's great, one of the best films of Godzilla ever actually. This horror film and one of the very few movies I can not stand to watch again GOJIRA (G. another against Megalon). <br /> <br /> The plot is too mannered to be in a series of Hays, a series that attempt to turn the aging of the Godzilla franchise militants fair revolving around ideas that seemed more in place in 1974 than 1991. This is just sound funny, especially with some of the subject, take, for example, WW2 scene with a dying Japanese soldiers praising Godzillasaurus, sad and serious tone, take a violent turn, former commander of the capitalist and his death, serious seens in the movie his fans a way to specify, both played for laughing at how stupid fuss unclean illogical fun, if so, what is easily one of the most tasteless films I've seen, but I think it's likely, it was the only talent filmmakers entirely missing, and it was a case of direct Granite militants has deteriorated. This has been done ever compounded by the fact that the special effects are terrible Beyond Compare, on a jet pack to the android to fake sound effects emitted from the whole, it can not take anything seriously, and yet the film is waiting for you, there are no pushing the camera. <br /> <br /> as well as in almost all films Godzilla have a meaningless romance, and this is no exception, though something can be said that this is a particularly senseless and inexplicable since. There, there is literally no reason presented for romance, it just happens and there to make life 360 ​​degrees obligations. In addition, another terrible aspect of this movie dialogue, as Japanese and English is terrible, awkward and possibly the inspiration for Battlefield Earth. <br /> <br /> Tristar DVD exacerbates the problem, making it look grainy, blurry, dull and just plain ugly, it was the same for the sound. I first saw the Japanese version of Region 2, and the difference of day and night, with the original bright colors and texture, with a characteristic number, the fight scenes, especially, are actually watchable. <br /> <br /> In my view, a series of disappointing Hays, except Godzilla one thousand nine hundred eighty-four (Japanese version) is a bit of praise here, and Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah is an example of this failure. It's not even close to worthy of the reputation and the fans it gets. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10
