I was disappointed. the film was a bit predictable and did not live up to the hype plastered all over the box. Having said that, the characters were well developed, then windego myth has been used in a unique room and the house was pretty awful, but it just missed me. I kept waiting for that big Ahhhhh or BOO! But this did not happen. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film was led to a bad shot bad effects. Thus, it is showing a lot of bad things, and not by the atmosphere and the viewer's imagination to create fear and uncertainty. Try films like Session 9 or cube If you are looking for a low-budget, but well conceived a horror movie.
