I will not say that this film was bad, but it was not good. I was expecting something good, but I think, Hum Hain Aapke Kaun was much better than that. It was a very old-fashioned. At each stage of this film, I was hoping for some sort of twist, and what do I get? Girl gets burned and win the love of an aunt. <br /> <br /> Despite being engaged, they must get permission for every little step they make. They're so damn shy, even after so many meetings. I expected that my aunt will be much tougher than that. All she did was shed mad. <br /> <br /> Hey, we have children too, but we do not look at them, and tears in the eyes always. This film is a dream. Happy family is one tough woman, good laws and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the father of the poor bride, and now it's the other way around. And somehow I knew that would Mohnish Behl in this film. In any case, I believe that I wasted my time. I give it a 2/10.
