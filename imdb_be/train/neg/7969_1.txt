OK another film acquired by me and Joe Swatman. OK this is not the worst film I reviewed this week, but he still sucked royaly. We had a lot of fun to watch this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> Monster puzzle is a mish mash of all these dysfunctional students ideas, just know Hurray for the trouble, when someone equips it with Buzzsaw and a sawed of shotgun, the film was not bloody, as we hoped, I mean on the death of a heart attack. Again, I think the acting sucks, actors amount to be a porn star and one hit in her immortal for what ever reason. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst part is the ending, it leaves it open for a little puzzle 2, but he never gunna happen lets face <br /> <br /> My rating :. <, Br /> <br /> 4/100 fun fun (how much fun we are mocking it) 73/100 8/100 acting normally 12/100
