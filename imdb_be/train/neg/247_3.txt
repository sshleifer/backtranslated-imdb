It was 9:30 pm last night in a tent trailers of my friend, and we were so hyped to watch South Park (new episode). The fact is, in my country, South Park aired at 10:30 pm, and we decided to kill time by watching the show is currently airing, pride father. To begin with, I was just looking into episodes. The first time I watched it, I found that the oil and unfunny anything, so I thought "" Holy sh * t, I have a football match early tomorrow, so I have to stop watching silly cartoons. "" But yesterday, I tried to give my father a second chance to Pride. I believe that it is a complete rip-off of The Simpsons, but substituting yellow human characters lions instead. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I wonder why he got this TV-14 rating. I think Simpson is much more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity in the show several homosexual (unfunny) jokes. The Simpsons also much stronger (Halloween discount) and crude. I also heard that the creator of the series also directed Shrek 2, and I have news for him: Shrek 2 was much better and I think he was too much in the family category. However, I must admit that the Pride Father made me smile (even laughed once) three or four times. <br /> <br /> In general, I am not against the Father will pass. I do not hate him, but I do not like too. I've seen way better with "" The Simpsons "." <br /> <br /> 3,5 / 10
