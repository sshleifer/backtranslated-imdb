I tried to watch this movie twice, and both times I still could not make it to the end credits. The first time I was able to sit out the first sequence of the battle, then lost interest. The second time I was able to bring myself to digest within hours worth of bad actions, the lame SFX and the extremely poor areas. It pales in comparison to the original. <br /> <br /> Does anyone hear about the old ET Atari 2600 debacle? For those who would not let me fill you in. This 1982 ... ET is one of the biggest box-office smashes all times ... Atari decided to release the movie tie-in game on their home console system in 2600. To cut a long and financially painful story short game flopped big time and as a result thousands of ET Atari 2600 games that will be dumped on a landfill, because they could not even give them away let alone sell them. <br /> <br /> What is Universal Soldier: The Return has to do with this story? Look at the rating of 3.2 and figure it out for yourself. <br /> <br /> Terrible IMDb movie ... it made me give it a 1 out of 10, because of their rating systems do not go as low as 0 not to mention in the negatives.
