The first in the series was a brilliant, easily one of the best horror movies of all time. This is the crappiest. When I sat down to look at it, I really think how bad the fourth and fifth of them were, it would have been nice after a preliminary fun. Boy, I was wrong. Incredibly wrong. <br /> <br /> When I watched the first ten minutes of this, I was actually really wanted to turn it off, but I thought, no, maybe it will improve. This is not so. <br /> <br /> This is not only a terrible film itself, it does not need another sequel, because the last two (fourth and fifth) has been quite scary! Besides, how many times you can bring back Freddy? Acting is awful, the story line was predictable and shit, and it was also the shortcomings in it, as well. The way they did Springwood just completely wrong. It does not pay respect to the first one for-all. To add to this, it all seemed to really over-the-top. <br /> <br /> Some people say that this film was "ridiculous." This film is not "funny" at all. So, if Freddy Krueger to be "funny"? I would call it weird shit. This film has to be a horror movie, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, this information is not surfaced in the first? The ending is also just silly and cheesy, just like everything else. This one is completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first. Just shows itself. <br /> <br /> Such a shame that Wes Craven created something so good in the beginning, but it must be slowed down because of this garbage, which belongs to the basket. They do not even bother to make this film. Nor any other proceedings, except the third. The third one is the only one worthy of all the sequels. <br /> <br /> If it were a DVD on its own and not part of the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD set that I got, I would have dropped it when I got it <br /> <br /> Summary: .. miserable and poor attempt at a sequel <br /> <br /> - a complete mockery of the first film <br /> <br /> So, please do not waste your time on this unnecessary garbage.
