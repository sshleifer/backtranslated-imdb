This film is bad news, and I am very surprised at the level of great talent name, ever agree to appear in such a piece of junk like this. I believe that there were a few strangled agents sprawled across Hollywood Blvd. as a result of this fiasco. What really gets you is that it might be a good thing. Director of star appeal and the subject was fodder enough to generate interest and ticket sales, but it is a failure. Many story lines all go from bad to stupid in the photo finish, and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze in search of a piece of cheese, which is rotten. That Spike is able to achieve revenge against all Italians who might beat him when he was a child or insulted him, as the film does quite a lot to perpetuate the elderly and possibly offensive Italian stereotypes. As with any film, Spike Lee has some really food for thought and the magic filming. He has the gift of capturing the mind and transport you to your vision, if only for a few memorable scenes. But the question remains ... you can stand the other 2:00 head scratching and hours watching as you wonder, and wait for the final, to be out there somewhere.
