First observed 2/16/2002 - 4 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery ?? / Thriller too many bizarre plot twists. Despite the very talented actors, this movie is too predictable and only completely underestimates his audience. publicity of the movie is not stupid, and I hope that will not keep filling the pockets of some stars again and again, despite the fact that they are associated with. We believe that this film is about something with conviction Connery against capitol punishment in the beginning, but it turns out to be none other than as a standard, invented for the audience, mediocre, let's not ever get this over with, a thriller, we have involved every stupid switch in character, as they are drawn to us when it is necessary for the story, and we are ready for it, that we should be more way to go before it ends. Yes, there is some good action here, especially of Blair Underwood, Fishburne, and Ed Harris in the psycho-supporting role, but the story does not work almost from the very beginning to the very end of the long-awaited.
