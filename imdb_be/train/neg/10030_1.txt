Tashan - the name itself explains the nature of the film <br /> <br /> This type of film is actually made for a flop .. What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces films such those worthless than film C-Class. Or even some C-grade films better and enjoyable story than Tashan. Much hyped and overly confident Tashan poorly promoted bombed at the box office, which is definitely deserved. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the worst movie ever made with honorable banner Yash Raj Films. How do they handle such a hard project for the new Vijay Krishna Acharya, who has no actual meaning to do action flick? He tried to imitate the way in making Sanjay Gadvi like Dhoom, but he had suffered in the past. Scenes look more alike than comics or animation films made for sucking viewers. <br /> <br /> The story also loses its meaning and substances gently win the hearts of the audience ,. In most scenes reminiscent of Anil Kapoor southern Tamil star Rajnikant in his body language, and exorbitant terms. I do not advocate any Saif nor Akshego, but Karina award must finally went to Saif 'hands instead of Akshay. Just from a starting point I expected from him, but in the end he displeased me climax truth. Saif is the principal behind all the adventures, while Akshay is connected to the middle. In any film, the final should be weighed against the entire characters throughout history and premium or say, the reward should be given to the one who deserves the credit. And Tashan lost so unexpectedly became a hit. <br /> <br /> Akshay does not have anything new to show his comic talent here, but still reminiscent of his previous films. He seriously need to create a new image for their fans, that would hit them again and again. Between Saif did a great job in the race, and now he returned to his cheerful character through this film. But it is fully developed itself in the field of acting. And last but not least about Karina. She looks very hot in a bikini dress some of whom complain, as it has become too poor. But I do not think so, instead she became slim. Yes slim !!! this is a good factor for a woman to attract large man (or say a man). Next to them pleasantly, that his son Saif Ibrahim appears at the beginning and in the past, as a young Saif. I hope that now it will also lean forward in the goal to make acting as a career. <br /> <br /> Those who like this they Tashan either mentally or immatured still wants to go back to childhood, or to say, want to admit to the shelter. Thumbs down to the debutante director Vijay Krishna Acharya, who jammed the draft proposed by Yash Raj Films. In the future, it is to experiment and learn the minimum scenario for 5 years before in practical areas. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I do not like to evaluate the merits of the stars of this type are unsuitable movies.
