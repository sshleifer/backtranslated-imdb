Do not waste your time watching this! If you do not want to learn it for all the wrong things you have to do to make a good film. I'm not one to usually review a movie, but this one is personal. I wasted precious time that they can not give an answer. I feel compelled to write this report in order to warn others not to waste your time watching this crap. If this was a student project, I must say, not bad, but only during the first 15 minutes ... then it gets annoying. screeching, bad sound, bad video (good camera people could do it much better). and so that the effect of Blair Witch-? no budget? I was hoping that it would be better, but it is not. Now, how the hell, it deserves 4? 2 is more than fair, but 1 for wasting your time! I said my peace.
