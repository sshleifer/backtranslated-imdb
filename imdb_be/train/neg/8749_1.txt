Scary movie, like all told. What made me laugh was episodic Scott McNeil, giving an award of one of the victims of programmers before the wall SUN logo. McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that practically defines himself his hatred of Microsoft. They play an important role in applying antitrust complaint against Microsoft. Thus, they were stupid enough to think that this is a bad film will add fuel to this fire? <br /> <br /> There's no public record that I see in the participation of SUN, but it is obvious that the creators of this movie know Scott McNeil. Interesting puzzle.
