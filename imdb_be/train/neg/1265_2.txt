I first did not want to watch this movie, because it gave the impression of a trailer is too general and anticipated film ... but as I recently had the pleasure to discover the amazing «Mensonges trahisons etc. etc. plus si affinité» », which was beautifully written and Laurent Tirard (screenwriter, "Pro-Moi the backbone"), I changed my mind and decided to try it out, thinking that "Pro-Moi to the main" will be just as good as the «mensonges ...». and it is absolutely not the case. the script is not bad, but it's not as good as a director «Mensonges ...», the actors are not so generous (especially Charlotte, as boring as it is usual) like Edouard Baer and Clovis Cornillac and too be honest, I still I do not understand how this shit can have such success, even in this casting ... in any case, the story would be the basis to create so many interesting areas, but it is not as good as Tirari Desert in «Mensonges ...» , though it is also written by him. Easy, is not surprising and lazy work. Completely overpriced!
