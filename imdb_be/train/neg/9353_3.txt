I was lured by the title ... I was expecting, insightful and intriguing journey into alcoholism, instead I got pretty bored and sad story of a rowdy Scot. <br /> <br /> The leading character is not given a lot of psychological depth, if you are not ready to classify cheese teenager, like poetry, like psychology. <br /> <br /> It was a shame, because the core of the story could have been good, with more effort to reflect the inner feelings of the person who was supposed to live with alcohol and violence, because of his youth. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the general idea seems to be more like "I'm so, like me, because it is so like me." And chuckling poor attempt to give a poetic edge to the lowest class of people makes things worse. Turning to abuse cliches about the "cursed poets" smacks of a quick fix, a cheap way to make a boring film, it seems smart, artsy and intelligent. <br /> <br /> But the "16 years of alcohol" is not very smart, artsy, or sense ... the leading character is not developed at all, but a feeble attempt to change can not be without a good explanation. Just as the first attempt to place more with blue. <br /> <br /> The film borrows from classics such as a Clockwork orange and the needle, but ultimately unable to regain their greatness, even for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Jobson too much emphasis on the artistic side of history, and despising the rest, which gives us a film that pleases the eye, but fresh in the mind.
