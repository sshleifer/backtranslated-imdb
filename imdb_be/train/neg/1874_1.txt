I have been an ardent supporter of Hal Hartley, since I have seen him a short "Surviving Desire" in high school, and even then was very unmoored his searingly brilliant "Henry Fool." . But this 10-year-old later sequel is not only unnecessary, it is shameful <br /> <br /> After a choppy and quick start «Fay Grim» sends a pseudo-intellectualism, flat with boredom, and, finally, the unjustifiable - and undesirable - nihilism. And that's just the story <br /> <br /> Most of the new faces as frivolous and poorly developed, like in the movies :. One particularly flat character ends up hogging half the time we spend with the infamous Henry Fool yourself, and this is his say only scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> Agent Fulbright Jeff Goldblum, it seems to be the only bright personage (pun definitely intended Hartley, a). How, then, did he go? ** Spoiler ** Dead by a car bomb, it is easy to make the most violent film this gentle natured Hartley to date, and the tone is all wrong in a film that is all wrong from the word go. <br /> <br /> As for the other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or is it a Grim?), not to mention the very Fay ... well, I will not spoil their fate, as the film does a good enough job, that all on his own (if he did not care itself with another godawful sloping at an angle that gives the impression of confusion that Hartley is moving in the opposite direction from the director to the crappy student film). <br /> <br /> This is part of a complete disaster, terrible mess, which is not even enough good-natured, to revel in its untidiness. Instead, he self indulgent overflows typically funny Hipster pretense of its director in the "real world", one ugly and meaner than it should be, but not as ugly or mean enough to come close to what to say. At the same time, Hartley tracks sh * t all over my memory of these people, and wonderful world, it was originally created for them. <br /> <br /> I rarely so depressed in the movie, and I look forward to "leaving Las Vegas", which, at least, developed a fresh new characters we've grown to love, before you destroy them, instead to immediately excluding the characters already beloved. <br /> <br /> Grimm, actually.
