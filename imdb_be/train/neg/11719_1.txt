According to the character of Charles Dance in the movie "Nonsense!" No story, no character development, and it is incredible. <br /> <br /> full of things that just do not happen in the real world (in fact, when the British were police inspectors, armed with pistols in shoulder holsters?). Full error (Bulgarian train in London?). Full dull and artificial dialogue. And directing / editing awful - shaky handheld camera shots that do not add anything to the film, except for a vague sense of motion sickness; confusing jump-cuts; . No structures <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes character is not entirely unsympathetic - why should we care what happens to him? Point to the video? Straight in the trash!
