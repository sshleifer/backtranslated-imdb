I rented this movie from your library (this is hard to find for a good reason) purely out of curiosity. I'm a big fan of the Platte and the film was a complete disappointment. Jar Bell (1979) it is by far one of the worst films I have ever seen. The script is terrible, not because it deviates from the original text of the novel, but because he rejected without attention or intentions. Scenes poorly constructed and do not lead the viewer anywhere. What's with the voice of hockey poetry fee? Lady Lazarus has little to do with the situation Greenwood; Plath's poetry was completely wrong. Marilyn Hassett is absolutely incredible, Esther Greenwood (or any 20-year-old for that matter), partly because of the cast (she was 32 at the time of filming, age Platt was when she died), and partly due to the fact that it does not can act. Hassett all the emotions, entirely handicraft, not skill. Direction mediocre; director simply covers that there is not a lot. The only reason I give the film 1 is because 0 is not an option. Unfortunately by Sylvia, you have to wait for someone else to adapt the excellent work into something more fitting.
