I was recently on the Internet, looking at the site, which showed movies of the public domain. In a long list of films was this film, and I thought that I must be a hallucination in this offensive title and premise. But, no, that's really what it was. And since the film was only about 27 minutes, I decided to give it a try. If it turned out some porn movie, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it was the most bizarre movie I've ever seen. Danish crew tried, with a budget of about $ 49 to make the film Star Trek style of the team is very gay, traveling to destroy the galaxy of women's oppression, killing all women - they have continued to do on earth! And in any case, they were greeted with applause and appreciation from the planet now gay. <br /> <br /> The thin, it is not. With some of the most obscene and juvenile character names, which I have ever heard, I do not think I can write them on the IMDb without my review has been deleted! However, despite the full crappiness of it all, it was surprisingly watchable and worth a look. But, as I said, due to the rough names and odd object (although nudity is not), this is a movie for adults only. <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie left me with 1001 questions, who will do it, why to do it and the WHO was the target audience? This may not be the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's probably the strangest and perhaps most insulting!
