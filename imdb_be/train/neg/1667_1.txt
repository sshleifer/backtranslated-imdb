I really liked this movie to end. Of course, it was a bad and pretty unlikely, but still kept his attention on a rainy day. Until the end, that is. For her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory, where she struggled to catch up with other classically trained students, which makes the protagonist do? Wow them with her understanding and implementation of this time-honored musical tradition? No, it hurts and butchers most sensual Habanera from Carmen and turns it into a completely forgettable Brittany Spears-wannabe pop songs. My ears are bleeding! And at the last moment of horror, her teacher gave her a standing ovation! Any teacher in Spears-induced fantasies would have failed her in place. Save your time, save your ears - miss this movie!
