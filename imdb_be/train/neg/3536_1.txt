I do not think I've ever felt it was let down by a film before. After loving the previous two films of Guy Ritchie (I do not feel swept away - he was blind kiosks), I can not wait to see it. <br /> <br /> reviews were poor, then again, I do not trust the media in any way. More worrying is the fact that the Internet buzz was that it was a bit of a bitch, so it was with some trepidation I handed my Â£ 4,80 yesterday afternoon. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to explain this movie, mostly because I do not have a clue what was going on, and at some point I was genuinely close to standing up and asking if it was only I, who have not got it! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think Richie seems to fall into the trap of his wife to take a too seriously.It it seems that it was not good enough for him to make films with good areas, laughs , vigorous dialogue and good characters. It's almost as if it were a list of films he wanted to pick, here are a few I noticed: <br /> <br /> The Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, The Usual Suspects, Vanilla Sky ... <br /> <br /> I think that most care about what performances of the two main actors Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were actually very good, and it was really self-indulgent story and editing / direction, let the film down. <br /> <br /> So big thumbs down from me.
