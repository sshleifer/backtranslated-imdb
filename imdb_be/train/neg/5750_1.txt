in fact, it was pretty funny ... in "God, how the hell did this movie get made" kind of way. if you make fun of life film ... I kind of do ... go ahead and watch ... but if you really think? "is a good movie" eff off. <br /> <br /> This film is drawn from the very beginning of the action scenes with the worst I have ever seen in any movie .... usually they get five minutes with her, before you realize, "this movie can suck." . but no, you know, right away. This film tells the story of Edgar ... I never tried to explain it, though, for people who do not remember the story of the life of Edgar ... so I do not know if any of what was said, it is a fact. <br /> <br /> this film about a writer "ethane for" Hookin with his cousin "ann" .... they are both children of Edgar ... or are they?!? apparently, people give what their ancestors did. this guy ethane TEM is actually Ethan, "announce", which is supposed to be descendants of the story "House of Usher", which was written by Edgar Allan Poe. Ann's brother appears sometimes to try to rape her ... Ann also pursue, at one point in the film, three different people on the same street (seriously, three ... they are right for its blatant at her and she even do not understand). characters that are killed everywhere, appear at the end to try to save the day .... but they can not. in the end, Appa shoot Ethan until he tries to kill your best friend. Of course, before she shoots him, she should shout «Nevermore!» This film should never see!
