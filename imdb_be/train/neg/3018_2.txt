What do you get when you mix a piece of clichés with aimless pacing and a group of characters that you do not care about, and a failed attempt to create an attractive visual style and even greater piece of clichés and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget? Why, you get one of the most unbearably unwatchable movies ever! I mean, of course, Domino <br /> <br /> Here are some things that people might say while watching this movie :. <br /> <br /> "Oh, wow, the story told of a sequence that has not been done a billion times. and much more skillfully than in this film." <br /> <br /> "Wow, look all the flashing lights and grainy texture of film and development transitions! director is trying so hard to make things look arty and set the visual style! it's just too bad that none of these effects is not to add anything to the movies or to make sense to the scenes they are, and it is also very bad that most of them come across as annoying! "<br /> <br />" I have heard that an exchange of dialogue about two tstsatsi thousands of movies before! "<br /> <br />" I have seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies to! «<br /> <br />" it too! «<br /> <br />" Well, do not they reveal the "twist" about half an hour ago? It was that to be awesome? «<br /> <br />" If the film is to be showing "tough chick" going around kicking ass ... when, why did not she make a lot of it? «<br /> <br />" I can not believe how unoriginal this dialogue. "<, Br /> <br />" How long is this thing? I feel like I'm watching it for more than four hours already. «<br /> <br />" I have no idea what just happened, but I do not feel particularly motivated to try to understand it. «<br /> <br />" is over? «<br /> <br />" I want my money «<br /> <br />" songs in the soundtrack feel so wrong here «<br /> <br />" It's ironic that all they use obscenities in fact does not diminish the impact of each of them. «<br /> <br />» UGH "<br /> <br /> And finally." I could have ended his friendship with the person who recommended the film for me. »<br /> <br / > in summation, this film is a failure in almost all aspects Avoid watch it at any cost .. If your house is on fire, and the movie plays in a single room, which is non-flammable, you should seriously consider burned to death instead. <br /> <br /> (If I sound bitter, it's because I just spent two hours watching this movie and, uh, I did not enjoy it very much.)
