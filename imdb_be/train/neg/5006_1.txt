Nothing like a film about a group of friends who are not only not all love each other with disgust point, but they have almost no redeeming qualities to make the audience * *, as well as to empathize with any of the characters either. There are movies so bad they are good (a la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter movies), and there's just bad (for example, 99% of the "work" by Uwe Boll in). This film is barely tolerable, even if you are brilliantly talented MSTie Riffer (eg, Mystery Science Theater 3000). Fortunately, while I am quite talented in this regard (this is how my mind works continuously), for those who are not naturally talented in MSTie reefs, in the end, * that * movie you just want to pull his own head, painfully aware of the film "Tabu" takes you about an hour and twenty minutes, you will never get back. Even my talents MSTie little match for the slow paced, boring waste of time. The most puzzling aspect of this film is that someone * * green light and / or funded by it ... I rented a "taboo" solely for the normally talented Amber Benson, who clearly had to blackmail in making this film. I'm even less known film about it in my queue rent reviews which I would rather read the first. Ironically the best aspect of the film was its impressive labyrinthine mansion for its internal arrangement.
