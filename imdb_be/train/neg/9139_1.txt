I do not know what it is about this film directed by Sam Mraavich something messed up about every little aspect in this film. I usually say that it is a film that should not exist, but this film may be the most important of all time. This film has to exist for the sole purpose of being without doubt "the worst movie of all time." I've seen bad movies in my life, but it somehow breaks down what I thought was wrong with something much more difficult to imagine. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is hilarious, but the only funny thing is that he Mraovich think this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, wow ...
