I am glad that I was shooting this movie for one reason: his faults, I wanted to read the book, Allende and get the full story. <br /> <br /> Pros: beautiful film, the period portrayed well and consistently (to the best of my knowledge), and Meryl and Glen do a good job <br /> <br /> Cons :. This is the worst acting job I've ever seen of Jeremy Irons - I was wondering when something is wrong with his mouth. (And I hate terribly English, as he says, «Transito.») Winona Ryder does not do anything but believable look young and idealistic. Most of the other presentations in order, but the little things hanging out together in the character arcs and development of the relations that I was upset and angry long before the end. <br /> <br /> I'm wondering whether today is a typical work Bille August in the movie. I might have to throw a couple bucks more for rent Sense Smilla for the snow.
