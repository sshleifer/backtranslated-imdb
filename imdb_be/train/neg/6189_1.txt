I bought the DVD version of the film on the recommendation of my wife, who loved the version she saw the broadcast on television. But the version put on the DVD was a disaster. The lighting was poor to non-existent and the whole scene was just cut. In one case, Adel to be laid down in the bed, and we immediately cut to another scene - coming in mid-sentence - where the next night. Characters such as Grace Poole and Mason never even introduced, causing one to wonder if they fell asleep for a few minutes in the film. <br /> <br /> DVD we saw was manufactured Platinum Corp and even in the $ 6.32 it was a scam. <br /> <br /> Be careful which version you buy this movie! We send this one back.
