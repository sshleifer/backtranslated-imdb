I just finished watching this film, and I found that it's basically just not funny. <br /> <br /> I RPG Gamer (type of computer, none of the countertop material DnD), but I have not found any of the jokes in this funny. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes seemed to pull a lot of (tilting and zooming, might have been reduced to 5 seconds, and not a minute), and it feels as if the director was just trying to fill time. <br /> <br /> I think I laughed a total of 2-3 times over the entire film. <br /> <br /> acting itself is not all that bad, about standard for what a movie B class should have. <br /> <br /> I do not propose to tinker with this film, if you're not a big fan of the bottom, and even then it would probably be best to stay away from him.
