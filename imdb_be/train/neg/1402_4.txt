Dynasty Revisited in Hawaii ... Full clich√©, very predictable, unrealistic and sometimes even stupid. If you do not have anything better, however, it provides 40 minutes of simple, unpretensive entertainment, endless views of the large muscles of male and female, and a very good picture of impressive Hawaiian landscapes. On the other hand, if you are looking for something more than just stay away ... <br /> <br /> Oh, and by the way, if you've ever worked in a hotel, or know anything about running one, you there are two options: 1. you'll feel sick every two minutes in the apparent folly and madness, as the show is the hotel business or 2. Look at it as a science fiction comedy, as I did, lie down, relax and laugh at it!
