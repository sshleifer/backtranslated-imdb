With the exception of people seem to buy into this garbage! As shown, as "Moral Orel" showed, even if you tried to make the most outrageous, on-the-top parody of evangelization, you might think that you do not approach close to the fun of the show. It is difficult to say that even happens when you look at it. Whether it's a news show? Talk show? Who knows? They begin by reporting on various international news, but seemingly random points, interrupted this amazing news, troll-like little man with a forehead more than his face, muttering and laughing and generally being awful. <, Br /> <br /> Pat Robertson did not seem such a bad guy, at first glance. He just seems like a senile, yet harmless old coot stuck in its archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this man who called for the killing, which was friendly and offered to help not one, but two blood-thirsty dictators, who have illegally used the donation money to run the diamond mines, which supported forced abortions in China, and who regularly implies that Caucasians (direct American male Caucasians in particular) are superior to all other races. <br /> <br /> However, all this will be funny, except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep it a little show on the air after 40 years (or enough money, to bribe some television executives who do not give a damn what they show). The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people, somewhere, must have been watching it and hang on every word. Even if Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt it is, people still listen to it. I do not know if this is funny or scary. I believe a healthy mixture of both.
