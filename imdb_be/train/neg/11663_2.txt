White Chicks Hold on, why they could not be dressed as Black Chicks, oh yes, they would not look different at all. Can anyone give me a Wayans film where they are not dressed, as at home? Nha Be a Menace is not listed, Jack White and Michael Costanzo ghost writing (other members of the Trio Norton served as directors). <br /> <br /> In White Chicks, there's never really any jokes. It simply acts as the Wayans girls for 2 hours. There are no facilities, no punchlines and laughs. There is a lot of "I think I'm going to play a Time Crisis 3." At least for me it was not (5 times, to be exact). <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (only talented), Kim, Rakeesha, George W. and Osama bin Wayans stop making movies. Its only hurts layer O-Zone. <br /> <br /> * with 1/2 RESULTS ****
