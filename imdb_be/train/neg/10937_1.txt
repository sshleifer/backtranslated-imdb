Each time in a long time the film comes, it would be so terrible that I have to warn people. If I work all my days, and I can save but one soul by watching this movie, how great is my joy. <br /> <br /> Where to start my discussion of the pain. To begin with, was a music installation every five minutes. There has been no development of character. Each character was a stereotype. We had to take the oath guy fat guy who eats donuts dumb foreign guy, etc. The script felt as if it was written, the film was shot. The cost of production was so incredibly low that it seemed that I was watching a junior high video presentation. The director, producers, etc. never even seen the film before? Halestorm is getting worse and worse with each new record. The concept of this movie sounds so ridiculous. How can you go wrong with Gary Coleman and heaps more legitimate actors. But believe me when I say this, it all went wrong, all wrong.
