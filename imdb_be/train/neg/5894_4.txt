How many centuries will pass until the Japanese Asian horror / will not give up the ghost of a long-haired woman chips? However, they managed to disrupt the «Ringu» a million times, and often it worked well - which once again proves that originality is not what most of the needs for the horror genre (or that I am very uncritical and easy to please?). However, this time I was a little anxious, a little boring. This is not a bad film, but it's at least half an hour, an hour longer than it should be, with its ridiculous length of 110 minutes. Compared with many other Japanese horror films, OMC lacking atmosphere and excitement. In addition, the end of the confusing: it does not make any sense. As for the ring tone: Miike could come up with a melody that is more efficient than it is forgotten trifle. Despite what was played a dozen times I can not even remember it - that's how it was terrible. Speaking of Miike, for it is something of business, so if someone thinks that they could receive a perversion «Bijita Q» or «Audition» pretend that they spend their time.
