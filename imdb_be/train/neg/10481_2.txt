The film is poorly cast, for some famous old Hollywood names, except. Other performances of unknown names (ie, Jennifer Gabriel) are boring. I've seen other films of this director, unfortunately, this is one of his worst. Perhaps this is a reflection of the script? <br /> <br /> In a positive note, Basinger and productivity Pat Morita saved the film from oblivion. I have enjoyed more than Pat Karate Kid, though. There are a lot of good movies to see, and in general, this one is not one of them. Save your money and celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
