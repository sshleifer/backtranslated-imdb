I got the DVD of "Baba", and it was stunker optional feature. I assumed that it was "The Boogeyman II», because he was paired with the original. But you know what they say about those who "presume": this makes «ass-» with «of u-" and "me." I have read that before watching BII contains a lot of footage from the original, and that it appeared actress Love. While watching "The Return of the Boogeyman," I decided to stay over the original footage to see the proverbial death in the dental scene. Before I knew it, the film was completed. Plagiarism. I think I thought it was striking because it has a similar name to one of the alternate names in biy. Well, at least it was only an optional feature, is not it? <br /> <br /> Let me stop talking about my mistakes and start to talk about the movie bug. Many, many mistakes. Who is this guy Ulli Whatever imagined? Does he really think that the same film will be sold in various forms. There is nothing original holding up Part III. It is basically the memory of the original psychic eye, which give us flour sad to play in the game, how it happens. It's a movie. Oh, and one death from the stereo stage, but you can read that on someone else's review. My interest in "Boogeyman II» lost forever <br /> <br /> Final. Note: This is not a series of films to watch back-to-back.
