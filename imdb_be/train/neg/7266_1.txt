... and yet, as we were told there was one hour and 20 minutes left to go. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why was not there to tell the editor the writer / director snip, snip, snip? It seems that the writer / director previously made shorts; as a short, it would be good. But the lack of dialogue begins to rub in twenty minutes. The absence of many highlights of music. Background noise (talking, movement, and especially the ubiquitous helicopter) are aging very quickly. But the worst failure in history. There is very little short. <br /> <br /> An hour later, we saw a variation of the same scene over and over again. I almost yelled at the screen, "We get it, we get it !!!!!" It is surprising that after that left the theater, we could go home, watch the Daily Show and Colbert Report part, get ready for bed, and I know that the public was still trapped in the theater. <br /> <br /> it is not enough to nurture their vision. You have to give the audience enough to share their vision.
