Who loves terrible "comedy" shows as Little Mosque on the Prairie? Two views of the people, I can think of who are watching this: First, the Muslims and the self-proclaimed liberal defender of each ethnic group, who are so excited to have a show about Muslims, that it does not even matter if you show a good or funny (which it is not). Two, the elderly and people whose idea of ​​comedy is incredibly predictable, poorly written, stale jokes. <br /> <br /> CBC should definitely take a look at what they do and who their audience is. If they keep only write comedy for very old people, then guess what happens, their audience will die off soon and they will not be the audience does not remain. I would be interested, who even wrote for the show? Do you think it is actually Muslim, or hip, funny young people? No, I'm sure that old white guys who were writing the same jokes for as bad CBC shows since the 1960's. <br /> <br /> When you look at CBC comedy show there, Air Farce was only finally just removed from the air (thank God!), but we still have lame ducks as this hour 22 minutes and Rick Mercer that we pay for, not to mention this is a poor excuse for a "comedy" Little mosque on the prairie. It should be offencive and funny? Only the CBC would think that this lame show all offencive or funny. Shame on the CBC for squandering our tax dollars on the show only very few people bother to look.
