I must say that a lot of people say that some of us need to get with the times, cause the new film "The Dukes" is a modernized version. OH PLEASE. If this is what you think then upgraded Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN site also said that (I quote) "you old fogies need to get over it, and apart from him as it is." Well, let me tell you something, I'm 24, so I'm far from that, and OLD FOGIE and I will not be on it, it's a shame all this Hazzard COUNTY. The only thing in the name of the film was "Hazzard". It was all profanity, smoking and drinking is really necessary. The cast was awesome. Jessica was a few morning show to discuss the film and to be honest, I think it's all gone to her head. It does not in any way is Daisy Duke, a coincidence, perhaps, but certainly not the Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not as Bo. They should include the original cast, at least, cameos, but even Hollywood knew that they did not approve of the script. I mean come even today the actors on people expressed a negative opinion, why do some of you, giving positive comments.
