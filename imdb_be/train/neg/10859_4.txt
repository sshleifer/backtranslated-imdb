This is another of the many B minus films with the tag noir hoping to create some interest in something that lacks it. All aspects of the film - script, acting, direction - mediocre. Steps three wires wood. I think John Dall, is expected to go to the place in the movie business, but then someone realized that he had little talent, and so end up doing TV work. Or Jay Cobb, who tend to be a terrific can not rise above the poor script and poor leadership. Jane Wyatt to be a femme fatale, but does not come far to convince the audience. The film has two amazing looking car that I have ever seen, one in which John Dole is after Lee J. Cobb particularly strange. Transfer DVD typical Alfa.
