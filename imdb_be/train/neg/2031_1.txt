While William Shater could always make me smile in that it appears in, (and I especially love it as Denny Crane in Boston Legal), well, it's a show all about Glitz and dancing and screaming and jumping up and down . <, Br /> <br /> He has none of the intelligence Millionaire, none of the flair of the transaction or No Deal. <br /> <br /> This show is not all dancing and nonsense to fill the time. <, Br /> <br /> I watched it, of course, just to check it out. I did watch it for more than 45 minutes, after which I had to turn it off. <br /> <br /> Most of this was William Shatner dancing on stage. He hoot !!! Unfortunately, this show will not make it. <br /> <br /> It is a given
