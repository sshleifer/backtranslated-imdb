After witty Disney live-action George of the jungle, I had high hopes for this film. The main disappointment. Subject bare plot, bad acting, bad visual effects. This film was based on the lame jokes, stupid (and pointless) Product placement, as well as Lamest most annoying side kick in this gadget car things. I took two young children to see him, and they where bored with their mind. Only laughter was from this movie was bad standby, if needing a laugh to show a guy, getting him in the groin!
