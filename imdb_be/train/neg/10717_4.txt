I am giving it a generous four out of ten stars, or point or marker or something. <br /> <br /> It has been immense only two really funny scenes in this film. All scenes with Amy P fairies and Tina and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) moved along quite nicely. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the usual trading patterns, lightning speed, roughly pushing a silly soundtrack, and "soundtrack" generous. <br /> <br /> Anyway, these two really very funny scenes involving Amy P. It is just so much fun in the animal sort of way. It is a mixture of ape man skit they do on SNL and Lucille Ball. <br /> <br /> I hope they (Amy P and Tina Fey) just flat out admitted that they did it for the money, because if he, she gave birth to a parody of Sarah Palin, I think we can to say that yes, it was worth to put the black man back to man the role of a slave who is actually there to help you to be more human. <br /> <br /> Blah. 4 got off 10, as I said, generously. <br /> <br /> But no more girls, okay? Oh, I almost forgot. Mom with "Two and a Half Men" in this film, and she had some plastic surgery so that her mouth looks like the mouth of 30-year-old, so every scene she is, I try to rearrange her face, or to put it together, I think, or simply answer the question: "No, wait. Wait. HAS she had plastic surgery? "As a spectator, you really do not want her to have plastic surgery.
