I can not think of any redeeming features of this very bad rendering on Azimov than directing. Forget about product placement catastrophe, the unconvincing performance by Will Smith and a giant plot-holes. It was not only funny and yet painful to watch. Even the action was boring. A mixture of the values ​​inspired by the MTV production and very bad dialogue, probably aimed at very young children. <br /> <br /> What a shame that it's bad science fiction can still be done after we had BladeRunner, Minority Report, or to a lesser extent, Dark City (same director). This one is really belongs in the lower list 100. Really scary.
