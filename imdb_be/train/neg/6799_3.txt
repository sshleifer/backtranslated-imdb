do not expect this film. In many ways, this film resembles a film that Doris Day played a major role in 1956, the name, Julie. In this film by Doris, who was steward, stewardess, in those days, landed the airship after its upset her husband, played by Louis Jordan shot the captain. She did a much better job, more convincing than Kim Oji, who took control of the 747 and managed to land it without much help from the control tower. I know a little about 747 planes, I use to be a flight attendant himself. Like I said, do not expect from this film, it was done on a cheap budget. Producers were cheap to use aircraft with airline name on it. Oceanic same name, which was used in several films. Just write the name of it was the company that made the plane on this plane.
