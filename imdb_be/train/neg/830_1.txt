I really do not understand all the positive reviews of users. This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I'm not trying to be pessimistic. <br /> <br /> Mendes hot, but scary in this film. But I do not think that it was her own fault, but the directors. He somehow managed to make it look artificial; their actions, idea, makeup, everything. <br /> <br /> The star I give only the idea for the film, which is very poorly executed. <br /> <br /> Sun watch this garbage, go to watch Fellini ~ d, Woody Allen or some of David Lynch.
