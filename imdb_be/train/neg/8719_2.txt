Well, here I go with a friend in the film industry. It is sad enough to see some badly made movies, but I do not care if B or C industry film industry produces. Show some effort in. Symbols are very bad. Actions not covered in the other (surprise), but the plot. As a united team witness his two colleagues scolded, and then, as if nothing had happened. What sickened me was as a writer even threw in the rest of the members of the scene, where they were joking about how good the doctor ass was. Give me a break.
