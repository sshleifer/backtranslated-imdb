The only redemption was a small part of the Larry Miller. It seemed that the film tries too hard to be "Something about Mary", but I do not like this movie, and he still did not meet these standards. The actor, who plays Paul was great, but Selma Blair stuck in her folly harsh. James Brolin was great, but his father Paul thought he was trying too hard to be the character of Randy Quaid National Lampoon's Vacation movies.
