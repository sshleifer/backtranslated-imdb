This show is terrible. George wants his mother's death funny? This show is terrible. Parents obviously horrible, and children should be taken for children's services. The daughter of a witch with a b and son apron. George is not funny, especially when he says it loud and back brand Spanglish. Ernie loser, but at least I laughed at him a few times, but mostly how pathetic he is. George's mother, Benny, in a horrible, despicable character. Of course, her husband left her, but how anyone can laugh at how she treated George as a kid for me. <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain to me how George's head to be a great funny? It's not even so much! I moved from the characters, because they are too awful, and it may take a few hours for me to write, and I, frankly, do not care enough. I care enough to say who is looking at this and I wonder if they want to watch this show, this show is awful excuse for a sitcom and not worth your time. <br /> <br /> I give it two starts because my wife is very attractive.
