So where cannibals? Those who are intrigued by the name and the "real ogre," the appeal of this film will be lowered. Instead, we have shown an amazing man and his repeated visits to the village of Papua New Guinea, full of natives, one of whom was his lover for decades. Man, Tobias Shnibaum New York Jew, as they come and somehow, it is interwoven with documentary as he appears in his yamika in several scenes <br /> <br /> There's no real cannibals here :. Only stories to relay some of the natives themselves Tobias. Not all together bad film. Very interesting and a big cinema. Schneebaum is very pleasant around and gives us a glimpse into the fascinating life that is about as far from Western civilization as you can get. <br /> <br /> It's just not what it says on the cover, and plot summaries. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 children.
