I watched it because I thought that there was going to be a lot of chases and cool cars to look at. I think I was lying. This film is very boring. <br /> <br /> The film begins Stacks Raines (Giovanni Ribisi), sitting beyond checking to make sure that they have the right to Porsche dealership. If they confirm this is the right one, Kip gets a brick out of the trunk and throws it out the window, breaking it. He gets a Porsche while his friend received the keys. They start the car and shoot at night. They deliver it to the warehouse only been followed by the police. Thus, the entire crew of a ditch all the cars, and they parted ways. Then we get an idea of ​​the Memphis Raines. He gives a little speech to a bunch of kids on the go-kart track. Then, he is faced with Utley Jackson (Will Patton). Utley says Memphis, his brother Kip is in deep * * beep. Memphis is known as one of the most famous car thieves in Los Angeles. Memphis goes to dump and meets Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclesten). This guy threatens to kill Bale when Memphis does not deliver 50 cars within 72 hours <br /> <br /> There are several problems with this film :. <br /> <br /> 1.Story: the first 48-hours of film occur when Cage and Duval looking for a crew and plan everything with. Recent 12-hour movie a waste! <br /> <br /> 2. The Cars: You see, maybe 10 cars from 50, as the film touts. So, where are the other 40 cars? Why do not we see them? <br /> <br /> 3. Chase: The chase in the end of the film was a joke. He was not in suspense at all. <br /> <br /> 4. Dog: Somewhere in the film, the dog eats hamburgers and swallows three keys as well. It's impossible. The keys were inverted open. The keys will be severely damaged the dog's esophagus, stomach and colon. Guys show, giving the dog a laxative to help him his karma. It will not work. The dog will get a lot of diarrhea, but no keys. This is stated in Jackass Ryan Dunn was delayed after a toy car up his rectum. Take laxatives a lot of diarrhea but no car. The same is the case with the dog. <br /> <br /> 5. Cop time The Chase: If Eleanor break for a few minutes, Nicolas Cage is desperately trying to start the car. You see a police cruiser behind it, who does not look at his car at all. But just when Nicolas Cage starts the engine again, the policeman jerked his head to the right to see the car, and immediately starts chasing him. This is nonsense. Thus, the right, when he heard the engine start and saw the car, he knew that the car he was looking for. How does he know that this is the right car? He sees only the back of his. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is boring. There's no action. There are very few cars. stupid movie. I've never seen the original, but I plan to. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star out of 10. Get Furious instead.
