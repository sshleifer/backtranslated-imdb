This is one of the most terrible action movies I've ever seen. This is especially due to the large portion of the actual implausibility (as evident agent posing as an employee of a bank loan, making clear that he is talking to someone on the wires or scenes where scientists believe that it is safe to enter the room in which the virus has been released, even if "it has not found a viable host" does not mean that she will never find one), cheap sets (bank looks like it was poorly built to look like a prison), and bad action. This is the story of an organized criminal group, which has been successfully stolen a deadly virus capsule. Nevertheless, the head chef who decides to remove it from the safe of the bank's security, making it at the same time a bank robbery going down the same FBI agents were informed about it, and at the same time terrifying breaks earthquake, needless to say that the earthquake in more than a dirty one. Nevertheless, the results do not make for a tempting militants, but instead, who were obviously Mr class junk from the beginning of the film. (Perhaps this is why some of the screen shots on the package appearance should be created with computer graphics, but not the actual screen shots from different sequences of the film). What the hell, Ron Perlman doing this, I have no idea. I wonder if he was embarrassed to be in it, as I was watching it.
