Maybe fake scenery to spoil the picture? You would not think so, but it's really for me here. Listen, I have a lot of classical cinema era, and I have quite a lot of that, except to know, for example, the driver steering estate car in front of screen, etc. But much of this business has to do with hockey scenes. In order to have a fake sets, fake mountains and flowers shot after shot, as seen in «Brigadoon» gets hurt after a while. <br /> <br /> As far as the music went, it's always subjective. What songs one person loves, another may not, that there should be a big part of the film to judge (or love someone lyrics). I could blow up this film for him sugary 1950 songs, dances, songs and characters, but it was in the 50's and a lot of people like this kind of stuff. Musicals did very well in the 50-ies. Me, I liked the 30's and 40's with a large crane. Until the 50s, the crane was, and this new material - I can - it was. It makes it a lousy movie? No, it just makes one I did not care very much <br /> <br /> Despite a good cast, good director and high expectations, the film bombed at the box office, and with me. I would like it even being a dreamer himself, and it is a good part of this story. I am not cynical type, and a beautiful city and nice people, making me feel good sounds terrible treatment. Then why can not I connect with this film? Some of them were also dance. I do not care about the things that have replaced the water dancing on the screen. But - no - thing really turned that that statement. There was not Scotland or the Highlands, just looking hokey- background to make it so, and it has made me almost from the beginning. One point for today's realism, where they "go to place" most of the time.
