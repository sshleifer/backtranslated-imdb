Wow, what a great premise for a movie: Set it around a filmmaker from writer`s unit that decides to take tango lessons. Hey, what's even better idea to throw a central role cinematographer Who`s interested in tango. Gosh, I'd like that a knack for genius. Yes I`m sarcasm. <br /> <br /> It's surprising to me that this type of zero potential for making films made money. Well, if you`re a rabid fan of tango (I have to admit that they do exist, judging by the comments) or a die hard member of the fan club Sally Potter (?) Not there`s nothing in this movie that will make you run to the cinema to see it. Even if you`re in the tango a large part of the film is taken with goofy scenes at home, getting renovated or people in a wheelchair goes along the road <br /> <br /> Lessons FAST where an unsuccessful writer from Scotland sits in front of a computer, writing very sarcastic, but very exciting movie reviews he`s seen. Gasp in shock when Theo Robertson puts the boot in the latest Hollywood blockbusters, weep in sympathy when he gets another rejection letter from the production company, fall in lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap on his well-toned body. OVERVIEW LESSON soon to the cinema near you, if anyone foolish enough to finance the film <br /> <br /> PS Sally Potter has nothing to do with Harry Potter
