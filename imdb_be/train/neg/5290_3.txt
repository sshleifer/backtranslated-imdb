I'm not usually one for the film slate. I try to see the good points and not focus on the bad, but in this case there is almost no good points. In my opinion, if you're going to do something that bad, then why? Part of the film takes with Anna face frames while she breathes deeply, and violin music playing in the background. the other part is filled with poor and wooden acting. Rupert Penry-Jones is unclear. Jennifer Higham plays younger sister Anna with modern manners. Anne are portrayed as good-natured and very modest, it is good in the beginning, but it remains the same throughout the film, and see no reason to Captain Wentworth, to fall in love with her. In general, the production makes no sense period, too many mistakes to be overlooked, such as the end of the concert, kissing on the street, running through the streets, without a hat on (why this scene in the film at all? In the book scene It was one of the most romantic scenes written.). To sum up, a terrible film, it is very disappointing.
