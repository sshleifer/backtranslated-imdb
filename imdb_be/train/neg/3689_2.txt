The main aspect of the movie superstar at later stages were the frequency gap between one movie and the next. As a well established star of the southern Indian cinema, the feedback he received before Baba were great. <br /> <br /> Since Nattukku ORU Nallavan (1991), the number of films he acted in Tamil as a mass hero was just 11 times in 11 years at a rate of 1 every year. They were all a big hit. It was an image that many thought that can not be easily knocked down. <br /> <br /> But after Padayappa (1999), he entered a state of hibernation. His supporters around the world, especially in South India were ready to see a film of any kind with their superstar in action. Thus, Tamil movie industry decided to go to Baba. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers thought that the fans will accept the fact that they show a Superstar in it. But this is clearly not possible in this film. As usual, deception on the part of the media and the expectations of the fans was well over the limit. <br /> <br /> image Razhnikant was completely damaged. Fans ofigel. movie collection did not meet the expected level. greats reputation went down. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this film were A.R.Rehman songs. Rahman is known, is good music for some of the worst films like Tajmahal, Kadal viruses, Allie Arjun, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, En Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu etc. Well, I never thought that this film will join the league. <, Br /> <br /> you'l feel very depressed, not because of a bad movie, it'l be due to the image of a superstar goes down. It took him a full five years to restore it fully back with two films Chandramukhi and Sivaji and give the fans back what they are really looking for in a movie superstar.
