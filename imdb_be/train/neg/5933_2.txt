I've been a fan since their first album. This film is a disservice to him. Performances, one Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson, except just awful. <br /> <br /> Those Martha Wainwright, Nick Cave, Antony is, and Jarvis Cocker had been particularly annoying. Even one McGarrigle sisters was destroyed by the so-called harmony Martha Wainwright. <br /> <br /> I never saw my wife get up and leave the room on film before and I found myself fast forwarding through the ledge to get to several interview segments, which are also difficult to observe because of the poor camera work. <br /> <br /> There are many of those who were able to interpret the songs of Cohen, Jennifer Warnes, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville, and Willie Nelson comes to mind, but the people selected for the job were just awful . <br /> <br /> I hope there will be another attempt to capture the Leonard Cohen in the film, which will illustrate his insight, talent and intelligence. <br /> <br /> So sad
