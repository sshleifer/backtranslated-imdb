Pretty good movie, but not the real story. <br /> <br /> Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was notorius liar, murder and has never been convicted. New Jersey just did not go for it for the third time, as has already been 20 years. Carter received an offer in 1976: "Go lie test and go free." He did not take. This film should never have been made, but money talks. Many spend their lives unjustly in prison, and no doubt, more blacks than whites. Why fake stories? <br /> <br /> Jens
