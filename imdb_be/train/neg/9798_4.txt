15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the hits that swept the nation, especially the youth. When I was 3 years old child, who lives in the Philippines, I would watch this show every Friday on ABS-CBN (channel 2 there). When the film came out in 1995, he was full of shock and awe to me when I watched it with my dad and two uncles. My grandparents even sent me a box of «Balikbayan» full Power Rangers things (including Megazord figure is easy to assemble and stuffed toys Rangers). I even played video games, and loved only one of them ( «MMPR: Wrestling Edition"), which was really boring. In any case, it was shown that the set step on my interest in the series robots (especially anime mecha series like «Gundam») Now that I'm 18, I would like to think that this show is now quite cheesy to me. To prove this, I took a trip down memory lane, buying 2-DVD set collection «MMPR: The Movie» and «Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie» and watched them both. I was like, «Ugh. How awful. Just another junk in the attic for me. "For all of you, people of my generation, it's not a show you want to watch again and again. I'm not saying to leave it to the rest of your life, but sometimes it's not bad now, is it? Instead of "Power Rangers", I would recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam" (Highly Recommended) "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (aka Ninja Robots), or even the original Sentai shows, which were the basis of «Power Rangers.
