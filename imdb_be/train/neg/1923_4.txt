Ironically, Dr. Seuss tale emphasizing the non-commercialization of Christmas has to be one of the most promoted, sold and successful blockbuster holiday season. Overall are Ron Howard's adaptation is that the poison against the Grinch Christmas is associated with early childhood incident and that the Whos themselves entangled in materialism of the season with the exception of Cindy Lou Who (played very well Taylor Momsen). This film makes a fiery, ambitious attempt to capture the mood and wackiness Seuss stories, but ultimately it's a film that never bends and no packs emotional punch Chuck Jones animated version. Jim Carrey noted in his performance as the Grinch diabolical, but whether it is a dialogue, Shagan or extraneous subplots tricked on the initial portion of the transition from bitter miser to benefactor exultant simply does not ignite convincing. There are some amazing visual effects and make-up work is strange, but in addition there is an element of technical triumphs or two here, that is not enough. <br /> <br /> short? <br /> <br /> Soul? <, Br /> <br /> Or maybe Jones did the original adaptation too well in his 25-minute animated film, which Howard is behind a movie that feels as much as three hours. Howard, Carrie, and the team is very capable and talented, but what seems to be a winning combination is just weak, and perseverance in the final product. If you need to see the full-length version, remove it on video with the animation version of Jones, and you can see how more and glitzier is not always better. I give this movie three banks Who-Hash of five.
