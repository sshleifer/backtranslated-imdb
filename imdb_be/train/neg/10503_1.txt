yesterday I saw this film .. I rented a DVD from Blockbuster .. In fact, I know one of the actresses from the movie .. I will not say who ..! (It is kept under lock and key ..) But I have to admit that it was not as good as I thought it would be .. Savinykh? Hats down to this guy .. But it is a shame that he was not in the film for a long time .. What the film lacks the idea, script, sound, etc .. It may seem like a good movie .. but it WASN «t, that entertainment .. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm glad that my sister had paid £ 10 for rent 3 DVD from Blockbuster .. I chose this .. and I was disappointed. Anyway, thumbs down for me ..! Not my cup of tea! 0 out of 10!
