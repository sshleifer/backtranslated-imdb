When people ask me what the worst movie I have ever seen is his friend. It is not even close to the level of MST3K reefs or watching midnight in the theater, or even as a Disney Channel late at night filler. The only time I ever wanted to jump off a trip to Disney World (or Disney / MGM Studios, in this case) had to grab a jacket Dick Tracy from dummy, rip it into pieces, and ram it down the throat guides saying "Eat this ! Eat this ugly dark coats !!! "I've never been so angry in the film, even" Nutty Professor II: Klump Family "or« Flash Gordon ». You want beautiful colors and cinema? Not here baby. Reviewers continue to say, "Oh, but it is too similar to a comic strip," Well, to me, its colors Gordito after a few weeks in the sun. About nice too. Beatty roam the landscape to jump around and talk for hours, he, and sometimes on other actors, hoping that someone would tell him that the time to start shooting continued. To be fair, I've only seen the movie once, but my threshold of pain in humans, not God.
