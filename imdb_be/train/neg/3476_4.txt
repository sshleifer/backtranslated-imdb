I liked it, I really did. Please do not think I'm an idiot, but I have to admit that I enjoyed this film. I expected it to be crap, it was shit, but sometimes it is the OK, to relax and watch a crappy movie that you should not focus too much on it not so? I did not expect any hidden meanings or Morales, nor any case, but it does not matter, because I only watched it for fun, and it was to entertain me everywhere. Movies like this are why Ben Stiller (sorry, "there's something about Mary") and Vince Vaughns (but spelled his name, I could not be bothered checking) have jobs. It is normal to see a shit movie as long as you do not expect too much from him, and I for one must take a stand, jogging, perhaps to run, but not to go, because I do not have a car, Blockbuster Video, or even an option, and take a bunch of toilet indulges movies and stay one night, watching them. Good day to you the reader. P.S, if not to say that this comment helped you, I do not love you if you say that it helped, God bless you, you'll go to heaven.
