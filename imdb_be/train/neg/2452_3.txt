Watching it again recently, I found that it was nice to see how they genuinely sought to bring the book to the screen, even if the budget is poor and stilted actors meant the inevitable failure. By any objective measure it was a disaster, but I found it to be just a fantasy, like a good movie Lord of the Rings may be, if someone had to do one sincerely - and with the money to hire the most talented artists and writers. Unfortunately, thanks to Jackson, it would be impossible for a long time. <br /> <br /> Looking at this movie, I was left with the impression that any of the budget at all, this story simply can not be stuffed up. Fantasy only provides so many opportunities for creating interesting film. There were many moments in this film that were potentially more interesting than the way that Peter Jackson did it, though, of course, you should always use your imagination because of poor performance. The way they tried to show the shadowy world from the point of view of Frodo, for example. Or so that Galadriel showed Sam, what's going on at home in another <br /> <br /> Another thing that I really appreciated in this version. - quiet moments. There were moments when the dialogue spoken, without background music against even reverse the fall. Compare this to the grand soaring chambers from Jackson's films and intrusive bill that seemed designed to emphasize how each scene was the most penetrating and powerful scenes we've ever looked. Jackson's movies were full of their own importance, it was quieter and much more modest. <br /> <br /> Jackson and hit it together with more than $ 270 million dollars in production costs at least $ 90 million more for marketing, a massive benefit from the Government of New Zealand, as well as get huge savings from filming new Zealand, USA Sun Nevertheless, despite the marketing claims, the intention to be faithful was never there. It is well-documented. Philippa Boyens said in an interview, when she said that they intentionally did not reread the book before writing the script. Jackson also said that they were originally intended to make the fantasy film "in-line" lord of the rings, and that one he really wanted to do, Return of the King, because there were a lot of battles, but not the nature of development. <br /> <br /> In contrast, the film tries to be more accurate. Of course, things were not so, the effect was terrible, and pretty much all sunk, and the pace was too fast. Naturally, they cut a lot, and adapt other scenes, and for that they deserve. While Jackson has added a lot of scenes that do not serve any purpose of the plot, the book cut scenes Bakshi, who did nothing to advance the plot in any way. There's actually an interesting similarity between the structure of the films and Jackson Bakshi about the beginning - is that they are both different from the original books in the same way - although, of course, some of this may be a coincidence <br /> <br />. it was not a good film, but the potential was there. Bakshi told the Onion AV Club that only animation can make a lord justice of the ring. His version does not work, but he may have been right.
