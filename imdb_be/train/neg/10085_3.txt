Why all the movies on Lifetime this anemia name? "Unexpected love" - ​​oh, so provocative !! "This much I know," it would be better. Nothing special film. Real people do not say how these characters are doing and the situation really hackneyed. Direct the woman who "makes" a lesbian seemed more than a butcher lesbian character. If you want to watch two hot women kissing in a very careful way, you can enjoy it. Although it seems that it was written by someone who does not really come out into the light, to observe people. Why am I wasting my time writing about it?
