This is the reason of the complex, the inherent minority, which often occurs when Finland is trying to export something. <br /> <br /> Lordi's not scary. Lordi is lame.

Of course, they won the Eurovision Song <br /> <br /> No, wait. - they won the Eurovision Song Contest. That's all. I rest my case.
