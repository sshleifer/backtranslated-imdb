This movie was so badly written, directed and acted, it beggars belief. He should be revamped with a better script, director and casting service. The biggest problem is in force. Do you have a Jennifer Beals on the one hand, which is polished, professional and totally believable, and on the other hand, Ri'chard, which is very miscast and a concussion in this particular part. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine awful as a slave possess (and keeping) a pair, although both usually do an excellent job. Actors (and the director) did not try to focus on all - they are incompatible and unbelievable. Much better focused to do a good job on the English language. Casting ridiculous. Why do children merchant "African" (hence, less socially desirable for Gens de Couleur society) were cast from very pale skin actors, while ostensibly socially desirable by Marcel, has pronounced African features, including, obviously, painted light "here"? It is as if casting directors can not be bothered to read the script and they were cast to select the appropriate actor from a large pool of highly talented and physically different color cast. It's just so weird! This can be a great film, and needs to be redone, but with people who respect the material and can select suitable and qualified actor. There are a lot of good actors out there, and it would be interesting to see how Jennifer Beals, Sanzhato and Gloria Reuben will do with the respective cast, a good script and a decent direction.
