Waldemar Daninsky (Our Paul) went to Tibet and was bitten by a yeti, which causes it to become a werewolf. He accidentally killed after he attacked him cheating wife and her lover, and later revived female scientist, Dr. Ilona Ermann, which uses it in experiments on mind control. Daninsky later discovers an underground shelter inhabited bizarre subjects failed medical experiments. <br /> <br /> Learning about Naschy death with colleague John Kitley, I rummaged in my collection suitable film to watch. In my struggle, I found I have not one, but three (!) Copy of "Rage Wolfman». The film of questionable quality video, audio duplicated in a mediocre fashion, cinema is its native style slapstick at times. And American versions have two love scenes removed. Frankly, without remastered, uncut copy, I really was not getting a proper cinema in all its glory. <br /> <br /> This film pretends to fourth place in the long series about the werewolf Count Waldemar Daninsky. I suspect that's true, but you do not know it from the film itself. The plot is convoluted at times, not really no indication that it is a sequel. If you read the plot summary on Wikipedia and compare them with what is printed on the box, you will see that I am not alone in my confusion. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the film's shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand development hell he was. Although floating around for years, it was released only in 1973 due to problems in finding a distributor. And Naschy said in his autobiography that director, Zabalza, was an incompetent drunk, and that he could not stand working with him. Those actually are not easy charge, and I have no idea what Zabalza had to say on his own behalf. <br /> <br /> Most likely, sooner or later you will run into a low-grade version with "Fury of the Wolfman». He appears in three packs of different sets and boxes, so that you can accidentally get it and do not even know. What is really needed is an American director's option, with decent sound and video mix and love scenes thrown back. As far as I know, it does not exist. Let us appreciate the legacy of Paul ours and get their films to a wider audience in the level of quality it deserves.
