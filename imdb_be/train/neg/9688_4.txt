Greenaway's films are as intelligent, erudite and innovative. However, his style and grammar occur and remind viewers of the films made in the first World War 1 era of filmmaking: the frame of the composition, the use of the middle frame, the static camera. It can be good to rub against the mainstream movies with this style, but it is not new. Maybe, like the other "pioneer", TS Eliot, he draws more from the past than looking forward, as a true innovator would or could. <br /> <br /> However, the biggest drawback Greenaway that he can not write. His dialogue and even the plot structure of mechanical and logical, but without the life force of another dramatic logic, Brecht. Where this is the most obvious weakness in its humor, which balances and logically, so that the joke is dead before it is delivered. As a result of boredom, if it's not funny, it was not possible: set the comedian to justify their actions when the public does not respond. Maybe read a director can learn something from Freud to humor. <br /> <br /> And finally, as Woody Allen Greenway manipulated his actor for many years to work as a clone. They say the line with boring, complacent air, like a narcissistic teenagers. <br /> <br /> This film, in spite of its design and lighting, is a sham.
