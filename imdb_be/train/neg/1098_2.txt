I got this film in $ 5 silo in Walmart. I would not recommend watching this step. I could give it to one of my friends when I'm angry at them and want to suffer for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I looked at the cover and mileage summary and thought that it was a war movie. I would like to know how sad this film was supposed to be before turning it on. It was my mistake to think that something will happen in this movie. It's just a group of people who go from one camp to the other boot. Drilling sargents refers to the soldiers is very bad, and the main character is trying to help people get out of combat in Vietnam <br /> <br /> So, here's my rant about the movie :. For me, this film is slow and difficult to watch. It was just one of those movies that you put in and stuck to watch because you want to turn it off, but your hanging on the line, hoping that he can pick up before the end. It does not. After the film was finished, I through it behind my because I T. I was angry that I spent almost 2 hours of my life watching it, and another 10 minutes to write this review to warn people about this.
