Oh so familiar comedy story about a low-key nice guy Paul (Jason Lee), who after the night of his bachelor party, waking up in bed with Becky (Julia Stiles), an attractive blonde he met only the night before. After lying about his fianc√©e, Karen (Selma Blair), he is forced to tell more and more lies to cover his tracks. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most of us have witnessed the story as it at least once before ... on film or on television. The film is very predictable and formulaic, with the ending you can see coming a mile away. <br /> <br /> At least the cast provides some interest and keeps it watchable. Or just in particular, and Stiles lot of fun in a light-hearted comedic roles very different from serious roles she usually plays. Becky free spirit who seems to change jobs as often as other people change their clothes. <br /> <br /> But you know, this is not well written. At least one question remains unanswered: what, in fact, is Ray (Locklin Monroe), a brutal ex-boyfriend of Becky investigated IA <br /> <br /> And I do not like the character of Buck? (Kokner) stepfather Paul he is a super-unpleasant moron who got on my nerves so quickly I asked for someone to knock him <br /> <br /> Add more debit. disinterested, uncredited cameo by comedian / actor Larry Miller, once again playing the croaker (in this case, it's a bit justified - his character is an ultra-conservative minister) <br /> <br /> Or is not good at all, but, I usually give it three out of ten for me, based on. throw efforts alone.
