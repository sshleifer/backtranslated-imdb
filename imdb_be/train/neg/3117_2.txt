My husband is a big fan of Robin Williams. I love him, but, as a rule, found that he should "follow what he does best," and focus on comedic roles. My thoughts were confirmed with this film. I was completely bored throughout the film. History was predictable. I understand, that was inspired by a true story. But I think that there may be some suspense or intrigue even with the truth in history. None of the characters were not well developed. was a side story about the main character and his partner . This bond may be further explored Ana. More important, however, would be more in-depth study of the mother, "the boy." Her psychological profile would be interesting to delve into. She obviously has a long history, which was not affected, except in the most superficial way. If my husband was not so a big fan of the Williams, we have 20 minutes left in it. it is a pity that I can not get $ 20 or 2 hours ago.
