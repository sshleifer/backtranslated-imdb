This film is mostly crap and the only reason this movie is worth watching, because Jean-Claude Vam Damme stars in this movie.There some good scenes in this film, and the best of them at the end of the film. <, Br /> <br /> act in this film is so bad, and the worst acting I have ever seen, and 2 actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White can not act in this film ALL.And should certainly be one of the Jeanne Claud Vam Dammes worst films he has made, and if and what to watch him in one of his greatest films, and should watch Bloodsport, kickboxer, or sudden death. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is shit / OK and has a rating of 4 out of 10.
