Spoiler alert. <br /> <br /> When the sister of the main character is pushed down the stairs, the killer smashes a glass of vodka next to her to pretend that she was drinking. But just before she dies, she says business partner of his sister (Harry Terry) on the phone, she did not have a drink in 4 days. However, the police did not mention the results of the toxicology report! And the characters say that she was drunk when she fell down the stairs. And? In fact, a bad mistake in this film, which is pretty awful in general. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly bad considering the large cast. Some drawbacks: writing is not very good, the music is made for bad TV, and there is no stress at all, because we already know the answer to the riddle of the first scene in the film.
