One of, if not the worst film to come out of the UK in the 80s. <br /> <br /> This is a tasteless story about a middle aged lecher who two teenage scrubbers "lures" to babysit for him and his faux-chic wife has nothing to redeem it. <br /> <br /> In turns gratuitous, frivolous, uncouth and unrealistic, this film is paving depth, it fails miserably in their attempts to be funny, provocative, intelligent and contradictory. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst thing about this film is how strong cast of George Costigan, Michael Holmes and Finneran fully sewn in such a lame script. It is not surprising that it is only the work of Andrea Dunbar, who died to make it to the screen. Full and complete nonsense at every level.
