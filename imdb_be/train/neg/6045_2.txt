It's an interesting idea gone bad. Hidden meanings in art remains as the serial killer keys sounds intriguing, but the execution is in "anamorphic" painfully slow and without much interest. There's no other way to describe this film, except boring. Proof of death are the only interesting part of the "Anamorphic". All connecting them tedious. Willem Dafoe gives reliable work as a researcher, but it has nothing to do with the script that is stretched to the limit. Several supporting character actor wasted, including Peter Stormare as a specialist art, James Rebhorn as the police chief, Paul Lazar, as the medical examiner, and especially Debbie Harry, which is indicated on the back of the DVD casing, but only has a pair lines spoken through a crack the door. Not recommended. - MERK
