I saw this movie right after the end of the book, and may have been the idea of ​​a neutral or very stupid. I think it was the last. First of all, it was inaccurate in many small but important details. One of the first things I noticed was, during the day Winston in their daily lives in their work, talking, eating in the dining room, etc., he feels free to look miserable and make suggestive views on people who do not They have a huge fear. One of the most important parts of the book, is that even in small measures, it was almost impossible to safely show even a hint of his true emotions on his face at any moment. This is also shown in the scenes on the streets proletarions. In the book, Winston knew it was a huge risk to wander around there, and was skeptical and scared on every trip. While in the movie, he does it so often and without fear that you will lose an important feeling heavy surveillance and risks right from the bat. <br /> <br /> Other inaccuracies included Winston hiding her diary in the wall, but a very small change, but the question arises, what is the point? It was also the most annoying thing a director can do with the book, and it is morphing characters. <br /> <br /> Large discrepancies were much more alarming, however. First of all, one of the most important parts of the book is that Big Brother government on the basis of reasonable, even crude philosophy. In the film, they skip that and go straight to making you think that the government is run by Hitler with the technology. However, in a sense, when the director with his fascism, but if that's all you get with Big Brother, you really missed the point of the book. The terrible thing about Big Brother is that, in a sense, it has some moments that lie in his philosophy. If O'Brien is gaining in mind Winstons in the Ministry of Love, he listens to all, Winston says against Big Brother. The fact that he listens, and is moving forward in his philosophy, because that is the most terrible and intriguing. In the end, (SPOILER cautiously forward), when Winston says he loves Big Brother, terrible thing is that you are not sure whether it souly beatings and torture, that the reason for this, or the actual power behind the philosophy. I am in no way saying that the philosophy of Big Brother there are times that appeal to me, but his intelligence and depth that makes this book extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> In addition, someone can feel any connection between Julia and Winston in the film? It was awful, no connection. <br /> <br /> And where was O'Brien before he gave his address Winston? One of the things that carried the book was Winston thought OBrayno before he came into contact with him. In the film, they are just ahead of the <br /> <br /> But what about sums up why this movie was terrible adaptation:., Because it is impossible not to be ahead and morphing characters in less than two hours. How can one think that this film was watchable if it had been for two hours? At least, the film requires 3 hours to be able to capture some of the most important attitudes and connections. Anything less is simply meaningless. <br /> <br /> If you liked this book, and I mean really loved him, did not approve of this movie, and, most likely, you already knew that you would not. Since the book unfilmable, and this movie just proves how impossible to cram something decent in a small reel. <br /> <br /> Two stars out of ten
