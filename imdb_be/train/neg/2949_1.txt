Wow ... what would you do with $ 33m? Let me give you a choice; You can either a) grind it up and flush it down the toilet, or b) to make a film based on the premise Whoopi Goldberg as a toughie futuristic cop partnered with a rubber dinosaur that uses terms such as "I do not butt-pipe" and blowing raspberries at the based on it's funny right, would you choose the option that has more advantages -.. flushing down the toilet <br /> <br /> it must see to believe I can not even find the words to describe how bad. . He even this film does not fit into the "so bad - it's good" category . I actually have it on TV as I write - and while watching, I felt the need to come to the IMDb and register my disgust <br /> <br /> Given Jurassic Park was made a few years ago, both on the ground, did. they think that viewers will no longer tolerate a man wearing a rubber suit? WG should be just walking and damn the consequences .. All interested parties will go to hell for this criminal waste of money <br /> <br /> I I must stop writing - I'm going to erode.
