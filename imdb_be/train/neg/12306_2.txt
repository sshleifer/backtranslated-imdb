This film is a pure failure. I am a supporter of Steve Martin, but even he can not save a tired idea and Swiss cheese script. Think "Police Academy 7" and apply it to the military parody. Ugh. <br /> <br /> I do not feel more suited comments portrayed a bad rating the film received (and rightfully earned!). This is extremely misleading. I have often seen this film marked up to $ 3.00 at the grocery store, and now of course, I know why. <br /> <br /> If only I could get my 90 minutes ago ...
