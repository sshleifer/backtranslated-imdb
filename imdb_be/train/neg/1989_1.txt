I would give this movie a zero, but that was not an option !! This movie sucks !!! Women can not act. I had to know what was going to suck when I saw Bobby Brown. No one in my house could believe that I have never changed the channel after the first 15 minutes. the idea of ​​black women as the shooters in the western days is ridiculous. is not just a race thing, it is also the floor. a combination of two things ridiculous.i very sorry, because some people in the movie is not bad actors / actresses, but the movie itself was horrible. it is not credible as a movie. it can be "entertained" to a particular group of people, but I'm not in this group. lol. and using a large line of great, great movie ... "that's all I have to say about it."
