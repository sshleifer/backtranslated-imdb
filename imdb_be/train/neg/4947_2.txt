Dieter, a famous composer and producer a bit cheesy pop music in Germany hits such as "You're my heart, you're my soul" felt the need to tell their story - and gracefully, he decided to hire a ghost writer. The result was a funny book about his life. Well, more or less blurred image of this. He does not deny that he is a selfish asshole, but this story has been twisted to match his image of himself. Not a word, that he would probably beat his ex-wife, and she was in the hospital. However, it was written in a funny style and a huge success after its emergence as a jury member of the German version of «American Idol». - especially his memorable comments <br /> <br /> This should be the end of the story - in fact. The fraud referred to «Idol» TV show called «Deutschland Sucht den Superstar» (abbreviated DSDS) someone had to come up with a terrible idea to make a movie out of the book. As a result, «Dieter - der Film» <br /> <br /> I have rarely seen a film that is desperately trying to be funny and not so. None of the jokes really gets to the point. voice and style to speak Naddel was getting on my nerves at once, though the voice Verona had to do it more. Obviously, children, predictable and long-lasting fun destroy any motivation to see this movie until the end for a few minutes. The content of the film is the film adaptation of sloppy sloppy written down a ghost writer on the basis of inaccurate idealized memory Bohlen. They could use this freedom to do almost anything. He was supposed to be satire, but they failed. History completely uninteresting, and the fact that von Bohlen's voice itself ensures that the entire film has nothing satirical in general. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that considered bad for the release of the movie. The probability that this thing will be rotten in some archive was quite high until recently, when the current season of DSDS proved a mediocre success. With "friendly" means of the largest yellow press of the newspaper "Bild" in Germany and in a desperate situation for the channel the RTL, to have something in the program, yet invincible show "Wetten Dassin ...?" Powered by Channel 2 film finally arrives on TV . - unfortunately, <br /> <br /> Watching this film is a waste of time - there are, of course, the best cartoons much more fun and history is really worth a look at <br. /> <br /> Therefore: 2/10
