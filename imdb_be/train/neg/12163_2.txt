Absolutely rotten slasher has a soothing quality. It has Camp Counselor Angela (Pamela Anderson..awful as a murderer, she smiles as she spends the people do not even funny) on the warpath killing teenagers acting the least bit naughty or resist her pleas for good behavior. Runs range of drilling, the clich√©d murder, such as a sharp decline to the throat of a child looking for his Freddy clawed gloves, a child who receives a chainsaw, a girl who gets drilled, the one who gets stuck in the toilet (filled with leeches), the who roasted, etc. <br /> <br /> It does not have a single original idea to offer and it's just a waste of time. That is, if you do not want to see (Ally, who plays the whore) tits Valerie Hartmen years. In most cases, the violence occurs off-screen, so even that is not satisfied.
