(SPOILERS in this) <br /> <br /> «Rosenstrasse» is a film about heroic women in the German Nazi time. But it is too long, it does not apply to, and sometimes even boring! There are too many clichés and not enough good acting. <br /> <br /> The story (story line) bad. As in James Cameron's Titanic old woman remembers the events of her living. Well, now there we were able to view. Than there is another woman presented who does the same thing. Mix in the fact that they both remember the events of other people's lives! Come on! This ignorance of the basic stories ... As Riemann know the fate of the little girl and her mother's questioning, for example? <br /> <br /> scenes are shown in the wrong order and you know rare, when it happened. For example, the scene where the Riemann offers for Fabian. When did this happen? The scene looks like it's set in the twenties ... <br /> <br /> Riemann's character, of course, a talented pianist, well, she even Baroness! Wow. Her brother returned from the Eastern Front, he received «Ritterkreuz», which he shows in some scenes. Thus, he is a hero of the war and is still a wonderful person who has kept his conscience. And he received the knowledge of the massacres committed by the Germans. He even took a few photos! And so on, cliché after cliché is accumulated and that is why the film does not work. <br /> <br /> Basically, von Trotta made a chick flick of something that might be a decent movie. And in the end, it's all very simple. Riemann finds a way to get into bed and Goebbels - ta-da! - it's all free. That is not a historical fact, but a pure idea, despite the "true story" claims in the beginning. As "Audacity" is unclear based on true events. <br /> <br /> It's sad but it's true, this is a typical German theater these days. This is bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
