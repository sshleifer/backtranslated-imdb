Stupid and just amazing film about a child who gets injured when he learns that Santa is not real (???). It grows and becomes an adult (Brandon Maggart), who makes lists of people that are unruly or good. One Christmas, he snaps and sets out to kill the naughty man - dressed as Santa know <br /> <br /> sad and just a bad killer Sant movie .. If you are looking for gore, it's not here. Only a few of these killings are shown, and they are not what the mountain with a very fake effects. Much of the film contains only Brandon Maggart talking to himself and slowly going mad. Scenario banal acting is terrible, and it leads to the final, which had me watched slack-jawed at the TV. Seriously, I had to rewind the tape and watch it again to make sure I was not hallucinating! In fact, really a poor ending. <br /> <br /> If you want to rent a frightening Christmas film "Black Christmas" (the original version of the 70s --- not a terrible remake). Avoid this one at any price.
