I went to the D-War on a whim and with very low expectations. The film failed to meet them <br /> <br /> I am not against history, which continue credulity -. Remember Reign of Fire? - but I expect that they will be internally consistent. The film jumped from howler howler on without a break, all mixed with special effects that are far behind from such LOTR or even Godzilla. <br /> <br /> shape change mystical warrior from Korea, curiously metamorphosed in the Caucasus antiquarian and pops like Deus Ex Machina, to get a hero unlucky with their latest mash. Special Agent of the FBI, which seems to be fully extended to the ancient Korean folklore because of the wonderful "paranormal division," the Fed - passed unnoticed until now. Lovers kissing on a deserted beach, where one exclaims: "I never wanted this to happen." The reincarnation of a pair of long-dead Koreans who "died as amateurs unfortunate." Mystical suspension, faceless hordes of soldiers, robots (to many orcs Peter Jackson) and snakes, who spends as much time snarling that every time he was elected prey within reach of it comes to distract him. <br /> <br /> dialogue appalling acting is wooden and the overall effect was, frankly, exhausting. However, for me the wreath moment was at the end, after the finale, the music for the end credits was - Arirang! It's rather like Akira Kurosawa closing "Run" with karaoke performance of My Way -. And let me be clear that I am in no way comparing director Shim with Kurosawa <br /> <br /> In short, indulgent self dull collection of clich√©s and narrative nya-sequituurs, which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so popular in the Qur'an of popular culture, but it should not be worth the ticket price for any serious film goer -. or even not so serious a movie goer I would suggest that it is bypass the cinema in general, and to go straight to video, but I can not even convince yen that it costs so much.
