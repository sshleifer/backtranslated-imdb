There's no doubt about it, the first film was a commercial product Azogo; This was an adaptation of the popular manga and kicked out of the young, attractive actors and, of course, is not enough in the budget department. However, it is more than entertaining for what it was, and I can not deny it, loved it. <br /> <br /> Â«Azumi 2" lacks just about everything that made the original so great. The first thing you need to set alarm bells ringing is the absence of miraculous Ryuhogo Kitamura at the helm. With him, he seemed not only its own visual style and kinetics, but the style of the original beauty and, most importantly, his heart. While the first was a simple "plot" the results list, this one has a corkscrew mess stories, too many sad characters stabbing each other in the back so many times, the potential for compassion and pathos erased. Disappeared effective interaction between the protagonists; Azuy and her cohorts are often reduced to a bunch of wayward teenagers arguing in the forest. Feature is not there; if someone looks really cares who lives and who dies, I'll be shocked. The same applies to the villains here. The final battle - in fact all the battles - completely devoid of any tension. The fact that they are bad and choreographer plaintively aims - not to mention small and far apart - it did sideline his own net a complete zero. Villains themselves are trying too hard to be mannerism, and even if they were all together, they do not come to a country mile antics of Pete Burnsian from Joe Odagiri in the original. <br /> <br /> ## ## Major spoiler at the end of the item! ##### <br /> <br /> Aya Ueto tries his best, that has to be said, and it has also managed to keep their hair in good condition between the films. Azay is now a full-fledged assassin, meaning it can wave his sword around in slow motion; Unfortunately, the character is now instilled with some guy Unnamed mystery style model looks Ueto becomes even more absurd. I know that this must be a point, but it is combined with the inefficiency of the rest of the film, the stupidity of the plot and generally smile movie as a whole means that it is absolutely impossible to get for her character this time around, the less said Chiaki about "Remember me Kill Bill" Kuriyama performance better; suffice it to say, her "turn" from good to evil, about the same as thin napalm. <br /> <br /> In general, it was just a huge disappointment. All the advantages of this really has been made ten times better than in the first film. Lazy, poor - and all very sad - a mess.
