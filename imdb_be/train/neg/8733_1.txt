*** Possible Interference land *** <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Hopper. I asked why he took the role of a police detective in 2000, extending the Ground. This film is flat out sucks, and I'm going to tell you why. <br /> <br /> This is a small town, who is going to get a deal in the sports arena. One catch: there is a killer on the loose, and it's bad for business. The mayor makes a deal with the Irish mafia to find the killer and make sure that it never makes it to the court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants this guy caught, too, but he's on the level, and believes that in the system. He wants to see the system do its job. <br /> <br /> This can be very good. This could be riveting. It was awful. First, they call this guy is a serial killer. Err no. There are certain criteria, and none of them are not suitable here. Bad guy killed 5 children on the first day, and I think it was a 2 on the second day. This whole film covers the time period of 48 hours .... It is unlikely that a serial killer action. I do not care what warped motives that they give him in the end, Serial killers do their work for a long period of time. They do not just suddenly kill 7 children for two days. It Spree. <br /> <br /> Well, that stimulus towards action was brutal. The only name that was here Hopper, and he is the only one who came even close to pulling off a part of it. Unfortunately, it is a kind of type casting to me, and I think he does a psycho side is much better. It just was not a good way to Hopper. She did not allow him to do what he does best, which is to operate all terrible. This is not something that he has done bad, it's what I saw him do it much better <br /> <br /> The Irish Mob guy, John Galt. (Tom Makkamus - Long Day's Journey Into Night), which is responsible for their research is just over the top of a solid. Contradiction? Not really. He tries to play a cold, hard kinda guy, and he makes it to the fact that the character is just wooden. Sadly max. He does not scare me. He has not caused any emotion all but boredom. I can not tell you how many times I checked to see how long it will be before the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that it was the feeling of a made for TV movie, you know what I mean. Poor production values, a low budget, re-use scenes to cut costs. Just like that. They? But I feel, comparing this with the fact it is an insult to them. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlint was both director and cinematographer on the project. He has bitten off more than he can chew. I can not help feeling that Hopper must have accepted this role as a personal favor to a friend. This is the only rational, I can think of. It was the first work Vanlint as a director, the third as a filmmaker. I hope it was an experience for him. <br /> <br /> I will not spoil the ending, if you decide to torture yourself with this, but I want to say that they all fell to the ball here. ..even Hopper. In a scene that was emotionally turns to a detective, it was just..well .. lo. I do not see any fear because all that will accompany the overall gearchange this guy did. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> This is a grueling 100 minutes Rating R for violence and language. No child will not be under 13 years old have no interest at all watching it, so no worries there. It is not suitable for those who one way or another. heh. <br /> <br /> Skip this one. You'll thank me later.
