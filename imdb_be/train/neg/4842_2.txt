Who did the research for this film? It is installed in Baghdad in 2004, but all the soldiers are dressed and have a needle all the Universal Camouflage Pattern gear. No one was wearing that stuff in 04. <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie, while deployed overseas, and I can say that the overwhelming feeling the audience was WTF? This film does not make sense if the characters come and go without explanation, and people do funny things that would never happen in real life. I understand that this is a movie, but this is obviously trying to portray something realistic. He fails miserably, but he's trying. <br /> <br /> It's like someone came up with a bunch of random ideas, chewed and swallowed them, and then threw the tape. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I still do not know why I sat through the whole thing. GI Joe was the one that really made you think, in comparison with this. Do not come!
