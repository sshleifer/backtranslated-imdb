This film is about a very sexy Olympic track star, who is hired to coach high school basketball team boys. It looks like Goldie Hawn Wildcats, it stars Cathy Lee Crosby in the title role, and it does, about the same as the script allows. I think Raquel Welch would be the best choice, but given the seeming budget television movie film, they probably could not afford it. Kathie Lee looks great in every frame, but we never see her completely naked. The story is quite predictable, to put it mildly, does not offer any surprises. Young and happy Michael Biehn has a male lead. He is the star of the team, as well as the love interest Kathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has some funny scenes, like a rich man who runs the sports program, and does not think that a woman should coach the sport. This point is brought up throughout the film, and, of course, dated. Ironically, Kathie Lee puts his team through any unorthodox practice sessions; she did male coach will not do not do. There is a funny story line involving the high and not very bright player who undergoes hypnosis in order to pass their classes and play as a professional basketball player Sidney Wicks. It looks like everyone had a good time making this film, but the only real reason to see it for Cathy Lee Crosby. It is not so great actress, but she has a dazzling smile, beautiful hair, and very brown body.
