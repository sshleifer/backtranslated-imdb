Well, finally see a remake of last night in London, unintentionally hilarious, neuter and devoid of any real humor. I really do not know where to start, while I was entertained by this awesome respect, it does not really touch me. Acting strangely unnatural, no original music, the costumes too "Disney" is ridiculous "six months later" inserted after the burning of Nic Cage (who did not come fast enough for my taste) bit with Cage in a bear suit had audience suppressing fun, as did comedy stamping of different "villains" of the island. It's such a strange remake that I cant fully believe what I saw, I was reminded of something that would make a comic gifts in the eighties, a bit like a Hollywood interpretation of their hit miner, very strange!
