Hello, <br /> <br /> This is my first post in IMDb, even if I use it as a reference material for quite some time. Therefore, I would like to welcome you all. The fact that I am a Greek will inevitably influence my decision, I hope, not your irritation. <br /> <br /> I spent 2 years of my life (we all did the Greek actually), analyzing Omirus epic (and not Homers, as you see everywhere), rhyme rhyme. If I remember well it was Iliada (Iliad) in the 8th grade and Odysseia (Odyssey) in the 9th grade. Troy Warner, was a big disappointment for me and my fellow Greeks around campus (I'm in the UK). <br /> <br /> The Iliad epic is one of the best works of literature ever done. It was written by the Greek poet Omirus as much as 400 years after the actual war. Historians put the Trojan War around 1200 BC, but the true cause of the war is not the beauty of Helena, but the strategically important position of Troy. It is said one can now understand that Omirus epic without presenting real events (as this is not true historically), but this has never been the purpose of this work. <br /> <br /> As you read this great poem, you can find yourself wondering to themselves definitions of honor, love, anger, hatred, heroism, discipline, loyalty and so on. The best part and the most educational, and there were these long negotiations between warriors for battle. None of them, though not found in "TroyÂ» <br /> <br /> Troy Warner was very cheap in my eyes, and other intelligent people English Finnish and German colleagues have. It's a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. Incidentally perfect storm was bad and stupid blockbuster (computers did all the work schedule), and yet it is the best work by Wolfgang Petersen. <br /> <br /> I conclude saying that you would be better to see something else instead. I would give Troy 2 out of 10. It is a very expensive B movie. <br /> <br /> Cheers <br /> <br /> Alex
