At one point, when it seemed it gets interesting, he never got there. <br /> <br /> People go from one point to another, with really no sense (if there was one it was very sad). There has not been any action, suspense or any horror and characters were rather callous, so there was no worries, what happened to them. <br /> <br /> All together, the film was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3/10. <br /> <br /> I like that it was not jerky shaky camera work, and if there was music it does not irritate me as some really bad movies and action was not terrible,
