There is not a sympathetic character throughout the film. Is this a lawyer played by Kenneth Branagh, that we should be pulling for? Well, let's see - we know that it is a hideous defender who gets off on the intricacies of the offender. It belongs to my colleagues, like cattle, gets them involved in his own personal crisis (in the process, get one of them died), jeopardizes the safety of their children, threatens new boyfriend of his ex-wife, trying to high-current hand police and school administrators - and all this for what? Because he had to think a little head! I was actually pull for a father and his gang beat lawyer arrogance and drown it in the swamp ... he would have made for a much more satisfactory ending.
