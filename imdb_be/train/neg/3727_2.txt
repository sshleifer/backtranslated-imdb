Written and acted sincere lovers produced some Monger operation, it is boring and hard to watch. <br /> <br /> I do not the worst movie ever, but at least as a potboiler _Plan 9 from Outer Space_ usually was a real actor or two. I would recommend _A thief Night_ ironists only hardcore and hardcore Dispensationalists. Me neither. <br /> <br /> Do not believe me? Watch it for free (although derived from the poor VHS) here: http://www.archive.org/details/Thief-In-The-Night <br /> <br /> Relevant links added primarily to achieve 10 IMDb-line at least: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3199/thief-in-the-night-se-a/
