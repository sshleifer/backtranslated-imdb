My husband rented it from the video store thinking it was unknown. (He never reads the synopsis). <br /> <br /> Well, it would have been funny if it was watchable. This is simply not the case. The same thing over and over again, without intrigues, and where they found a leading man?. Leading man, Michael Des Barres, not even feasible good, especially for the role he is given. In addition, sexual harassment in the workplace is something, if you want to see, lease Michael Crichton "Disclosures". At least Michael Douglas looked good in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> Alexander Paul, who tend to be watchable, plays an awkward scene here. There are also lighting effects are cheaper than your home on webcam. Do not even waste the time of this lease. 0/10.
