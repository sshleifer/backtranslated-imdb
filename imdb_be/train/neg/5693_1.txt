I can not believe the positive reviews of this movie - I thought it was one of the worst, most poorly executed and poorly acted films I have ever seen. And the story was completely inappropriate (sp?). She begins to do with it, until it is tied to a chair? PUH-lys. Worst of all was that it was not even bad in a good way ridiculous. Simply terrible - I could not understand why they even bother to show it on HBO. I thought that Belushi was ridiculously stupid - really incredible how "eccentric" killer. Idk, I could go on - again, I was shocked by the positive reviews. The only thing that kept me watching it that it is interesting to see how a film can go wrong, and what makes it bad. And the finale did not disappoint in any stupidity! "Live by the sword, die by the sword ..." funny.
