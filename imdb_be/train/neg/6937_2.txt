The theme of this latest advertiser turned movieman trying to solve in his debut (declaration) of the enterprise it is rather the age-old topic of discussion almost any cultural standard - timeless novel (pun intended) <br /> <br />. Nevertheless, a study (and for the operation of Desi AUDS) provides sorely lacking as usual inclinations to "pepper, spices and sugar" to the usual Masai mixture b / g points, dialogue, dance, drama, etc. It creates a beautiful view of the package with not much inside. <br /> <br /> In the first 40 minutes of the film, the kitchen scene was repeated at least 8-9 times. Further repetitions go through the film output (because the main character is a chef). But it is not le problemos, - not a story! Huh, no wonder. Someone forgot to write the script. <br /> <br /> put Amitabh in Cheeni Jyada (more) amount of excess of action. In fact, if this guy ever stop ?? How many 60-something prance around like that, even if the tease in the marriage of 30-something ??? Infinite mind is, but, of course, that of not Liverpool bodybuilding? And the only one? Unfortunately, the soul? Reasonably good acting by Paresh Rawa having a single reasonable role in the film. The director does not make any sense of realism, getting all caught up in his newfangled opening a hot new idea. Nowhere we presented with any real-life problems or issues, such a pair could face but actually getting married, which is a primary obstacle. Podagovor young child with cancer (first bachelor boy love) is not going anywhere, and all that little sharpness it otherwise would have caused fresh presentation quickly destroyed along with the character of the girl. <br /> <br /> Anyway, nice try, but not quite there yet.
