At first I liked this movie. It felt good comedy with some silly moments. Costumes Albert Wolski make it better !!! As well as an excellent set decorator Robert R. Benton - this man was really very good taste !!! But the writers have disappointed me enormously. Best ending to the scene on the stairs, but instead, they decided that a father and his daughter should be together. I do not like the ending. Father boyfriend becomes his own daughter and his ex-wife knows about it, and finds it in order. It would be nice if the writers, for example, say that now there is another soul in the body, but they did not, they just stripped him of his memories. The actors were good, they were really funny. Cybill Shepherd was a magical, Robert Downey Jr. was very funny in the dance scene :))) ... But some things spoil the impression of even good acting. For example, Karen Jeffries, playing Cybill Shepherd waited for him 23 years after the death of her husband (it's a long time!) She was faithful to him, she did not love anyone but him, and when she met him and just how to love it, after the scene with his friend Philip train (Ryan O'Neal), it is very easy to betray the man she longed for years !!! It would be a good movie, if not the end but missed some human psychology.
