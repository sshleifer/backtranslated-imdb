I'm shocked at how bad this film. The styling of the early twentieth century, Hollywood actresses, he sets a new low - even by modernists or (gasp) Cradle Will Rock & I never thought I'd see a movie worse than 2. They were presented on several different environment and time. However, the intention and the results were depressingly similar <br /> <br /> First of all, there is a terrible casting :. Eddie Izzard as Chaplin? Excuse me? Peter, you're bound to this guy something? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons ?? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? Holy smoke, these people do not even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they supposedly show. <br /> <br /> Well, The Last Picture Show was a decent movie, but this thing is a disaster and other photos Bogdonovitch, were not much better. Guess rub against Wells and Hitch & Ford disappeared long ago. Still good for TCM host, though.
