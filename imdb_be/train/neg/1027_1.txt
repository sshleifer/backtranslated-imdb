As a rule, I have much more important things to do with my time than to write reviews, but I was so disappointed with this film that I spent an hour with IMDb registration just to get it off my chest. <br /> <br /> You would think a movie with names such as Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey will be acceptable rate ... well, this movie was horrible. It is almost impossible to "suspend disbelief"; I tried, in fact, I wanted to enjoy it, but Justin Timberlake is simply not allowed. <br /> <br /> Timberlake have to follow the music, what a terrible performance - no presence as an actor, NO character. I can not blame everything on Justin: The film also boasts a terrible story & untimely editing; its definitely «F». <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I have to wonder, what really motivates the actors. I mean, of course, Morgan actually read the script before taking part. Had he not seen how poor it? What, then, might encourage him to take part? Money? Of course, acting is at times more of who you saw with rather than actually developing the quality of work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a fine actor; it gets a lot more time than Freeman screen or Spacey in the film, and really struggling to put up with a bad script. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the audience goes, "What the hell is going on here you expect me to believe this shit" <br /> <br /> In short, except for Justin's great lineup bad punished - very disappointing.
