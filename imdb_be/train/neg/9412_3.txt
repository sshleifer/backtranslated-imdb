This film was displayed as part of the Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival 2007. I had no expectations of the movie, as someone to choose for me. <br /> <br /> I really like films that take time to develop, movies that allow characters to unfold and allow the flow of the plot. Property well. But this film, even though he was just slow. <br /> <br /> Credit must go to the two main actor. There was a sense of tension between them as two completely different people, misfits really came together in a very uncomfortable. There were tender moments and sadness, as we have learned about them. <br /> <br /> I also liked his apparatus and method for shot. It was claustrophobic and monochrome, and he added to the intimacy of the film and reinforces the strangeness of the characters. <br /> <br /> I just do not see the end. What's the point of all this?
