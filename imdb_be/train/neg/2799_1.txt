Whoever wrote the script for this film does not deserve to work in Hollywood at all (not even live there), and the actors have to find another job. The most terrible hour and a few minutes of my life ... and I just kept watching to see if he recovers, which, unfortunately, is not the case for me. <br /> <br /> Even in the end, the credits given me anxiety. I think there was a lot of people for the film, so that they are rolling loans slow ... very slow. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely a great "How not to make a film" leadership, I'm sorry I can not give 0.
