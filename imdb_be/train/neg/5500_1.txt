This film tries his best, but it lacks the fun of 1960s TV series that I'm sure people remember fondly. Although I am 17, I watched some series on YouTube for a long time and it was nice and fun. Unfortunately, this film does little justice to the series. <br /> <br /> The special effects are pretty poor quality, and it did not help flat-camera work. The script was too boring and there was no feeling of surprise and humor. Other films with scripts under-par are Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat, Thomas and the Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion. <br /> <br /> Now I tell you that like the idea of ​​the story, but, unfortunately, it was poorly done and exhausted too early and I honestly do not believe that's the reason it's something for the family, to enjoy. And I was annoyed the suit says, despite the energetic voice work by Wayne Knight. <br /> <br /> But the fact is that most annoyed me about this film, he wasted the talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah, all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels made a few good performances in the past, but it seems to have not the slightest idea what he was supposed to do, and the character of Elizabeth Hurley, unfortunately, come across as useless. Daryl Hannah wonderful actress and generally ignored, and I liked the idea that she was the love interest, but unfortunately you can see very little of it (not to mention the monster attack is likely to frighten children than excite them) also Wallace Shawn as a kind of government promptly. Christopher Lloyd will pay off better, and as an actor, I like Lloyd lot (it was two of my favorite films Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I love Back To The Future), but they gave him little to work and tended to overplay pretty wildly. <br /> <br /> In general, how I wanted to love this film, I left unimpressed. Instead, to be fun, he came across as pointless, and it's a shame, because there were a lot of opportunities, with some talented actors and a good idea, but in vain with poor execution. 1/10 Bethany Cox
