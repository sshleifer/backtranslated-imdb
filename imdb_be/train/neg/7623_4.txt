This small show, obviously, some silly little prequel / spin off of the original series. <br /> <br /> In comparison with the live-action series of the show is full of shit. Show live acts were smart jokes and storylines. While the animated series basically softened the bitter version for young audiences to digest, but I think that maybe kids deteste this shit. <br /> <br /> The storyline in every episode basically just Sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it. Basiclly the idea of ​​each episode. The strangest episode was when Sabrina uses magic to become the Gem and Gem to become Sabrina. Thus Gem becomes a witch hypnotizes harvery and become its slave. This then leads to a bizarre still pretty interesting scene were Gem says "just love me now" and Harvey get down on your hands and knees and began to kiss her feet, like a god STE. (What is quite right, since he was her mind-control slave) But this is nonsense spin-off is not worth the time and effort.
