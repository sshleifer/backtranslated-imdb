Judging by the hype and other reviews on this site, I was ready for an amazing horror movie with a focus on drug users. What I got was crap focusing on drug addicts. I wonder if there is another film called "Cooking", that these people have considered? There are only three main characters, and none of them hit me like a well-written and well-acted. In general, the whole film, which I have just spent shaking my head and wondering at the stupidity of these addicts. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Do not make this film. Rent "Cabin Fever" or some other decent horror film. Hell, rent "Mary Poppins!" Animated penguins terrible and more convincing than anything you will find in the "Water heaters" section.
