It may be incredible, but the film grossed $ 878,138 in Russia! He showed almost all the cinemas and is still working! Well, I have no idea why the distributors to put an eye on this particular um "cinema", which had almost no screening worldwide. This is a mystery! Ha-ha! Maybe it was based on the fact that one more film, "Promise This" with Paris Hilton, which was just released on DVD only almost everywhere, there were large screening in Russia and raised more than $ 1 million. In addition, both films have been a lot of publicity, as there have been banners all over the city, TV commercials, etc. Speaking about the film, I would say that it is boring and absolutely boring. It may be better, in fact. Even if he has Jessica Simpson.
