I'm probably always going to see the film Woody Alleb, because no one knows when he can just make a real return to its former greatness. Only one or two big moments or lines might make it useful. Unfortunately, however, this film is just does'nt do it on any account. Talking Tar actually makes me sad and even a little guilty. I am sure that my reaction is very similar to many other fans of Woody, but what can I say? It's probably time for him to focus on his Clarinett, in my opinion, it is quite good. Saying all this, I still probably go to any new film by Woody can go in the future. There is always hope, and I will continue to love and respect Woody !!
