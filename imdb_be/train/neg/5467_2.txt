What can I say about this movie. Well, it's about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and become delinquent students selling drugs for poorer people. Two of these people have adverse consequences, as one turns into a toxic avenger type and his girlfriend throws a creature that grows in the basement of the school. That is all you need to do, and they stretch it for 84 minutes. This film is very bad and should be closed forever. Although it is not fair, some people like TROMA movies, and they can watch it when they want. TROMA movies for me, though, the worst movies are there. I just watched it one of morbid curiosity.
