I warn you here, I decided to believe the reviewers who say that this is not an action film in the usual sense of the word, but rather a psychological drama, so you have to assess it on this basis, and you'll be well <br /> <. br /> I'm here to tell you that they were wrong. . Completely wrong <br /> <br /> Well, no, not really; it is very frustrating if you are looking for an action movie, they were right. But it is also very satisfactory at all other levels, as well as <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is not too bad, I think, is no worse than usual. but what possessed them to throw Billy Zane in this? Was it some kind of death wish on the part of manufacturers? Ways to make your film a guaranteed failure? In this case, it worked. <br /> <br /> If they were actually aimed at success, then why not give someone who can act? Oh, and can also go for a writer who knows how to write. Oh yes, and a director who knows how to direct. <br /> <br /> As someone who sat through this mess, actually believing that it will be in the near future to redeem myself, I can assure you that never did. It is a pity that might have been a good film.
