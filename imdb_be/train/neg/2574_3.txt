I know that the movies do not have to reflect reality, but this one got on my nerves. He perpetuates the ignorant stereotypes about the "psychological trauma" and mental illness. "Psycho Mom" ​​has been done too many times (and usually is better), and most of the rest of the plot contrived as well. Act was not terrible, but nothing to rave about <br /> <br /> One of the highlights :. I'm a longtime fan of General Hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by the former GH regularly, John Lindstrom. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you can ignore the fake psychoanalytic part, in the same way, one must suspend reality / view when watching a lot of movies, this film can be tolerated. If you do not have anything better and a relatively low level. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I took the time to view it.
