Finally, I think that someone is going to pay tribute to the classics H.G. Wells, not another version is installed in the wrong locale or era, but based firmly on the book. Well, it's definitely worth the book quite closely, and that is the only plus to this confusion. <br /> <br /> This 180 Min (Yes 3 hours) long, the book is only 150 pages. <br /> <br /> If Timothy Hines had the nerve to come here and say, "if you can do better ..." I would say "yes, I could not," and I did not use the camera or was in a or a theater school in my life. <br /> <br /> I paid good money to get this crap to the UK from the United States, does not make the same mistake that I did.
