This should be my kind of film. Even if he was sucking it still had right up my alley; hell, I like "Congo" and the films "Alan Quatermaine». I have a soft spot in my heart for stupid movie alien / demon / adventure. Let's look at why I decided to look it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 1. Horror / Sci-Fi almost always intrigues me 2. I am a big fan of archeology, and the movie does involve a rare treasure. 3. Super-natural enemies with FX quality. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf, I generally use. 5. Tara Reid hot. <br /> <br /> So that this film had the potential, at least in the section of the cheese-horror video store, but boy did it suck ass. Only redemptive aspects Slater and Dorf, not everyone finds it as entertaining as I ... I mean, let's face it, both melodramatic. But now some of the many shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid. Despite the fact that the film as a whole is worse Reid's performance is really awful. We're not just bad, I'm talking about Tara Reid nomination for worst performance of the year. I do not know when it is able to act, but to play the curator of the museum straight from their league ... completely. Watching her trying to carry a roll of learned scholars do not differ much from what you get watching the installation of bad porn. I mean, it's not just bad, it is ridiculously bad. Oh, and for those of you wondering what she did not undress, but to her bra in a silly, completely unnecessary love scene. <br /> <br /> Even with the implementation of Reid, perhaps the movie would work, but the story that dominates, and the plot seems to be written by 10-year-old. I did not understand that this adaptation of the video game to after watching DVD, otherwise I would appreciate stupidity in real time. <br /> <br /> The plot bounces back and forth with Slater childhood in an orphanage, where he gets the memory of something terrible that has happened, he has amnesia, of course. In his adult life Slater was hired by a 713-Unit, paranormal military force, apparently, hunts evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was too naughty, I guess you never know when he was not in one of these voice-overs, I disconnected while. The film begins with Slater hunting artifacts, receiving its last part after some deals with "the Chilean mercenary forces that specialize in the sale of rare antiquities." I can have a precise quotation is wrong, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> There is an evil doctor who wants to uncover some Naughty on the ground (there is no reason given), experiments on children, super demon / alien- human hybrids, "photon" bullets (demon thing can not stand sunlight) and, of course, Slater and Dorf, to try and save everyone. <br /> <br /> Jesus, I can not even have to wade through in clichéd elements. The script is very necessary to process to narrow the focus and provide some depth. I mean, why is it so damn evil scientist evil? Oh right, people are doomed, and he's just trying to save the human race. I believe that it is infected? How did this happen? Oh, right, it has one of the evil demons of things in the cage and pulls his blood to shoot himself. How the hell did that happen? Why and where he is a super snails (oh yes, they use old sci-fi stand in the parasitic aliens / demons that "passion" with the spine of their owner) Of course, Slater, the blade half cork super power, but his bullet "is not completely fuse due to electric shock, "thank God. Oh, and people with these "fusion" spikes, have no idea what they half-alien / demon and does not act as good members of society, yet some secret signal is where they become a zombie killer. Yes, we have a zombie. <br /> <br /> So much crap that can be interesting, but none of them is not. <br /> <br /> In addition, the ending is completely stupid, all is not that big a deal is not correct in the first place ... at least nothing a little dynamite can not handle. <br /> <br /> not the worst thing that you see, but really bad movie.
