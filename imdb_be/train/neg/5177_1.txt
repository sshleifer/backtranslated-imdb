It's so bad, so very, very bad. Actions is the biggest joke in history. Do not even bother to see it, and I did it on after 20 minutes, and it was just as disappointing in the end, as in the beginning ... I really do not understand people of taste, I have a horror film fan and I 'm not picky, but I have my limits! Maybe it was a quarter of a star is better than at the beginning of Hoast, but that's all. Therefore, I recommend that you do not waste 15 minutes, you'll be able to watch. I mean the action is better to make the monkeys. A big brother with the parent role is simply awful. Did not they pay characters in a C-movie? No, I have to say that this is not the first time I think horror is a bad thing, but it's absolutely one of my down in ten films, and it will be swapped with Charing Portrait vampire cabin on the lake, The Hoast!
