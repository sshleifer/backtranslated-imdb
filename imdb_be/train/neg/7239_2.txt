This film is advertised as a clever romantic comedy. It is neither reasonable nor romantic and it is certainly not an effective comedy. The fate of the well-meaning yet helpless character, "Tom", varies from one very uncomfortable catastrophe to another. The only saving grace is the competent performance of Toni Collette and the frequency with which we glimpse a pleasant person Paltrow. In general, you should avoid!
