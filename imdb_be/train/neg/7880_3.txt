Animal Farm (1954) was very well read about the dangers of totalitarianism. As well ideals can be changed and distorted by those who do not know or rule with an iron fist and an empty head. Unfortunately, this film does not represent any of them. What we have shown a propaganda piece with a lot of waving and pointing a finger. Animation and the direction was good, considering the budget and the time period, but the essence of the novel by George Orwell sorely lacking. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who want to see how not to adapt a novel or just interested in the fact that the adaptation of the brilliant novel then by all means watch. I just found this one, some mediocre. Just one person's opinion however. <br /> <br /> remake notch lower, but not by much.
