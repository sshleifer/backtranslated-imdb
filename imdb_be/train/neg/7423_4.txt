There really is not much to say about Las Vegas Lady. It's harmless, but it's little more than a dull robbery movie from the '70s. The film is neither as smart nor as sexy as it tends to be. The site is a new tire tired old casino robbery plot, it was done to death. Except in the case of Las Vegas lady, I think it was a robbery plot developed 3-year-old. The plan includes three women ?? one too, and in a simple view of the scale outside the building Cicus circus show one waitress only undermine its causation at the earliest opportunity, and one to be exposing her cleavage. That's pretty much it. Confused, right? In addition, Stella Stevens and her aforementioned breast and other women involved in the conspiracy, not particularly memorable. Las Vegas lady co-stars Stuart Whitman. When not going over Stevens, his participation in the film is highlighted by one of the most idiotic gun fights ever put on film. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie. He has that '70s feel to it that I always enjoy and some good shots of Las Vegas CIRCA 1975. But the film itself is too dim to appreciate slightly higher than 4/10 ?? and it's probably exaggerating it. Eventually, Las Vegas Lady waste of some very good cleavage.
