As difficult as it is for me to believe, with all the terrible reality shows there over the last few years, this one has to take the first place in the worst one yet. I'm still wondering if it was really just a parody made by a gang of SCTV. If Andy Kaufman was still alive, I would be sure that he was for it. Can a rock band to bend slightly lower than INXS has done a shameful thing like this? The premise is simple and imbecile. Audition bunch of karaoke refuses to become the new lead singer of INXS, to take the place of Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and no hits later, the group to commit the ultimate act of patheticness, exposing themselves to listening pile of mediocre imitators, to become the new lead singer of which 20 years in the past their prime. Thus, they are trotting all those awful singers (I thought that American Idol its share Doozies), who do terrible renditions of just about every classic (and predictable) rock songs imaginable. And then they cut a member of the group INXS, who seriously discuss the merits of each of these candidates. You could see better (and more original) rock artists in almost every nightclub in any city in the world. <br /> <br /> It has all the usual elements of uncreative any other reality show. Lama participants of reality, the lame interview lame host / entertainer, lame 'judging' performance and hobbling loading one participant at the end of each show Are these shows get any more predictable This is obviously a publicity stunt on the part of the group;.? Last breath of hope to revive the lost glory, before they finally buried in oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if he had a little dignity in life, to be tipping in his grave. not that INXS has never been a large group, but I had no idea that they were this miserable. If INXS are to all members of that rock 'n' roll began, the show will be the final proof that rock and roll once and for all, died.
