This film looked good - a good throw, evergreen topic and explosive opening. It went downhill from there. Why he was shot hand-held camera? He highway, judders, captures part of the stage and just knocks the viewer confused. Poor choice indeed. As if that were not enough, the worst memory of editing involves a narcotic viewer - is mandatory if you want to get any satisfaction from it all. And then he makes the worst sin of all. After leading the viewer down a variety of unlikely and improbable scenarios to exhaustion, they roll credits, without revealing the denouement - the end - winning -like that clip was the motive? How can you expect to succeed by making thrillers with no ending? Doh! This film had great promise and ultimately makes the face plant in the mud. Which is a waste of effort. The poor performance of writer and director.
