Whatever possessed Guy Ritchie to remake the film Wertmuller is unclear. <br /> <br /> This new film is a mess. There was another person in the audience, when I saw her, and she went about an hour into it. (I hope that she demanded the money back.) The only reason I stayed until the end, because I have never walked out of a movie. <br /> <br /> But I sat through this piece of junk thoroughly surprised that Madonna and Ritchie could actually think that they made a good movie. The dialogue is ridiculous, the game is brutal and the actors only good thing in this movie scenery. Richie took Lina's film and turned it into another "Blue Lagoon". <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you do not even take the time to watch late at night on Cinemax. Time is too precious to waste on crap like this.
