I watched the videotape of the Canadian film, like «The witching", which somehow made its way to New York. Audio was very bad, I had to pick it up 7/8 to hear it and the soundtrack was often overwhelming dialogue. Orson Welles was the onlookers, worse than usual, and some of his dialogue and the other passed through the echo chamber. Shadowy figure that keeps her voice was being distorted. Some closed captioning really helped! <br /> <br /> A group of witches or Satanists (end credits say that the group was not intended to represent any real group!) There is a ritual in which they undress and cause miscarriage stabbing a doll. A woman who was miscarriage and her husband to move to a town called "Lilith", where he was offered a job in a toy factory. Despite one of the AKAS this film, apparently, being «The Toy Factory», we never see him, and he rarely mentioned at all. <br /> <br /> On the way to Lilith, her husband gets impatient with some of her questions about what his new boss, Mr. Kato wanted to know about their religion. He drives aggressively and causes another car to go off the road and explode. After the arrival of the police, she takes the doll, which fell out of the car, the second of many handmade dolls in the movie. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Mr. Kato and all citizens witch, and that they are the ones that caused her miscarriage, although she did not understand it. They want to because she has an innate talent for the necromancer, of which she was not aware of. <br /> <br /> Some of the images in the film have some impact, but in general the film is not very involving. The film does seem a bit of confusion, and it is no doubt largely due to its re-editing and add a new video. The original version, in accordance with the titles, was named Necromancer - Life is for living. DVD Magic can allow us to see both versions on the same disc, but to re-release the film, probably not a priority.
