I'm afraid that this is one pretty creepy, in spite of some good performances in general competent for the most acting out the camera direction. This is the first and last attempt to writer-director Soo Lyu. «Rub and Tug" (2002) is one of Canada's disadvantaged byproducts promote homegrown cinema program. While the program promotes decent effort as «New Waterford Girl» opens the door for inept novices like Liu, who do not aggressively transfer this project, but has been given the green light without sufficient study of its script or its powers. <br /> <br /> You do not mind low budget, because the design of the production shabby, poor lighting, poor audio and dreary selection of shots docu-style corresponds to the object; workers in Canadian showrooms massage. But the dialogue and the building does not give anything to work actor, editor of a lot to gather, or spectator any mental challenge, in addition to the suspension of disbelief. If your story is simplistic last thing you need is a confusing narrative technique; Even if nothing happens, the film is hard to follow, and point-of-view can not be pressed. <br /> <br /> performance of Don McKellar Conrad several expressions below its similar characteristics in the "exotic". Lea Linda Booth is its standard nimble fool; as always, it's cute, but here it is a little bit more. Cindy Kira Clavell is a pleasant surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duvall. Only one part of any consequence, Tara Spencer-Nairn for Betty circumspect, more than compensates for its excellent work in "New-Waterford Girl». Her performance in the shallow "rub and tug" should limit any tendency to look for other films in which she was; if you do not need further confirmation «Waterford» skill director Alan Moylan in working with young actors. <br /> <br /> You will quickly conclude that the reptile brain Liu can not understand such things as the complexity of the plot, so it is necessary to insert a lazy and lame «Deus Ex Machina» device at the end of almost a surprise. Nevertheless, it could be worse, languid story has so little internal logic, in any case, which is unlikely, the ending is not as painful as it is usually the case. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
