Dr. Mordrid appalling. I would not recommend any adult or child sees it, unless they are already angry killers. There is so much dirt in this film he hurt my yes. Speaking of eyes, have eyes in the sky against a background of stars. Only the devil himself could imagine such an evil thing. I rented every copy I could from the local video store and crushed them with the 5 pound crucifix. This film should remain closed in the basement of the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting creatures of hell. It belongs to the film here. I suggest that if you want some scandalous entertainment, go and rent all dogs go to heaven, and angels in the outfield. These films are worth seeing. If you want to commit a sin and love scary movies, you should see a doctor Mordrid.
