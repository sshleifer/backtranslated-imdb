I remember a Monday morning 06/18/02, to be exact. I dozed off, trying to convince myself to get out of bed when there was a terrible explosion. I went into the kitchen, where I have a view of the few neighborhoods in southern Jerusalem and saw a column of smoke rising from a distant point of view of smoke followed by a minute at Waling sirens. I remember rushing to the bedroom, taking the binoculars, rushes into the kitchen and spotting the image glass shattered bus. The bus was still about the pick-up station where a suicide sat on it, and with the touch of a button on the device TNT, killed 25 passengers, many of whom were on the way to school. The wife of my good friend, took the bus in the back row, it would seem arbitrary and meaningless decision that saved her life. <br /> <br /> I am sure that every Israeli has at least one terror- related to memory, he wishes he'd never been, and it was only a matter of time before someone made a movie about it . As it turned out, the film was about to become a repressed memory of its own. <br /> <br /> The film is about a play-writing on dry, Haim Buzaglo (pictured, hmmm, Haim Buzaglo who also wrote and directed the film), who spends most of his day who watch conducting contests with his blank page in a text editor. At the same time, his girlfriend, a field reporter for the Israeli commercial channel, decides to make a piece of the debt covered by the former army officer. Buzaglo, sad and a little paranoid because that is medically known as a "what on earth this hot babe meets me" syndrome, asks the private eye to a breakdown of his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> As a detective progressed in his study, his penetrating observation in the game, and later, in the lives of its actors. At the same time, the metamorphosis of the game with a comic game of the indictment against the alienation of Israeli society. As for the film, well, the movie becomes an exercise in editing furiously, sitting in their small cardboard dialogues and unreliable characters while drifting miles from the subject, he had to deal with in the first place. <br /> <br /> When I say "cardboard characters", I mean characters that the obsession with the writer / director of "significant" film, were devoid of any real dialogue and any shred of reliability. I will not elaborate too much about it. Suffice it to say that I am sure that the homeless prostitute barefoot men rarely go to the theater. With the intention to see the game, that is. <br /> <br /> This film is, in the words of Haim Buzaglo is the first part of the trilogy of the current agenda. I sincerely hope that the other two will be taken out of the film experience as the one I wrote at the beginning of my review, as opposed to the separate characters in the world, which are nothing but there is a story that is nothing but persuasive. <, Br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter. <br /> <br /> PS The film became a landmark in penance. It was filmed in ten days, all the actors worked for free, and the full cost of the film was about $ 12,000 (no, I did not fail to zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). It makes you wonder why it took $ 34,000 to complete the Blair Witch Project.
