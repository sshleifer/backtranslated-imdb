I think you can sum up this show about the same way as everybody else. Batman TAS can be the worst thing that ever happened to the cartoons based on comic book, because all that comes after will be compared with him and did not even measured. It's just too damn good. Batman Beyond was good? "Yes, but it was not a TAS." Is Justice League well? "It's not so bad, but it's not the TAC." <br /> <br /> Batman, of course, not TAS, either, but I will not argue against him. It would be unfair, and besides, he has a lot of other problems associated with it. <br /> <br /> The concept of a younger, less experienced Batman fight against crime is a fine one, and sometimes art is very nice. But the rest of the time, the art does not cost anything Americanime, and it changes a lot of the shortcomings of the show. He walked, written and designed as Americanime. If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan Adventures, I'd watch Jackie Chan Adventures. Or I could just hit his head against the wall at any time and get the same effect. Joker is a fatal, mentally unstable clown in a suit, who uses his wit and unpredictability of the smart gadgets to fight with Batman. If he is forced to fight hand to hand, he will either refer to something cheaper, or be completely outmatched. It is not intended to be a monkey with dreadlocks, who knows kung fu and can jump twenty feet into the air, accompanied by a high-speed lines. If they wanted to do it with a villain, there were other less important characters, they could use or suffocation * * they could create a new completely. And it's not that rethinking is bad, do not get me wrong. TAS (there I go again) took Mr. Freeze from the standard icegun B has the villain and made it a memorable and emotionally complex. Freezing Of course not quite a classic villain at the time, and they have modernized, but it's worth it. Batman that makes it all takes liked Batman comics and knowledge and occupies a large smelly dump on them. Guess what? They eat corn. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this show can not stand against the TAS, but stand on its own feet, and he still does not work for me. Areas are not good and they do not develop better. They were written for the population of children under the age of twelve years. If children will be able to enjoy the show? Of course they should. This should not be an adult show with swearing, nudity, violence and unfounded. But the brand is really good show is that it can be enjoyed on different levels all ages. This show misses the mark. <br /> <br /> This show TAS? No, of course not. The problem is that not even the JLU.
