Cadaveric chronicle <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> During the search for ( literally) a ghost town in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) raises gray hitchhiking (Joseph Haggerty), who tells her two stories associated with the flesh-eating zombies Reputed excites area. <br /> <br /> absolute waste of time, hobbled from the start by painfully amateur performance Haggerty in the key role. Worse yet, these two stories that make up most of the time works completely routine deteriorate indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes, previously responsible for such CAMP BLOOD (1999). This is not a "fun" film in the sense that the films of Ed Wood are "fun" (he, at least, believed in what he was doing, and was sincere in his efforts, in spite of the lack of talent); Sykes homemade movies, in fact, make it difficult, sad and almost completely devoid of any saving charity, and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated so sad, poorly thought-out waste. 3-D format is completely emptied here.
