I watched this movie when I was a young guy, full of raging hormones, and it was just as sexy movie I've ever seen, and was never meant to see. It may not have been a great movie. I think it was not. I do not remember about it, to tell you the truth. I remember only the sexual chemistry between Crosby and Bean. No woman in any film has ever done this for me, as did Kathy incredibly sexy in this film. I have not seen him since I first caught it on TV in the 70s, and I do not think I want to see him again, so I'm sure it will be a disappointment, my hormones are not so raging and I became more tormented for years. Nevertheless, when I think of the scene in my heart I still remember how great it felt way back when <br /> <br /> Added later :. After re-watching the film, I found that it is dangerous to go home. What was once an erotic now quite tame. The older the woman, the young man, that still does not work for me, just not as much as before, probably because I am no longer 12 years. This elderly woman is now younger than I am. In addition, the inexperience of all, it was not perceived by my twelve-year-old mind. <br /> <br /> Moral: Sometimes it's better not to go back into the past.
