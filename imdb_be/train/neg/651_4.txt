I saw this movie a few days ago, and boldly jumped during the scary parts. I must admit that I found it to be pretty decent ... until I started thinking about what the characters say. Logical problems: <br /> <br /> 1. Her boyfriend, who seems to be pretty fit guy does not make a sound, being killed. Do you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer? <br /> <br /> 2. If you made a remark that the physical education teacher is Â«SOOOO in love with Lisa," I almost cried on the screen. If your best friend's family was killed by the teacher, who was in love with her, you do not make comments like that, if you have half a heart. <br /> <br /> 3. Once Nash asks his uncle, as they have outlets in the home, and uncle catches for what can be a danger ahead, would not a smart thing to do be to Donna, a friend, aunt and uncle in the car and go far, far away, the bait house with HRT and the police, so that the killer has no opportunities to take? <br /> <br /> I could go on. And further. And further. Basically, the plot was decent, the characters have not been profiled enough to actually feel empathy when they were killed and there were too many errors. <br /> <br /> however. <br /> <br /> This movie might be good for teenagers or young couples just looking for a fun night. If you do not consider all the inconsistencies, it is a mediocre film.
