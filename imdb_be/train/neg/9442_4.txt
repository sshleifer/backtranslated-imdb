I tried to like this slasher, I try to use all the slasher movies. I mean senseless killing, mixed with a small amount of nudity, and some uncertainty, how can you go wrong. Frustrated but I think it's an example of what the formula is wrong. The main problem is the terrible actions of the three main girls who landed in the house. It was as if they were under general anesthesia, and he stopped me ever interested in getting their plight. The film tends to suspense and horror, but the numbers line pulls him out of those, and leaves the film rather dull. It's a shame, because when the film was made better, he would have been ace. Story and characters pretty awful and there are some dark humor and bizarre moments of interaction between the mother and daughters of the girls in an old house. There's some good naked, bleeding and sometimes ostentatious, just not enough to make the film he needed impact. The finale is quite twisted and scary and really gives the film a great lift, but unfortunately, it is too little too late. Thus, in my opinion, one to avoid if you really love obscure slasher movies. There's a fair amount of potential, but the film delivers too small to be useful.
