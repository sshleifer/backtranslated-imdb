This is one of the most fun bad movies that I have ever had the privilege to see. <br /> <br /> I watched it on DVD with a bunch of friends one Friday night, and we just could not stop laughing from start to. Finish <br /> <br /> the story is quite simple: the terrorists hijack a convoy they believe is weapons-grade uranium, but it actually has a bunch of man-eating dinosaurs. It is easy to make a mistake. Cue surprisingly incompetent army special forces team to fight pre-historic animals. They are led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; a man who seems to have perfected the "smell of a fart," which acts as proposed by Joe as a friend. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of gore and a lot of shooting, but unfortunately, Rance team seems to have a problem of aiming their weapons in the general direction of the hordes of gigantic, lumbering monsters. In addition, the light always seems to flicker and go out every time velociraptor attack (preumably so we can not see how bad the consequences of being there). <br /> <br /> Having said all that, we all had a lot in betting on who is going to get their head bitten off on. <br /> <br /> in the style of action-adventure Jusassic Park / Aliens the movie stinks worse than the crotch of a dinosaur, but ridiculous, insincere entertainment is roaring success.
