I'm a big fan of Michael Madsen, so needless to say I bought this movie, even rent it or anything ... This film was so bad, I did not even take it back to the store, I would not want anyone still subjected to this human poison, I just threw it in the trash, do not mind the money, worth the price, to be able to throw. Acting is not too bad, it was not good or anything. The story was awful, and the end was that I despise. He was broken, alcoholic. his life was a bunch of junk. I thought that his horse, peanuts, was a terrible instrument to show their childlike innocence, the dog would have been much better. I hate religion, it's the end of me, no doubt angered. Jesus heals all ... I hate the fact that I know the people, just as it is that the great Christians and Catholics, and time will show that God does not heal all or nothing. It was a terrible film, if there is a chance to see it pass, or even better to buy or rent it, and throw it in the garbage, and leave the coffee grounds at him in the morning
