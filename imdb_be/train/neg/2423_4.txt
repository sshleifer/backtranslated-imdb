I got this movie from a private collection and was very interesting. It was 7.8 in IMDb (only 9 votes) and some external comments were pleasant. But I must say that this is very common and uninteresting Giallo. Thus, a large cinema, the film is well directed, but it never freaked me out. It starts well, but, although it does not bother me at all, the story is so common and things that are happening are so normal that I do not really like. <br /> <br /> You can make a few laughs, and you can see some small breasts. But if you like the look of giallos Like (strange, surreal, nonsenseful, bloody, atmospheric, violent murder ...), you will not appreciate a lot of this film. <br /> <br /> I give it a 4 for good direction and installation, and the final twists and turns that make the movie interesting. But it could be much better.
