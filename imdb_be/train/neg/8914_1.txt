I had to stop watching this film (pseudo-intellectual product for the discerning viewers of the film) for twenty minutes with him, because he was a mediocre and rather boring to inspire yawns, not to mention the fact that I soon near tears over $ 3 99 I spent on Blockbuster, acting Joanna flour and its terrible had Slavic accent badly enough to install in one clenched between his teeth. I knew that two hours it would be two o'clock too much. Both Breuer and Nietzsche invisible actors play several amazing talents. While we're on the topic of talent, the arrogant assistant Breuer seems to have pulled out of a local acting troupe. She obviously did not recognize her craft. In fact, it is really terrible. All of the available scene seemed set with extras to go mechanically about in their Sunday best. Excluding the film was much more fun than to include it. Do not remove this terrible movie. You'll be sorry that you spent your money.
