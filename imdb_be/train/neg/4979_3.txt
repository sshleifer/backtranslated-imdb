Why oh why can not anyone make a decent movie with a legendary tale? This is the second film adaptation of "Beowulf" I was disappointed in the year. But I must say that the previous version ( "Beowulf & Grendel," starring Butler) was much higher than that. This alone is a bit disappointing. This is one mess !!! <br /> <br /> What is the most bug me? Whether it was a useless plot elements are added in no particular reason (human sacrifice? Pointless love interest?), or bad CGI, or lack of character or uninspired action? Even worse was the way they made a beautiful Syrtis looks awful !!! And let's not even talk about that funny crossbow? <br /> <br /> And why do they constantly remind us that Beowulf had the power to 30 people, and yet he never showed the slightest sign of such strength throughout the film. He threw it around both fought monsters, relying on its allies to save his own skin. Even if he hit the arrogant prince, he did not knock him out. He was too relies on the weapon. Beo-wimp like. This, of course, is not powerful Beowulf epic! <br /> <br /> I would like to end it on a positive note, but I can not think of one offhand. All I can say is that if you ever read "Beowulf", you will be endlessly disappointed by this gloomy, inaccurate basis for adaptation!
