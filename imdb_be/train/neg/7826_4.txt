Special effects? All right. <br /> <br /> The script? Terrible. There is no plot. Many depth. It makes no sense. This film had a Superman as a meaningless character, hero, Sun archetype. In the original film, he represented America in the Cold War. Here, it does not represent anything other than the Hulk. <br /> <br /> Of course, the actors were good. Kevin Spacey was an excellent choice, among others. <br /> <br /> It does not solve the problem that the film had no depth at all. I can not see how anyone could leave anything meaningful out of this film, when Superman was, and every day is designed to be informative, not only the hero of comics, but also in people's minds. It was a real waste of money, considering how many lines could take the film <br /> <br /> A few examples :. Lex Luthor could be the villain of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism, and so on and. He was just another fool Hackman incarnation. <br /> <br /> And Superman? Why did he stand in this movie? Nothing but another hack "rescuer" figure. <br /> <br /> Wait until he comes to the dollar theater, when you see it at all.
