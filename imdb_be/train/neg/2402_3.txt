A strange flash in the pan with the usually reliable Larry Cohen (God said to me also, Q, etc.), Full Moon High is trying so hard to be funny and do not mind, even with decent twists Ed McMahon (!) And Kenneth Mars. Alan Arkin looks confused throughout its activities and son Adam just looks numb. This makes it look like cub comedy classic.
