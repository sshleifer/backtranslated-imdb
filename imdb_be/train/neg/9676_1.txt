Films put me to bed earlier, but the film never made it twice, so it took me three meetings, in fact, to finish it. Dialogue was bad. Women talked stiltedly men were cartoons. And two of the supposedly Japanese women look in Chinese, have Chinese names and spoke with a Chinese accent clearly. I'm still trying to figure out why the men were sexually Emmenthal wrapped up with each other. 10 minus 8 is equal to 1/2 of a difficult choice: Should I give this film a must rating? or two? <br /> <br /> Films put me to bed earlier, but the film never made it twice, so it took me three meetings, in fact, to finish it.
