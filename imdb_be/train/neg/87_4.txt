I've read all the books Love Come Softly. Knowing full well that movies can not use all aspects of the book, but in general they are, at least, the main point of the book. I was very disappointed in this film. The only thing that they have in this film, which is in the book is that the father is visited Miss (although in the book and parents come). That's all. The storyline was so twisted and far to bring and let sad, from the book that I just could not enjoy it. Even if I had not read the book, it was too boring. I know that Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was boring. Evaluation of the same family orientation film that makes them great.
