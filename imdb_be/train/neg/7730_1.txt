Despite a lot of style, flash and glitter, this French musical unable to speak. These melodies are repeated, predictable and tedious. History is not interested in how many characters. <br /> <br /> People who break into song and dance, without motivation and reasons. Most of the actors wearing fake looking wigs and hairpieces, and sets look hopelessly studio bound. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this video is a reconstructed version was stopped before the end, so that the negative effect it has on me. Of course, a shame to have such a multi-talented cast in such a weak final effort. <br /> <br /> Goes to show, I think, where followups (in this case, to the great classics, "umbrella") often go awry. No one can return, only to re-create.
