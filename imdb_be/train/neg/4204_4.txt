David Arquette is young and naive to signal home security alarm <br /> <br /> seller under the wing of Stanley Tucci. Arquette is <br /> <br /> golden boy killed a big sale at its first Call- widow Kate <br /> <br /> Capshaw and her dopey son, Ryan Reynolds. Things go <br /> <br /> well Arquette, he appears in a commercial for <br /> <br /> security firm, and he fell in love Capshaw. <br /> <br /> Then Tucci and his right-hand woman, Mary McCormack admit it <br /> <br /> on a little secret, they sometimes break into their homes <br /> <br /> customers to scare them and get their neighbors to buy <br /> <br /> security system from the company. Arquette decides not to get <br /> <br /> participation, taking Capshaw, to meet his family and go through life <br /> <br /> with a dull smile. Then someone breaks into <br /> <br /> home and murders her Capshaw and her son. Arquette suspects Tucci, and establishes a series of traps, causing the gun to his <br /> <br /> boss's head as Tucci pleads his innocence. <br /> <br /> On the basis of the play, "On alarmist" does not open well. <br /> <br /> scene where Arquette takes Capshaw, to meet his parents <br /> <br /> poorly played and completely unfunny. They also line <br /> <br /> Capshaw plays with character, since she gets drunk and says <br /> <br /> pornographic stories mother Arquette Michael scientific. Other <br /> <br /> In addition to these scenes, Capshaw is not given much to do, but it <br /> <br /> does a lot with a little give to it. <br /> <br /> Stanley Tucci, looking just as Terry OKuinn, rebellion like <br /> <br /> the owner of the security company. He's a loser, who does not really understand, <br /> <br /> moral disgust Arquette. However, when it turns into a <br /> <br /> whine whiners after Arquette kidnaps him, he's funny. Mary <br /> <br /> McCormack, it seems to have been groomed on a greater role, but <br /> <br /> It basically stands around and agrees Tucci. Ryan Reynolds <br /> <br /> too old to play dumb teenager, but he is funny, especially <br /> <br /> tell his apparent sexual history Arquette. <br /> <br /> script lurches from romantic comedy to black comedy also <br /> <br /> soon. Capshaw father meeting completely unmotivated, <br /> <br /> except give her an excuse to get out of town, so someone can <br /> <br /> break into her house. Capshaw and Reynolds in the film just <br /> <br /> Arquette give reason to avenge Tucci. <br /> <br /> Arquette, who has proved that he is a good actor, terrible here. He <br /> <br /> constipation based on plunder, who received it through the <br /> <br /> AT & T advertising, and it is not strong enough to build a presence that <br /> <br /> weak film around. In fact, Reynolds could have been better <br /> <br /> choice in this role. HN <br /> <br /> Dunskiy direction is good, nothing that will win an Oscar anytime soon. <br /> <br /> light jazz score by Christophe Beck recalls this type of film noir <br /> <br /> film tries to be, and it's really catchy on top of it. <br /> <br /> Despite the advantages, Arquette failure as lead and <br /> <br /> script schizophrenic quality sink film. I do not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is the ranking (R) to physical violence, use of firearms, some gore, <br /> <br /> strong profanity, brief female nudity, sexual content, strong sexual <br /> <br /> links and adult situations.
