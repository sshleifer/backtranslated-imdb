I was drawn to this film, it is interesting to see how they have adapted brutal novel Hubert Shelby. I thought that a literary piece of such depth, with a rich palette of characters, a terrible situation, and social criticism could not be translated into a bad movie. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This film is a terrible experience of the film, not for its content but also for its form. Director Ulrich Edel performs, in my honest opinion, terrible directing work, that does not make the validity of the original book. Not surprisingly, Edel is not a director of television; this film looks and feels bad "TV" Flicka. Some of my views on the bomb (spoilers ahead ** **): <br /> <br /> - the absence of the director's work. Scenes slowly feels slow, look bad shot, and hardly ever go on the attached position. The only freedom they adopt in the field of cinematography, with a nice dark tone. In addition, the film has the same technical creativity as a television soap opera <br /> <br /> -. All the actors do an amazing job at drawing these unfortunate characters. The problem is that the adaptation does not solve the basic element in the development of the plot: Motivation. All these characters move like robots, without a clear motivation of their actions. They seem to be doing things out of the blue, like robots, without any reason. Edel miss every opportunity to enrich the character development, the sun exploring the motives of the character, as well as to avoid the development of the personality of each character in full. <br /> <br /> This lack of character development is a glaring at Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight does a great job playing this shit prostitute, but her alcoholic solution that seafarers violate it is not explained. It looks very silly, as we can see, this character makes it out of the blue. This is a clear example of poor character development. <br /> <br /> The film also has a lot of minor, symbolic characters who do nothing, feel nothing, and do not add anything to the story. I would like to learn more about Harry's wife, for example, and the interaction between them. This is another missed opportunity. <br /> <br Edel /> only approaches to the development of the character of Harry and his fixation with his gay lover, only to screw him in the end, did not clearly explain its motivations -again-. Bandits also a joke in their underdevelopment <br /> <br /> -. The soundtrack is one of the worst I have ever experienced. Terrible Mark Knopfler. I seriously expected the former leader of Dire Straits, but his work in this film is seriously lacking. Sometimes, as in the battle between the union workers and the police, the music seems to be completely cut off from the film. He also feels completely poor and anachronistic; I could have sworn the entire soundtrack was made with a toy keyboard Casio. It distracts from the real action <br /> <br /> -. Adaptation of the book, Desmond Nakano is so literal that eliminates the point of history. It feels as if they were so anxious to maintain the effect of the action of the story in the book, that they forgot to actually develop the characters and, once again, to explain his actions and motivations. <br /> <br /> I seriously can not recommend this film, not even a fan of Shelby, because it can destroy the original book. This is a very uninspired efforts to adapt the novel, and shows very little creative input.
