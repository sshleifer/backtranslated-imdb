I was looking forward to watching this movie, and then I realized that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the parties was littered with unnecessary abuse. Now I'm not a prude in any case, but screaming obscenities at each other, do not make a good movie. Ewen Bremner, probably one of the worst actors in the world at that time (witness his performances in the life of the god awful material) and its emphasis "cockney" almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. Avoid. How many of these films, "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang», «Beautiful Creatures» we have to suffer before the filmmakers realize that e-word, the word c-, etc. not a substitute for a proper dialogue.
