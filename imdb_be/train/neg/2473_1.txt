when my grandmother made films that they are likely to do much better shape than this ... incredibly bad ... the main characters (mother, father and son) in order. Especially the mother, she is a good actress and a child, too, is a good one especially in the scenes where he has to be scary. But does the director really know the meaning of the words Plot Point, Triller and a good script. the script does not have any atmosphere develops to become the unknown thing. If you like being chased by trees you can probably enjoy it, otherwise just stay at home and sleep. Oh ... in fact there is something funny: the film from 2001, but we could not figure it out, because the image is so bad (as in the DV-mini) and the cars are so old (70 and 80-ies) .
