I liked the first movie, but it's a textbook example of a sequel, which would be better left on the drawing board. The main idea in the first film was, if not more, then at least very interesting. This sequel is trying to build on the ideas and the character from the first film, and while Christopher Walken is still good, like Gabrielle, the whole idea suddenly becomes a bit ridiculous. If you have not seen any of these films, and then get the first movie and forget about sequels, they can take away all the joy from the original.
