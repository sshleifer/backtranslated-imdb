Ashley Judd, in an early role, and I think her first major role, shows her in real life at the rebellious nature of unmarketable feminist soap opera. Wow, this is a vehicle for political correctness and extreme liberalism there? <br /> <br /> As a staunch feminist, in real life, it should be cherished, this scenario. Not surprisingly, the left-wing critic Roger Ebert liked the film; it is up to his political alley too. <br /> <br /> Unlike the reviewers here, I'm glad that Judd erected against this idiotic down to better roles in movies that entertained, Sun Heavy preached the liberal program.
