This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The story and message horrible. There are too many errors in this film, it's impossible to keep up. I do not even understand how this film can get any nomination, let alone 2. Here's why: 1) Sam Lee reflects angry / non-rational detective, which was caused by the disappointment of his father. Pros: He's angry well. Cons: When it comes to explaining the scene, it can not convey the sadness / disappointment he has at his father. Crying scene was too fake, and it seems that it is literally squeezing tears from the corner of his eye. <br /> <br /> 2) In order to put together a film with the title, were barking dog or wimping sounds during a fight scene and rape scenes that are irrelevant and confusing for the viewer. I understand that this must be a metaphor or not ... but it's just sooo dumb! 3) WHY THE HECK DO NOT REMOVE OR cops murderer? What a hell is wrong with this film. If the killer began to stab the officer to shoot him. He's already dead! What the hell? There were a lot of opportunities that the killer may have been killed, but I do not know why he was not! 4) During the scene where the girl had her leg pain. In the scene, it was clear that the girl's left leg was hurt, because, hell, in the next scene, she credits her weight on the left foot? And this actress is nominated for Best New Artist? WTF? 5) The sounds in the movie are excluded synchronization. <br /> <br /> 6) I believe that this film tries to show awareness of the cruelty and violence among children in South-East Asia, so why the bad guy wins, and then the police joined the fight? 7) This film is simply too strong without purpose. Cops beat the CI to a pulp, and then when they work together, they give them marijuana and cocaine? This is generally the worst film. I really feel that the person who wrote this film sadistic and sick people. I have never seen a more disgusting film in my whole entire life. WORST MOVIE EVER!
