Firstly, I must say that I loved the book Animal Farm. I read it with my 9 th grade class, and it was great. We also decided to watch a movie it would be useful. The film was so disappointing to me. The film cuts out some of the characters, and passes many highlights of the book. It jumps around a lot, and did not explain in detail. If someone is watching this film without having first read the book, they will be confused. The most offensive in this movie for me was the end. The ending in the book was the most powerful, and in the movie, they changed it! He was to be pig and men in the union and a sort of "melting" together, but instead, the movie made it seem like the animals going to rebel against the pigs. To sum up, I do not think this movie captures the real meaning of what Orwell depicted in his book.
