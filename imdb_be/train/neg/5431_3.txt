This is your typical Priyadarshan film - a bunch of loony characters on some stupid mission. His signature is the climax of the entire cast of the film come together and fight each other in some mad moshpit for hidden money. Whether it's winning lottery ticket in Malamaal Weekly, black money in Hera Pheri and, «kodokoo» in Phir Hera Pheri, etc., etc., the director becomes ridiculously predictable. Do not get me wrong; in clichéd and ridiculous, his films may be, I usually end up enjoying the comedy. However, in most of his previous films have actually been some good-natured, (Hera Pheri and Hungama be characteristic of them). Now, the fun of his fading films, as it uses the same formula over and over again. <br /> <br /> The songs are good. Tanushree Dat looks strange. Razhpal Yadav annoying and Tusshar not much better. Kuhn Khem OK, and Sharman Joshi is the best.
