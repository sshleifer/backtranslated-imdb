I usually do not comment on anything (I read other opinions) ... but it is one I _have_ comment ... I was sure I did watch this movie on the world, as an action, F-117, and other hi-tech stuff, but only the first few minutes, and I changed my mind ... a lousy actor, lousy script and a great science fiction. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films I have ever seen ... <br /> <br /> Just ... do not bother ... <br /> <br /> and more one thing, before any film I usually check user comments and ratings on this site ... 3.7 points and I give this film a try, now I'm wondering who rated this film, giving it a score of 2 ??? ???????
