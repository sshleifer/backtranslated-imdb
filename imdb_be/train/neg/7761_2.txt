After a series of power outages on a remote island zoo, genetically engineered SABERTOOTH tigers on the loose and criticize the island's inhabitants. Man, the sci-fi channel did some bad "original" films, but I think this might be their worst so far! This is bad writer and director of "Jurassic Park" rip-off offers all the usual clich√©s (MAD scientists who will count people killed monsters "expended loss" characters that go down the long dark corridors alone, brain dead hero teenagers who only feature film to die a horrible death, etc.), and, not surprisingly, no suspense at all. The special effects are brutal ?? puppet heads in close-title Beasties bad enough, watching the plush doll hard, but CGI ?? which makes computer-generated dinosaurs in "Walking with Dinosaurs" to look like a living relative ?? just absolutely terrible. There's some blood, but most of them look pretty unconvincing. Oh, and the scene of his death in the end, it's really one of the worst things I've seen in years. I could not even laugh it was so bad! <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, it's the only one really bad. <br /> <br /> 2/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and here's some interesting trivia for you ?? this film is borrowed music cues from the sci-fi movie 2003 "Alien Hunter", which was far superior to that piece of shit.
