I'm really looking forward to meeting again after viewing the Renoir astonishing debut work, Whirlpool fate. I have read that Nana generally considered his best silent film, so I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it felt like a huge step backwards. <br /> <br /> Gessling main problem with this film. Her acting is over the top, even for silent movies. Her acting is more like what you would expect in a movie from the early teenage years, not since the late 20's. It is usually the same person who reminds me (unfortunately) from someone with constipation pain. In addition, it was very hard to believe that anyone would fall for this femme fatale. There was nothing charming about it at all. <br /> <br /> The film was also very long, the camera work was uninteresting (apart from the spikes shot) and editing was bored. Story reminded me of Pandora's Box Pabst. It is interesting to compare the two, because there are only three years between films. Pandora's box is just killing each level, where Nana fails. <br /> <br /> This film is only for Renoir Completists or very serious silent film buffs.
