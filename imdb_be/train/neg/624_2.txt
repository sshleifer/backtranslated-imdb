Directed by the state in the backstage feature, he loves horror movies. He loves them so much that he dedicated the film Dario Argento, as well as other well-known directors such as George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. Basically dedicate this film the great directors like your mother gives you piece of shit for Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was casting. CAST THE PEOPLE THAT MAY APPLY TO YOU. Also, do not throw a man who 40 years for role is not clear, 18-year-old recluse. It is true that he was in high school for 22 years. The reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their heart ripped out funny. Or, on the one hand, if a guy gets hit in the ear with a knife cobs (haha get it), and his girlfriend just goes, Â«Oh..my .. God?" The very nature of it is stuffed. Doing flips on the machine and people calling lost. <br /> <br /> The film does have one redeeming factor ... oh wait, no, it's not. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely have to see this movie than just watching a rock-and-roll trailer on DVD. It covers almost everything and has very awkward song dude.
