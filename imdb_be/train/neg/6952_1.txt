The worst retelling of a large series. He was not supposed to be called Battlestar Galactica, because it's just the same in name only. Too many changes simply change. You have characters turn from man to woman, from black to Asian Cylon all in a way that "to attract women viewers," If we are strong female characters, which could only have been made stronger. Gone Egyptian feeling. Gone are the search of land. The absence of a Cylon go to Terminator defective picks from the movie, especially if one did fembot. Of course the original show was a lot of cheese, but it was a lot of followers. They tried to keep it in the next, but does not give the fans nothing to work and basically spit in the face, how they do it "their own history." The changes are good, when they do something better, not just make them.
