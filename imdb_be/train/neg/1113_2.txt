Hopalong Cassidy with a horse, not white not named Topper? Go figure it out! <br /> <br /> This is a travesty does gross injustice to the greatest of all the cowboy hero, Hopalong Cassidy. The actor, who plays his young against old, blond hair, compared with gray and kills people against firing gun out of their hands. Will be a real Hopalong please stand up! <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies ever, and, believe it or not, the man who brought us the saga of Santa!
