A friend and I went through a phase some (many) years ago, the choice crappest horror films in video stores for evening entertainment. For some reason, I ended up buying this one (maybe, v. V. cheap). <br /> <br /> cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. There's also some very funny scenes. Among them, there is a scene where a man is attacked and defended with a number of unexpected things, he made me laugh at a time (do not seem quite so funny in retrospect, but there you go). <br /> <br /> In addition, this common shit note. But probably worth a look if you love movies like "crushed MallÂ». Yes, I saw that too.
