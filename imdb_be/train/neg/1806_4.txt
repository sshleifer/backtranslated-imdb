Antonioni's films have aged not very good. What always strikes me about them is that, in addition to the undeniable plastic beauty, there is a dull and didactic "psychology" of the characters and situations. Remember, for example, a conversation between Mastroianni and "evil capitalist" who wants to sing his "La Notte", or Monica Vitti laughing peasants flirting on the train in "La Aventura" or release Ferzetti glass ink at the end of the same film. <br /> <br /> I reviewed yesterday, "Zabriskie Point". In this film there are a lot of good shots and complex office Rod Taylor, roads and streets of Los Angeles, advertising publicity, desert et al., Which shows the charm of the author in his American tour, in the same way than Wim Wenders years later. Unfortunately, too many hippy-leftist cliché, that spoil the film - Boy leaves the meeting, steals a plane and flies over the desert in order to free themselves and to find "something different." - Leaders in gray suite talk all the time about the speculation. - A girl looks at the 'object' woman in the pool and go, because she wants to be like them. - It's time the middle class fat loaf say the beauty of nature, the construction of hotels and earn a lot of money. - And last but not least, many couples are making love in the desert. Hippies vulgarity! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, today, half a century after the "revolution" in the "La Aventura" we can see that the emperor has no clothes, and his films (except "Le Amica" and perhaps, «Il grido") only a few platitudes and aestheticism.
