Okay, so I was bored, and I watched it all the way through. <br /> <br /> This film is soft, harmless and dull. History is so sugary it rots your teeth during the opening credits. The tail of two "injured" children will learn about the "God" a fairy tale path that is open left me quite traumatized. It uses the Irish "flattery" in such a stereotypical way one expects any real Irish never seen. Directed to children, which would open the exception after the first attempt as «OIRISH» accent. In general, why they pump these out.
