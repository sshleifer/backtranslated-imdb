Where to start, there are so many bad and terrible this movie I'm not sure where to start. Well, two puppets, who wrote the outhouse. Joseph Green and Rex Carlton, they could not do before their so-called minds for the name. I believe that they split the difference, so the main name of the BRAIN THAT WOULD NOT DIE, but the screen end of said head that will not die. None knows nothing about the medical profession. After all doctors swear to "do no harm". Murder of a woman's head for a transplant will be considered as "damage". Besides, a little thing called the blood and tissues of the comparison. Refusal would mean death in January in a frying pan. Besides, who holds a monster patch work. What medical school did Bill finish, FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY? Old FU, or MAD SCIENTIST TECH? The monster did not name the hell out of me errors. Plus, the brilliant surgeon, Dr. Bill Cortner does not know how to keep the patient sedated? All and all a disaster movie, it's incredibly stupid and unwatchable, except for MST3K. I give him thanks to Turkey.
