This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. He went as a feature film, but it really is a piece of garbage. This is one nice quality sacrificial tango, but it can not compensate for the disgusting obvious tribute to Sally Potter to himself. The plot of this film does not exist, and I guarantee you will start laughing until the end. Especially where it begins to sing. It is absolutely unreal.
