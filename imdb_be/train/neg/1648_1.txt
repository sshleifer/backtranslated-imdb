Personally, while I was able to appreciate the really good films, I also have an amazing ability to enjoy a few even the crappiest of crap. You know those times when you just want to sit and watch some terrible cookie cutter gunman to kill time. It's the only movie I remember actually turning off in the middle, and I have absolutely no intention to come back to finish it. The site was so contrived and predictable, I call that the next stage would be easy (and I'm usually not very good at this). The actors were terrible, I've seen better acting in high school plays. Even cuts scenes were bad, the flow is not so. <br /> <br /> This film is like a parody, funny that I forgot.
