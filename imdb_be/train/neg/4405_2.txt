All I can say is, before watching the movie, I had no indications hint that was Annemarie Schwarzenbach or her life story..and I must admit that the film is unlikely to help achieve these data .. and not even able to convince me do some research, typing a few words on the Google website; However, all I can say is that the actress Jeanette Hain was great with her dumb look on his face, she really played well and showed a deep depression mental state, as in real life. <br /> <br /> In the end, based on the script of the film took place in Turkey and Tehran, as well as Afghanistan .. but trust me, I'm familiar with the area, it was all about the Arabian desert in Morocco .. Turkish people and Persian people completely different person and culture as well as the language, which is not an Arab .. <br /> <br /> I believe, to create a movie like this- documentary type- thorough research about all these small elements It is a must ..
