Recently, I watched it again and there is another version, which is shorter than the 1999 I get the feeling that they are the same movies, but I would like to know the difference. <br /> <br /> One Japanese and Pikachu are not short anything that I can think of. Ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice ?? <br /> <br /> Professor Ivy was pretty boring. She sounded as if she was almost asleep, no expression at all with a few lines she had to. HN <br /> <br /> It was pleasant enough, but there was not much to it at all. <br /> <br /> A collector (after whose Lugia, he has no plan to destroy the world) and ordinary characters who are trying to stop him, because he was trying to capture Lugia causes a lot of destruction. <br /> <br /> Pokemon movies that are a little better, Deoxys (poke 7) is large, with not. 8 is almost here.
