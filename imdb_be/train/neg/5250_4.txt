I just love this book written by Robin Klein, so I was very excited when I heard that the film based on the book was in the making. <br /> <br /> But I was very disappointed with the film, when I saw it because he is not carried away by what I liked about the book -. absolutely ridiculous Funny Eric and exciting way in which she views the world <br /> <br /> From the very beginning of the film, I realized that all weren Â«t just as I had imagined in the book. So, I just went for a ride. It was not so bad, I think. Belmont Miss was completely different from what I imagined it to be! I do not think it will be a smoking and drinking - Jean Kittson, who plays her, paddle <br /> <br /> On my own, I thought that the film and its actors / actress, it did a good job, but Unfortunately, I'm such a fan of the book (one of my favorites), I could not help but feel disappointed = P
