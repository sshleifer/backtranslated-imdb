He was great in the «Walking Tall» and had a good bit part in "Gogol", but here all hope is gone «Final Justice» ... the dark side won. <br /> <br /> As with the majority of mankind, my main experience with this was on MST3K, and what an experience it was! Mike and robots to dig its claws deep into the flesh rich Baker and completely twisted this movie. it is obvious that they are just beginning with "Mitchell" in their anti-Joe Don punch and then lies their continuation on <br /> <br /> it makes for a fun experience, but there are many choices :. reefs My favorites - «John Rhys-Davies for sale", "it" Meatloaf.: Texas Ranger "", "none of them worthy of a sponge," "Why was she wearing her prom dress to bed", and my favorite - "" What son ... What was he the son of the son of MAN ??? preacher "< br /> <br /> itself "Final Justice" is how Joe Don puts it in a movie, "a big fat nada." But here, in fact, it has some entertainment value. You get a chance to catch this version of «Final Justice". <br /> <br /> The two stars in the "Final Justice". Ten for the MST3K version ONLY. <br /> <br /> Oh, and try not to visit Malta, when Joe Don in the city.
