The original Lensman series of novels is a classic of the genre. This is pure SF adventure with some substance (here and there), and I always wondered why Hollywood has not filmed it word for word, because it's just such a thing, what they like: massive explosions, super weapons, super-heroics, hero gains woman, ETs (CGI high potential), good vs. evil in pure form, etc. etc. Instead (and keep in mind that I am Japanese-o-Phile and anime lover) we get this monstrous kids movie that rips guts stories, mixes Star-Wars (ironic as the latter thwarted the book sometimes) stylizations and dumbs all it is up to the level «ThunderCats». To see Kimball Kinnison, the epitome of Galactic Patrol officer and second-degree Lensman painted like a little boy pathetic (and so on). I just can not understand why the creators have done it because they obviously had the right to the story and could make much more money (FAR!), Put it bluntly. It makes no sense.
