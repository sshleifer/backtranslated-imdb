I saw this film in a "sneak preview" and I really have to admit that I do not like movies with Meryl Streep that much. This picture was the worst. Half of the theater did not come back after the break for the film halfway. I could not blame them, if it's not the real story there was absolutely no need for the second half of the picture. Just before the film goes forward about ten years, I expect myself the time that the loans are.
