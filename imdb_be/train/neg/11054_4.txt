I believe, is the heart of a house-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, American Graffiti and Howard the Duck to start their careers with a low-budget horror film operation like this. Perhaps as evidence of the talent that would make Willard Hyuck and Gloria Katz Oscar nomination later in their career, the Messiah of Evil has potential, but unfortunately, it is worried about it because it can not gain the shooting skills to get it. <br /> <br /> in the room includes a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search of his father, an artist, who disappeared some time ago. It did not take long for the fragmented narrative to give up all hope, and dive headlong into the rambling absurdity - and for some time it works remarkably well to the point where you start to think that maybe the Messiah of Evil must be corrected by schlocky 70- gutter operation as an example sly secrets horror. <br /> <br /> surreal nya-sequiturs accumulates on as a daughter stumbles upon a young couple in the room seedy hotels that are in the city to conduct a study on the local legend of the "month of blood," battered and half-crazed alcoholic (in performing large Elisha Cook Jr. in the best possible movie scene), who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley, "eaten by dogs later, a blind old woman who has a local art gallery and who inexplicably deleted se picture of his father from the store and the last but not the least backward, killer, albino squirrel food. <br /> <br /> Part of the charm of the film is in the bran d of unsuitable pretentious surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions of each step of the way. While with Lynch's obviously a symbol of a talented creator, the Messiah of Evil boundaries between "intentional", the "unintentional" and "really did not expect to come true, but it's good enough - WRAP SCENES" blur hopelessly <. br /> <br /> Take for example the double narrative that flows in and out of the picture in the drug-addled, feverish, stream-of-consciousness way, one goes from daughter as she wanders from place to place in search of his father and the second voice told her father, as she reads his diary. <br /> <br /> while we are still talking about the "living dead" Artin, Evil Messiah is different, and only one free -. At least with the current prejudice that zombie film to be origin of the living dead here is the 100-year curse, gave the city the mysterious "Dark Stranger", released out of the woods one day in. the same time Hyuck finds time for scraps of mass criticism of consumption in carnivorous supermarket scene preceding the dawn dEAD good number of years (you can hear the MST3K line already: "a person is dead, only the capitalist food cans left) and well thought of, but it is bad made such a scene in the cinema <br /> <br /> I do believe that the surreal works in the cautious, well-measured doses. - as it is ridiculous to work, if it is not hidden inside a perfectly normal? Hyuck seems simply to smear it across the picture, and making it dangerous to replay his hand. If albino such catches girl hitch their way into the city and eat a squirrel in front of it, you can almost imagine the director of winking meaningfully audience surprised and pleased with his jokes. <br /> <br /> The overall level of the shooting is also quite low - after the half way mark, the pace becomes confusing and tedious story, and apparently nowhere and not particularly fast either. Add to that the choppy editing, medium action and a general inability to Hyuck, to capture the true atmosphere - empty streets of the coastal city of criminal wrong - and I would Messiah file as a "missed opportunity", but still Grindhouse fans creativity will find enough to appreciate - even although it is not particularly mountains, bad or sloppy.
