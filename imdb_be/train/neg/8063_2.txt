I was ahead of various sci-fi and thriller movies such as this summer, but was so disappointed about this particular film. While some people came out of the movie, I decided to stay, only to laugh along with other film fans to the action, the absence of suspense, funny ending and it is difficult to follow the storyline. I have found that almost as confused as the protagonist in the film. Only redemptive quality of the film was the soundtrack. This is one of those budding movie star, which they then regret do. Looking back, I would not even rent one, not to mention pay more than $ 5 to see.
