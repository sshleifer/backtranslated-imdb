It's like what other movies Dracula always minions of Dracula is always on the side of Dracula, which is a fact that disappointed me in the final. Regardless of whether a person wants to stay in a vampire or not, I'd like to see something like that in the first film, which Mignon fights against his master. It is very interesting (because you can almost predict how the story goes) than either the priest or D. to win the game (we need strange stories!).
