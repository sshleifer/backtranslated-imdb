It was a movie, I could not wait to see it! So I finally got it, and I was very disappointed. Firstly, the film is so little said about New York, just a bunch of incomprehensible frames of buildings, streets, bridges and cafes.It do not stay focused on the New York magic.Another thing that changed my mind was a French film set in this movie .I know that this is a remake, but this is not a remake of the French style! Anyway, here you will find items that remind you of French films, such as long and messy scene, no or little to say, and of course, all this smoking French style! The story follows the lives of a lot (too much for my taste), and they somehow seem to be related after all. I feel like I did not have the dedication of characters as much as it was in the history. The film was too short to cover every fate is happy ending.So we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each.And there you have 120 minutes! if you like the scene active dialogues, etc. this is not the film for you! I give it a 4 only because I love New York and I loved the actor!
