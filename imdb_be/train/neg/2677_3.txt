It's really cheesy parody of Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones some humor's cheesy, and therefore valid. But it is a soft core of the film, which is expected, and it does not matter, because what you really want is sex. Which leads me to the biggest problem of all, hardly any of it. What it makes you feel like you are watching TV at 3am and independent films play and one that has been made on some college kid who is not going anywhere in this area. You have left a long time waiting for real sex scenes, a lot of times you think that something is going to happen, it just hung. One (possibly two, or one of the two parts) that actually goes somewhere very nice though. I personally can not recommend it if you can not find it in a clear bin for a dollar or two. If you lucking for a good movie with a storyline and good acting, you do not want this. If you are looking for a nice soft core lesbian film, you do not want it either.
