I'm a big movie fan. I love all types of movies. This is perhaps the worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I understand that it is behind the book carefully, which raises the point that not everything needs to be done in the movie. Especially because the authenticity of the experience in the book, has been questioned more than once. <br /> <br /> These characters are quirky, they are mentally ill. Things that are happening are not funny, they are alarming; especially considering that they are supposed to be true. <br /> <br /> This film was a sense of The Royal Tenenbaums, another movie that I hated, only Running With Scissors has been even more dysfunctional and less funny. <br /> <br /> I'll never get those hours back. I wanted to wash my brain after watching.
