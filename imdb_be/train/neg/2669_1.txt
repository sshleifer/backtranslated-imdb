I am rarely moved to make a comment on the internet about the film. But I can not understand how this one was made. Who did this? How could they possibly think they are capable of making a feature film? They made a weekend course in some film school, get a nice big check from her father and kidnap the family of David Badiel one after another, until he agreed to be in it? Or he accidentally longtime family friend / distant relation do it out of pure, absurd kindness? I do not care, do not want to know. Even it looks very embarrassed to be in it, muttering his lines, and hiding his face from the camera. Meanwhile, the DOP was lighter from its neighbors, it seemed, there was absolutely no sound design, script, direction and editing were all sad, and quite openly apathy that overwhelmed me now is that I can not be bothered to spend more life to think about this film.
