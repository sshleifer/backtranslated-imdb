That's right, you heard me. I'm a big fan of James Patterson. I've got 10 of his books, and I read the whole series of Lindsay Boxer. In my opinion, a screenwriter should be shot. <br /> <br /> What is the right of any filmmaker should slaughter a terrific job of science fiction and turn it into ridicule mystery genre? If I ever thought that Harry Potter was butchered, then Michael O'Hara proved me wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only pray that the next writer who decides this fabulous book, make it much more justice. To Michael O'Hara and Russell Mulcahy: do not quit your day job.
