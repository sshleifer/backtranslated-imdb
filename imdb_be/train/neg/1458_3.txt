The back cover DVD (missed this one when it came out) -The welcomed Hitler Rise of Evil as "Triumph" (The New York Post) and "Mesmerizing" (Newsweek). <br /> <br /> Well, not to mention the post, but really, who ever wrote that word in Newsweek in the same context with the soulful, um, art should be dismissed. <br /> <br /> I do not no where to start. Why try to paint a picture of Hitler's evil flowers that do not exist? He was angry well, but now his character is drawn in a way that often historically inaccurate (compared with his love of animals, gentle and subdued as he treated women) and so on. <br /> <br /> The actors well, so you should feel sorry for them, because they are imprisoned in their one-dimensional characters. Some curse here with Peter O Â»Tool: This is the second time in his honorable career when he finished playing old and not a leader in the unsuccessful film (or in this case TV production, to be exact). The first one was, of course, the legendary Galigula. <br /> <br /> The list of historically inaccurate scenes alone would fill 1,000 words allowed IMDb, so I think I'll leave it here. <br /> <br /> this one is OK if it's on TV, and you do not have anything to do, but believe me - it's better left on the shelf at your local store Virgin.
