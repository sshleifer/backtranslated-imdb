I'm a big sign for Neil Young's music, and this glowing praise and the film received many alt-indie press wheels, hit the first show Greendale I could find. My excitement was short-lived, because this arrogant and a weak plot lyrical impulse has left most moviegoers either asleep or disappointment. <br /> <br /> Neil says that the film began as a soundtrack, and the characters come to life so that they just removed the soundtrack. Not the best way to handle the story. None of the character actually has no arc, and if "significant" events happen, the audience did not care, because of the art of film irritants so high at that time. Film songs, and to this end, the signs on the mouthpiece lyrics as they sing ... the technician working on the first stanza of this is done, and the grating on the nerves after that. It does not feel real or fake, it just feels unwanted. <br /> <br /> The terrible acting with the characters find one mood and play. Poor lighting at times. Only kudos I can give the film with respect to several scenes shot in the newscast, but techniques as used in the cinema today that the film did little to further it. Good soundtrack, but nothing I quickly buy. Bad film.
