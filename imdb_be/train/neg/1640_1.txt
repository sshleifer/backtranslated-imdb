This film is not enough ... it all: history, acting, surprisingly, creativity and soul. Fifteen minutes later, I looked at the screen, saying, "How do these guys could get together and consider themselves friends (even without the women)," Another fifteen minutes, I prayed for as much as Amanda Peet as possible. If a bad film calmly raises his ugly head, eye candy is a good consolation. But it was not so much that! Cheated on all fronts!
