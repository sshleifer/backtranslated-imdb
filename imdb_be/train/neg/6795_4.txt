Comeback begins to look promising, with a rigid scene death mask wearing killer. The mask itself is pretty cool too, and looks almost identical to that used in the 1990s slasher "grandmother." From then on the film, mostly dull. We get a few more deaths, which is again good, but not enough. The cause of death is so good, because they're bloody mad. The story behind the movie is actually quite interesting and would work very well, if it were not so sad, for the most part. <br /> <br /> I would like to avoid it if you are not a die-hard collector - there's not enough here to even make it to the average slasher flick.
