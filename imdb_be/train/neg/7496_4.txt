It's hard to put into words, almost seething hatred I have this film. But I'll try: <br /> <br /> every word profanity, sex scenes were uncomfortable, drugs were rampant and the stereotype was above the norm, if not offensive to Italian-Americans <br /> <. br /> I'm not saying that the action was scared because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito and others. al, have shown good results. But ... almost every character in the film, I despised. Not so Bonfire of the Vanities is, I did not love every character on the screen.
