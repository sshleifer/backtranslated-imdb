I can not believe this has a blockbuster movie. It was so bad. I was completely fooled the field of art. Do not be fooled !! It's not worth your time, I promise you. I do not know if the positive reviews about this film was no joke. I'm so disappointed. :( <br /> <br /> description on the reverse side of the box, does not even match! The girl, who is on his fishing rod is a stripper. Synopsis on the back says that she only 17. Did the people who write the description for a movie even bother to watch it? These positive responses had to be a joke, they just had to be. If someone really liked this movie, I lost faith in humanity. <br /> <br /> And even do not get me started on the stories than the name. Or the fact that the entire film was made only 2 seats ah. Or that the police were not even close to the actual shape. Why would you even say that ?? Who cares about the uniformed cops? compared with the rest of the film uniform, were in place. <br /> <br /> This the film is an insult to the zombie genre and all its supporters.
