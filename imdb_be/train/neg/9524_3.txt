The Story of a useless poet and singer sidekick, who puts his music expression. Directed by Danny Boyle has not lost his passion for raking in a ditch for human characters, but he has lost, in this film, the edge to create inspiring and funny movies. Slut painful to watch and hardly justified by the fact that it was made for television.
