The main complaint with this film is the fact that I can not tell who is who. A lot of racism was not going to, but the Asians look after all! I can tell some of the stories, but heck, that's how it goes. peoples' identity is not a secret, if they were a mystery, I would take care of them. Instead, I was not from the screen as quickly as possible. <br /> <br /> A ton of wide shots and quiet Emotionless people take this film. Heck it's sad, I just do not know these people, but they were just sitting there. <br /> <br /> Production typical chinese John Woo, scary scenes video spots. It looks only slightly better than Andy Lau "Job Killer" (which was a great movie.) You would think with a decent budget, they could at least make it look like the 90th Hollywood. I did not know that the Chinese had the Arthouse beatniks.
