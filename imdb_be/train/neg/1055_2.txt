* Spoiler * <br /> <br /> First of all, I rated this film 2 of 10. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, but there are too many stupid mistakes in the film, otherwise make it a psychological drama, that it might be. First of all, it is not fighting alone. After the initial very strange question from his mother (which is not plausible when the mother is so kind and loving later in the film), the victim is not alone. <br /> <br /> It is also incredibly naive always falls into the wrong crew traps. <br /> <br /> Her friends are incredibly ugly. <br /> <br /> The thing that I find most incredible that Ethan has no control over the team when it changes its opinon. Ethan is very crew leader (hey, they even say so), and people seem to think the other guy a jerk, but if ethane changes his mind, he simply will not be able to convince at least one man in the Crew that he is right and that his ex boyfriend is not. Everyone just hates him ... why ?? The film does not give any explanation. How did he ever become a leader? <br /> <br /> A funny remark that my girlfriend thought I was looking at Beverly Hills as she entered. Two actors from one successful series .... cheapest way to get the audience?
