When I went and saw this movie, I had high hopes. But I was so wrong. This film was the same as any other horror movies. This virus, zombies, etc. Just like Resident Evil and many, many other films. But the difference with this and other films, is that the story is very week. It's bad actors and sad music. Picture is OK, but the rest of the total shit. If you do not see this "horror" movie, go and see the ring 2 or any other movie that much more of the story. I hope that they will stop making horror movies that has a virus and spread of the virus and make people zombies. We've seen enough. The only good thing in the film, when they stand on the roof and shoot the known infected celebrity.
