** Contained Noise ** <br /> <br /> I have heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the conclusion, in particular, it was terrible. What I did not expect was a complete change of Hals about twenty minutes to go. What begins as a typical cowboy / western Indian suddenly descends into a very dull romantic "comedy" about Honus (Soldier Blue played the title Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen), who escape the pressure of the cavalry of Cheyenne. Much of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people, so a bit of a romantic comedy. Pleasence then turns up and kidnaps both of them without any real reason. Then they run and how to turn up (separately) in the cavalry bases on the eve of the attack on the base of Cheyenne. As Cresta was married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs, she runs a cavalry base and connect with them. So far, so every day. Then the end comes. After enduring more than an hour of bad acting involving templates will they / will not they get together the plot, the film then becomes a top operation involving among other things the decapitation and baby shot in the head. The similarity can be done with Wild Bunch at this point of the film, but the Wild Bunch kept the same tone throughout and did not resort to extreme gratuitous violence. In a sense, the soldiers blue reminds me of Frank Perry last summer, which is also completely changed the course of the shock is over. I do not hate the soldiers of the Blue and to find the ending is particularly alarming, but just found it to be pretty bored with overly rigid isolation. If you want to watch a movie with a really alarming slaughter innocent, I would recommend El Klimov, Come and see.
