What begins as a rather clever farce about a few shady security company monitoring is almost instantaneous, uninteresting and completely senseless murder mystery. David Arquette and a large powerful Stanley Tucci try to make this train derailment watchable, but some things are just not humanly possible. <br /> <br /> For example, what causes Gail suddenly turn from a sweet maternal figure in a drunken shrew in his parents' home, Tommy? Why Henry, though admittedly sleezebag, want to destroy the business, to which he devoted his life, robbing and possibly killing its customers? Why do seemingly intelligent, Tommy felt that Henry could be a killer (based almost entirely on the dream), and even if this were true, why does not he go to the police? And why not Gale activate the alarm when she returned home, especially after scolding Howie that away? Of course, all these events are necessary for the scene (and I use that term very, very poorly) to unfold. And it may be forgivable if it led even the slightest comedy. But all of his descriptions Howie date rape to false coroner Gale, until the final "joke" about Gale and Howie still dead, more tasteless, and pitiful than anything else. <br /> <br /> I was checked, which indicates that my comments contain "spoilers", but nothing more than I or anyone else could do to ruin this thing that already stinks to high heaven.
