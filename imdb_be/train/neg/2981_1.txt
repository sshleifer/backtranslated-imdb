The film has recently been released on DVD in the United States, and I finally got the opportunity to see this hard-to-find gem. He even came up with the original theatrical announcements of other Italian horror classics as «SPASMO» and «Beyond the Dark". Unfortunately, the previews have been the best thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> «ZOMBI 3" in a bizarre way actually associated with the infamous Fulci "ZOMBIE" franchise, which began in 1979. Similarly, in comparison with the "zombie", "ZOMBI 3" consists of threadbare plot and some very bad actors, who holds the "horror" garbage just to survive. Blood is almost nonexistent (if one is not afraid of people running with green moss on their faces) and English dubbing incision below uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The plot this time includes some secret military operation with a bunch of inept scholars (ie. an idiotic man and his stupid female side kick) who develop any chemical called «Death One», which should revive the dead. If my ears do not need to be tested, I do not even remember the reason for the study of «Death One». It seems to exist only to wreak havoc on the poor souls who made the mistake of choosing a "star" in the cinematic festival of laughter. <br /> <br /> Anyway, «Death One» experimenting on a corpse (who I swear looked like Yul Brynner), and after it is injected into his system, he sits up straight and his head explodes! Sound effects are also a lot of fun - as a person cadaver bubble with green slime, the sound of "crumpled paper" can be heard. Toxin «Death One» transported outside and "hi-jacked" a group of thieves, where one does away with it, but infects himself after struggling on the open vial. <br /> <br /> Of course ,, the guy turns into a zombie, but not before he makes his timely escape in a cheap motel, a humble porter infects and kills the servant, pressing her face in the bathroom mirror (!). Military catches wind of this and take immediate action to "liquidation" of all those who are not lucky enough to be within the "infected zone" and turn upside down motel. They are infected with the thief and burn his body, only to smoke infect a flock of birds which flew over the chimney (!). <br /> <br /> We are reduced to the introduction of a group of people on leave from the army, listening to "windup music" that comes out of a small elegant boom-box while the rear of the trailer load slutty girls, leaning out of windows and displaying their boxes. Can anyone say "zombies food"? We also podagovor with the participation of girls and her friend behind the wheel of a car that had stopped to examine a group of birds, lying on the road ... the same birds that were infected "zombie" smoke! <br /> <br /> birds attack each other and she goes on a desert gas station to search for water. This is one of the most incredibly fun moments of the film. She goes to this old dirty, rusty, and obviously abandoned building, where she continues to ask aloud, «HELLO? There are here, please, I just need some water! "She meets a group of zombies, one of which is fixed on the wall (!), And the second was waving a machete. After a bit of rumbling and tumbling around on the ground, she escapes, but not before blow up a gas station with her lighter. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the birds attack the trailer load whore and one girl gets pecked and infected. They all pulled to the same motel where the infection originally occurred, and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film occurs. After several hours (a day in the best case), then the motel is now caked in dust, have vines growing on its entire length, and it looks like he sat derelict for many years. Anyway, what better place to hide than in this particular building? Needless to say, the group begins to deteriorate as more people go along to get yourself stuck in an incredibly stupid situation related to the zombies attack. <br /> <br /> The third point concerns the most cheerful man and woman, to explore the abandoned village from which a woman says, "This place is a dump!" She then goes to "pushed" from the balcony of the zombies in Pirahna (?) infect water where she had her leg bitten off and turns into a zombie for a few seconds! At the same time, her friend at the motel, which was pecking and infected HOURS earlier still turning into zombies! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are too many inconsistencies in the film, making the film too stupid for words, for example, the rate of time on infected people being «Zombified» is very different. Sometimes it takes a few seconds, other times it takes a few hours. Some zombies are fleeing, others drag their feet and go very slowly. Some even do kung fu moves, while the rest are hidden under a pile of hay to surprise people. Some of the zombies even talk! Funniest moment, of course, the infamous "zombie head in the fridge," stop-gap, which "lifts" itself in the air and "attack" stupid man who goes in search of food. Oddly enough, his girlfriend gets her throat torn out a "headless" counter-part (LMAO!). <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment for me though was the lack of storylines involving people who are in fact killed by the zombies. We never see them come back as zombies, because the only ones we see «Zombified» are those birds pecked and one girl who gets her legs bitten off. I In addition, at least, waiting for the couple, who were killed in the kitchen and / or the guy who was killed on the bridge to come back as a zombie. It is also surprising that the zombies only take "a few bites," and then move on to the next victim. <br /> <br /> Funniest moment was, of course, the zombie fruit. A pregnant woman who was infected with lies on a bed in the hospital. The woman, who seems to have a lot of "medical knowledge" is trying to take the child (!) And has her face pulled zombies before having her head pushed into the woman's abdomen, where the hand bursts, and proceeds to ripam rest of her face. Timeless! <br /> <br /> As usual, all the characters are ideal stereotypes of the genre. Megalomaniacal military, pathetic useless screaming women who cry to kill, obvious symbols that are going to kill (ie. Watch the man chasing the chicken!) I think this film is really a comedy. There were a lot of ridiculous scenes, such as a barn, which gets blown grenade (probably the scene where the entire budget has been carried out) and the climatic scene where the man screams: "I'm THIRSTY .... THIRSTY FOR YOUR BLOOD! ". The costumes are very bad - the same zombie appears throughout the film, wearing the same "Asian as" clothes that can be found in the film Bruce Lee, and watch out for the blue 60-skirt girl to a motel to wear when she and her boyfriend crashing into an infected person. <br /> <br /> at the end of the film leaves the door open as usual for the apocalyptic storyline. Radio DJ, telling throughout the film turns out to be a zombie himself and warns his listeners about the "beginning of the end" while two survivors take off in a helicopter. It is unlikely that "Dawn of the Dead" stuff if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this film really bring a lot of laughter. Gore is minimal, and the blood is then very convincing, not to mention the mundane. Usual mixture of black blood, mucus thick green oozing from weeping wounds and "zombie makeup", which consists of green moss. «ZOMBI 3" does a good rent to sleep for the night party or beer and popcorn. Furthermore, horror fans should stay away. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10
