This film is very slow and has no plot. He transmits the life of a group of laid-off boatworkers. One of the oldest is sincere in his attempt to get a job. There may be some social commentary here, but it is confusing as no one is painted in a very favorable light. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why it was 7.8 when I decided to look at. I watched all the tedious thing and built a huge waiting sacrificial win. No luck. IMDb rating has always been such a good match for my taste. Anything above 6.5 is worth watching. <br /> <br /> And my wife says Javier Barem not even look good in this movie. He's not my type, so my consent does not mean. <br /> <br /> Sigh. I give it a 1.
