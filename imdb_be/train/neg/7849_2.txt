The film picks up after the last few years with the installation of a remake of the military on the electronic surveillance equipment in the desert, where the attack took place in the first film. The crew were killed not long before a group of soldiers on maneuvers show not find anyone around. You can fill in the rest. <br /> <br /> This is an image all around the salary. There seems to be no passion in one's speeches in no one behind the camera. This is a film that was made for money and nothing else. At some level, it was supposed to work, it might be more horrible Southern Comfort (where the National Guard was interrupted a few people in the swamps), but instead he was not much of anything. For the most part, you can blame the script written by an incredibly partially Wes Craven, who again and again strikes the same old goals. Add to the mess of the fact that the direction of a vague and many of the sequences is lacking luster, to remove any inherent tension in any scene. <br /> <br /> This is not bad per se, but poorly made and boring, Let me my feelings into context: The reason I saw this movie because the local multiplex fucked and ran the film and not the children pour the last Mimzy, and I wanted to see what caused a cry (I have in mind the films have so much in common, he says sarcastically). I am convinced that this movie will scare only those who, as the last Mimzy.
