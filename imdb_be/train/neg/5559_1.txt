This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Avengers held the dubious honor ?? but no more. Acting "Jill the Ripper" is terrible and eclipsed only story. This film is as intellectually stimulating as the Telletubbes. He does not know whether he wants to be in the S & M flick or very bad thriller. Just look under extreme intoxication, or if you need a bed and covered by a leather-clad distraction. This script must be processed in the adult, it does not take a lot of effort and will have a longer shelf life. Porn, porn, even bad, will not do harm to the career of Dolph Lundgren in the way that this film has.
