Does anyone stop to understand what film they made here? Now let's former naval officer becomes assinged to a group of children in the Cadet Corps, so it should be a family comedy right? Wrong. It's just rude comedy aimed at teens with bad taste in many things .It could be watchable in a very blunt, at this moment, but I found Damon Wayans voice is irritating beyond belief. he has to say, just like in real life? If he is, he has his liking, but he won`t get any of my money from watching his films
