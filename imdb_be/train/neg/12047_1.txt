I had the greatest enthusiasm going into the pre-screening for the film. In the end, this is one of the oldest and most complex stories known to mankind, and it was one of the first of epic stories that I read as a child (even before Tolkien). I must say that it was a huge disappointment. They totally make the story as a joke, and turned the thing in one long soap opera. Elements that were true story had run through so haphazardly that the audience laughed many times to fool a script that only in words of this battle of all battles. It was a huge disappointment to see the complex nature of how Achilles (which has a wonderful combination of close sample of such a force, complete ruthlessness and men in the original poetry lovers) refer to "Fabio on the beach" in the form of Pitta (which is a good script and more effort could turn it into a very sophisticated and original warrior figure of Hollywood ever created). The actors were really worthy, trying to make the best of a ridiculous scenario. It was really a waste of so much talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean was dire). Compare that with LOTR or Gladiator, and did not even hold a candle to them. Many miser to give Tarascha more, but not enough battle scenes for the film, which is going to one long battle and precipitation. I would not recommend that someone pays to see this story dragged through the mud, as one of the characters has been (at least they got that part right).
