I did not know it was a silent film with narration. I do not care about silent movies - formulaic humor, a flickering light and the film, etc. I am sure that assigns the lowest score I have assigned him. It was about the 8th chapter, before I found any interest in this story, and if I was I popcorn, maybe threw it on the screen. Perhaps it refers to the sci-fi crowd? The only thing missing was the scene of zombies and brain transplant. I went with two other people on a Friday night, and there were a total of 6 people all over the theater. Isabella Rosselinni gave this film - in one nice aspect of the film. Nobody has posted a comment yet how much they enjoyed it and did not appreciate the unusual approach to telling this story. I can not recommend this film.
