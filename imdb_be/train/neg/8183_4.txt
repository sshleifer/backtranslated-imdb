This is a pretty hand-down of the relative WW II codes were broken, stolen, etc. Act that I expected from this roll MGM «B» actors. <br /> <br /> One big caution. Jean Rogers, who has done such a great job playing a very sexy Dale Arden in the first two series Flash Gordon awful in that movie. Her character is very annoying. It absolutely never allow her to replay. We must believe that in the midst of World War I that is likely to be the best secret code of the object, it will be solved just pop in and from any office of her choice, even though it has no official function. From this perspective, I am very sorry that I have ever watched this movie. It forever changed my perception of Ms. Rogers. Talentwise, it is ultra light. <br /> <br /> Lee Bowman his usual self, which means that it is the only adequate. <br /> <br />
