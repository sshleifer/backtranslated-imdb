Watching the trailer only to Theodore Rex, you might think it's bad buddy cop comedy with Whoopi Goldberg and a guy in a dinosaur costume. This is true, but it is basically a futuristic story that looks like Batman Forever with his leadership style and strange character design. He was mismarketed, and has been marketed as a futuristic fairy tale, and not just a lame comedy police. Is this film, it's still a terrible film mismarketed. <br /> <br /> In the future, the dinosaurs were brought back to life through strange technology, and they talk and walk like humans. Teddy dinosaur detective who has never taken seriously, but after the dinosaur was killed, he gave a deal to work, but it should be partners with tough cop of them all, Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg). It is still inconsistent duo to solve the murder, and it's up to the audience not to sleep long enough to make it through this part of the crud. <br /> <br /> Teddy begins now as a normal valid character, but in the end, it is unbearable to listen to. For some reason, however, the detective, he was too bad a bad comedian and impersonator. He does an imitation of famous people and accents, and has some really horrible line. Whoopi accuses him farting, and he says: "It's not my ass pipe!" Wow! What frivolous, immature line, even for a film of this caliber kid. Whoopi also annoying and rude to everyone. I had hoped that Teddy would bite her head over the entire length of the film. <br /> <br /> This film never knew he wanted to be. If futuristic scenes and the action takes place, there is no comedy or humor. In all the scenes without action, the characters are trying to be as funny as they are, that only leads to a non-stop straight edge boredome. Scenes do not work because they are also quite strange and exuberant, and, as mentioned earlier, just a bunch of dead comedy jokes. Nothing ever works here. <br /> <br /> Having a dinosaur / human detective duo seems quite original film, if nothing else. No! This film is a huge rip-off Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Simply replace the dinosaur cartoons, and install it in the future, and it's exactly the same story. Man dies, the dinosaur was killed. Dinosaur and detective solves a murder toon and detective solves a murder. The bad guys are in Roger Rabbit, Christopher Lloyd and tenderness. The bad guys are the guy who sounds like Christopher Lloyd, and the guys who are just like a weasel. Club scene in Roger Rabbit, where Jessica Rabbit down on stage simulated dinosaurs. ! This is a huge rip-off of the film is much better <br /> <br /> In general, it's a bad film, not even deserve it right VHS growth <br /> <br /> My rating .: 1/2 ****. 90 min. PG for mild violence, language and crude humor.
