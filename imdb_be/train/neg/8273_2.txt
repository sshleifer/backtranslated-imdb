A lot of promises and nothing more. All star cast, of course by HK standards, but a man of the people is a bitch. No history? This is good, the action will be done to him, as the majority of clicks actions HK. What? Action terrible, banal, and rare? Dragon Dynasty releases up to this point in general are excellent and generally considered to be a classic in Asian cinema. This rot. They managed to argue a couple of actors from Infernal Affairs, but they can not breathe life into a disjointed script. There is a dialogue scene where two or three lines that are spoken with a cut between each, and there is no continuity in the fact that the characters speak. You almost feel that they each give a running monologue and simply ignoring the other characters. Michael Biehn is made of wood, really? Hung Summit uses understudy? No way. Yes way. Stay away.
