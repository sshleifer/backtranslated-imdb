Fun obvious "drama" about a bunch of high school (I think) the children who are non-stop hip-hop, breakdance, graffiti and trying to become a DJ at the Roxy - or something. To be completely honest, I was so bored, I forgot! Even people who love music, agree this film badly acted, and - as a drama - went bankrupt. We have to find it cute and beautiful children. I found them soft and sad. One that I really hated Ramon. He does graffiti on subway trains, and it is considered as big. Excuse me? He defacing public property, not his to begin with. In addition, these "big" kids connect electricity of the city so that they can spend a great dance party in an abandoned building. Uh-huh. Thus, we have to find a bunch of lawbreakers sweet and funny. <br /> <br /> I could forgive all that when the music was good, but I can not stand hip-hop. The songs were - at best - mediocre, and they have been non-stop! They always play! So much so, that I was fast forwarding through a set of infinite musical numbers. (Cut the music and HAVER 30-minute film - can be) there are a few creative rooms - underground dance battle, really ridiculous number of Santa and climate Roxy show. If you like hip-hop your movie here. But you are looking for a good drama in the mixed - forget. Also, how did it get rated PG? There's an incredible amount of abuse in this.
