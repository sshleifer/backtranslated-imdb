For those of you who have never heard of this (or saw him on A & E), an attacker brilliant British series about overweight, who smoke, foulmouthed psychologist by the name of Fitz, who helps the police department in Manchester to get violent criminals head. It is considered one of the best shows ever come out of Britain (and that's saying something), and has been extremely successful in the UK and around the world in 1993. <br /> <br /> At the present time, the original stars have again He has teamed up with the original writer to knock another 2-hour episode. I loved this show ever since I first saw it, more than a decade ago. DVD box set takes pride of place in my collection, and I can cite many interrogation scenes Fitz almost verbatim. The idea of ​​Robbie Coltrane reteaming with Jimmy McGovern for another TV movie about Fitz filled me with absolute fun. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the good. One of the many things that impressed me about the original Cracker series was how quickly Fitz was defined as a symbol. Five minutes later, in the first episode ?? his lecture (throwing books into the air), his drunkenness and his quarrels with Man after his turn slot machine ?? and you know, just know who this character is. You can feel it "click" in your mind, click the form that occurs only when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writer. <br /> <br /> Coltrane, of course, was great throughout the show, but I always felt that some of the later episodes ?? those that are not written McGovern ?? abuse nature <br /> <br /> So, the good news is the following :. Fitz returned. As soon as you see it on this show ?? that makes it incredibly ridiculous comments on his daughter's wedding ?? you will feel that the "click" again. This is it: the annoying one moment and really sorry the next, always insightful, sincere to the point of indiscretion, but brilliantly funny in the process. If you like the character in the same way as I do, you will be delighted, as depicted in the film. And this applies to Judith and Mark: in fact, all that has to do with Fitzs handled perfectly <br /> <br /> The problem I have with this film revolves around trying to solve the crime Fitz .. Standard Cracker fashion, we know exactly who the offender in the first five minutes ?? the unknown is to Fitz understand it. In this case, we have a serial killer who for American blood. And the reason for this, unfortunately, is not due to some plausible psychological trauma ?? but it seems that the murder is simply that the writer to show their personal political beliefs. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to write this, as I truly believe that Jimmy McGovern is one of the greatest writers in the world. I also have a problem with movies that are about current issues or films that take a political position. But Cracker universe, we expect that the characters behave like human beings, not as caricatures. Instead, the Americans in this film all the shows in full stereotypical fashion. They know nothing loudmouths complaining about everything related to the local people like crap and cheat on their wives ?? one of them even manage to do all of the above in less than 5 minutes. I honestly thought I had mistakenly switched channels or something. <br /> <br /> But it does not stop there. We get a constant reminder of how much the Iraq war would be ?? reminders that have nothing to do with history and are virtually out of nowhere. Killer so busy ranting about how Bush worse than Hitler, that he almost forgot to get to the murder; but more importantly, he is a mouthpiece of the political views of the writer that he forgets to act like a true man, and so we ?? the audience ?? do not buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man to the tortured soul of serial murder. <br /> <br /> I can not say that it has ruined the show for me ?? it was still a good TV, it is better than almost anything else in the genre (mostly because, again, Coltrane). But his constant politicking made it impossible for it to be as good as the real Cracker classics like "To Be Someone" ?? episode, which was the same as «issuey», but one that has been treated with much more subtlety and psychological depth <br /> <br /> Two other little things :. Panhandle not be around disappointing, but what is even worse than its replacement, the entire police department ?? that so long filled with such great characters - now full of vanilla. Fully interchangeable police, who did not have any and all persons (as you can drain off the clutch Richard Coyle person for me, but really missing here). <br /> <br /> In addition, there are a couple of moments where the show lost its believability for me. One such example revolves around Fitz to narrow down all of Manchester's population from 1 million to a hundred on the basis of some strange criteria (French windows? How the computer to know if I have French windows?) ?? he not only managed to do it, but he managed less than an hour. I do not think so. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, I was a little disappointed. Recommended viewing, but be sure to leave at least some of your expectations at the door. However, if there is a new series to come after that, it would have been for the benefit of all can be, now that he got his politics from his system, he can return to the letter, I am convinced that McGovern might still write a great material and people.
