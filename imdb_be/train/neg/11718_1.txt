It's incredible !! ..yes, who wrote me that it was time to spend on a seat and watch the movie .. it! Do not do that! I'm totally annoying! I loved Wesley Snipes and I founded it funny that he played the meaning of his name in the movie. Anyway, I would like to see this movie (only at home, of course), but now (only after) I am totally disappointed! It was his worst film ever. Inwatchable !! Bad actor to play! Bad cameraman! Bad script! ..Only one good think: what a beautiful girl! There must be a dummy, of course! Eeee !! MB ..10 line at least? I do not want to waste time, you will be more to read my mind! I hope I was clear and a stable, because English is not my native method speak. So that the lattice period, and watch a good movie, I try too .. Peace!
