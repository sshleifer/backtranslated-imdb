I saw a lot of Sci-Fi Channel original movies ever since I started watching them in 2002. (My first one was a saber-tooth - which is actually one of the more interesting Sci-Fi Channel has, in my opinion). Their quality varies. Some of them are average, but decent (saber-tooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Devil Swamp), some of them are ridiculously bad, and then there are some that are really scary. Raptor Planet is in the latter. <br /> <br /> Raptor Planet, a loose continuation of the 2004 Sci-Fi Channel original Raptor Island is a little mess watchable film with really hardcore action and lazy writers. Effects that bring the dinosaur to life (a combination of puppetry and Animatronics and CGI and footage from the Raptor Planet) are some of the worst effects of perspective that I have seen in the low-budget film. Gore effects even unconvincing. <br /> <br /> The plot includes a bunch of commandos, who for some reason (I forget why) journey to the planet alien dinosaurs. That's right folks, dinosaurs aliens. Dinosaurs in outer space. What's next, a shark in space?!? The rest of the story is simple. The man who cast removed and eaten. To date, we've come to expect this in many dinosaur movies and novels that are released, but this is the first dinosaur killer film that I've seen where I actually got bored with all the dinosaurs attack. <br /> <br /> There are a few laughs in it, though. There's one scene that stands out, in which people are currently munching on Carnotaur (revived footage from the original film), it becomes a giant lizard in a few seconds. In addition, the bit of trivia, this is the scene where Steven Bauer shoots his own death scene from the first film. <br /> <br /> While the Raptor Island was not a good movie to begin with a masterpiece compared to its continuation. <br /> <br /> Believe me when I say that this is quite possibly the worst movie ever Syfy aired. It's darn near unwatchable.
