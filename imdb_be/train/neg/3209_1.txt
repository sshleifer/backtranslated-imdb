I also saw this amazing piece of bad "anime" in the London Sci-Fi Festival. If you have to see this thing, do it with a large audience, preferably after a few beers, you can then pick up some fun with this. <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue is hilarious, settled in my mind is the introduction of an arsonist. Animation terrible. It is poorly planned and poorly executed. This may be a good idea for the producers to hire at least one person who was not colorblind. <br /> <br /> There's nothing else to say, really, this film a failure on every level.
