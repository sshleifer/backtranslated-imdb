I liked how it started showing some decent special effects, especially for the film 50 years. There are some pretty spectacular scenery. However, the film bogs down quite early with some very dumb dialogue, both men are trying to flirt with Anne Francis «Altaira Morbius.») <br /> <br /> Look at this 90 years after a long absence, it was fun, again to see Francis, an actress who has done mostly television shows, since the film was released .... and still operates. It was also interesting to see a youthful appearance by Leslie Nielsen ( "Dr. John J. Adams"), which I would not have known if it were not for this voice <br /> <br /> I watched half of the film came to boredom almost overwhelming, and I had a strong desire to go to sleep. I appreciated their re-do it video cassette stereo. but it was weak. This is one to overestimate the film where "elite" think, "heavy" and "that make you think." This is nonsense. He only appeared "smart" because the rest of the '50s sci-fi movies have been so stupid !! <br /> <br /> Some if the early scene would look great on wideescreen, that I did not have at the time of this writing. Maybe another look - this time for 2.35: 1 widescreen transfer force me to change that opinion.
