When the film was released, he was the biggest hit, and soon became a blockbuster. But, to be honest film funny clock with a story that celebrates a loser. The film has a tag line - "While MADHURA, traction Amara", which means sweet love, but immortal Sacrifice. In the film, the film (Ganesh) hero sacrifices his love for the leading lady (Pooja Gandhi), even though the two love each other! His justification sense string tag. This film influenced so many young broken hearts, that they found such an attitude "Loser as a sacrificial" very thoughtful and, thus, has become a cult film that, when they could have moved to their lives. Ganesh actions amateurish film, Stupid and silly child. He actually looks funny in the song, (Onde Ondu Sari ...) when he should look all cool and stylish. His appearance did not help a leading role. His hair style is poorly done in most of the film. Pooja GANDHI CANT ACT. Her monstrous costumes in the movie and is very contradictory. <br /> <br /> A good portion of the film is excellent cinematography and brilliant music Mano Murtha, who actually are the true saving grace of the movie. Also lyricist Zheyant Kaikina very well written. Director Yograj Bhat should be praised picturization songs in an elegant way. <br /> <br /> Anyway, all-in-all of the songs, except that the film is a very common one !!!!!!
