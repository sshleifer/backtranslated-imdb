Slow, boring, very repetitive. Not surprisingly, the Weinstein Company did not buy it. It Spurlock should eat more McDonalds while filming himself and quit the production. There is no way you can watch it and enjoy. Preacher is a joke. The whole idea is not funny. You can make a 2-minute film with this idea is not a function. I'm so sorry that I'm shooting this film. I will never do anything in the name of Spurlock to look at him. This is absolutely rubbish. Filmmakers, as it should be on YouTube, and will never be given the distribution business. The film argues that US consumers and their shops are at fault for the current depression when buying and purchasing products, making money circulating in the system are the foundation of a healthy economy.
