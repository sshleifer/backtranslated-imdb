First observed 5/27/2009 - 4 10 (Dir - Harold Young): Universal mummy third film is about the same as the first two, as a final result from the viewer's perspective. The story is similar and ho-hum results. At this time, a place of the story is the United States, as a new follower of the Egyptian priest sends a mummy in our country, in the hope that he can restore it to kill the descendant of those who opened the original tomb. At this time the mother is played Lon Chaney (which does not make much difference, because he really did not ask to do a lot of acting for this character). New priest becomes a morgue-keeper in the city and sends a mummy to do their dirty deeds after feeding it cheap leaf juice. Again, the girl gets in the way, as a priest falls into one of the groom's descendant and wants her to be immortal so --- with him (do not we heard this before?). The plan, of course, disrupted as inhabitants to hunt down a mummy with torches (by analogy with the monster of Frankenstein) and the burning creature completes the story ... how they get continued ?? I think you learn from the next in the series ?? or not .....
