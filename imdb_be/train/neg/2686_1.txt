First of all, I'm not American or Middle Eastern. Secondly, I have no religion. The closest thing to religion, I have a sports and movies. In the future, I think I would be best to put the evaluation of neutrality and impartiality. <br /> <br /> Most of these short films is very shameful. This terrible event should be used to the memory of all the innocent people who were killed "several" barbaric and uncultured morons. Instead, most of what I saw in these short films were arrogant attempts to kill a variety of political points. Examples: <br /> <br /> 1) segment Ken Loach. Of course, we are all sad that this guy had a hard life in the country, but what does this have to the innocent victims of 2001? Two errors are not doing right? Anything! This film should have subtitles for those who have problems listening to the incoherent part of the Chilean-British accent. <br /> <br /> 2) segment is most disturbing in Shahin Yousef. It is obvious that he has a problem with logic. He justified the killing of - America is a democracy, and because some Americans voted the politicians in power, all the Americans in the end, responsible for the actions and decisions taken by their leaders in the Middle East. Helloooo! Is this guy for real ?? Some Americans do not vote! Some Americans do not even know where the Middle East; some do not even know what religion is practiced there; and most do not know the real political issues that played behind the scenes. ### Mr. Shahin, so we have all these problems in the world, because there are too many people come to your logic. Innocent victims in the Twin Towers came from all over the world. Killed firefighters, rescue workers, office workers, in pillars and air travelers have nothing to do with politics. And yet, we have no right to go about our lives, because "some" people think that everyone has to choose a side or religion. We are seen as fair game for extreme policies. <br /> <br /> 3) Israeli segment showed their own bombed sacrifice. Another director, using the event to highlight their political agenda. Sometimes, it's not about you. Some people are always thinking about "me, me, me." Sometimes it comes to other people. <br /> <br /> 4) Idris Ouedraogo segment is a joke and the other political point scorer. They obviously need the money from the international community, highlighting their poverty. Blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> This film denigrates the memory of "September 11, 2001" of the victim. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do is TRASH CAN.
