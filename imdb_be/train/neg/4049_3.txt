I do not like this car, Bill Murray, when it was originally released in the 80s, so I tried to watch it again to see if my aversion to this film was to my films of current tastes in the 80's or is it that «Stripes» it's just a bad movie. Well, the verdict and «Stripes» is a bad film. <br /> <br /> Currently, «Stripes», may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s, and it can reach out to people who have passed basic training and who are supporters of Bill Murray, but his still a bad film. <br /> <br /> Why is this bad? Mainly because «Stripes» must be a comedy, but it's just not funny. There are some laughs, but they are few and far between. Much of the film is consumed dramatic story, which is incredibly confusing and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you are used to more modern comedies such as "Anchorman," which tend to laugh in every part of the film. <br /> <br /> «Stripes» further suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Ramis lack of acting abilities. Bill Murray is a great comedian, but he was not very convincing dramatic actor at this point in his career, and Harold Ramis Harold Ramis plays. These two simply is not good enough as an actor to carry a dramatic arch film. <br /> <br /> And finally, most of the comedy, which is in «Stripes» revolves around a self-centered, smart Aleko Bill Murray man-child character, so if you do not find that funny character (as I did not), you're not going to find much of what little comedy there «Stripes» funny too. <br /> <br /> «Stripes» very film of its era, it has not aged well and is not worth watching. If you want to watch the early 80's "buddy" comedy, I would recommend "Mix with intelligence." As "Stripes" humor "Stir crazy" not as rapidly as in modern comedies, but unlike the "Stripes" it in age much better and as a result is still watchable.
