Two old friends are sent to Japan to get back the results of genetic research containing a videotape that stolen black ninja suit at the beginning of the film. In the first place, they just need to learn some ninja skills, because "only a ninja can beat a ninja." <br /> <br /> Sakura killers trying his best to be pleasant ninja movie, but not that bad. The whole movie is just so hollow and predictable, it's hard to say anything good about it: The same story has been seen in various forms in dozens of times higher, characters are too short are drawn, the direction of the dim and the script nothing surprising offer, even in the final stage that in itself is a decrease of the film (garbage) value. <br /> <br /> Even the 80-Flick Ninja fan who understands the aesthetics of trash cinema, it is difficult to find this movie even a little nice, he just does not give anything new to offer the viewer nor visually, nor in the plot. Shurikens thrown rock and roll, but it is not enough to cause the direction of the movie is meant to be similar and repeated fighting scenes stuns even the most calloused viewer after the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's hard to recommend the film to anyone. Even clumsy speech Franco Nero in the «Enter the Ninja" behind the US-Sakura Ninja assassin. Even in film visual level it does not have the balls, and a waste of time to try to find any big action scenes in this movie: There is none. In general, one of the most useless ninja-click, I have ever seen. Not interested even curiosity. Trust me on this. <br /> <br /> ½ of 10.
