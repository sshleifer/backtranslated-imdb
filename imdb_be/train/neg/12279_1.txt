Although it seems quite old shows (2002), I watched my first episode last night, and I must say that this must be the worst show. ,, Ever. <br /> <br /> I'm not one to place comments, but I was so impressed that the show may be, it is clearly trying to appease, and I'm just guessing that it was their target audience, children under 12 years old or people with a less than average IQ. <br /> <br /> I was subjected to an episode last night, contained so many disparate storylines, tried to include every possible short story imaginable and is constantly trying to preach about friendship., family, religion and politics !!! <br /> <br /> The main story that they covered in the episode: Frat house hazing gone wrong with too much alcohol - death turns Senators son, who wants the FBI to investigate death of actually killing a peanut allergy Senator considers that this may be his sworn enemy and childhood best friend, who has done this because the senator took money for their votes for the legislation, but in the end, got a conscience and did not say "no" means MULIT millionaire. Each suspect, but all have the usual alibi (former girlfriend student fucks married teacher so had to lie, dissatisfied student, as victims actually had a life changing experience, Senators enemy entirely paid a desperate student to kill the arch-enemy of the son, he gives money freely I broke many students). All this time the heroine of this dig has a niece staying, who "at this age" and in love with a boy, which she finally gets the courage to talk with the help of her aunt, but only to lose it, because "in the" girls says that he it is not enough, and so well, that with them she dumps him. Do not worry, she comes back with a boy when she learns the truth about life and "to" girls to drop her aunt explains that God is the only one who did it can rely on (I was almost sick at the moment). <br /> <br /> This "drama" is even better when Sue and her FBI team to find out who the killer is. ,, Your will laugh at this, I'm sure he did. ,, <br /> <br /> This is one of the Frat boys who only a year ago found out that he was adopted and that his real father is an international terrorist and he is trying to large real dad, killing a boy and planting bombs on funeral ,,,,,,, <br /> <br /> The characters of cardboard acting is a cardboard carton Continuity story is cardboard anyone who says that they love this show is for the brain cardboard <br /> <br /> Why do the authors of this show have tried to collect in each case in one show is that they obviously do not have any faith in the possibilities of development characters or the actors lead a simple storyline. Watching this show, like watching "Last Action Hero" with Arnie murder of 5,000 people with a tooth pick except Arnie best actor (wow, never thought it would be a day that I would like to say that !!) <br /> <br /> according to Simpson favorite character "comics". ,,, <br /> <br /> worst TV show. ,,,, EVER.
