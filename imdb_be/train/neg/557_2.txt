Hard to believe, after waiting 14 years, we have got from this part of cinematic garbage. The original was shockproof, dark thriller, which reached "cult" status showcasing fine art film as director Paul Verhoeven. This film does not add anything, does not give anything, and eventually end in a big box of failed sequels. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence could cause an intriguing story set of events with much talented and capable actors. Unfortunately, we were treated to 90 minutes of the thesis in itself indulgent life of Catherine Tramell ... or is it Sharon Stone. Perhaps pairing both. <br /> <br /> If you wish to also see the continuation of provocative sensual sex stying in «B.S.1», forget about it. You wind up with a soft pornography longing that ultimately asserts the old adage that a woman may be more attractive in the clothes than with him. It is interesting to note that the beautiful Charlotte Rampling was fussing around in her underwear through one thousand nine hundred sixty-six Georg girl when Mrs. Stone was only 8 years old. Very talented actress and very skillfully holding its own even here. <br /> <br /> If you are a true movie fan, then you should see this film and evaluate it using its own rating system. If not, you can also expect a DVD release in the "nominal" version of the "unrated" version, "collectors' edition, or" final "version, and perhaps another 14 years we will be filled with news of" Basic Instinct 3 ", in which point Ms. Stone is 62 years, and no one will really care.
