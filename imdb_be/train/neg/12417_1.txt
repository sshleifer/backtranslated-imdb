Any movie that starts with a cowhand fucks female calf floor can not promise much. With regard to stereotypes in the kibbutz, as it was 50 YRS ago, and I was there, and it's just not like that. OK each kibbutz was only a small piece of something as shown in the film (as a youth raid the kitchen at night), but you can not show the whole kibbutz was like full of all those who - for example - the juicy features. Every kibbutz has its own problems, but it is unlikely the kibbutz was all of them. Israel views were great. I still remember my youth in the garden of Eden is called Emek (Valley). Yes, and the action was too good, so you can see that not all black - just the wrong image - perhaps to too.
