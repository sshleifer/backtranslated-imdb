I love the actor is quite a lot, but the kind of story unfolds slowly. Danny Glover is doing a good job of making you wonder if he's a bad guy. At the same time, the other characters are only part of the story. Dennis Quaid was not as much space in the history of how he could have had. I thought that the first stage was a bit over the top dark compared with the way the story unfolded. I watched it again, though. I appreciated it a 5 (wish I could appreciate it in 5.5)
