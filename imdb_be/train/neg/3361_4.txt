This film was one of the greatest films ever made ,,,, it was all to make a film outstanding. Incredible action, special effects strange ...... Oh wait, I have to think of a good movie. Well, this is not one of them, it's just crap. <br /> <br /> What I want to know what would be the bone heads think that this film was 10. When I cast my vote there were 206 there, God knows what's going on in their head. Now, as for any other vote, 8 or 9 was a little too high, but 10 ??? Well, what made this movie is sooooo good to give it a 10? I know that these are the same 206 he thought that Jean-Claude Van Damme is a great dramatic actor.
