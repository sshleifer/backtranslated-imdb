There is one good thing in this movie: ass Glaudine in! Sorry to be so blunt, but it's true. It is a pity that she did not bare. That, at least, have made this mess bearable. We see another chick boobs, but it is nowhere near Lola. And man, it Armand Assante old or what? The man looks like crap! "Aftermath" normal B-Movie would be expected. Story had potential. It's like they had good ideas, but do not know how to execute them. Cinematography is just awful. Years old! Guide bend and the end result is a soft thriller with twists and discarded lame actors. Lola Gaudini big as a fox in a cheap, depraved way, but not even she saves the "consequences" of garbage and trash is not funny, just old smelly garbage.
