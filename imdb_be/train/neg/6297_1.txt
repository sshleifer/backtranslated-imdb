I'm a big fan of Martin Amis, who book the film is based. Unfortunately, the director was not able to translate the book to the screen. Roman thoroughly after modern and very artificial in his wildly overblown characters and the disintegration of the traditional story line and character development. This is a fun study of human greed, excess and void one of the Morals of contemporary British writers. Director of the film completely missed the point of the novel. In his hands shouts film together at a breakneck pace, yielding in each known Stunt firing chamber and excess carbon possible. It's like Ken Russell on acid, and is suffering from its own indulgence that older director cranked up to a hundred. Not even the (short) a glimpse of a penis a great actor Cristian Solimeno was enough to save this unfortunate film for me. Furious!
