I rarely comment on the movie, but I have read other comments and I can not believe that some people are applauding this celluloid trash. I know that there are some people who have their own agenda, but allow him to take his due; bad acting, bad shot and the story felt like a director doing this as it comes together. I'm not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film with small children, as the filmmakers obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience wants. All I can say is that this is a terrible film, the content of the poor and humiliating, amateurish production, and I'm glad that they could not make a film like this is legally today
