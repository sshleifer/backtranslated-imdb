Ah Yez, the Sci Fi Channel produces Yeti other disgusting film. I was particularly taken by the scene immediately after the accident, where the survivors were desperately looking for matches, at least half a dozen fires burned ?? without any apparent reason ?? at various points debris. The fire seemed to be the preferred theme throughout. They were looking for the bodies of lighters and matches, and finally found the box lit a fire every day for, apparently, 12, but no one has ever collected wood. Then, when a vegan (ha) to burn the body, what does it use for the accelerator? I mean, these guys were frozen ?? or maybe not. Despite the apparent low temperature All Yeti ate blood. Maybe it's just me, but even completely incredible tale (none of the survivors had never heard of the yeti or Bigfoot, until the very end), if you care about the little things larger deals are becoming more acceptable. Oh, what did a prologue (1972) relates to the rest of the film? And revolvers, warm enough to hold in your hand, cold and will not fire. Give me a break. Well, at least we've got Carly Pope, another very remarkable Canadian lass. And, with a little irony, Ed Marinaro as a coach. <br /> <br /> Well, I might as well add the rabbit, they ate (in spite of what looks like a chicken) is not a rodent and lagomorph. Now that it was a protein (or rats) would be rodents, but he still looked like a chicken. And the authors have missed a real chance that someone marked as "It tastes just like ..."
