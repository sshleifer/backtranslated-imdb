Be careful: Never Zeta-Jones nor McGregor plays a major role as the poster would have you believe. Their role in the minor. <br /> <br /> The film stumbles greatly exaggerated between comedy and realistic drama, with neither be very interesting. In particular, I believe that it is impossible to gather a lot of sympathy for the main character, not to mention his eccentric friends and sex obsessed fianc√©. The plot draws badly, and I turned it in about 2/3 - unusual for me as I would like to finish what I start. Good acting and beautiful setting take from 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
