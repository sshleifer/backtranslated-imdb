Sad, sad look, really is the place to Münster. The Munsters back to the last time (Gywnne Fred got a huge salary to return to the role of Herman Munster) in this made-for-TV movie about a pair of wax replicas of the grandfathers and Germany, which are robots "terrorizing" the city as a preparation for the robbery of the mummy cache at the exhibition. With the police on their heels, the two older television icons are trying to find out who is actually behind the crimes to clear their names. We see them dress drag as a waitress (minor HighPoint in the film), the grandfather turns into a bat with an attached wire several times (once even fly to Transylvania with Herman somehow causing his frequent flyer miles, I think), and the most annoying cousin " Phantom "sings constantly and breaks a window ad nausium! What is most sad is difficult to determine exactly: it's Gywnne (especially) and Al Lewis look so haggard in each scene, and so indifferent to the material. Is it fake costumes robots that have that school production values ​​look about them. Maybe it's funny script. crazy, mostly unfunny antics of Sid Caesar. Or perhaps he sees what has brought me joy and fond memories as a child being treated in the Super K-Mart fashion makeover. In any even the result is clearly disappointing and silly even for Munster standards. As for the rest of the cast, Yvonne De Carlo is adequate in most indolent role (although showing more cleavage than usual for a woman of her age and experience). KS Martell makes everything so not affable Eddie Munster. Joe McDonell is appealing Marilyn. Bob Hastings as the aforementioned Phantom looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd manner. The film has a real cheap feel about it even a movie made for television.
