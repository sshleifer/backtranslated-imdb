What a terrible movie. It sucks. It was awful. I do not know what to say about this movie, but DinoCrap, which I stole from a reviewer with a nail in the ass. AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sigh .. This is not Roger Corman, that I hate, it is this god-awful movie. Oh, really? But what can you expect from a movie with Homoeric computer graphics. What's one more thing, CGI suck loud; I hate this movie is terrible. This is, without doubt, the worst Roger Corman B-Movie, and probably the most fun B-Movie too. This is --- DINOCRAP! I'm sorry, I must have offended some nerd at these moments. It's just a terrible film ... 0/1000
