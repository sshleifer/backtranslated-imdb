This movie is funny, but not in a good way. Fights very poorly made, while sometimes they will try to shock you, breaking several bones, and even this only happens two or three times, certainly not enough to call it shockmovie. Gunfight means the hero can go to the open field of 10 people shot from uzi's, pick up a weapon, begin to shoot and avoid injury. <br /> <br /> The story is empty, the guy woke up, lost his memory begins to struggle owls is that he is well. Five years later, the memories come back to avenge blablabla. <br /> <br /> Do not spent, it is not really worth your time if you're not drunk and boring.
