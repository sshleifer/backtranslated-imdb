When I first saw the show, the first few episodes, seemed promising. Bill Compton presented himself as the stereotypical "mysterious" vampire and Sookie presented themselves as an independent woman. Nevertheless, the show went down here, and when something interesting characters as entertainment, like a cardboard box. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses the main characters lose their original identity, along with their current abilities. The episode 5, Bill furrowed brow so low that his face simply consists of the forehead. Bitches, or, more precisely, the actress even more dead than her vampire lover. All these tragic events surrounding it, and it reacts only on how nice it was losing her virginity. Personally, I think they did the main characters are sleeping with each other too early in the show. The way they tease each other was that I was hooked, and can be easily played a little bit more. As soon as Sookie loses she walks around like a total Dietz, only Bill's libido and the size of his appendage. Bill also loses his cheerful attitude and well, it just becomes obvious stupid. His actions are never really explained, except that he does it for Sookie. Why? Their love for each other never penetrated, if there is love. Until now, it just seems that sex, which is the foundation of their relationship. <br /> <br /> Yes, vampires are usually equal to sex, but come on. Every five seconds, I see some Humping occurs. It was not so much of a surprise, since HBO is always trying to convey a soft core porn as a decent TV show. Bill comes out of the dirt and just get it from Sookie without reason that so ever? I laughed so hard I almost peed myself. <br /> <br /> The plot is just a stream of consciousness. Characters never go into detail about anything. All events that occur normally remain unexplained. The only constant is the sex. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I can say that I like are the secondary characters. Tara and her mother had drunk far more interesting than the main characters. The only reason why I continue to watch the show for the development of secondary characters. <br /> <br /> Minus the sex and the main characters of the show would be much more useful.
