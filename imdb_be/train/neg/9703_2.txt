For those who are too young to know it, or for those who have forgotten that the Disney company almost went down the pipe to the end of the 1980s. People do not see their films more, and the company did not produce the customary useful stuff .... at least not that people did not expect. . The main problem: profanation <br /> <br /> So, idiots who work Disney films during this decade will produce films with swear words - including the Lord's name in vain, if you can believe that - embedded in this "family 'and movies'. In fact, what is happening here twice within the first 20 minutes! <br /> <br /> This film, in addition to the problems of language, has an unpleasant tone to it, and that made it an unpleasant, almost from the beginning. Fortunately, Disney woke up and made a lot of great stuff, as these decadent 80th movies. ( "Touchstone" is Disney, just under a different name.)
