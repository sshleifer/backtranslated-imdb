This film has the appearance of a student film project. Yes, there are some interesting (albeit useless) edits and arrows, but the end result was a minor. <br /> <br /> it seems the director will not say, "Look at this movie," He seemed to be saying. "Look at me I am the director" <br /> <br /> Thumbs down!.
