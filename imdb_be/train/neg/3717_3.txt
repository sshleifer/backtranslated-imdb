Chris Rock, apparently desperately cozy star-vehicle that crosses his appeal to white and black to a mass audience, updates hit one thousand nine hundred seventy-eight comedy «Heaven Can Wait» with the urban agenda. He plays a struggling comedian, who is involved in a car accident, who has his soul removed too early from his body - so that his angels have to find another body to place it, and can only come up with that white businessman. Rewriting the movie, as soft and sentimental as «Heaven Can Wait» only shows that the Eye Rock was on the spit (it was strictly corporate movement is organized mercenary most Hollywood players). Why not strive for something sublime, or more memorable than a silly comedy reincarnation, which culminates in the evening in Apollo? Terrific supporting cast (including the usually reliable Regina King, the amazing Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy, and stunning Frankie Faison) to do what they can, but Rock seems awkward and unsure of himself everywhere. * 1/2 ****
