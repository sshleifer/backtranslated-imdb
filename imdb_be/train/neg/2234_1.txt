I bought this DVD for £ 1, and now I understand why. The action was the worst that I've seen in a long time. Lighting and sound bad at best. The plot does not make sense, even if sober (NOTE: I advise you not to watch this movie, if sober.) This film feels like you're watching a movie at home, who does not get out much. It's really a shame that all the little money spent on this project went to a waste, I can not wait to see if any of those envoled still has a career but Eva Longoria who with 'it is the only "star" of the film that apparently did not hit a bad actor with a stick. I'm sorry that none of this criticism does not give constructive, but I will say one thing James Cahill, not to try again. According squirlyem «His severely lacking in good department."
