Go right and to make this film. It will be located on the bottom shelf at your local video store and will be covered with dust. Nobody hooked it over the years. It may even be a special for $ 0.50! It costs ten dollars, I swear! Buy! There's not a lot of films than can be compared with this - the celluloid version of the slime that forms on the bottom of a trash can in a few years. Yes, I gave it a "1", but it really deserves much lower. 1-10 weight were not designed with things like this in mind.
