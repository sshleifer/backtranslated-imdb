All these reviewers on the site. I've seen a lot of bad films over the years, believe me, and it has a lot! <br /> <br /> This is not just a "so bad it's good" exploiter waste of time, but real, fun, film crime. <br /> <br /> finished white furry monster thing! <br /> <br /> WET MYSELF LAUGHING at Thom Christopher "spelling weaving" is valid! <br /> <br /> GAPE In SHEER A ** E-clenching DISBELIEF! in shabby sets! <br /> <br /> This is one of those "European co-productions." It is not surprising that we are not so many wars. I swear, some of the people who take part in the "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" really do not know that they appear in the film! <br /> <br /> FACT! Initially, I watched this movie on HTV Wales late in the night, suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation. I had to track down a copy of a few weeks to make sure that it was in fact this is terrible. This. Worse even than Lee Majors in Norseman, more ridiculous than all the films of John Derek, this is, indeed, a citizen Kane basket.
