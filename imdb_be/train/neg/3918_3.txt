This film could have been the biggest LET-down, I felt in the distribution of a film based on IMDb reviews. In general, I just found it to be the second film speed. <br /> <br /> Leslie Cheung, of course, cross-country as the anti-hero and Ma Wu handles his character cheerful competence. On the other hand, Ma Wu makeup (facial hair) is so obviously false that I just could not take it seriously. He looked like overweight teenager, dressed for Halloween, complete with a $ 4.95 a stick on a beard. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so-so, although the "undead" was pretty good in the cellar. Wood-language looked like something from a bad 1950s monster flick, though POV shots from the field of view of language more closely resembled shots brands Sam Raimi in later "Evil Dead" trilogy. Pyrotechnics were ho-hum and the final battle is about as boring as you can get. (In fact, it is the most closely resembled me of "Lost in Space" episode where Robinsons caught in a sandstorm and ....) <br /> <br /> The plot was not particularly original, and was told countless times in a European fairy tales. There was no tension and plot twists. In fact, you know, as soon as you get to know the characters that well, who is bad and who is going to survive. <br /> <br /> I just returned this movie on Netflix, and then I sat down to write this review. The very first thing I did was to check the date of manufacture. So, he says that one thousand nine hundred eighty-seven ... nya 1967, I thought it might be. And that pretty much sums it up: Values ​​of production and FX typical of the 1960s. The plot and the action seems to be much older, because Hollywood was actually produces some interesting and challenging films in the 60s. <br /> <br /> ** to *****
