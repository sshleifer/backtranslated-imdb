The Mummy's Tomb begins with a review of developments in the mummy's hand, and then moves the story forward a few years, and across the ocean to the United States, where there is currently high priest and the mummy Harris wanted to harm and avenge those who violated the tomb of the past. <br /> <br /> while I absolutely loved the "mummy" with Boris Karloff as the mummy of Imhotep, and liked "The Mummy's Hand" with Tom Tyler Harris (which is the direct prequel to this film) I was not as taken with "The mummy's Tomb". <br /> <br /> It is designed in the same style as the previous film, and has a somewhat similar story although in the new circumstances. Lon Chaney Jr. in order as Harris, but does not really stand out. And I think this is my main criticism of this movie is really nothing stands out. There's nothing really wrong here, but nothing really outstanding day, so that the viewer is left with the lads quite soft mummy.
