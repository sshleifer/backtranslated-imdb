It just seems odd that someone read this script and thought, 'This is ridiculous! I mean, it's so much fun, it just has to be! "Who was this man? Is he or she the person really responsible for this? Are they friend who owes me for my time, more than the director / writer? <br /> <br /> This movie stinks almost every possible way. No one has some good dialogue, not a pleasant character. And the story ... <br /> <br /> I prefer the 2nd worst movie ever, Hulk Hogan's "no hold barred" it is quite a large extent. It seems almost Shakespearen in comparison. <br /> <br /> The ending is paved with a few minutes of outtakes, and it is still under the 80-minutes it. The outtakes include a cast member of the clowns in the "fun" mistakes that they made, and what went wrong during the shooting of this "comedy". Glad to see that someone laughs in some way, with a certain connection with the "movie." <br /> <br /> At the present time is not funny in this movie. Never mind. He just goes on and on. That's really lame. I love movies that are so bad they're good. It's so bad it's ... something, but I do not know, and, I hope, will never know. <br /> <br /> Amanda Peet Sun suck right, and in fact only half the good thing about this wannabe film. But that really does not mean much. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
