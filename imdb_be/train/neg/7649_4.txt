Joyce Reynolds seems possible, grown-up for the role of Jenny, a boy-crazy sixteen in small town America, which died its permanent guy to visit the soldiers and winds on the cover of Life (smooching in a blanket party) all in the same week! Non-stop barrage of jokes, put-downs, bullish talk, unfunny and broken businesses, such as the little sister of bribing members of the family Jenny, Hattie McDaniel (maid) is constantly flooded after a brazen baby Lisa's mother Jenny participates Red Cross, and the father Jenny tries to write an editorial about the problems with today's young people (parents, stuffy, Edward Arnold and asexual passion talkative Anne Harding makes unlikely pair, even for 1944, it appears unable to help conceive a child much less lifting the two of them). Nominated for an Academy Award (!) To edit Owen Marks', Warner Bros. This was followed in 1946 with "Jenny is getting married." Reynolds should outgrown it with then-Horts - it was replaced by Joan Leslie. * 1/2 ****
