Lethargic direction ruining otherwise convincing period of history that amazing star Zhang Ziyi, in the excellent role of a woman who joined the extremist group in 1928. China, just before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and reunites with former lover, who is currently working for Japan. Every bit of drama and the forward movement of history is sucked dry somnambulist directorial style director Lou Ye. The characters are still looking at each other for a long moment, saying nothing, hand-held cameras to keep forever on their faces, showing endless reaction path longer than necessary edits to repeat the same reaction triple redundancy. We know nothing about the characters as the story begins, and offer little new information as the story progresses, only silence and static shots of fans who do not speak, who interact through a silent dance, but do not share no obvious emotional intimacy. Very sleep inducing film.
