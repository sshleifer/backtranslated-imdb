After reading all the rave reviews about this movie and a few that give it so-so. I finally decided to throw in my not worth cents. I agree with the majority on the fact that if it were not for Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry it would be a disaster. Filmed in Mariette OH. just north of Dogpatch, where all the real talent fled south down I-77 years ago, at least as far as a tank of gas will allow. I got a chuckle out of reviewers who subtly argue that they mull over a little better than most, arguing that they had followed the story without knowing the confusion. This tiny tale Crook brothers like the old record with a pass in it. As an American, I understand the difficulties faced by film artists Ind. A trip to Romania would have destroyed the budget for sure. Let's face it, all this film was Claire loop-de-loops in the gas station, Claire on the side of the road, under the stands Clare, Clare House Clare in the cornfield, Claire at school. Claire Claire here and there. He almost became homogeneous and, if it was not the best actor in the cast. Josh and Jeff to make a living, but do not write the script on two pages and turn it into an hour, twenty-Flick. Before you write another screenplay about dreaming ghost to watch an episode or two ghosts or something and get a bit of background. All the cast, with the exception of the above and several others were busy in the first and last film. In addition, there is a view of the co-director Jeff as he is in all his films. Just as Alfred Hitchcock, eh? One thing the film has going for it is that the operator appeared to be a fixation on derri√®re Lauren Lewis. Well, with all the sarcasm now satisfied, I recommend the movie for an amateur horror just to see this young actress in the formative period of his career (I hope) and Chris Ferry has established himself as a villain worth watching.
