Be warned. This film is such a mess. This is a disaster. Do not waste your time with this. I warned you! <br /> <br /> Proceed story, dialogue, music ... basically all the way from the top, it is absolutely annoying and funny. It made me want to throw (if the dialogue / action / story does not make it all the shooting line). You will feel like you are watching a comedy. The problem lies in the fact that part of that claim is ridiculous is not even funny. Action, history, movies, you can feel all just trying WAAAAY too hard - but it never fails. Almost every shot is tilted, but so what?! This film just feels like a student film. Not surprisingly, they shot it in HD, since it would be a waste to spend more money to shoot this on film. <br /> <br /> If you are easily amused or bad acting, writing, editing, management, full of cliches, all that he had to face, oh, and did I mention the poor acting? (Well, actually, it's not all the fault of the actor - a director). Then I think you will like this movie <br /> <br /> I had to watch it for the class. I would eliminate it as soon as I could. If you still can not say now, I hated this movie. It made me want to take my time and get back ... at least I do not have to pay for this rubbish. <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum, you know ... the guy from Jurassic Park / Independence Day, in this film, but he sure went down, then - taking roles for films like this catastrophe.
