It's the nature of business to try to benefit from the success of others. Here we have a film with elements from the earlier "Dracula" (1931) and "Frankenstein" (1931) - in the German town of village leaders believe that vampires (in the form of bats), were the cause of the recent deaths of bloodless sacrifices. (! And in the caves Bronson) Although it is fired in a universal feature of Poverty Row; it is not fair to compare it to the earlier, more expensive, and made a great movie. <br /> <br /> From the familiar and exciting, cool music major titles (which have been on the Misha Bakalienikoff), through Talky but well done opening sequence, we expect the arrival of Etuill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, to give us a good 30s mystery movie. Unfortunately, this is not happening. It's frustrating. <br /> <br /> We get a little more than boilerplate elements such films, but with the slow pacing, low budget, Sun grabbed Dwight Frye, in the presence of Maud overdone Abern (Aunt Gassya), and a room for Etuill (Dr. von Niemann) require human blood or how it manifests consciousness control of the servant of his Emile (Robert Frazer) is not very clear. <br /> <br /> Do not look Technicolor «Dr. X »(1932) - which also stars Etuill and Fay Wray, but as a father and daughter - before you watch it as I did; Oscar winner this comparison. So watch this first. Structurally «The Vampire Bat» is still not so good. He runs with too much talk and unnecessary comic, not much focus on the vampire crime. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, «Dr. X «and" Mystery of the Wax Museum "(both in 1932 and co-starring Fay Wray), the most famous performances are Etuill as one armed policeman in" Son of Frankenstein "(1939) and as Moriarity in" Sherlock Holmes: The weapon "(1943). Dwight Frye steals all his manic episodes in "Dracula" (1931). As a "young lovers" Melvyn Douglas and Fay Wray have a nice kissing scenes, but that's about it. It can be seen in «The Old Dark House» (1932), and Faye gets dragged by McCrea in "The Dangerous Games" (1930). Then there is her 1933 classic "screamer". It's a pity more time, money and rewrites were not available for this film to better showcase their talents and chemistry Etuill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye. Unfortunately, then, the film is sad disappointment receives only 4.
