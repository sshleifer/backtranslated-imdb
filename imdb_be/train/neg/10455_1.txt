$ 25,000 Pyramid Evidence: Deep Blue Sea. Tremors. Slither. Attack the spiders <br /> <br /> Pyramid Category: .. Movies that were funnier and more exciting than Snakes on a Plane <br /> <br /> Hell, with this definition, I would have to include a relatively harrowing Ted and Elaine journey on the plane! . As above Snakes in both laughs and thrills, <br /> <br /> The sad truth is that it is not even close to the mother of all unintentional intentional funny snake movie: Anaconda! In addition, never seen casting JLo-Cube-O.Wilson-Stolz-WÃ¼hrer in the same movie, you have Jon Voight pull constantly cinematic robbery. His final scene alone is all SOAP tried and failed to do, like "yes absurd-is-fun" movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, Snakes on a Plane is the ultimate proof that the studio Execs and fans do the worst possible staff. Every big stage has been discussed and is divided as in the past year, all that was left to entertain, opening night was the number FanBoy flop sweat, which was supposed to be a mop in my theater. I've heard more than a forced laugh here than in the studio tapes for "According to Jim".
