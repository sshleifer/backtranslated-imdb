This film seems to be a rip off of the many films that have dealt with the same issue in the past. Let the future viewer will be warned that the «Art Heist» adds nothing to the genre. Directed by Brian Goers does not have a clue what to do with the film. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin keeps appearing in the film, and to be honest, I wonder if he's got a great agent, or is it that directors and producers love his unusual looks goofy, boast this amazing hairstyle he sports competition in most of his films. The only good film in which he appeared, it "Squid and the Whale," which he says only two or three lines. Pompey, his leading lady, is not much better; no chemistry between Mrs. Pompey and Mr. Baldwin. <br /> <br /> The film will be seen on your own risk viewer.
