This is not the first zombie subgenre review ive done, but this film is worth doing a review for. Dinocroc good movie in general, but, unfortunately, still clearly b-movie. Dinocroc itself looked great, but I thought that the movie itself needs a bit more weight, both in action and violence, because every time the crocodile specified or fight scene is not very suitable, but to show crocodiles and crocodile either kills or runs in the repeated process. Jane Longenecker was hot, which is a plus, and the effect was better than average, and the most surprising thing is that the crocodile species fleshy together as a cartoon cough * * cough Komodo curse. I enjoyed the movie enough to be glad that there will be a sequel, which is more than what I can say about some of the films as a whole. Overall, 3.6 stars, and worth watching.
