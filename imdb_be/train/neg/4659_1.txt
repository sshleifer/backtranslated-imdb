This film is a waste of films. Do you find that the map of the military mission plan will be placed on an easel on a patio in the middle of the day for those with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see? It happened in this movie. Do you believe that the deaf would actually be enlisted in the army serving in Europe during World War II to serve in the «Negro» one ... cooking, food services, burial details, and so on? It happened in this movie. Do you believe that black (and presumably intelligent) officer would choose the same Deaf K.P. to be part of an active combat mission, to protect the dam from being destroyed by the Germans before the Allies arrived? It happened in this movie. You would be surprised that the soldier DEAF realized that a German plane approaching from behind and will assault and kill him? It happened in this movie. You would be surprised that a group of American soldiers to keep up in the barn on the farm, the Germans came to b shout their emotions at the sight of German soldiers, who were only 50 'away? They did it in this film, and left all possible entrances to the barn, the Germans were able to verify completely unprotected. I believe that, over the airwaves, and in plain English, the captain mentioned the rank of general, if not his name, as the person he was talking to, and that in general, in plain English on the open ether, said that the dam had to be protected at the next day? Maybe they should have just sent to an emissary to tell in which direction the US attack will come from all to make it a little easier for the Germans. This so-called film should be placed in the list of top 50 worst films. If it was, I'm sure he will do well. Watch it at your own risk.
