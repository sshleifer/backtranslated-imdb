After the success of «Paris, Je t'aime», director of the group decided to get together and make a similar film anthology style, based in New York. Unlike the original film, the history of this film seems to sometimes come and go too fast - up to the time you think you are getting into the story, it's more than a great many cases. And often start and stop, and then start again - interwoven with history. As a result, there is no name to show that the story is completed, and it is less formal structure. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, however, while "Paris, Je t'aime» was a hit or miss (mostly hit), the majority of "New York, I Love You» was Miss. Stories tend to be much more sexual in nature, but also significantly less sweet - and often quite scary. It was surprisingly dull and uninteresting film only a few exceptional stories - and maybe often inconvenienced by the music made it seem longer. Now I understand, it was a good quality of music, but his tone grim really, really made me feel like my wrist sharply! Among the best of them was a story about a young man who took her in a wheelchair at a graduation, a couple talking about cheating outside the restaurant (although this, too, was in the first film) and a wayward old. It's all so sad, because I loved the first film so much - and I really wanted to like this movie. I respected what they tried, but it just did not really like it. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is not really a complaint, but I was amazed at how many people smoke in the film. For a recent film, which was unusual in our more anti-smoking culture. <br /> <br /> In addition, if you get the DVD, there are two segment included as additional services which were not included in the film. One consists of Kevin Bacon (wear cool felt) eating a hot dog .... and absolutely nothing else for almost ten minutes. Other features of a teenager who spends the movie filming the world - including a very unhappy couple.
