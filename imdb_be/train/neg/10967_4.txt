Believe me, I love horror movies. I like sci-fi movies. I love independent films. And I like a low-budget, films B. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, I even like bad acting, perseverance scripts, wooden line, improbable situation, and the like. However, I do not like Christmas on Mars. <br /> <br /> It just does not work on many levels. For all the reasons listed above, and many others. This includes the senseless, flagrant use of images of female genitalia. And many allusions to male genitalia, in a very Freudian way. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that this is purely from mediocrity. Unlike some attempts to do something really new. I mean, any movie that takes years to film, simply can not keep up with the level of congruent and focus requires a modern audience. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the whole movie was just a dream, or but a hallucination of the protagonist, unfortunately, it had to have happened, as we have seen things unfold on the screen. <br /> <br /> About the only kindness I can express that way at the end was huge. If it was used in the beginning, not the end, it could allow the film to shoot, which ended in 2001 ... <br /> <br /> To bad they did not try that instead. I just do not understand what is so important about this film that even had to be done. Was it a conspiracy? Of course, it could not be. Was it the characters? I doubt it; I mean, I could have lived without knowing about Ed 15. Was this a dialogue? Decidedly not. Music? Perhaps, but more likely that the ego-embellishment by the principal, who need to iron. <br /> <br /> Much better effort died on the floor of the room.
