Darkling was a very interesting and fascinating film while F. Murray Abraham was in it. Spoilers: About halfway through, F.Murray gets zapped because Darkling is a kind of demon-like creature that likes to live vicariously. He takes slackers and misfits and perverts them away, giving them everything they want in terms of success. It feeds on their implementation of the seven deadly sins. However, part of this is that it needs to people who may be flawed, but not completely evil. Otherwise, he can not "distort" its natural goodness. Said the little guy in his Barry White voice, which I found both charming and funny. Mostly funny. How can we imagine, Barry White, if he were a dwarf, and he said Gillen "Yes Yes aircraft, airplane, Bos, here EET came But Plane!Â» All through the movie, Yes Dwarf (actually robotronic cherub) talking with Guillen to Barry White voice, saying something like "This poorly, you know you want to." "Now you have committed a murder, you are actually moving in the world" and other comments that sound like commercials "for Being Evil" stores or then. It's really fun in a sick way. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Guillen entirely F. Murray Abraham, and tanks in the movie as soon as Murray gets the ax (or killed?). F. Murray brings a certain happy ill to his role in this film. He's a good actor. Guillen on the other hand, has a permanent happy grin on his face, and it looks like maybe it Procedure English Comp. class never got into the mythological characters, and he could not imagine what the film was about. The ending is really terrible and almost comic. If this film was a parody, the ending was perfect. If this is not a parody, it was terrible; but the use of a cheap little girl deliver flagrant something that the film could not deliver. The people who made this film had lost whatever they wanted to do with him somewhere before the end. It finishes, they just realized that they run out of money and had to remove substandard ending.
