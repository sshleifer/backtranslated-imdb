I can not understand why so many people appreciated the show. Twin Peaks is one of the saddest call I have ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Now I've seen all the episodes of season 1 and season 2 episode sees 1. I just can not take this show anymore. <br /> <br /> 1) Where the actual induction of a criminal investigation? <br /> <br /> in season 1, there was a scene, Agent Cooper throws stones in a bottle. Can you guess why he did it? He just wants to identify the killer, making it a "joke" referring to supernatural powers, according to the Tibetan dream. Wow !!! <br /> <br /> 2) there are too many unnecessary scenes in the show. <br /> <br /> For example, Season 2 started with a "funny" scene that dumb old Agent Cooper to serve with a cup of milk while Cooper is on the field. (He's got a gun shoots him in the stomach already.) That old man does not do anything but say some stupid comments. That's all. <br /> <br /> This scene is really sad, and even longer (3 min 30 sec .... it's like hell.) <br /> <br /> I read some comic books instead of watching the show anymore.
