As noted by other reviewers film dies in the last half hour. But before that she suffers from a predictability of performance and stunningly boring Kate Capshaw, who clearly did not find it in nature, and destroys every scene she is in. Connery well as Fishburne, but most of the scenes are manipulated for effect, rather than the truth, which overlaps with the fullness of feeling of unreality. And the ending is just amazing. The filmmakers seem to know when they are pieces of this mess together, they all needed the sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving dinner, to compensate, they added overloud «dramatic» account. Every little jump accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point where it becomes ridiculous. If you want an example of a major league bad movie is one to see, otherwise skip it.
