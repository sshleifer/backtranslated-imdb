We laughed our heads. This script is so incredible, you either overwrite on CNN or go to sleep. <br /> <br /> My father was a sea captain for 30 years, he could not believe his eyes when he saw the film. <br /> <br /> during his experience as an officer he once claimed the command of the ship, the captain drank 3 bottles of whiskey / day (sorry) s ** t on his desk. Of course, it was not in the nuclear mission. <br /> <br /> For example, a fire in the kitchen, the fire the most important thing on any ship, nuclear or not. To give the drill while just a Hollywood script. When the captain placed under arrest, he is in custody, you take all the keys and open the safe where the weapons are stored. This holds true for a few minutes in a well-protected area. He can not leave it just like in prison. <br /> <br /> It's funny, my dad also had a dog on board, however, we see how Hackman let urinate in the control room. This is not done ever. My dad clean up all the mess the dog made no matter where he was. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington make the three stars of the film is credited, everything else is bulls ** t. <br /> <br /> If we know that 23 people were still alive in the Koersk, this film gets extra dimension <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real thriller lease submarines: .. Thas boat <br /> <br />
