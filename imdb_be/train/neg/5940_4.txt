Look, I read and read those comments, and have a lot of it, I want to say, but I'll try to make it short, but clean ... <br /> <br /> First of all, lets you forget all with things like bad was made this film ... as it did not show anything the Notorious, and I agree with most people here say that it was a "Hollywood", I mean that you would expect a real life story? When people wake up and see that will never ever find the real truth about 2pac and Biggie ... It's all covered up and buried deep. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I am not against any 2pac and Biggie I like them both, but 2pac and Lil Kim DID hesitate in this film for sure ... <br /> <br /> Next, for all ya, who say that the movie is awesome and I can not see the truth, or too blind to see it too, because you think, and I know something about the BIG or you do something about it did not know and love this Hollywood movies teens. Use your mind and see at the clouds ... There is a lot that can be said that, when he gets into the subject, I did not say 60% of what I have to say, because it is very broad topic but for a movie I I can only say that it might be a little, I mean a lot better to do. But in any case, I'm just a man gives his opinion .... no offense ... <br /> <br /> Look, I love hip-hop, and I live for it, but after watching the film every person with little intelligence can see that it's not like someone is suppose to live. With all do respect 2pac and BIG, like all the other artists who make life as it is to turn another page, so as ruining the youth .... Bringing the wrong message to children, and it's not going to school, but live from the streets, hustling and just reaching for the paper .... <br /> <br /> true hip-hop is suppose to be about love and understanding, be smart and everything. <br /> <br /> OK, I know that many of you will think I am crazy, but that's just my point of view. Look, maybe I'm wrong about something and Im not saying that this is a bad movie, because even if I'm in hip hop for 17, 18 years, I still do not fight 2pac and Biggie know, regardless how many articles I read or how much I support them and listen to their music ... like most of you out there. Only people who were very close to them and the killer know the truth behind it all. <br /> <br /> And in the end, I just want to say to all ya Biggie & Tupac fans and family, it's two men and is the biggest of all time, no matter how they lived their life, but please, in the future trying to be better to learn and love one another, think well, even for those who do not love you, because in the end .. .ITS nOT ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY OR of FAME U managed to get and how quickly managed to U get to the top, the iTS about the implementation of your SELF to the full and feeding your soul, your body and mind ... because if U was able to do, you will live a life on am after death !!!! PEACE AND LOVE TO YA ALL !!!! RIP BIGGIE, 2PAC, Aaliyah, Left Eye, Jam MASTER Jay and others who make a difference in this world !!!!
