Now here's a movie that, if done in Australia would be easy one comedy. Unfortunately, and annoyingly, there it is, sluggish and cheese and overbaked from Lala land. As di-installation to get it so wrong? Well, basically, it is serious about working so funny strange that no one can take seriously in their right mind. Unless, of course, they were not alone brake gay cliché (but somehow cute) ... or it's a cliche piled on clichés. A lot of significance in the history, which seems almost like a prequel to Gerry Gus Van Sant ..... name as Choke, how it is a lead weight? Well, this is a film director should Soooooo mad that he did not get Bert and BOOGIE first, that he had to do it yourself. Corrugated and undeveloped apart from the "unrequited love is boredom," the theme from the left faded Streisand lyrics, we have only gloomy Beefcake and TV series level story line on the left. The UN needs the fourth act of this drama arrogant too long really terrible, as the film wanders Gerries how to jump and get stuck there. In Oz in the late 90-ies about 20 have done something like that, but really fun movie called Moneyshot. Originally filmed as Venus Factory too suffered from a filmmaker more terrible than Orson, so they again filmed half, was a ruthless editor of the TV, to chop it up and down to 72 minutes and hey-presto..comedy, tonight! The lesson there when bad movies turn a good zipper up. I believe Choke Stiffed on release and after watching do not perform, I can understand why.
