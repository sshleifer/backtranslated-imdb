I started watching this movie with my girlfriend. And after 5 minutes I was alone. <br /> <br /> I can stay until the end. It was a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I loved Anglade, but I think he needs to eat, as we do, and so he took to play in this film. <br /> <br /> There are only 5 characters, and the rest could be called "art" or something that I could not express, but I do not understand. <br /> <br /> only the worst movie I saw was a failure, but I'm sure now that I have enough experience to watch it again successfully. <br /> <br /> Good luck !! ; O)
