Well, let us really. Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi or the Templars, as they are often referred to did not even exist before the 12th century. The story is so ridiculous that it's pathetic. Dolph Lundgren just looked positively bored. And besides, if you want to have in the real world of the Templars, why not use the Knights of Christ, which still exist in Portugal. At least, they had to take into account the history. Only redeeming quality I could find in this film was the fact that artifacts looked pretty authentic famous medieval Gothic or part of the period. The acting was bad, the plot is terrible, terrible action, and props were in order.
