Do not waste time and money on it. Half decent cast might make you think that this teen thriller, while hardly going to break any records, may be a little entertaining for 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It will not. <br /> <br /> It does not make you afraid, laugh, cry, or even challenge your intellect. This will leave you wondering how on earth this film ever finished products. Yes, it really is poor.
