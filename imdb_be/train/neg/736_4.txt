Twenty years ago, five years old boy Michael Hawthorne had witnessed his father kill his mother with an ax in an empty road and commit suicide later. In our days, Michael (Gordon Currie) invites her friend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends by Chris (MIA Agnew), Jennifer (Vozhe), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), the NED (Brendan Beiser), Mitch Maldives (Phillip Reese ) and Trisha (Rachel Hayward), to spend Halloween in the country with his grandparents at their farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that represent their most intimate fears, and together with his Indian friends Crow (Byron Chief Moon), they will perform an ancient Indian festival, using carved wooden dummy Mort (Jon Fedele), thereby eliminating their fears forever. The greatest fear of Michael to become a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong and Mort turns to his father by killing his friends <br /> <br /> «Fear: Resurrection." Frustrated and meaningless slash film, which uses an interesting concept liquidation the greatest secret for fear of each one before he grows up, but in a dirty scenarios full of clichés. There are some exaggerated, such as Ms. Betsy Palmer; others are very weak, but generally works well. Unfortunately, there is no explanation as to why the dummy have to live; In addition, although in an environment of close friends, the group does not feel pain or sadness, when one of them dies. It could be used lowest rate for more than five minutes to build a more dramatic situation. In the end, Michael reveals the charm, that his father was concerned that I had not noticed in history. I do not know whether there was a preliminary reference is edited in the DVD released in Brazil with 87 minutes of work. The special effects are very reasonable for a B-movie. . My vote is four <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma Noite de Halloween" ( "Fear 2: One Night Halloween")
