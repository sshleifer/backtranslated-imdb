In 1966 the film «Blow Up», Antonioni had his own hero question truth on the background of the British youth protesters. By asking such questions, in relation to the fabric hippie youth movement, Antonioni questioned, whether intentionally or not, the effectiveness of these organizations. How can you fight for the cause, if what you think is true may actually be false? On the other hand, the film tells us that we must fight and actively to challenge what we see, it is because others can deceive us with false images and false truths. Although aspects of the hippies were the most sticky parts «Blow Up», they have built a good texture and give the movie more sense than it might otherwise have not. It was very instructive and mature a little film. <br /> <br /> With the "Zabriskie Point" Antonioni rejects all ambiguities and subtleties «Blow Up» and is a full-blown hippie. As a result, the film is flooded with bad metaphor, stupid ideas and heavy hand of the narrator. How can someone who has shown such restraint and intelligence of his career, to do something so stupid? <br /> <br /> The film begins with a good series to close the windows as we watch a group of radicals who discuss the meaning of the revolution. Suddenly a man (Mark) gets up and leaves. He hates tight and orderly character of the revolution. He admits that while the revolutionaries are fighting for freedom to associate itself with the militant cause, to effectively give away your freedom. And so, like Jack Nicholson in «The Passenger», Mark just wants to be free. <br /> <br /> So, Mark buys a gun and goes solo. He takes orders from anyone. When the police raided his campus Marcus shoots a guy and runs away. He then runs to the nearby airfield, steals a small private plane and fly into the wilderness. Antonioni sees the desert as a peaceful utopia, and contrasts it with ruthless capitalist cities, including shields and hollow modern appliances. He sees the desert as a kind of Garden of Eden. <br /> <br /> In the wilderness, Mark meets and quickly falls in love with Daria. Antonioni then gives us a funny sex scene in which hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand. Free from the constraints of modern life, the timber Huggers and student radicals can celebrate your individualism to impact the sun. <br /> <br /> The film ends with Mark and Daria dies fantasize about bloated mansions and stately homes of the rich capitalists who killed him. It is a challenge Antonioni its audience. Take the gun, pickets and explosives, he said. Tear down the walls before they cage you in! <br /> <br /> Of course, the film did not have any impact on his audience. They acknowledged, "Zabriskie Point" as just another himself in the center of commercial attempts to be radical. A sort of commodified radicalism. He felt like a liar and a manual. <br /> <br /> Thematically the film is quite silly. Antonioni basically says that if you are unhappy with the modern world, and fat cats who exploit you, you either have to flee into the wilderness (Mark) or actively fight the system (Daria). It's all good. But while artists constantly warn us about such gloomy nightmares, they mostly fail to show us how to effectively manage the change. As at the end of "Fight Club", nihilism and violence will not achieve anything. In the real world, social changes are usually triggered by modest inventor, driven forward minor technological advances. I mean that liberated women more than contraceptives <br /> <br /> 3/10 - very bad film. The problem, Antonioni does not believe in the uprising. He is quiet and contemplative man. Introvert, who seems to have made an extrovert film simply gather more love from the counterculture that has engulfed it earlier film «Blow Up». Thus, «Zabrinskie Point» comes across as a very pretentious and silly movie. It is in fact a 50-year-old man said, "Look at me, I'm a daring rebel!» <br /> <br /> There are a lot of films in which the audience is encouraged to fight the "system", but they all fall into one of four categories. In the first category, you have films such as "Network," "Cool Hand Luke," "Cuckoo's Nest" and "Spartacus." They all show that the life of fighters for the freedom of all end in failure, although in each case the "revolutionary spirit" survives. A message that you can not bring about change, but to die or fail, optimistic about changing survives through martyrdom. In fact, we have to keep to fail and not lose hope. <br /> <br /> Then you have movies like "Fight Club", "Zabriskie Point" and «Falling Down», which simply urge you to explode. Tear it all down. Blow it all. All this is a lie, so you might as well go out guns blazing. These films brought out the angry, reactionary feelings, rather than any sense. <br /> <br /> Then you have "flight, not fight" category. Terrence Malick and Antonioni are masters of this genre. Films such as "The Passenger," "Red Desert" and "Badlands" shows people walking on the worlds they do not like and forge peaceful island or storage for yourself. Both directors pessimists that Malik has destroyed their island and Antonioni have their island without offering any sense of happiness or solutions. <br /> <br /> Then you have the fourth category. Films like Donnersmarck in the "other life," Ashby «Bound For Glory» and Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange", refers to the artists as a force of change and rebellion. In these worlds, gloomy, in which everyone is content to be a slave state, a wild creativity and freedom of the will of the artist / criminal who keep the system in check. Just outside the existing flock, you create waves. Your comments, actions and critical view, the status quo of the problem. Thus, the film Donnersmarck is a novelist and painter, undermining Nazi Germany, while Kubrick Alex artist / criminal combat fascist droogs, painting the city in blood and semen.
