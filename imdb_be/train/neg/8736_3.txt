The film was a good concept, but the execution just did not live up to it. <br /> <br /> What is the concept? Well, story-wise, it's "Dirty Harry" meets "M". Child killer began to terrorize the city. Lead detective (Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forrest) never had to deal with a serial killer before. The mayor and the police chief, in desperation, secretly hired a local crowd accelerate ... to go places and do things that the police would not be able to put an end to this mess as quickly as possible. <br /> <br /> in order to be fair, this film really does have some good things to offer. <br /> <br /> In addition, the concept, I liked the look of the killer's lair. Norman Bates has a basement. This guy has a terrible drain. In some of the pictures, the light reflected from the water and creating ripples displayed on the walls; often giving these scenes horrible, dreamlike quality. <br /> <br /> The action was good. Dennis Hopper is one of those actors who gets better with age. <br /> <br /> Once you get past that, however, is more or less goes down. <br /> <br /> The film is too fast. The very process of investigation of both teams feel very rushed, unlike the sense of a complex and fascinating. This could be remedied in two ways: either to make the film more or cut some of the many storylines. Any one of them would allow the crew to spend more time on the actual secrets. <br /> <br /> As an example of how bad it is, one of the most important keys, which helps them to focus only on the right of the suspect is: at some point in his life, the suspect went to the pet store ... that's it .. . I'm being totally serious here. This is how they went from point A (the first key) to point Z (a suspect) and missed all the "in-between" steps. <br /> <br /> Then there are the characters. Only the ones I really liked the two pick-pocket you meet about halfway through the movie. Given that they are secondary characters, I would call it a bad sign. <br /> <br /> And finally, is the angle of the crowd. It's the one that gets me the most because that's why I coughed up $ 3 to buy a DVD in the first place. I mean that the hook! There was an absolute excess of serial killers clicks over the last 10-15 years. The angle of the mob was a trick that could help it rise above the rest ... but it is not. <br /> <br /> I realized gangster methods would be tough, but fun and exciting at the same time; kind of like a vigilante movie or something ... maybe they even throw in some elements Robbery movie too. We're talking about criminals, after all. Instead, we have given some of the nastiest characters committed to celluloid. Investigators examine witnesses. What mobile do? They interrogate and kill them. It's not even really like these witnesses even that bad. I actually found that criminals are less pleasant than the killer, they hunt. <br /> <br /> If the good moments I have not spoken enough to get your interest, I'd say give it a miss. Maybe, someday, they will re-use the same plot idea and do it right. I hope. I hate to see such a good concept to disappear.
