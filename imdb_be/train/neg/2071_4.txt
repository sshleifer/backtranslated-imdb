I had two reasons for this view Daredevil when he was shown on Danish television last night. First of all, I would like to see Gina Lollobrigida - and then I was not disappointed. She looked great. Secondly, through the reading of the film I got the impression that it featured an absurd humor is not unlike what is found in Philippe de Broca's films. On this account, however, I was sadly disappointed. I found the jokes predictable (except for a few witty remarks about the war) and the one-dimensional character entirely. In addition, the action scenes were done in a strange mechanical and uninspired fashion, without a sense of drama in general. I continued to look not to the end, but I got bored very quickly and just sat there, waiting for scenes Lollobrigida.
