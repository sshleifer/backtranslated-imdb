Tell the truth, I am a bit numb to see all the positive response so many people, which is also the main reason why I actually decided to watch this movie. And after I saw it, I was really disappointed, and this comes from a guy who loves this genre of film <br /> <br /> I have a surprise in this movie all full. - it's like a movie with nudity kid for absolutely no reason, and it's all to attract small children, cursing and swearing. I'm not quite righteous, but it really has gone too far in my account <br /> <br /> A brief description :. A tale of two guys got a great program to send his brother reckless behavior. There they met up with one of the children of boobs possession, and the other medieval freak. <br /> <br /> Just the name itself is not actually related to the history in general. They do not have a role model or do anything other than serve their time on what they have done. The story is very predictable (though expected), and the humor is lame. And do not we have seen the same character (played by Mc Lovin ') and many other films (eg, Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh three times and almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> Well, cast well after all he is the one that produces the script. And the acting is so-so, as expected, when you look at this type of film. And the direction that the wait? This is the same guy who brought us Hot American Summer and this film sucks too. But somehow he always managed to bring in a star to get his terrible film. <br /> <br /> In any case, I felt not a complete riff off, but in a completely waste of time. Just nude scenes, it seems, the best part of the film. I can not see any point why I should recommend to anyone <br /> <br /> Pros :. Elizabeth Banks? Two half-naked scenes <br /> <br /> Cons :. Not funny, terrible story, nudity and children do not mix together <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.5. / 10 (Evaluation: F)
