In my eyes, this is an almost perfect example of a Hollywood ego, only beaten by the new King Kong film. Superman Original Super Hero and deserves to be treated with respect, even when he wears tights. Brandon Routh Superman was the worst I have ever seen, from the very beginning of the movie you want to just shove a piece of kryptonite throat. He looks ridiculous wearing a suit. But enough about him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choice for Lois Lane, it should be a tough ass reporter, but in this film it looks like a schoolgirl. The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, it really supermans son who would never have thought ....) and the effect was terrible. This film has one good thing going for it, and the name of Kevin Spacey. His portrayal of Lex Luthor was brilliant, but even he could not save this film. What do I need this film was cast of "Lois & Clark" (with the exception of Kevin Spacey, of course), and another story. I watched this movie after watching "The Hills Have Eyes," and I was chocked to see that there existed the worst films of the time.
