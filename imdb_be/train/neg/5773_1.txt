Another effort FINE most underrated filmmaker America. His knowledge on the subject of racism overwhelms and delights me more than at the same level. Charges that Lee really just an insidious little racist poison dwarf who opportunistic use of affirmative action in Hollywood to make films of low quality utter nonsense, just right-wing propaganda. The very notion that Lee will seek to abuse the present climate of political correctness in America to produce hate filled anti-white movies simply false and malicious. <br /> <br /> Some detractors Lee even go so far as to suggest that GOTB celebrates African-Americans, while postponing other races :. obviously still lies spread by people who are opposed to peaceful coexistence among different races in America and elsewhere <br /> <br /> My favorite scene in the film is a long dialogue at an early stage between the rich black republic and the other on the bus . The views presented in this man is simply wrong - across the board. 100% untrue. He grabs education, in contrast to the brilliantly knowledgeable guys who deservedly throw him out of the bus. <br /> <br /> fantastic performance and an intelligent script to make the viewing experience, which was a rare rivaled by any political films made since then. <br /> <br /> I would also like to note ongoing LIE that millions in March was only 80 thousand people take part in it! <br /> <br /> (Now all you have to do is take all the antonyms of words written in big letters ...) <br /> <br /> So what message do I send here? If someone does not agree with your political views, you simply use violence and throw him out of the bus. I thought the film said, "in the bus» ... <br /> <br /> Perhaps, Mr.Lee segregation tires eventually, that is, no different from those crazy KKK in front of him: the bus only those blacks who, in accordance with the line of thinking of the Democratic party. So much for "the liberation of slaves» ... <br /> <br /> In the end credits: "This film has been fully funded by black people" and distributed and sold in major Hollywood studio run by Jews and whites who despise Farrakhan .. .
