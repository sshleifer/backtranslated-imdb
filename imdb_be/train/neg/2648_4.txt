I just finished reading a book about the work of Anita Loos and photo in TCM Magazine Macdonald in his angel costume looked great (impressive wings), so I thought I would watch this movie. I had never heard of the movie before, so I had no preconceived notions about it at all. I thought he had gone with a nice started with Eddie as a playboy and McDonald as secretary, he does not know exists. The scene where she appears in the costume party in her an angel costume with wings and a halo of non-constructive, that will not be a truly obeys. I even film if Eddy falls asleep and presents it as a real angel. But after a while it just started to fall apart for me. Eddy remains "asleep" to the rest of the film, so it's all a dream. Whatever happens there it does not really matter, because he's just sleeping. The rest of the story was less and meaningless to a large extent. I had to force myself to stick. And the last number where McDonald comes from a musical to a number of musical numbers in some mad hallucination was just crazy. <br /> <br /> If Eddy Â«wake up" and the earlier and original story continued, or if he really married to an angel, I think it would be much more interesting. I would like to see more of her real character. <br /> <br /> There was not enough accurate musical numbers to call it a musical. The first few songs were good, but zhitterbag amount that MacDonald preform was like nails on a chalkboard. It is absolutely wrong operatic voice. Nevertheless, of Eddy and MacDonald still manage to shine, showing that the real stars they were.
