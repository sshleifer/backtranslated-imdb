this film looks like Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it's also much more visible than the two, and not as good as either.it also slow and rather predictable.it also got shades of Deliverance and The Amityville Horror.plus, we get a new age flavor thrown in the mix, and some of these scenes come off as a motivational / inspirational sermon.really, this film is a hodgepodge almost everything.even, although it is a mountain, make-up effects are not very realistic. in fact, they look kind of cheap.aside from all that, there are some really horrible clich√©d dialogue.and I will not say when, but there is a point where several actions of the character they were not real or plausible, given the circumstances. No one in their right mind that would have acted this way.once you watch a movie, you will know that I mean.there some gratuitous nudity for nudity sake.it was simply no need for all.The good news is that the effect of it was actually quite good.better, than this film deserves s.so, after carefully weighing the evidence, id say this movie was passable, but not good.my sentence for the Tooth fairy: 4/10
