This is the worst damage to the brain, ultra-cheap, super stupid, stupid, pointless stuff I've ever seen, incredibly rubbish instant cult status among fans of bizarre. If you think that "Plan 9" Ed Wood's bad, well ... let me tell you, it looks like "Citizen Kane" in comparison with that. ¿Special effects? ... again, "Plan 9" is a "Star Wars". ¿Responsibilities? ... Thor Johnson Al Pacino ... so poorly, in fact. But if you are looking for something incredible movies, this is for you! I'm a fan of American International are so many famous horror movies, sagas Price Corman-Poe and some of the great things blaxploitation, but «Creatures stars" they descend straight down to the level Z. Of course, is one of the 10 works in the opposite direction when the you want to watch bad movies to meet (the guy plays great Indian leader), so have fun and enjoy ... if you can.
