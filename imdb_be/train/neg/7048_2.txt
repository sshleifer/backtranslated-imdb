I chose this film on the cover of which was a bad move. It was not funny, but the main characters were unpleasant. She was beautiful, but the story and the actions were terrible. He had absolutely nothing to do with surfing. Scary movie with surf "theme", which had nothing to do with real surfing and surfers. Catherine Zeta-Jones was beautiful, and the film is likely to see a revival only becuase it is in the spotlight now, being married to Gordon Gekko, and all, but if you have not seen it, do not waste your time. Bad film with great surfing, surfers and REAL strange, beautiful cinematography was in God's hands.
