This film was ridiculously bad. A friend rented it from Netflix and forced to watch me. There are so many flaws and inconsistencies that it is impossible to even bother getting to know the character and the story. How about them, such as ... <br /> <br /> Â«Vermont Airport" in the palm trees surrounded by <br /> <br miraculously appear shirts /> Ben during a telephone conversation <br /> <br /> luxury priest's office ... complete with a folding table card table <br /> <br /> There is a decent story is hidden in a very bad movie. But even if you look past the technical flaws, you will find abhorrent actions and casting. Most of all I was tickled to cast great actors to play gay-rights religious fanatic brother. Its opening scene, sitting in his immaculate apartment, stroking the cat Kitty, was fun. <br /> <br /> I applaud the writer / director / producer / editor / star / provisions / cast dentist / composer (and everything else that he has done on this course) will actually get the film as it is distributed. If you do not have anything better, it can be a fun group of film or even the basis for a drinking game, but do not rent it out for a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriage.
