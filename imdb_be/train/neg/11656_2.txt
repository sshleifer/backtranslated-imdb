Scary Movie 2 was a serious disappointment. Just links to movies like Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to a comedy. The film begins well enough with funny white people shaking scenes and a great use of James Woods Ands Andy Richter. sinkers film there, unfortunately. Act badly. Tori Spelling looks and acts completely inappropriate. The film looks hacked together and surprisingly slow pace. Some of the longer pinned in the snail pace of the film, with the participation of the joints and the previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie, funny werent anyone in my theater. The film, fortunately, comes screeching to a halt after 83 minutes a shockingly unfunny ending. (I say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to do away with humor), I do not know what else to say, except that it is messy rush continued done to make Miramax more than cash on the backs of stupid teenagers. In general, very poorly done movie.
