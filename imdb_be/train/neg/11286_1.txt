Where do you start with a movie as bad as this? <br /> <br /> As you mention throwing unsympathetic characters? Over-the-top action? Scary scenario? <br /> <br /> No. You just said that the one who pays money to see the film, as the poor, since it is necessary to head to watch. I know what to do. I respect the poor man, who saw it with little or no prior word from magazines like Empire (usually a bad sign if the previous instance was not available for quality cinema magazines). However, cinema really have to start thinking about the issue of circulation, if the client is not satisfied with the finished product. <br /> <br /> I went through three days after he was discovered with two other friends. The only person in the cinema was one guy on his own. <br /> <br /> And it's a cheap night. <br /> <br /> In any advertising campaign it was bankrupt or word has spread through most of the country's only that it's a bitch. <br /> <br /> Not since the days of The Avengers (1998) I feel so short changed with movie viewing. If the Assistant comes round with the video for several months, make sure that it pays energy bills while watching it <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald deserves a reward for Sun crack up - or walk off the set. Keith Allen retains some dignity on a background of cinematic carnage; Barry Foster was to be arrested on the set for its implementation, Rhys Ifans does not contribute to his career after the success of Notting Hill and only Dani Behr is halfway cute as a busty secretary. <br /> <br /> It should be noted, considering it used to be in the Word, all the expectations of its viewers acting skills had to be pretty low to begin with. <br /> <br /> production values ​​is not bad, considering the obviously limited budget, but this script is atrocious, If you want to hear a bunch of unsympathetic characters say, "Fuck!" in a few hours, this should be right up your streets. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bargepoles required. <br /> <br />
