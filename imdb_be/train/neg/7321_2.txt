Maybe not my genre, but the story was awful, how to act, Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino. S. Thomas also seemed uncomfortable in the role of seduction here (while on marijuana? Why should it be included? This is much weakened portion). Also CHARAC Farentino in. it would be better if it was more respect for the relationship. Will the film is trying to say? not much.
