First of all, this film is not a "thriller". Neither is the "capture, in a tensioned state." It could have been so on the basis of the script, but the slow pace of the direction of making it difficult to get into. <br /> <br /> The story itself is very interesting and witty. Unfortunately, we only get a sense of * how * brilliant after painting is completed. This leaves us with more than two hours long sequences with music playing over them interspersed with some scenes that do not capture the audience, and "cunning fox" scene, injecting a little more open mind. <br /> <br /> I want it to be a fast-paced thriller box promised. That would be an outstanding movie. Instead, Spike Lee did it last until the end.
