click incision come few and far between now days, so when I heard about the Cut, I had high expectations and had heard good things about it. Those good things that I heard were wrong..very wrong! This film is bad, and I mean BAD. This is just silly. Everything about this. Especially the origin of the killer, and he is alive and he takes care of in the end. There's nothing original or outstanding about this movie. Just another copycat slasher with the "Hip", "self-consciousness". "The film is grounded" characters. I'm so tired of this shit. Somebody something different reason slash genre needs new blood, literally.
