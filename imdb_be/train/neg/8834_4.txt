there is some truth in this film. I remember a story told 15 to 20 years ago 4 fisherman found the body in the water, and they decided not to report it, as long as their trip was not finished. I also remember they were accused of interfering with a corpse (or some such charge). I'm not sure if it was in Australia. Viewers outside Australia must think that we live in a country full of rapists and serial killers. Wolf Creek, and this film will encourage this perception. The film reminded me of a simple plan. But how far it was one of the best Australian films ever, someone claimed that I can not be so generous. Let's just say, I would not bother to watch it again.
