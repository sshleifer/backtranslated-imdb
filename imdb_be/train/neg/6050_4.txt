I just can not believe the amount of people compared it favorably with the first film. This prompted me to leave this comment! It's just obvious attempt to available-on the success of the first film. Dialogue is appalling and nothing like as real or compelling as the original film. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, ludicrous French police image and characteristic Doyle a mile from the first film. <, Br /> <br /> How do you think the drug bosses to go to the docks to see the person enter the shipment? The ease with which Doyle finds his guy is just deplorable. Like all French police were just drinking coffee while Doyle does not appear from America and do some real police work. Which is a joke. Try to go to an unfamiliar city and the excavations of the largest CRIMS in place with a travel card and some travel brochures. Helpless. <br /> <br /> A truly awful sequel who thinks otherwise is crazy.
