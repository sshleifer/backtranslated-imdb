I made this film with overhear fuss about it was put up for an Oscar, but after viewing, it's easy to understand why it is not. In spite of the beautiful pictures, the film moves incredibly slow, even though hardly any plot. <br /> <br /> The story about a young boy trying to get used to the death of their parents that may or may not have been an accident (the film is never clear on this point), and his grandfather told him stories. Magical stories contain only bits of interest in the story, but they are very short, and in fact does not seem to have any point. <br /> <br /> The first tale, in particular, the problems, the boy tries to get the magic flower of a dying girl to save his life, but the boy tasting delay the first flowers to make sure that it is not toxic, resulting in his time a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend - the grandfather say that the morality that the boy was too impatient, but it does not make any sense, because it was overcaution and slow, which led to his failure. Perfect metaphor for this film for sure. <br /> <br /> Photographing Skye great though, but then the Stardust, which was released this year, another movie about fairy tales, taken in Skye and beautifully photographed - and it's much better than this.
