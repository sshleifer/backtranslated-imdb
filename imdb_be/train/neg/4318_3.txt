I thought it was one of the most depressing holiday movies I have ever seen - which is the other's wife and Christmas JACK FROST. All three films about death. If you like to be completely suppressed, then by all means watch this movie or any of the others. In this film, the acting is good, and some of the scenery (except when people die) fine. But I am afraid that a clinically depressed person might accidentally see the film and make yourself! Despite the "happily after" the end of the main part of the film is a terrible disaster follows another. And for some insane reason, I do not want to miss when I'm watching a Christmas movie (I know it sounds crazy people - after all, the sun bawling your eyes out and feeling miserable that everything about any holidays?) . <br /> <br /> For more inspiring viewing experience, try the forgotten house without a Christmas tree, George C. Scott Christmas or the Christmas story, and there is no - unless you like being miserable.
