One scene shows the mentality of "Terminator woman" very well: Karen Sheperd and another woman tries to escape from the villain camp. Karen stumbles armed guard, which shows the gun at her, but leaves her and challenges her to a fight after a few seconds. Karen kicks him in the balls, raises the gun and runs away! Again, if the film producer and martial artist wrote / made to other members of your family, you know that you should not expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble funny banter really get going at an early stage, and the film could get better if it focused more on their love-hate relationship. But after about 20 minutes they share, and the film slows down and sometimes even with the battle scenes to liven things up, it lacks excitement. The final was struggling Trimble Qissi inside the cave and Shepherd going womano-and-womano against the beautiful Ashley Hayden on the boat, but fighting the sidebar so that disrupts their flow and reduces their costs. On the positive side, the prestige costume department to give Karen a chance to show a spectacular cleavage throughout the film! (* 1/2)
