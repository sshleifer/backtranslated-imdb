Save $ 8.97 you'll spend on Walmart, to buy the DVD and go see the real Steven Spielberg. <br /> <br /> I am a filmmaker, and being an avid fan of HG Wells, I had to buy it in hopes to sit and watch three hours good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to watch it, because I could not stand to watch more than 10 minutes at a time. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> There are reports that Timothy Hines had a budget of $ 20 million for this product. Where the hell was that? Whether he used most of them to buy a new home? To fund his retirement? What is it? Let me start with what is really good about this movie. He is to stay true to the book and have a few good performances in it. I can respect the actors, who obviously tried to make it a good movie. But the good performances were quickly overshadowed by the terrible ... and I mean terrible effects. Any student school freshman film could have done a much better job with CGI. For me, most of them looked like a "stop action" card board expressions that have been used instead of complicated software, CGI, that the project of $ 20 million should be used. <br /> <br /> There's no excuse for amateur post-production, which was in respect of the film. My own partner, and I sat down and rebuilt our Ferry stage version of the software that cost less than $ 1500.00 and during the day there were five minutes of scenes that look better and more realistic than the created Hines. I've seen movies with a budget of less than $ 2 million look better. Much better. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the special effects used in the original King Kong were more complex and better than special effects Hines' in this film. In fact, I have a much higher Score Attack killer tomatoes because of this film. There is no excuse with modern technology for the film to look like a 50-B-Movie, if it was not the intention that there should be with this particular project. <br /> <br /> The problem that I had with the DVD transfer was the fact that the film jerks, another demonstration of amateur cinema. <br /> <br /> Overall, I must say that I did a project in the amount of $ 45,000 in 2003, which have the best cinematography and special effects, than this film. <, Br /> <br /> I highly recommend to anyone who appreciates a good shooting or who is a supporter of WOTW leave the film on the shelf and watch Attack of the 50 foot woman instead. It would be easier on the eyes.
