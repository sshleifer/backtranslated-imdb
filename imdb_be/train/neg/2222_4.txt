Karl once Verdon managed to combine excellent comedy with clever and subtle social analysis and criticism. <br /> <br /> Then something happened, and it turned into another stupid "Hypocrites you" director. <br /> <br /> Il Mio Miglior Nemico can more or less be summarized in a single line "type = working class and heat, while the upper class = snoot and insidious. but love wins in the end. " <br /> <br /> This beaten clich√© for such a clever director. <br /> <br /> There is not really too much to say in the film. Each character is a walking stereotype homemade person who forgets his roots, but who is going to become "good" again, despised wife, a rebellious rich girl who falls in love with an honest-but the poor guy ... Acting is just average. <br /> <br /> bitter disappointment at every aspect.
