Very stupid movie, filled with blunt liners and Jewish links through out. It was a serious movie, but can not be taken lightly. The familiar story of the movie ... Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The brutal scene, with Basinger. Very robotic and too regulated. I noticed that Al Pacinos acting ability seems to go down. From troubleshooting problems, but nothing is more disturbing than Pacinos terrible Atlantean accent. Damage control is necessary to correct this damage film. OK liners have bad but not as bad as those in this film. The film manages to not only boring, but disgusting as well. Usually disgusting film watchable for the wrong reasons. This film unwatchable. I managed to sit through it. The plot, if it is written a little better, with perhaps a little better to act and eliminating the terrible story, and even dumber jokes, could have pulled this thriller with depression. The fact that we were in a deaf, dumb movie that did that it was drilled into our heads that Eli Wurman was a Jew. The difficulty for all the good Jewish folk worldwide.
