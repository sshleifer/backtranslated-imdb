Hey Arnold! slower pace and a bit sad movie. The plot is not very creative. The character of Paul Sorvino (Schenk) buys all the old, low-cost houses in order to build a giant shopping center, shopping mall and office buildings. This story goes back to the 1960s many films of children. It's sad. Paul Sorvino is not very interesting, too, so the idea of ​​him as the bad guy is not so scary. Gramps remembers something about a historic document, and the rest of the film is about the last 36 hours, when Arnold and Jamal have to find the document with the secret help by Helga, whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to the Mall Schenk. Children need to move around the city by bus, and so exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only foolish, but highlights how the film was written for very young children. Hey Arnold, a TV cartoon, as a rule, very interesting, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. TV cartoon, as a rule, faster paced and more creative than this film. Hey Arnold movie is about five times more sedation, and a good way to put anyone, including the kids to bed. Hey Arnold was hard not to sleep all the way to a predictable and very sad end. If you want to send their children completely non-offensive film, this is it. I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute film, the producers started to script 30 minutes cartoon TV and tried to turn it on 90 minutes. This story Mall defined could be covered in a television cartoon. He hopes Arnold put the best writer, if there is ever a sequel.
