I refused to look at it when it was originally aired, stores the memory of the late, lamented series in 1960 with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I can never resist a challenge. I should have known better. Not really Remek, but rather a parody than a tribute, this show did not know how to play, and came down with a children's comedy and animated scenes and characters. Three main character was a little more than caricatures of actors, and only Emilia Fox can act (Bob Mortimer painful in direct role). The supporting cast was just a comic friend Vic and Bob wants to be part of the in-jokes, and too aware of the situation, to be convincing. And the CGI, although the effect could not be improved on those available 30 years ago, just dazzled the audience with lighting and camera work, and did little to mask the poor quality of scripts and dialogue. All style and no substance. (And while the show 1960s mocked for being a very large part of its time, this "update" is now also very dated, with "modes Matrix 'style, be sure to" girl power "of the scene, and less subtle tension between the two live lead).
