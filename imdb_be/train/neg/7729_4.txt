Excellent TV mini-series completely destroyed the 45-year-old woman desperately tries to pass itself for 16-year-old ingenue! Without exaggeration - this is not the most current age of the character played by Ali McGraw, when the film begins shortly before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. This TV mini-series really is the classic example of the title of this post, and one I am every time the topic comes up. <br /> <br /> This in itself makes it quite unwatchable, despite the fact that it is one of the best shot of the Second World War "global" TV drama ever created. If you have the stomach - a decent ability to fast forward - you might be able to enjoy the late Robert Mitchum in a very strong performance. <br /> <br /> I'm stunned at some of the comments relating to the history of love (pun intended). Or they watch a movie with your eyes closed? Or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their "selective memories" and "selective vision". I am a Boomer myself, so do not think for a second I was some arrogant young punk. 45. 45 always looks to get used to it. Deal with it. Age gracefully Damnit. <br /> <br /> The Winds of War might be ... so good. How else are we going to talk about this mini-series today, some 25 years later, I had ACTUAL ingenue was cast in such an important and critical role? Now, with a haggard old Biddy constant distraction that alone cancels the most outstanding aspects of the winds of war.
