A film about the Harlem Renaissance and one writer in particular. He contrasts it with a modern story about a young, gay black artist. <br /> <br /> If this sounds vague, it's because the film itself. This label is well written and (mostly) well-acted. In addition to the scene in the last shot in whimsical black and white. In addition, it is one of the few films dealing with gay, that does not shy away from sex scenes (not that obvious and frontal). Nevertheless, I mostly hated it. <br /> <br /> The film meanders all over the place, full of unpleasant characters (including the protagonist) and (a murderer) is moving at a snails pace. Three times I decided to leave the theater, because I was so utterly boring. But the director was there, so I stayed. <br /> <br /> His talk epilogue reveals that it was a labor of love and it took 6 years to complete. I really wanted to like it more (there are very few dedicated honest with funny black film), but I can not. If you are not very interested in the Harlem Renaissance, there is no reason to see it.
