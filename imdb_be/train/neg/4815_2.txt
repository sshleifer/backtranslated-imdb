As with most of the comments I've seen this movie called The witching, which is the name of the reissue. Apparently necromancer that the original is better, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Most of the scenes of sorcery still include most necromancers scene and it's still bad. In many ways, I think that added nudity in witchcraft at least added some entertainment value! But do not be fooled -There's only 3 scenes with nudity and people standing around diversity. Many Diabolique ramp PUMPY participate! <br /> <br /> This film is not so inherently is terribly difficult to understand that to criticize the first. Dialogue and terrible right from the box three. At least, Troma is tongue in cheek, though. It is right face longing personified. Acting with Pamela Franklin variable (Flora obsessed child in innocence you believe it!) The worst of her shrill squeaky voice. Wells seems to be just waiting for his check. Another woman lead a horrible person, so I do not know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the movie! And the doctor is very bad too. He also looks worringly Gene Wilder. <br /> <br /> He clumsily removed from the scene change for no reason and editing choppy. This is because witchcraft is the task of copying and pasting, and not thin this. Only the lighting right. The sound is also terrible, and it's hard to hear the terrible new soundtrack, which is never silent. "Ghost" is also equally bad mother, but the actress is so funny is bad, that at least it gives some desirable laughter. <br /> <br /> Really this movie (The witching at least) only for the unwary. He may not have a lot of savvy supporters, as it is quite unwatchable, and I really was mind numbingly sad! <br /> <br /> The best bit was when credits - enough said so simply better than this poor excuse for a film like the plague!
