Oh, it was a really bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer okay, but I think that it is acting bitchy through the movie, and not because she has her organs taken out on a black night, but because she was thinking about shooting her agent for its delivery in this piece of shit, Faye Dunaway acts as it remodels mother Dearest and ending entirely stupid. I really can not recommend this film at all, at least as a supporter of Edgar Allen Poe, I was intrigued by the little references to his work (Ravens, House Usher, as the family curse, and being buried alive) -still he probably roll over in his grave if he knew about this movie.
