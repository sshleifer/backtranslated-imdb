I do not give out "one" often, but if ever there was a film that deserves that kind of attention is the "Gas!" This self-indulgent crap that reaches the atmosphere in some M * A * S * H ​​and falls entirely flat on his face in an attempt to <br /> <br /> I understand that Corman was going for -. Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliot Gould tried to play the role of an immortal Gould in the original version of the film M * A * S * H ​​with a similar plot (in "tightening" - watch it here in IMDb, http://www.imdb.com / title / tt0073891 / for more information). <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould became closer to the brass ring with a "puff" than Corman made with the "gas" but not there. None of those films did not even come close to the success of M * A * S * H. <br /> <br /> What happened to the "Gas!"? What is not? No one comes close to actually operates at a level above junior high school theatrics. production values ​​stink. Someone here mentioned magically regenerate lights getaway car, and there are more of this lack of attention to detail. Nothing works as provided for in this film, and no one cares. <br /> <br /> «Gas!" really put me to sleep. It is not certain that a cure for insomnia, but very close. On a scale of Cinematic Sleep Induction, "Gas!" Falls somewhere between "Last Year at Marienbad" and the remake of George Clooney with "Solaris" (which in itself was a lovely to be more boring than the original Mosfilm, despite the imaginary ignorance of this studio with the idea of ​​preserving the audience's attention at a reasonable editing). <, Br /> <br /> Intelligent editing would be decimated, "Gas!" About twenty minutes. As a result, it would be pointless, but no longer than the original film. <br /> <br /> Some of the films are not so bad that they have convincing quality that makes them worth watching anyway. This is not one of them. Do not waste your time. It's not even funny bad.
