We gave at the point where the character of George Clooney learned his fingernails. We do not hesitate - we just knew after sitting through an hour of this nonsense, what it is. To say that this film was incomprehensible, sad, pretentious chatter is too praise it! How do people manage to sit through this confusion, slow, depressing poser corner of the film, not to mention his nomination for an Oscar? Clooney look quite as bad as we felt, watching him. What is he thinking? Oh .. and it was with these subtitles? - we just have a dud or DVD was the original film made like that - suggestions left hanging in the air? The film was quite difficult to follow without it as well. I'm sorry to throw, which, obviously, has done everything possible with the available materials.
