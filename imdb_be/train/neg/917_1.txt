This film was made in very bad taste. The script was very bad. I feel very sad the late Gregory Peck, who took on the main role of the B-movie adaptation of one of the greatest generals in history. The film was politically incorrect and completely insensitive to others, who fought against the Japanese during World War 2. There was a scene where I almost threw up, he showed MacArthur in a bunker on Corregidor island talking to troops, as an experienced politician, if he comes injured, one leg of Filipino soldiers. Bleeding and dying soldiers manage to sit up straight, seeing a general and says no dad or mom, or Uncle Sam "and MacArthur gives his little pep talk that amerykantsy` would never abandon" the Philippines. The scene ends with future soldier inspired words of MacArthur and gives him a reasonable salute. I mean, if there was more forgiving scene drawing on the United States as a great white savior of the world, please tell me, because that one takes the cake. He showed that Filipinos girl is in trouble, is not able to honor and must rely on more Americans exclusively for ransom. This is obviously and intentionally marred by contribution of members USAFFE (United States forces in the Far East), the Filipino volunteers who have been integrated into the US Army during World War 2, who died side by Boca with Americans fighting with the Japanese, who were walking side by side Americans in the death march of Bataan and Corregidor island defended by launching a guerrilla offensive after MacArthur left for Australia with his famous' I'll be back "speech. My late grandfather, a veteran Filipino World War 2 and USAFFE soldier was one of many who fought the Japanese with pride and love for his native country. I think that this film does not honor them and thousands of others that MacArthur relied on intelligence preparation for his famous return to Leyte Gulf landing.
