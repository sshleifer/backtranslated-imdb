I wanted to like this movie, but saw it, blah blah blah robbery, but I love these movies. If done well it had all the ingredients to be a good, brilliant sun, but a good movie .... unfortunately, these ingredients are gone! The acting was terrible, and it was first observed when prisoners are put to the kidnappers alone (hood removed), observation and liners simply awful, yes, I know, bad written form .... but it's more than that, it was bad writing, combined with bad acting. Two of the prisoners were in a relationship with each other and do not even recognize it until much later in the film ..... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Im even wondering why I tried to review the film at all. <br /> <br /> I will end with a land size NM, plot holes & MORE Plot holes! Disappointment!
