"Sleepwalkers" is the first film that Stephen King wrote the script. Given this, and the great Santo & Johnny's song, which they used as the theme of the movie, you would expect the odd, and ultimately fulfilling viewing experience. Unfortunately, this is not what you will get. The fact that they could have probably made a good movie. Start intriguing that with its small town atmosphere of a ghost. But something strange is going on for about 20 minutes in the film. The film turns funny for no apparent reason! From that moment the whole atmosphere "Sleepwalkers" is ruined.For those of you who saw it, who can never forget the good old Johnnie shouting "KS Kabob !!" after jabbed a pencil into his ear that a policeman? ? But do not misunderstand me, the humor has no quality redeemiing. I just rented it again to see if mabye I was wrong the first time around, considering how the original story sounds, but I was right. Man, that waste. I can not believe that they were entitled to the Santo and Johnny song. I gave it 2.
