I found the film offensive to Americans who have lost someone in the towers, to the American people as a whole. Pretending to be a tribute to the terrible facts have occurred in recent years, each director has the opportunity to argue with the old facts (which do not have any in common with a terrorist attack), or criticize American political behavior, or to compare different political situation, as they have at their own country, without having anything to do it or share with crimes September 11 shame on them.
