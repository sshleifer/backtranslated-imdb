I thought that this movie was pretty lame. If you are looking for a cheesey, you may like it. I myself do not mind a fair amount of cheese, but it was funny. The progression of the film I'm bored, and the plot has been very weak. <br /> <br /> The only entertaining about this movie was the day-Glo zombie, but even that is not sufficient reason to see this film.
