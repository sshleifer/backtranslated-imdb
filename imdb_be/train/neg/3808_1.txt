WARNING! This review will show the end of the film «Scoop». If you do not want to know how the movie ends, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> «scoop" is so bad that you'll think, "Annie Hall" was a fluke. <br /> <br /> It gets one star because you get to see bare breasts Hugh Jackman. This is the only thing that "scoop" going for it. <br /> <br /> misogyny Woody Allen, and his fixation on the women young enough at the moment to be his granddaughter, undermined any possibility of making movies, he may have at any time <br /> <br /> the plot seems promising :. ghost, Ian McShane, directs fluffy Headed student, Scarlett Johansson, to investigate whether non-English lord, Hugh Jackman, the notorious Tarot Card Killer prostitutes. Magician, Woody Allen, help the girl. <br /> <br /> promising area, in spite of this, the film completely lacks charm or humor, or the atmosphere. It's amazing lead, amateur efforts, who made at least one previous film, let alone ten. Perhaps Allen had a stroke, disappeared unreported in the press. <br /> <br /> A lot of the fact that, unlike his previous films of Woody Allen, is now seventy years, finally allowed a smaller actor in get a girl. <br /> <br /> Not so. In fact, the story is constructed in such a way that the girl does not get one. <br /> <br /> There is an early scene where Johansson, without cause central to the film, allows himself to be drunk and seduced, powerful, senior director. "Temptation" is a euphemism for what is happening. This "critical, bang, I have to go" kind of moment. It has nothing to do with the story at all, and it cheapens Johansson in the viewer's eye. Why Allen added that the unnecessary scenes in the movie? Because it shows a powerful director - Allen - sex with a female role. Allen gets to have his cake and eat it too. <br /> <br /> Johansson until the actress. She does not know how to command except for the screen, wearing a tight, low cut top. It mimics Allen in a pair of scenes, and it looks strange and sad. <br /> <br /> It does not help that her character in the script, such as dolls, which can not function without a ghost or older and less impressive magician, telling her what to do at every step. <br /> <br /> it is about half the age Jackman, and it comes in the presence of very bland scenes screen them together. <, Br /> <br /> The audience is not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their characters, and Jackman deserves better, too. - scenario that gives the character some intelligence and the agency, and the actress who can convey these qualities <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman as to deceive the script. Allen, apparently, could not stand that Jackman is so stunningly beautiful and young, and therefore he does not give Jackman nothing to say or do. As Johansson, it is only used for its good appearance. It's a shame, because as Jackman demonstrated in any number of industries, from "Oklahoma" in «X-Men», he can act <br /> <br /> This is a great plot twist. - Jackman, suave, charming English Lord, is in fact the killer. Thus, although the movie says it's all about letting someone else besides Allen, get the girl, she does not get anyone. Jackman, a man she did love the man who killed a prostitute. Nice, Woody. A good way to punish your character, because beyond your reach. <br /> <br /> In a passive aggressive touch, Allen deprives him of the heroine of your own presence, as well as the killing of his character, a mage, leaving Scarlett Johansson all alone in the end of the film <br /> <br /> A final note: in my. screening, no member of the audience laughed at any time during the film. Always a good sign when the film is advertised as a comedy.
