I think Jason Lee has great potential, but it was the wrong vehicle in which to try to break out as a star. The plot is terrible, terrible comedy. I laughed twice, I think that in order to facilitate, because in retrospect, they were pretty lame jokes. I found that fear for the future of Fletch, and had to console himself with the fact that it was a film that was flawed, not Lee. <br /> <br /> Julia Stiles and Selma Blair's hot, but I recommend a look at more photos on this site, to understand it, instead of the film. Save your time. 1 star.
