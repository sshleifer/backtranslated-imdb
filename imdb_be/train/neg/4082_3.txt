This film was just painful to watch ... not in a good dramatic way that makes you cringe emotion to well-developed characters in dramatic situations (yes, I'm pretty much done that the last sentence as I walked), but just an absolute stupid way to for over two hours. Now you can all think I'm just some ignorant reviewer who has no respect for Shakespeare, or "art film" ... well, you'd be wrong on both counts. I love Shakespeare's works, especially the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet, and I watched a lot of "art house" films, such as the surreal and well done Eraserhead and Fellini's 8 1/2. .. but it was only two hours lost in his translation of Shakespeare, too much nudity (I can understand the artistic nudity in some scenes ... but not in any other shot the movie !!! pointless and served NOTHING for the article !! !), and basically just overdone filmmaking. I had high hopes for this film is that it has been said that "very artistic" and was an adaptation of Shakespeare's The Tempest ... But it was just extremely disappointing. I made this film, only three of the presence of the actor Sir John Gielgud (which far surpassed all non-names in this film), and movie / set design combination, as did a lot of the scenes look like a painting in motion ... however, many that this film would've been better as just a picture scroll text underneath. Quite a disappointment ... maybe if Zeffirelli was given to the director's chair, it would've been much better. But it is the opinion of one member of the audience, many others can enjoy it much more than me. That being said, if you can not find it in any nearby video store (it is not currently on DVD), do not try to go too far out of the way to find it ... it's really not worth it.
