Yes, I know that I voted 1 of 10, but in reality it does not deserve no more than a half stars. I hated it. It was so silly and unrealistic, I can not believe that any of the stars signed to do so ridiculously absurd project. <br /> <br /> James G. O'Hara and Cathrine were excellent in their characters and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate was just as good, but the story sucked, and I call on all who see it in the video stores to even do not bother to pick it up and read the back cover, and just walk away ... I do not even want to get into that movie about, because it's too stupid to broadcast on. <br /> <br /> not to rent it! This is terrible! Horrible!
