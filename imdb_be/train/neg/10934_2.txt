First of all, let me say that I'm LDS, or rather, I'm Mormon. So when I watched this movie, I automatically gave him the benefit of the doubt. I can usually find something redemptive I look in every film. And this one was no exception. He has his moments of life. But they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> One of the first things I noticed that bothered me very much was that it seemed, Halestorm shy of our Church! The LDS church, congregations are called "Trust" and the basketball court is in the "Cultural Hall". NEVER AGAIN one of these two names mentioned. The church is never called by name and "standards" as far as it goes in mentioning that he considers our church. <br /> <br /> It makes me wonder if the director really LDS or LDS Wannabes? This film had so much potential! This could really showed our Church in a positive light, and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer, but also what we believe. Instead, he was only mildly entertaining and leaves much to be desired. If I was not already the LDS, I was left to think Mormons are stupid, idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie, I will recommend to my friends nonLDS. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Halestorm. You can do better than that!
