Discovery Channel / Animal Planet should be ashamed of themselves. This fantasy modeled "Walk with Dinosuars» series. Despite the fact that it is 100% fantasy it is presented in the same factual and archaeological method. Even mixing fantasy dragon T-rexs and disappearance Dinos. In addition to the points to the educational channel, instead of say, Sci-Fi, which allows air factual accuracy in this show. <br /> <br /> By itself, the show about a 7.5 / 10 to the entertainment goes. But the way in which it is presented, I have to give it 1/10. Do not get me wrong, I have no problem with fantasy, but they put on it so wrong. I can see small children and adults slowly believing that they had found the dragon, and it's real. <br /> <br /> I also think that this weakens the big "Walk with Dinosuars» series, because now you have to see what crazy how much imagination in this mini-series.
