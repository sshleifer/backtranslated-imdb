Gritty, dusty western from director Richard Brooks, who seems to be completely immersed in the genre, while retaining all the usual cliches intact. In the early 1900s, the horse race attracts low key Cowboy (Gene Hackman), a suave gambler (James Coburn), boldly child (Jan Michael Vincent), and even women (surprisingly game Candice Bergen). After the preliminaries are out of the way (with predictable arguments over whether or not a woman to take part), it gets pretty exciting record, even one that does not break any new ground (instead resembles something from the era of Gary Cooper). Good view when overlong part has Mee inspiration and a great cast, but the plot arrangements to get tedious pretty quickly. ** from ****
