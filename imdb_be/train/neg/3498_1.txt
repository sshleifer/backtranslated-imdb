I just watched an episode of the program, and I could not even get to the end of the program. Every minute I watched this program should be discarded my I.Q about 10 points. This is mainly as a children's program, but with abuse. Not even a curse and insult, she says other people made me laugh. In any case, the story should have been written by a monkey and the people who actually put this script for this program through to shoot wort was held at gunpoint and there was no choice but to take this lapse, disappointment, awful program operated. Sarah Silvermann have to use a little bit of money, it is really out of this program and get a damn acting lessons.
