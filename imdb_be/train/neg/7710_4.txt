"The attack of the killer tomatoes" consists mainly of rambling, poorly assembled frames in search of the film. The plot does not make any sense, and different symbols to look out of the picture and with no explanation at all. Watching this stupid parody, you get the feeling than many other observations captured so accurately: it's easy to make a cheap, low-quality movie, and then use the "parody" angle as the basis for its low cost and low quality (in one scene, women swimmers are afraid of tomatoes floating next to them how far can the "suspension of disbelief" go - even in a parody) song title is great, though (* 1/2)..
