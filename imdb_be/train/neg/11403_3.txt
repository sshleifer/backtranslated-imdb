I love horror films, low budget, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s .. but how can anyone think that this is a very good horror film? let's compare his name in such vein- haunted house movies. achieve, changeling, radiance. or based on similar technology horror movie that was FAAAR better (though still far from great) Demon Seed. Well, I'm just .. let's compare it made-for-TV horror movies! do not go to bed .. waaay terrible and better to do. Many Salem, night stalker, the gallery at night, do not even go to the basement or Krauhevny farms were much better. * * SPOILERS especially for how good scene as a bloody shower scene was, you have a scene like the opening scene .. oh boy! garden hose to the hose revives some lively teenagers! SCARY. In addition, just what we understand about the house .. it is perhaps necessary to use your camcorder to see what was happening, and it's a very emotional home. not spirit or demon, or a legal person, the house will be "obsessed", but what? we are led to believe inanimate object learned to love Susie / Margit, our hero? Now that I'm on the topic .. Susie another scene that I was completely worried that this poor old crazy lady comes in, tells you that it was your nurse, pours her heart, falls into a boiling pool, struggling to flour for 45 seconds, and that Margaret do? Or she risks her hands burned, to save this poor old woman, who had come there to warn her life? No, it is worth a watch! which operates for the most part was better than average for a horror movie, but that's where the positives end. at least, more interesting and fun horror film about an inanimate object, which kills people look death bed: a bed that eats. I have a feeling the people who have rated it so highly, or did not look as it originally aired, or remembered it scaring their children. this film was largely merit less.
