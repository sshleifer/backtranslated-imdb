This Die Hard meets Cliffhanger when ski resort besieged by terrorists, and it is up to a police officer, Jack (CrackerJack), to stop it. <br /> <br /> The film, B-action, which borrows from other movies and pretty good with a very good action, funny story (as always in these films) and three great stars. Thomas Ian Griffith, as a police officer and Nastassja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you do not like stupid movies B-action, this is not for you.
