Now, I like sci-fi cartoons. However, if «Robotboy» appeared in Canada in late 2006, I watched the premiere and inevitably shaken. The symbols are universal and stereotyped (whether or not they need to make African-American men wear a tiger stripe print dress and speak in Jamacian accent? Why all the Asian characters are bright yellow and blinking? Do mothers have big hips and chest and is constantly complaining? ) to the point where things become unrealistic, predictable, rough and sometimes anxiety. There are heavy similarities, even strokes in Astro Boy. Let me explain (duplicate titles for young): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Aleh Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay, and so on. Short similarities in "My Life as a Teenage Robot," "Star Wars", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Kamen Riders», «Sailor Moon» and co. They are in motion. Not to mention the rich racial / gender stereotypes. Do not even get me started on innuendo. I just said that they were hidden and quite dirty. But seriously. Do not even try to watch it. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
