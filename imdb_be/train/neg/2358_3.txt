In the future, 2001 Freddie after the last surviving teenager Elm Street. Leaving NO horror stories however were to attempt unfunny humor and celebrity cameos unnecessary (come on..Roseanne ??? Tom Arnold ?? !! ?? WTF?), This is part 2 of the worst demon child rapist kogda ever received. Wow that was a piece of shit. Not even the great legendary Alice Cooper could make a stink out of this film. And if they goad Freddy ever daughter ?? The entire film is strongly retained in another conceivable shape and form. Talal, you stink to heaven, baby <br /> <br /> My rating: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras :. Cast and Crew Bios; Go to the 3D sequence and advance to the Nightmare option (a supplement for the film can be found in the seventh round of nightmare Collection DVD set) <br /> <br /> The contents of DVD-Rom: Total game; scenario; and a web link
