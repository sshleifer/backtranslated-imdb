You have to wonder how some flics ever made ... this one decided to skip to the why, among many other things, and just wandering for LLP. <br /> <br /> And yet, is doing its best to pump some life into the story you have a number of decent actors. Blue tint throughout the film "again" in the slips, which in itself would have been depressing, but this is overkill. The idea that it is not a disease, and not just any house or gypsy trinkets or a curse, but only that for no apparent reason starts to happen with our main character, and then all the others around it, just to be completed as well as with gulp from an empty cup. Some twins have supernormal abilities, but others do not, or do not know what they are doing? It seems they are just as ignorant as we are. <br /> <br /> This is the poor man's rip-off "Invasion of Body-SnatchersÂ» with Kiefer Sutherland, "Mirror" and "The Sixth Sense", were you seriously spoil these three together.
