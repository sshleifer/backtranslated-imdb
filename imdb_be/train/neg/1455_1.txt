I rarely subjected to such blatant stupidity in the film, which should be based on a historical figure. A terrible joke movie, I cringed everywhere. Terrible, trivial distorted and riddled with half-truths and outright lies. <br /> <br /> The famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw was originally to be a consultant for the film. However, he found the script so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused and demanded that they stop using his name as the source (it bothered him to think, people will think that he was involved). <br /> <br /> One scene shows Hitler beat his dog. There is no one source for this. Hitler loved animals over people. He cited the strict laws on the protection of animals in Europe, have banned vivisection and animal experimentation. He was also a vegetarian. <br /> <br /> The film makes its receipt of the Iron Cross in the farce, including bribery. Utter lies. He was honored for his numerous exploits over a long period of time. <br /> <br /> There are no historical records that indicate that Hitler ever had sexual relations with his niece. Not one. <br /> <br /> In addition, Hitler portrayed as a mad simpleton in the trash movie. <br /> <br /> If he were even half as ignorant, crazy and as thick as it is in a nonsense film, as in real life, you would not even know that he ever existed. Never mind to become a leader of Germany. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this film was absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> Go see Crash and give it a very wide berth.
