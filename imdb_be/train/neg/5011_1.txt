... And I never thought that the film deserves to be rewarded with 1! But this one honestly the worst movie I have ever watched. My wife took it out for a throw, but the plot right as DVD box seemed quite predictable. It is no secret, nor a movie juvenile catch. It does not include sensuality, if that's what the name may be remotely suggest any of you. It's just a total no-no. Do not waste your time and money if you do not feel like watching a bunch of young people as a form of adult-gothic atmosphere, where the killer is going after them. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth watching. Max Makovsky makes things worse Nick Stahl.
