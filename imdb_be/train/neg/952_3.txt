Happy Go Excellent is a waste of everyone time and talent, including the audience. Ease of old hat of mistaken identity and artificial scandalous storylines eminently forgivable. Very few people are watching these movies on their lots. But as a rule, they had some interesting minor characters involved in the story - not here. As a rule, they had an interesting choreography and breathtaking dancing and catchy songs. Nha Happy Go Lovely. And Vera-Ellen, as the actress has played the entire film as the second banana frantically looking for a star to push - and instead it was designed to carry the movie, and I could not do it. Scottish locale wasted. Usually automatically universally beautiful Scottish whim absent. The photo was pedestrian. Musical numbers were pedestrian. Cesar Romero gives his usual professional activity, chewing the scenery, because no one does its part in the type of a producer often tried to Walter Abel and Menzhu. David Niven just great, and no one could make David Niven David Niven. In the end, if you like Niven, like me, that's reason enough to spend 90 minutes at Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip it.
