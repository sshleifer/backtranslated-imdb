This film is a joke and should be one of the worst films Stallone ever made. This is a typical 80s movie where you have one person, destroying the entire army by himself.

This film is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. However, it was the peak of the Cold War, but I'm sick of having a communist or a fascist always be specified as an enemy.
