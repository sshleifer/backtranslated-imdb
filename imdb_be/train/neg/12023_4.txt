Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia, who had been in a psychiatric hospital for more than a decade after it was found wondering the back roads with blood on their hands. Doctors want to test experimental new drug that will return the lost memory when it's running. But if the medicine gives him a demon hallucinations, he decides to run instead. While outside, he befriends a little boy whose stepfather (Greg Grunberg) pushes his mother would not let her near the darkroom in the basement and acting suspiciously in general. <br /> <br /> While the overall "mystery" to film a little easy to determine the way before he showed, I found acting, Mr. Diamond to be interesting enough to hold my attention throughout. (In the interest of full disclosure, I was a big fan of his, as Homicide and his short but extremely pivotal role in The Shield through the Apprentice and Dollhouse) Not a great movie, no good, but serviceable enough. Although I like it better than the previous movies that I've seen with the director / writer Michael Hirst (No. 6, Pumkinhead 4 Mansquito) <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: a pair of tits in passing hallucination <br /> < br /> My assessment: C-
