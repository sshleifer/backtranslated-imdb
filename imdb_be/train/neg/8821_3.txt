Why, oh, why did not they learn? If you have a good, juicy manual trick, use it! Do not go messing around, trying to get all deep and thoughtful; you're only going to look ridiculous wind. <br /> <br /> Christmas Evil is a story about Harry Stadling, which has seen a little too much kissing mother (dad dressed-kak) Santa Claus ago, when he was a child. So, of course, Harry grows obsessed with Christmas, and finally, when his frustration becomes too large, it turns to the dresses as Santa, and wanders through the city handing out good toys small children, and viciously killing anyone, he said, a mischievous . <br /> <br /> simple enough, but not a bad place to start. (In the end, like many other holiday horror use the same trick?) Unfortunately, this film wants to be "Santa, portrait of a serial killer" than «Silent Night, Deadly Night». Two-thirds of the movie is spent documenting the slow but inevitable frustration Harry, when I would be willing to buy the premises at the opening titles were rolling time. You know that the slasher in trouble when you find convincing the killer, just to get to it already. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Harry descent into madness could be convincing in the hands of a competent director, but, unfortunately, we have some guy by the name of Jackson Lewis. Apparently, it was his only film, and it shows. Action dizzying jumps from scene to scene without a snapshot or a clear idea of ​​actors to tell us where we are and who we see. <br /> <br /> Even if the film gets rolling, we still entertained a heaping portion of pity Harry uncertainty and neurotic behavior. More depressing than scary, Christmas Evil is one to avoid.
