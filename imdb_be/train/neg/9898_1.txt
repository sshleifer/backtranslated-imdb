This version of "Moby Dick" insulting the audience, claiming that it is based on Melville's novel, even so far as to show a fake first chapter deals rather than the famous "Call me Ishmael." The annex to the brutal act, even from John Barrymore, it is perhaps the greatest example of how far Hollywood (especially at the beginning of Hollywood) went to review and change a famous novel only increase your chances of office.All box with beautiful, poetic language the novel was completely destroyed, and Ahab was changed from thoughtful, blasphemous, Obsessive madman to evil, a misunderstood hero who only want to kill Moby Dick after his fiance (!) turns away from him, when he saw his wooden leg. Added to this is the standard evil brother who wants to groom themselves, and the other end!
