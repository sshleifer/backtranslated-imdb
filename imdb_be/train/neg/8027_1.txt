I watched this movie. Until the end. And it was in fact not so simple. It's so boring, played poorly in almost all parts stolen from the "Blair Witch Project", that you can not believe that manufacturers take it seriously. Even harder to believe as a "product" made it on VHS and DVD. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to see a horror film, just watch "The Scream", but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time watching some of the children who are going through the forest, who shouts at each and one showing their inability to look dark area.
