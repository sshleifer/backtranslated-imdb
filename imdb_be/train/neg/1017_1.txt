Oh, my God. It was awful. There is bad, then it was. This film does not make any sense. It works all over the map, and it is not clear that it in general. Music seemed like he was trying to be like Batman. The fact that the "Edison" is not a real city takes. Since I live in Vancouver, watch this movie, and recognizing all these places made unbearable. Why do not they make it a real city? The only thing that was decent writing was'Tilman Â», in which John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor who really did not play a role at the top and mannerisms. It was really a pity that John Heard plays a big bad guy with a lot of screen time, and the film will be erosion. Too bad. Hopefully, someone will see the importance of it, and at least give John Heard credit where credit is due, and hire him as the lead bad guy again, which is where it should be. list A.
