As one of the few commentators have not seen the 1st movie, I found it very disappointing film. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's funny inconvenient type of humor, if you can bear the (high) morally dubious premise. . However, he was not in tears in important areas <br /> <br /> There is a thin and meaningless storyline featuring generous friend Gordon Sinclair, who may or may not be wrapped in a conspiracy to ensure hazardous electronics in third world countries - possibly free computer ... or perhaps not. Vague, at length and unconvincing. The lack of any significant ending is so infuriating, and that is present in a pompous and utterly illogical. The film feels half-finished. <br /> <br /> Suspended disbelief is very difficult if there is a very attractive teacher (Maria Doyle Kennedy) can be paid to the unimpressive character Gordon Sinclair, especially if he is cleared of its achievement. Laughable. This worsens later in the film when he reaches his romantic ambitions throws it all away for some ideals, based on very little evidence of ambiguous value. <br /> <br /> There are not many films leave me feeling cheated, but I felt that my time has been stolen.
