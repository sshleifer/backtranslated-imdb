This film is like a final disappointment in Tsai Ming-Liang for me. He wears away the laziness of it each frame. So I'm not going to analyze it carefully ever. But some observations: <br /> <br /> 1. If the room is dry, so we will see cityscapes with flowering green trees? Interestingly, that was supposed to mean something in a metaphorical context of the film (in which the thirst report craving for intimacy, and watermelon trivial surrogate, sex). Or is it just a matter of lousy film, without giving curse be consistent. <br /> <br /> 2. We do not get to find out what happened to the porn actress why she is unconscious or apparently dead. It seems that the question is irrelevant as long as the message of a higher alienation successfully (= pompous) comes, but in retrospect, her motionless body is cheap dramaturgical trick excuse ?? as well as industrial and gratuitous how its activity is used. <br /> <br /> 3. Nothing appears in this film, that Antonioni Sun suggested over 40 years ago ?? and without the need to humiliate his actors. <br /> <br /> 4. Musical numbers (processed with «The Hole») it seemed that the idea of ​​a secondary school student in art counterpointing, performed at this level is very high school skills. If this is the point, the point of sludge.
