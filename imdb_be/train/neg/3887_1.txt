I managed to capture this view with the help of MST3K, and oh boy, even with the reef this movie was painfully bad. Imagine someone whose competence with the camera can be done with monkeys. <br /> <br /> Highlights (what little there was) came from the special effects, which were «OK». Actions for the most part as «OK»; although nothing special, it was of better quality compared to other B-movies that I have seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is distressingly bad camera work often looks like they just put the camera people on roller skates and pushed it forward. Story (if it can be called so) is so full of holes it is almost funny, he never really explains why the hell did he survive in the first place, or needs human flesh to survive. The script is written badly, and the dialogue borders on the airplane just silly. The climax of the film (if there is one) is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you can not find the MST3K version, avoid it at all costs.
