You can not go away when the initial history is not so great. The premise of the blood needing a cyborg just sluggish. <br /> <br /> The script oversaturated. Actors do not have a lot of work. The sets were organized in the wilderness, to cut costs. Is a trademark, when the background of the desert, the film does not have a budget. <br /> <br /> The lack of budget in accordance with the procedure if there is a story. «Solarbabies» and «Blood of Champions" are examples of decent work is not $. but this film looks as if they had to scrape them together change to buy a sandwich cameramen. Again, excusable, if the story is not simply sucks <br /> <br /> In the end, this film is committing the greatest crime of all :. He does not end there! It finishes, as if it were a commercial break from the rest of the film. But the rest never comes. It's amazing. <br /> <br /> So bad.
