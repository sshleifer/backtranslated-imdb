I watched about 30 minutes of this film before I finally got tired of getting a club on the head with this film. Soundtrack, the so-called "conspiracy", and each actor. It's like they think they are the main part of the movie and scream "attention to me!" Again and again. The bad guy is the bad guy of his music comes and says that sinister bad guy, like everyone else, just in case you do not quite catch. Good guy makes a bold and noble things just in case you did not know that he was a good guy. And oh, the plane of the scene. "MY HUSBAND no! OH MY GOD! Impossible that he got to rub his feet or go to the toilet or something, it should be no! "(And yes, I know, his clothes were still there, but honestly, she woke up and started to panic, before it even have time to look at the damn chair he was in.) <br /> <br /> As a religious woman, I want to apologize to the world for wasting the film was printed on. <br /> <br /> And I want my 30 minutes ago.
