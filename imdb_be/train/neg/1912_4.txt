There's nothing new. All standard romantic comedy scene, even to sprint taxi to the airport to stop the departure of a woman. The only thing that saves it is the actor Alison Eastwood and some of the secondary characters (blink and you'll miss Gabrielle Anwar), who apparently had some fun. <br /> <br /> Turn it on, if the couple are in luck, and you do not have to go through the inevitable pain site.
