I hate this program, not only the notion of laughable, but he is trying so difficult to realize (what was left of these "repent", that end of the program, how, Muder: She wrote) <br /> <br /> Sigh.. why is it that writers can never be smart enough in the program to come up with evidence that will stick and win a decision in court <br /> <br /> Well: after X-number of years after the events being resolved, why should one SUSPECT, EVERY episode * Recognize * (! damn it) to the murder, which would otherwise go disclosed <br /> <br /> I bet all the police want criminals were this good sportsmen: Â«Aw, scales, officer, you're a bright one - I think if you find enough to convince myself I did it I may as well admit it and make it easier for you in court I can say that it is.? a fair cop. " <br /> <br /> The absolute dog s ** t and an insult to those of us with brains enough to even have heard of IQ
