I've seen this movie a long time ... fortunately it was free. I must be one of maybe twenty people who saw this film at the cinema. I do not remember a whole bunch, but I remember I was incredibly boring, the plot does not make sense, and when I left the theater the only thing I could say was, at least, now I know that the worst film I've ever seen It was. I was just incredibly troubled one: if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun is low enough for people to survive, why can not they turn it down to a comfortable temperature, instead of all the hot and sweaty? How stupid do they think we?
