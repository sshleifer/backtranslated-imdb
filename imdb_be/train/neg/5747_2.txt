I love zombie movies, and I love amateur productions. And Meat Market 2 starts really promising with a good tribute to Fulci's Classic «Zombi». <br /> <br /> I sat back and waited to be impressed. Well, some of the big cosmetics for such a no budget film and some of the actors (in vampirelady and cook) really stand out, but still there's nothing. <br /> <br /> I did not expect a new Romero here, but there is one sequence in the whole film, which has even a little suspense or shock value. The director knows how to stage the body rippings and interesting eating habits, but now (after the two parts) It's time to learn something more <br /> <br /> In MeatMarket2 Gore rhymes with hole. - for me that's not enough. - I'm sorry <br /> <br /> ** to *****
