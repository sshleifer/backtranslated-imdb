I'm really starting to believe that Siegel is on a mission to see how bad his films could become.This particular movie was a complete and utter waste of time see.My first complaint was the cover DVD, where they forged his pass and made him look slimmer and younger, if it looks like a movie crap.He has a large pot belly and double chin will be for him and the most miserable and indifferent look on his face. <br /> <br /> the whole plot was ridiculous to begin with, and pulled too long.The entire film leads to the final, where Seagal and his team had to take on a bunch of people under the influence of a top-secret military chemical adrenaline was enhancer.There too many useless dialogue and not to mention funny and constant rewriting voice Seagals even in the middle statement.The duplicate sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was very comical. <br /> <br /> action scenes in the film were horrible.Half time when Seagal foug XT you could not even see what's going to be tight shots on.There waving his hands in the chamber, and then a man flying through a wall or something .It is like the old series of kung fu on television.They used way too slow movement for the fight scenes. <br /> <br /> I believe that it Seagals worst film to date, and I'm glad I did not buy this movie, or I would have been very upset, because I'm a big fan of Seagal action star Aikidoist.T quickly disappears and it seems to be getting worse with every performance.
