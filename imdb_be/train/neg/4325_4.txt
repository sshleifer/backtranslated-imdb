The second release in the series is easily the least pleasant one, Clark Griswold wins a trip for the whole family to Europe. <br /> <br /> tasteless, humor below the belt, which worked so well the first time around virtually non-existent here. . This wine, of course, lies with the director Hackerling, which is not obvious, is not as good as directed by Harold Ramis and a very sad scenario which has only a few decent lines scattered around <br /> <br /> Cast doing what they can; Chevy Chase introduces some form of life in the examination, but it is simply not enough, and very funny Eric Idle is completely lost in a small role very unhappy Englishman. Some potentially funny moments not played all their potential and leave the viewer mostly aggravated. All depictions of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost everywhere is not funny (such as English sooo polite). <br /> <br /> Aside from a few scenes, there's hardly a laugh in sight and the end of turning this one into a complete farce. But if you're a fan of Chevy Chase (I), the movie is not watchable, but not much else.
