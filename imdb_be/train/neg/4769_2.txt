Unfortunately, it was a mistake. This film smelly from start to finish. It was hard to watch, because I watched Clarissa explains it all every day on Nickelodeon. I loved it. Then the next thing I found that it did spread in Maxim, and it was gorgeous! I really have not heard anything about it until I watched this movie in the accident. I could not believe that she even let something like that you can see her name all over it. Everything about it was not so, but he still looked like someone somewhere in the team is trying really hard to keep the wreck. Too bad .. I hope she continues to act, and I would like to see her with a real cast of a real movie.
