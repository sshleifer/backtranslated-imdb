This movie reminded me of those wretched "erotic thriller" I stay up late and watch Cinemax, when I was 13. I would label this film softer core, as there is simply no simulated bump and grinder. There is, however, a ton nudity- opening scenes at a strip club, we see keester Kane Hodder (or at least stunt butt) and then the inexplicable 10 minutes lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and the naked female werewolf who looks like they rob on from Munster to suit. 13-year-old boys are happy. <br /> <br /> In addition, that the transformation of the werewolf scene has the worst CGI I have seen in recent years. Filming look FMV by Resident Evil video games in terms of quality. Wolf's too bad, to explain and, in spite of the poor quality of the costume shows way, way too many times. <br /> <br /> The story and actions have no meaning. There are a few oddball history of werewolves and hybrid-werewolves- DarkWolf is the last one, but from what I can tell, the hybrids do the same, all the werewolf looks DO- people change people kill a wolf. DarkWolf trying to find a mate, but oddly enough, can not find a mate, but can sniff out anyone she touches. Once again, this skill is less than helpful, as DarkWolf winds murder of several people in his goal is never touched, met or even seen as best I can tell. The assistant does not know what she is a werewolf, and she fights for the transformation or something. <br /> <br /> You might think that it would be difficult to spoil a monster movie th bad as it is, but they have done well, Want quality low-end werewolf-Ishmael, go rent the soldiers Dogs want a ton of T & A this is your movie.
