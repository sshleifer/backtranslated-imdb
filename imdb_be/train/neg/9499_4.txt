I thought the movie was bad documentary. not discussed anything of substance. It seemed to cheapen the idea and did not provide anything new. The film was not a surprise or a novel or something, that would actually drive one for science. Most scientists appeared "stereotypical", and sometimes strange. The woman said her award does not matter a whole lot, but children who have helped. She said that after 10 minutes of scenes where she explained all the awards. The game "modest scientist," we? "I have an equation dancing in my head," said another. I do not understand how it explains nothing. It does not cover a significant impact of science on our culture. science policy were barely touched. <br /> <br /> Not a bad film for 10-14 year olds. Also, I felt that it was a sad and unrevealing. <br /> <br /> 4/10
