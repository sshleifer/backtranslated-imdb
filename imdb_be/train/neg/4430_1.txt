Due to the dull, dimensionless Scenario Neil Simon and lackluster direction of Robert Moore, head of the second becomes shrill showcase for Marsha Mason, who received her third of four Oscar nods second chapter gives the same work here, she gave in Cinnderella Freedom (73) goodbye, dear (77), Audrey Rose (78), and only when I laugh (81), only this time she did not have to lug around a child. Chapter Two is the third and last feature film for a cheap detective Moore, formerly Directed by Neil Simon (78) and the murder of death (76). Kaan miscast, mono-dimensional characters, the dialogue is overly analytical, and there is practically no establishment details. The first half is less than captivating, meet cute, coy romance between narrow-minded Caan and milling Mason and dreary second half makes you long for the first half. Place NYC, as well as Joe Bologna, and painfully thin Valerie Harper has nothing to do, but at least they provide some welcome distraction. And last and not least, there is a very song plays during the credits.
