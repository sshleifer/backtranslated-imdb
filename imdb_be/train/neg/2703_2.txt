SMALL SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Well, I just had stayed up late and watched this movie, mostly because I enjoyed and appreciated some of the early works like Singleton «Boyz n the hood." However, I must say that it was a major disappointment, and that's all I hate the contrived, the clichéd, so-called "message" films. <br /> <br /> Proceed mostly poor, (pop star and model will not necessarily make a good actor ... take note), the situation is difficult to swallow (the rape victim becomes an overnight lesbian? Please ... !), but worst of all, it strengthens all screwed stereotype you can think of. By the second half of the film, he became a cartoon, as well as in its characterization, which makes you lose any bit of sympathy you may have for their one-dimensional players. <br /> <br /> Not just any real point was about the inherent causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result, he finishes sensationalising results of these problems. This message is inconsistent, resulting in a feeling of confusion and general lack of unity of plot. With regard to the conclusion of the film, I found it to be predictable, awkward, operational and slightly offensive. I have to say that everything that I have learned not to see this ever for a film titled "Higher Education." <br /> <br /> If you want a real comment on some of the themes that the film is completely unable to develop to then hire "American History X" .... if you're not just watching it Tyra Banks then hire a life .
