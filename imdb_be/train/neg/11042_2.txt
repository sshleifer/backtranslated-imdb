I would like to say that this show was unusual at this banality, but usually in every way.It has a dull husband, his intelligent, but boring and normal wife, together with an idiotic sidekick for "comic" relief-he needs it badly. Stale predictable jokes, with even more predictable response from the laugh track, interspersed nauseating presentation storylines this harmful psychiatric drugs to leave me either physically sick, or in deep sleep are more like an induced coma. But it may be for some time, but because it gives the average American character, to which they can truly identify.A «normal» man like you and me.I live in the southern part of the US, so for me this show just the opposite escapism.Down here that obnoxious character everywhere, in some form or another.Seeing it on TV hard overkill.
