There are many obvious fraud associated with this film. Let's face it, though, the main reasons why someone would be watching would be Leo and Kate, who are not necessarily the best actors in the film. I'm not saying that they are not good actors, I say that they are smelly in this film. The special effects were decent (and I say that the filmmakers did a good job, making eye ship enjoyable), and even has a few drawbacks. For example, just before the ship is under the ground, you can see the unfinished blue screen image behind your main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I love the history of the real Titanic, but I find this insulting film of the story. Editing was brutal - there is no reason for any film to be more than 2 1/2 hours (except MayBe biopic), as well as writing and the script was horrible unnatural <br /> <br /> I will speak. the music was, perhaps, better than I could have imagined (and not only «My Heart Will Go On» song too). There is one scene that stands out for me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music sounds. This may well be the highlight of the film. As for the mood around, it was very sad. I was more than relieved, sad when Jack died, I do not know, maybe what the director intended. <br /> <br /> In a nut shell, I think it's terrible that they have turned a beautiful story of the Titanic in its general bloated chick flick.
