Well, the deal with this show, Power Rangers, in any case? I have always felt that the show, which was originally brought from Japan in the best shape, took what was great in Japan, and has become one of the most ridiculous and meaningless excuses toy history of merchandising! There is absolutely no sense with this show at all. <br /> <br /> The bad haircuts, bad costumes, earrings, etc., all show that it was funny, back in the 1990s Of the two idiots, and filling the skull to "Douz" major roles, Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack marker, I just want to say one thing: Give me a break <br /> <br /> Saban brought it from Japan, and then Disney bought the rights to the show about five years ago. <br /> <br /> now the public time to endure the repetition of the show on the Disney channel and such. <br /> <br /> All I can say it one more time to give me a break!
