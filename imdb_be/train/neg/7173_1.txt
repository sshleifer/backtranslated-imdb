I HATE movies Plane crash ... all of them! In fact, I hate them all with enthusiasm! First of all, they are cheap that looks and have no skills! Secondly, they offend the aviation industry and to tell the audience that all aircraft to make it fall out of the sky ... and CRASH! <br /> <br /> Why I shudder at such a film? It can happen to any of us and the consequences of the worser than that incurred by the characters in this movie ... which is the only aspect of a terrible natural disaster yarn airlines such as this. I hate this movie, because it is, like all the stupid plane 50000000 chaos ass movies in front of him! Freefall is not like all the others: no more longing to clichéd nonsense dramatic scenes take place. <br /> <br /> First, throw away the morons on this flying death trap: Cleaver-of Esquire family of three, yuppie baastard, and bitch stewardess complete with big blonde hairdo 1987 scolds everyone who is a little scared! <br /> <br /> My second gripe it should not be a feature film and a documentary explaining all about «Gimbli Glider» incident, Air Canada aka «Freefall» up to safety. <, Br /> <br /> My third and final gripe is with all airlines films of this caliber (except Fearless) Why the hell, man steward instruct the passenger to remove shoes there? (I could understand, high heels and sharp, loose items, but C'Mon!) How it is going to "make them more e # * king safer than it is now! This aircraft, if they (passengers) do not know any better: he knew that they were going to break up the ground. Why did you make 100 wounded down rubber slider, which can cause irritation of the skin to peel and bleed when struck only walk in their stockings on the debris field! It makes it any sense to anyone? <br /> <br /> You are fearless and ABC «Lost» series was more depth and realism of the crash than just "plane malfunction of the people, the panic-stewards become assholes-plane lands without wheels in the field, people wander without shoes and jackets, etc. in the same old shit from the airport in 1975! Freefall was so characteristic of the air crash of the film, I half expected to see a Charlton Heston or Peter Graves broke into damn passenger compartment at any time. Can we, at least, these bad characters acted return to normal life, rather than people who are happy amidst the impending tragedy, which looked to them? Typical stupid Lifetime movie! Cheap and Stupid! <br /> <br /> Director of «Freefall» should follow cheap, made-for-TV movies with white middle-aged women with stupid teenage children who do drugs and have marital problems. As for the unknown ... leave it to professionals ... you crack! Why do we have to sit through the audience more than an hour and a half, the first airport wannabe rehash. I hope to God they do not make plane crash movies like this anymore. If it were as «Lost» series ABC, it will be something to watch. But it's full of shit, and then some. Stop rotation every airplane disaster movie "Airport 1975"! This is not the "Airport" is cheap pathetic waste of my time. I would not recommend this film or any of the crash of the TV movie nobody even has the worst enemies.
