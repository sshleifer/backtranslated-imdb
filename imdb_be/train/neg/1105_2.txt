Oh, my. How can they make films such beauty, but it is so terribly bad. I mean, even Uwe Boll does not do shit like that. There is not even a hint of a decent story, multi-layered character, or attraction. It's just a random sequence of meaningless chatter joined together to make a "film". I believe only children up to 3 years old can enjoy it, given that the world is so utterly dimensionless and the story is so incoherent that someone older, will irritate him. But then again, it's too scary for those under 6 years old, that's probably not the one who should see this movie at all. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and stay far, far away from this film. Your little daughter could make a better story, and while it probably will not be able to draw it fairly, her stories are much more worth listening to. And, please, in the name of who you believe, does not call into their children in this part of the ****. I'll give it 2 out of 10, and it is exclusively for the graphics, because the story and character development are so desperate they deserve a negative rating. <br /> <br /> And if you decide to watch it anyway ... remember that I warned you.
