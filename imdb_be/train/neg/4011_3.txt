For each series, which makes it to television, generated 100 ideas, 50 scripts were written, 15 pilots made, and one, only one, in fact, makes its production. From this selection process, we are lead to believe that the final product should be cream of the crop, for what other reason could so many ideas to be rejected to give us a TV series. <br /> <br /> And so it goes with the True Blood; All the stars were aligned, and what started out as a series of novels, has transformed into an idea, screen play, the pilot, and finally a row. Unfortunately, sometimes it can be a long journey, and along the way there are many twists and turns that will ultimately change the way that was good and pure and to show that the production of people feel it would be better to assess. Oh how wrong they are so often ... <br /> <br /> True Blood is an example of the creative concept, which has become one of the poorest storylines worst actions and silliest scene sometime in the recent history of television his international cast of relatively unknown actors trying to find their voices, but they keep stumbling fake southern accent. not so secret desires Alan Ball for Ryan (Jason Stackhouse) gives us a fresh shot of a naked every week, even though it often has nothing to do with the plot. angry black woman Tara feature can not connect, and you find yourself in the secret hope that the vampires take it quickly, before it turns into another speech about the white suppression while attending the opening ceremony of the glorious dead of Confedercy. Sam finds a suppressed love for Sookie, and suddenly we have to believe that he should watch her in the morning, at noon and in the evening, despite the years of working with it and avoid such relationships. <br /> <br /> As for Bill the vampire, his high moral quickly surrendered as soon as possible to make love with Sookie and have no problems with it to make a quick snack (though it remains somewhat a whole). We find other vampires do not like the ruling Bill, but to a large extent, that wants to be accepted by the public, how they look at life as a Happy feet. <br /> <br /> Despite all my efforts, the suffering in the first six episodes, I came to the realization that no matter how long you do not look at the bad show, it is still bad. Somethings are dying for a reason, even vampires. Maybe it has to show.
