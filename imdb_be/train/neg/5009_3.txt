This was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot did not make a lot of sense, and the acting was terrible. I'm a big fan of Amber Benson, I think it is, as a rule, a great actress, I can not imagine why she decided to make this film. Her character, Piper, consumed almost the entire film, except for the opening scene. On the positive side, there are several points in the film where the action was so bad, I actually laughed out loud. But despite this, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It lasts only 80 minutes, but it is 80 minutes of your life that you will be completely wasted.
