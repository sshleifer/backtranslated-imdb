That's what my friend Brian said about this film is about an hour it. He could not keep from dozing off. I was talking about how disgusting it was, and in the end I gave up and played, ran out of adjectives for "boring". <br /> <br /> Imagine, if you will, the pinnacle of schlock. Something so uninspired, so unbelievable that scared all you want to do after watching it, is to sit alone in the dark and did not tell anyone. Some people labor under the illusion that this film is watchable. It is not, not by any form of drugs or brain damage. I would only recommend it to someone to help them understand how it is really unbearable. You do not believe me? Gather 'round. <br /> <br /> Of course, as a nation, we in America do not always reflect the peoples of the Middle East in an elegant way. But as a child in Sheikh outfits bowing in Salaam-stack mode in the Castrol motor oil bottles? You will find that here. Got it? Arabic worships oil. I could not believe what I saw. With planes flying into a skyscraper child would be more suitable. Who in their right mind would think that was a funny joke? It's not even close to the "sly attack." It just sucks and makes you want to hit someone paid to write that little face. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, five people singing group called "Mina" enters the scene at the ball of the officer. Okay- you ready? Sing joke scary and OFF-KEY. Why did I write that in caps too? Because joke POUND, POUND, pounded in his head with a marathon monstrous gags. They start quite mediocre; Points cracking punch tumblers breaking ... I mean, I'm 100% serious, and two frame sequence of stop-motion shoes woman looking up. You read that correctly- music was so bad in one frame, a woman's feet have shoes on. In very next- shoe possible !!! Get it, because the music was so bad, her shoes came off! What F ???? <br /> <br /> Then there is an infinite assembly of footage to drive home the point that singing BAD. If any man really suffered from this in the theater scene does not work like hell, I'd be surprised. This film is honestly a joke to see how quickly people will sift through the door. Robert Downey Sr. directs a comedy, his son will be respected, remaining drug-free. It is not good. Other things to watch out for: <br /> <br /> 1. Pop squeeze in wherever possible. Every time there is Liceman, really ridiculous Iggy Pop song is playing. Plus, all the actors are doing their best to act like it was really chilly for some reason. <br /> <br /> 2. criminally horrible accent Barbara Bach. It sounds like she is trying to speak as a child, while the marble rolling around on her tongue. There's no nudity, and there are several scenes where the boys all moan and writhe glimpse of her cleavage as they OASHE acting class and they were directed to act as called backward people. <br /> <br /> 3. Liceman feeds his dog disgusting condom. remember; when this movie came out throwing "abortion" and "condom" was regarded as "sharp". <br /> <br /> 4. Meanwhile Poston plays a grinder, a boy hungry pedophile, back when Hollywood thought "pedophile" and "homosexual" was one in the same. Flat out embarrassing. <br /> <br /> 5. Watch the ending. There is nothing wrong with a VCR. That is really the end. Tell me that does not make you want to blow up anyone who's ever done any film, ever. <br /> <br /> Look at this at your own risk. To the Academy, as you know, to actually make other films like The Jerk or Blazing saddles less funny simply by placing a videotape with them.
