Well, just by reading the title you think it would be a good movie. Well, at least I did. He started well but has become so boring after the first half. * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> He tells the story of a mother who so desperately her daughter to become a dancer, she will stop at nothing to get what she wants. The only problem is that a friend of her daughter is the girl on the way. She always wins the competition, so the mother pushing further to the "liquidation" of it. After talking with a "killer", the mother decides that she must be a little dispersed. So action is being taken, but she was eventually caught. <br /> <br /> In the terrible roles and the film stretches, nothing happens for too long. Do not waste your time watching this. <br /> <br />
