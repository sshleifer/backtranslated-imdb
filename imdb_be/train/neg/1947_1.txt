I'm 17, and I still like most movies Scooby Doo and the old episodes. I love the movies of the 1990s, and more recently we were treated to one of the better right on the DVD Scooby Doo outings this decade, Scooby-Doo and the Goblin King, which I did not expect so good as it was. Anyway, to get a clue! I watched some episodes, waiting for something very good, but from what I saw it, I was not impressed at all. First of all, I hated the animation. It was flat, and blows away the very Saturday morning -cartoon -standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some show I really hate the animation was a little better. Even worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne, as they have added a lot of old episodes when Scooby-Doo was a positive good. I hated the changes in the nature, because it seemed like instead of solving the mystery, Shaggy and Scooby are now playing a superhero, what they would have never been done in the movies or in the Scooby-Doo, where are you? show. The theme tune was not very good and I can not even remember, and jokes were lame and contrived. Although, I will admit that there is a very talented voice cast, if they were better material and say sound as different from the original voices as humanly possible, what they did, I might add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was awful, and I'm not trying to discredit him, this is what I personally believe. 1/10 Bethany Cox
