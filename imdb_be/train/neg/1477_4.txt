I saw Dolemite, and (Punisher) Disco Godfather, two other remarkable works from the canon of black actors of our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this film, The Human Tornado (aka Dolemite 2) will always hold a special place in my heart. To explicitly the goofiness, inability in the film industry, and absolute enthusiasm (to be honest, too much), The Human Tornado can not be replenished. <br /> <br /> The opening scene sets the tone. Our old friend Dolemite is shacking with a white woman when some racist local police raid homes without good reason, would not you know it! Woman in bed with Ol Â»Dole none other than the wife of a sheriff. Her scream when she sees him: "He made me do it" scream Dolemite in: "& $ * @ $ you for real ???" Subtlety has never been his strong suit. <br /> <br /> Highlights? Cameo very young Ernie Hudson (from Ghostbusters fame), continuity errors (character looking in one direction in one frame, and the other in the next, Dolemite suit changing colors every frame of his nightclub act), and queen bees demonic eyes her first stage. <br /> <br /> But the real joy here himself Rudy Ray Moore. Do people really think that he looked cool in this film? Of course, I do not know why, but you have to admire the enthusiasm he has. Be those jumps absolutely naked with a rock, or barking orders his gang to rhyme (eg :! Quick In the cave I have a plan to allow the mother @ $ * (&% to dig his own grave) a person commits! Completely. Of course, he goes overboard, never more than at any time he is doing kung fu. climactic battle taken off at high speed, but occassionaly slows down to allow Rudy poses and grits his teeth. I'm not sure if they want it too look like they have accelerated film as an effect, or if they really wanted to believe that he was so fast. in the Telegram th event, "The Matrix" is not the case. <br /> <br /> Human Tornado, as well as the original Dolemite, is incompetent film of enormous size. But at least it's fun, and, of course, you must pay tribute to these people for their efforts. Just not so much. Enjoy my heartfelt recommendation.
