First of all, this film is glacier slow, and I can see, most of the audience is losing patience with him at all in the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> subject of the film was one, I think that would be the basis of a great movie; that the plot is most lacking it was here, which will promote the main themes. <br /> <br /> It's sad, because in the hands of the writer as (say) Lanford Wilson, I think the symbolism as a mountain lion invading the school campus can take on more, Tragic proportions, without being overbearing. <br /> <br /> I think that with a good script to support the film, the same director, the same tastes, and even with the same actors (which actually did not even get a chance to hit me), could be able to provide a meaningful and touching image of pain and with all the strength that the boy goes, if it develops a strong "crush" on the older boys, he enjoys. <br /> <br /> However, I'm sorry, that without this foundation, and armed with a clear, blunt, and much uninteresting scenario, without any plot in sight, and the absence of any reasonable structure (eg after watching, I think you will find that you can not show on the climactic scene, and instead find yourself listing "well, maybe that scene, or one, was the climax ..."). - the result of 95 minutes of boredom <br /> <br /> Without a good story, we will never get very interested in any of the characters; their trials and tribulations, just boring and sad. <br /> <br /> Without a good story, a dramatic device and surreal directorial liberties are mysterious and confusing, not to enhance the storyline. I could never believe that, for example, the creation of "Leah" and I think most viewers will be completely baffled by the traditional way in which it calls have been removed. <br /> <br /> As a film, I'm afraid that this is one I can not recommend at all. What I can never understand why a film like this will not alter the enterprising filmmaker ... instead of mediocre remakes of films that were extremely well in the first issue! All you need is a good script, written by a good writer, and I think that this film can be easily converted into an unforgettable classics of the male aspect of the coming of age, which is rarely dealt with in the drama. All the elements that were so tedious and seemingly so selective in the film (message written on her belly boys, "Leah" scenes, fantasy TV screen) can become rich, if supported by a good story. <br /> <br /> I see a lot of comments that people are talking about the movie, such as the time of the "gay" theme, and I think that's a mistake. Obviously, the "crush" reflect is that the newly pubescent boy at the older teen boys, but the character of Logan is too young to settle on any specific sexual choices, and, indeed, he was portrayed as masturbation fantasies, we we see all kinds of stimuli, sexual and non-sexual, as you would expect in a very small boy like him. I believe that "crushes", such as Logan common among young men who grow up to have a strong preference for female sex partners.
