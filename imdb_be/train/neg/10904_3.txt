I rented this film, which is waiting for a few laughs, I hope enough to keep me pleased, but I was wrong. This film showed a very minimal moments of humor and pathetic joke I cringed in shame forever ... Directed by hiring him in the age group 10-15, this film will definitely leave viewers outside of these borders feeling very unsatisfied. It should be no more than 3 votes highly unrecommended to those who do not want to spend my life 2:00.
