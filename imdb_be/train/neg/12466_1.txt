I could not wait to get the DVD after hearing so much about the film. What a disappointment! This was one of the most confusing movie that I have ever viewed. There are some others remind that it became impossible to follow the story line was so many characters introduced. I could not understand how George Clooney won the actor for the film, since he was barely involved, at least in the first half of the film. My wife and I gave up after an hour of torment and stopped DVD. I would consider fast-forward to see if the ending was better, but after so much confusion has decided that the chances of improvement are slim. A colleague told me that a lot of the movie "come together" at the last minute or less. I was glad that I did not spend an hour waiting. I gave the DVD off the next day.
