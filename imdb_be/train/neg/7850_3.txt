Alexander Aja remake of The Hills Have Eyes was one of the bright spots in 2006 was not only a remake of the classic horror film, but it was pretty damn good too. So, almost a year later, we turn to the sequel of this alteration. While the original scripter Wes Craven is back as a producer and scripting, the film simply can not rise to the level established by the original and the remake. A group of military trainees stop in the desert, to check in on some of the scientists and find yourself broke mutant family from the first film (at least those that remain, plus some new ones). There's plenty of gore to be here. What annoys me about this film is a complete lack of performance. The viewer does not care what happens to any of these people, because we have not received them. Even mutants had some characteristics of the last time and this time, nothing. Mountains for the sake of gore does not make sense. There must be a reason for this to happen in order to be interesting. Nothing is happening here is not interesting. And it recently with a rape scene in the film? Here we get another one for no real reason. Hopefully, this is one set of hills that will not visit again.
