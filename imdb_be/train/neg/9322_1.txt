Please do not let the cover fool you this film. And if you are looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh: it is not. Usually, I'm going to go stupid if it's funny, but it was so silly nonsense that nearly (or perhaps did) make me stupid. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film is better than a PDA, but not much, and it is quite possible, the music was created with Samba 2 keys on the Casio keyboard. These problems should not really be deterent from watching a horror movie, but add this amazing (Lam) roll, and you have a real trick. <br /> <br /> The story about a guy who invites his friends to his family house in Texas over the weekend. It also extends an invitation to his lady crush in the office. On the way they meet a woman in trouble who then invited to come to the other girls. <br /> <br /> Stay in the cabin includes sex and nudity, panties, and soon all are in conjunction, when one girl disappears, and the odd elements to turn the house. <br /> <br /> from you (the audience) and morons, um, actors, trying to figure out what's going on, and soon they begin to trust each other. Overall, I think I've made it sound better than it is. The main struggle with this film, the characters are very well developed, the plot is contrived acting badly and motivation ignorant. Once again it can be forgiveable it was a little ridiculous, but unfortunately this is not so. <br /> <br /> Turn the ending only twist is that no one would guess it's just because if you really think back through the film does not make sense anyway. Please do not let this review stop you see the bullet surprise of this film. (Oh, my nose just grew eight inches).
