I just gave it a ridiculously named comedy horror film and 2, because several well-known porn star past is in it. A group of tourists, ostensibly on holiday in Ireland, but in fact in Canada was interrupted in cannibal inbred mutant or something else, and the plot is more or less directly from the mountains have eyes Ands Wrong Turn. Only problem is, if I'm not lost, there is only one mutant on the display, and it is not all that impressive. Kind of like the pot-bellied mummy in this home movie from about five years ago. A bloody, stupid deaths but to help, but the film is strictly amateur night and sad beyond belief. The ending is predictable and has been done to death. A lot of pun.
