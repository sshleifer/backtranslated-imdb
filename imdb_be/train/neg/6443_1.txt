I was one of the few nya-liberals who showed to see the video of Steve. It was quite an experience ... in a propaganda film industry and boredom. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the film may be an actual documentary Michael Moore's visit to my local school, UVSC, but it turned out to be one more liberal, slash and burn effort to slam the conservative and the local religious community. It sure seems to be selfish for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects its bias on issues. <br /> <br /> What's more amazing to see all the "10" vote his homeys posted here. Perhaps they even see the video? Golly of Batman, should be treated with all the presidential Ratiu! Their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film. <br /> <br /> So, how laying votes at IMDb help a lame movie. Perhaps my voice will help balance it.
