I talk A.S.L. Student and was forced to watch this movie in the classroom, and what I got out of it was a clear bias in the film. The film is clearly leaning toward a P.O.V. "General perception of the deaf" they do not mean. In addition, the film does not mention or take into account other situations, which are also discussed in this topic.

Not that this is bad, but to be a true documentary is to try to be a bit impartial.
