History surprising disinterest kills "psychic" again and again. The characters and the plot is completely uninteresting (as a crazy work Fulci chamber which, as a rule, the redemptive factor in his films) and any grasp of suspense nowhere to be found. It is laid to intolerable degree - in the end, you will not be required of excitement, but affected by the amount (and, as I may be, uncontrollable desire to sleep) performance of Jennifer O'Neill deserves placement in the best film Fulci gorehounds beware -.. "Psychic" there just is not much adbyvaets camping in <br /> <br /> 3/10
