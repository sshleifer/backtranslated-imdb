How the Grinch Stole Christmas was a great little Christmas cartoon that everyone can easily use it, I never saw the reason for a remake. Not to mention the remake, which was made with the people cartoon was just perfect enough that the aim of this film? But it also seemed a bit odd to be the Grinch Jim Carrey. I mean that he is a great comedian, but he, like the Grinch? It just does not make any sense to me. His speech was a little above and unintentionally funny at moments. Not to mention some of the added dialogue was a bit like a child and not a pleasant one. The whole history of Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was better done and there was no need. In fact, they just destroyed a story, period. <br /> <br /> Everyone in Whoville is preparing for their best Christmas season even where everything is designed to go perfectly. But Cindy L-Who curious and worried about the Grinch who lives on them, and that he was not going to get as a benefit of Christmas, the other one. He pushes her and decides that he does not want to Christmas this year, and that in fact he has just steal Christmas all together, to show who is his version of Christmas is all about. But soon he realizes that someone can know that it is a little more than the materialized version of the Nativity. <br /> <br /> How the Grinch Stole Christmas was not necessary and was a bit on top. I really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that it is quite alarming option, at least in my opinion. Make-up and presentation of the film was just a little more to do, not to mention the fact that the Grinch Stole Christmas! It was more meant to be a cartoon, not a version starring Jim Carrey. But, at least, this version allows you to be grateful for version of Boris Karloff, who plays every Christmas. <br /> <br /> 1/10
