I fully agree with jamrom4 .. it was only the worst movie I have ever seen .. holy crap it was awful .. I was warned not to see it..and silly, I watched it anyway .. about 10 minutes in a painful experience I'm totally disappointed watching atrocity..but entirely hatched to end..just, to see if I could .. well I did, and now I wish I had been not..it disgusting..nothing It happened, and ending all preachy..no film, which is entitled to bad survive..i beg all of you to rid yourself of fat terror drives bus..if soon as I listened the same warning..please save amb itself from this film .. I have a feeling of those who praised him highly involved in the creation in movie..and all need to be wiped off the face of the planet ..
