This is probably one of the worst French films that I've seen so far, including more than 100 French films I've ever seen. Terrible script and very medioacre / unprofessional actions lead to directing powerless. with all that it does not matter how well the western French scene and fantasy music can add to the story. <br /> <br /> One of the key weaknesses of this film is the fact that these two characters are not attracted to men as the audience I do not care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> This struck me as the film received the Jury Prize at Cannes, man, I love almost all sentenced films at Cannes, but this is not one. The main disappointment for me.
