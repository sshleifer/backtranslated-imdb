This film had what sounded like a great premise: 9 people, facing their fears, to win one million dollars. Unfortunately, it was not possible to be a good film. There are a few scenes that are too long and really pointless, as the dancing scene. Several scenes just an excuse to point the camera to the female body. Act is bad, but some of the funny lines from them terribly. What is really surprising that by the end of the film, he becomes as 5 minutes west, and in the end, twist, of which there were several, does not make sense to the rest of the film. It seemed that the director just said things because he thought it would look cool, while generally ignoring the plot of the film up to that point. He just does not make much sense. Only terrible was that old people dancing along the corridor, but it is not even close to doing for the rest of this mess.
