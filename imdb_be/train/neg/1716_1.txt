Despite the fact that it was made for television production, there is absolutely no justification for the rock bottom of the results of the finished product. The film had a budget, and it has been casting department, so if you are going to make a film about the true story of the life, and actually put the "true story" in the title, to be determined effort to stand out to try to grab some realism? First of all, this film is absurd cast. These actors belong daytime TV soaps or those ridiculous Lifetime Channel movie, not in real life gangster / criminal history. All of them, of their views on their manners, just yelling from one generation to the 90th-shopping center alt-rock listening. What about the script? Two words describe this - stupid and insulting, and again it is too 90ish sound. I do not think that the actual Clyde Barrow ever uttered the words: ". I'm out of here" It's as if a bunch of Â«New Kids on the Block 'supporters came together and decided to make a really" KEWL film "about Bonnie and Clyde, you know, the that would have been completely pleased and lights. Well, this label does not even rank in the radian and the Rockin 'scale. Anything that could be wrong with any kind of film is not the case, from the casting and acting to editing and music. Every thing grossly wrong .... and it's infuriating that the parties responsible for this monstrous turkey had the gall to put a "true story" in the title. This, of course, is not the real story, but even worse, it's not even remotely entertaining as mindless popcorn flick, which is accepted on their own terms. As I mentioned in my article, it's just awful for words, at every level imaginable. Trust me on this, or look at your own risk.
