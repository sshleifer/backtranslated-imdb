The cover on the DVD drive and the uncontrolled strange, you think they made a movie about the sweet of twisted metal black color, which is still a really great idea, but the actors of this film are the worst, the performance of Ben at Pearl Harbor, porn x have the best quality and best actors. I was going to buy a DVD, but, fortunately, I rented the first, the story and the script, too awful, nothing seems to go together, so that the film does not make sense. Poor attempts to intimidate you by a flashback scene worse than those used in the 80's comedy show positions and in the end, it will leave you wanting to beat my head against the wall of your home.
