This film is just too long, too much repetition, with male nudity and sexuality be (as it says in Gaia with my own collection of adult titles) is too gratuitous and unnecessary. Most of the first third of the film could be reduced up to ten minutes and was just as effective, without trying the patience (and stamina) audience. <br /> <br /> I saw this film in the early Saturday afternoon, with the audience Film Festival; the type of crowd that tends to be more daring, more interested in experimental or unusual films, such as the one without much dialogue, shorts, foreign films. Next to a sell out crowd at about 275 theater seats began to dig in the first half of the film, and while most of it was left for the "pay off" (which never arrived), I have never, for about 14 years to visit any number of film festivals, experimental, gay and otherwise, have seen so many people to move away from the film. <br /> <br /> This film could easily be cut by more than half, and was just as effective as it was. He also could go in different directions, still with a shorter operating time, and was much more effective. <br /> <br /> At the moment it exists, it is not something that can be easy to recommend one, or I would have any desire to see again.
