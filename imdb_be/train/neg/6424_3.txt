would break the writer and his agent will be (Tom Wood and Arye Gross), is forced to live in a self-storage facility run by an eccentric and horrible manager (Ron Perlman), which they have come to believe is a serial killer who terrorizes the city, " suit killer "(so called because after the introduction of their victims Vindex, he puts them in silly costumes). They convince his life would make a great movie, and to bring together a group of loser imitators filmmakers (John Considine, Pantoliano ~ d, Kristy Swanson) and find that the art of making movies can be murder. <br /> <br /> There is more to this film, but unfortunately, it remains on the cutting room floor, and it shows (ear studio wants to "light" the dark comedy). Our losses (and the actors who are doing excellent jobs and deserve better), as it has the makings of an exceptional black comedy, but only mediocre rises cute. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Ron Perlman is absolutely worth getting just for their work. His comedy great time and he has a chance to do some really great experience (he was not kidding when he said the movie Hellboy comments that he must intervene if it gets into Jerry Lewis mode). He's just fun to watch this. <br /> <br /> David Dukes also shines in two sceners (but crucial) role.
