If you look at Corey Large INFORMATION here on IMDb, apparently, there is a film called "reset" in production (as of June '08), in which he plays a character named Sebastian Cole. <br /> <br /> First of all, how does this crappy movie ever to earn continued ... and the end is not the end to kill Sebastian «Loaded»? <br /> <br /> I watched it in the wee hours of the morning, when I Fight insomnia, so I drifted in and out while he was included. I'm sure I missed some points of the plot, but in general, it seemed very weak. Great performance was (for me) is one of the strongest parts of the film. I am also a little surprised by all the people commenting on the pretty girls, because I thought that the actress plays Brooke was nice, but not exceptional.
