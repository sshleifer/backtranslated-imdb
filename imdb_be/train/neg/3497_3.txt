Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman is a show not to praise it at all.The character even remotely cute, and it's not a situation where you think, 'Oh, she's such IB * Tch I love her "just" is such ab * TCH Â». this character is just plain old samoopravdatsya, then b * tch.Sarah, it seems to be struggling to carry the show, because it's the only one in the floor funny it.The mood, dialogue is all so damn boring and dry it how to listen to your grandfather and to go over the marble, which he collected in his childhood. <br /> <br /> Silverman Program, Sarah is so incredibly boring that I thought about changing the channel to watch old reruns Married with children is something that's funny, because the characters are so "immoral" and "rough" third excuse, but I I do not find the show packed with dry humor and banal stories from the wall of the angry, bitter life of an angry, bitter, losing its annoying as hell sisters and gay friends that sound like Keanu Reeves with a cold somewhere close to funny.I can not stand this show, although in general I find Sarah Silverman made that "I love her, because she is such a character * tch", as in the School Of Rock, and most of it should be up.I think this show is boring with characters who think and miserly to say and do things for the value shock, for example. constant pube, diarrhea, and $ hit for the whole laughs.The Sarah Silverman Program is trying to be funny and not need it, or laugh track or better writers.Someone compared it to South Park, but it's not even close.I've expressed my opinion on Sarah Silverman program, and will not irritate the troll means that you will not see me being ab * tch and permanent placement of things like "this show sucks" and "Why is not canceled yet" .I do not like the program, Sarah Silverman, if you enjoy.
