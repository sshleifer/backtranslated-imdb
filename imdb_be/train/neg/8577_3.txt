I knew that my resume will get you. As this film, as the Pet Rock and the disc? Well, if you did not live in the 1970s or '80s, you probably can not understand why someone would like New Coke, or his own Pet Rock (and, to be honest, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I still do not understand completely). They are just a couple of things that seemed to make sense at the time, but in fact to frustrate the younger generation. The same can be said about Koi Kyser and his team. At that time (the 1940s, mostly), they were very popular and had enough influence that the studio shoot them with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre in the film. However, if you have not lived at that time (this was long before my time), you wonder why anyone would like this kind of "entertainment." In the end, Kyser and his band mates are incredibly reverse and their humor very, very broad (ie, naive and cheese). Honestly, I could not stand their antics, and I do not understand that there were too many musical numbers in the film. Because of these factors, a large supporting cast got back seat and supporters of these actors are likely to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film includes Kyser and the group coming to the mansion, where the young lady and her foolish aunt live. Once there, the bridge is washed away and strange events begin. In the end, it culminates in some of the attempts on the life of Sally and the session (grades). It's all played for laughs - and it is not really a horror film, despite the actor's <br /> <br /> In general, this is a passable entertainment at best .. As a supporter of Lugosi and Karloff, I'm sure he felt cheated in order to watch Kyser and his knuckleheads.
