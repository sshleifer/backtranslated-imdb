First of all, let's start with the fact that Robert Englund and Doug Bradley Melinda Clarke is to pay tribute for to be associated with this part of the nonsense. I had to give to it, would not let me give it a zero. I want to know how bad this film? My mother calls me around the city and said to me: "Son, I just looked silly film ever. I replied, as they say, "killer language is that?" It was like how do you know that? this is how bad this film. I mean, it looked like a good movie in the first Freddy pinhead Melinda. well I'll give him a chance. I sat through to the end of this movie just because I wrote a column for reviews of horror movies. I implore you, do not waste time, money or even brain cells in this ridiculous piece of shit. scatter. far. if you see it on the shelf in a Hollywood blockbuster video or even your local video store, turn it around and go .... and I still want my two hours before his hell
