Let's face it-- to the eyes, if you rented STDVD continuation forgotten 80 stone, and it is expected that it will be better than the above, then you are an idiot. Wargames: The Dead Code joins a long list of acts of unnecessary sequels that the DVD market is filled with so easily. Films like this do not need to spoilers, because you already know them <br /> <br /> «story" for this "movie", as follows: a fool meets a girl ;. nerd girl likes; nerd loves a girl; nerd gets involved accidentally Top secret government computer; nerd girl and go to another country; nerd girl and ultimately pursued by government costumes in another country; nerd and girl meet some important old man who dies at a key moment in the "movie"; nerd girl and captured; Top secret government computer gets mad; botanist hired to beat Top Secret Government Computer; nerd beats secret computer, using the same old secret computer first Wargames «film»; nerd saves the day; nerd gets laid. <br /> <br /> end. <br /> <br /> acting, script, effects, cinematography and score that you would expect-- B-Class. Some familiar faces are there, and if you're not a mega fan of Colm Feore, then you should avoid it. Of course, the film does not make you stupid enough to eat their own fingers, seeing it, so if you are looking for cheap STDVD, then you are right at home. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Broderick was too associated with a kind of "masterpiece" that he could not even make a five-second cameo in this. But you can blame him?
