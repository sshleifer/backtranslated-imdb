Spoilers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I watched half of this film, and I'm useless "t like it. <br /> <br /> The first reason is boring. Hardly anything happens, women are sitting and discussing how awful their lives and how they do not have any hope that they smoke grass, reading magazines, caring for a sick friend, and sometimes cut the dead body. Sad !!!! <br /> <br /> The second reason: There are too many things left unexplained. Many scenes are devoted to zombie hunter who steals random person holding them in a chair and interrogated them. Who are these people? How do they know anything about the illegal activities in relation to the affected flesh eaters? Why did he kill one and let another go? <br /> <br /> In addition, there is this guy who at first I thought, also had a flesh eating disease, but he puts his fist through the wall with superhuman strength, believing that he is not quite what we originally thought, never explained! How to care about what? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I have found that women are annoying, uninteresting story, the film series tedious, and the effect of a non-existent. In addition, the cover is misleading because it leads you to believe that this film would be great if it is clearly not the case. I made this film, based on some of the reviews made by others on this site, and while I respect the fact that some people may enjoy this film, I am now sure that I have read more than two views deep into the film in such a to avoid renting another movie, I regret that I can see.
