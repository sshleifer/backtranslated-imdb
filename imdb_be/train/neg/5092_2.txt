Shocking! <br /> <br /> In 1965, I saw Yuri Gagarin alive. He was sincere, unpretentious and affectionate, he was calm and seemed well-educated and intelligent man. In this film, I saw a clown! The actor looks like a mannequin with affected gestures and facial expressions. They made a cartoon! This Gagarin was someone else! ! Do not believe in this film <br /> <br /> I saw this movie once in a movie like "The Taming of the Fire" and "Apollo 13" and after reading the book "Rockets and People" by Chertok and "King: Myths and the facts "by Golovanov. I was in shock from the tedious script, bad actions and production, as well as the many inaccuracies in the "space race." <br /> <br /> The film is tedious rendering is well known in the Russian historical facts. A lot of interesting facts known space projects has not been demonstrated. Some facts and details have been perverted. For example, in 1945, the Queens are no longer a prisoner (released in 1944), and in 1940 he was no longer in prison Kolyma gold mine, but in a special prison design bureau. Korolev was a designer in the design bureau of prison, and he was not buried dead prisoners. But in the film Korolev worked as a gravedigger after 1940 (because the jailer has epaulettes on his uniform). IMHO, the filmmakers do not have deep knowledge about this part of history, and they can not make interesting movies.
