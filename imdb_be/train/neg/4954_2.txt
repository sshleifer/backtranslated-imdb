I was brought up watching the original Batman Animated Series, and I am an avid collector of Batman graphic novel. With the hero of comics as iconic as Batman, there are certain traits that can not be changed. Creative freedom all is well, but if it completely changes the character, it's too far. I bought one of the seasons «The Batman» in the hope that the additional bonus feature can shed some light on the creators of the arguments for the creation of this show such atrocities. In an interview on creating «The Batman», one of the artists or writers (I'm not sure which one) said, "We felt that we should not mess with Batman, but we could communicate with the wicked." So , they continued to make the Joker in an immature little kid begging for attention, Penguin in some anime forgery, Mr. Freeze in the super-power value of the thief, poison ivy teenage hippies, and countless other shameful actions that make Bob Kane roll over in his grave. <br /> <br /> In summary: I would like more hands, so that I could give this show FOUR THUMBS DOWN. He squeezes my rating to 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the name of Batman. Warner Bros ... to rethink this! Please!
