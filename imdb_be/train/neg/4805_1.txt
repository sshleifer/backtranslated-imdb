I loved Adrian Kari before the show. I thought she was great on Top Model and was very happy when she won. I also liked Chris Knight, it looks like a great guy. But this only shows me SICK! I'm so angry at both of them for what happened on the show. I do not care that they were of different ages, I know that age can not come between love. But Adrianne, you've been together for only seven months. It did not surprise me that he was not offered. And I do not see the appeal to force someone to marry you before they will be ready. If it's meant to be, then why not just enjoy each other's company and love one another, and let it come naturally? The transformation of an engagement ring in a ball and chain were unnecessarily, it is obviously silly that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, are not you ashamed for breaking down and offer her all the same! You've been through two failed marriages, as you could break into another just because it fit the camp? I hope the relationship lasts, but I really feel that the marriage has been delivered, and for all the wrong reasons. Maybe now they can rest and find the right reasons to be married within a marriage.
