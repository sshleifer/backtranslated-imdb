This film blowing - let's take that right now. There are a few gems scenes covered in this heap of shit, but no one can redeem the slack portion. Farrell looks like Brad Pitt in "12 monkeys" and operates in a similar manner. I usually hate Colin because he is a fairy as a whole, but it's all right in this film. There were two storylines this film = one of a child who is throwing stones through windshields moving vehicles, and one of a woman with a mustache. Let's face it- this film has no fucking idea what he wanted to say, or where he wanted to go. Characters storylines intertwine at some levels, but in no way deserve to be included in the script. All this is a weak and pointless, and then there is the occasional scene OK. Overall- but do not bother if you do not like the Irish accents are so many that you can watch mediocrity, and saves all sound like Lucky Charms Elf -an American fetish that catapulted some really crappy movies to success.
