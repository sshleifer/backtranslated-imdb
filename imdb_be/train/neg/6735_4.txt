The best thing I can say about this movie is that it grows well. This does not fall flat. On the next best things that support the performance of the actor playing a nifty bride to be Edward, always amazingly Holland Taylor and actor playing the husband of Taylor. Actor helps criticize potential Messing uniforms in the early stage brings wonderful absurd-but-winning quality to the proceedings. Well, that about it on the positive side. <br /> <br /> Dermot Mulroney, whom I love much more believable expressing contempt for messing up than in any place where he is trying to be a business or support. As already others, he noted, seems to have no emotional investment in this enterprise, besides wrapping it as soon as possible. Messing, on the other hand, sincerely trying to carry the film and create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. It is enough to do it, but it's just not strong enough actress to pull it all off without assistance. Give her a «E» for the efforts and «C +» to achieve. Given the indifference Mulroney, the one thing that might help would be brilliant Messing Cavalier Irons-of Esquire performance by an actor playing her ex-fiance, Jeffrey. Instead, its weak performance, mewling and irresponsible. <br /> <br /> If I tried to analyze this further, I would obviously pay more attention than most of the people involved. It's harmless enough, to pass the time if you do not have anything to do, and less unpleasant (and less creative) than The Wedding Singer, but you are much better to watch "The wedding of my best friend" again.
