It can only be described as awful. It is bad to begin with, and then becomes even worse. When you start, you really have to look it over because it was impossible to believe that it could get worse - but fear not, because it does. Another poorly written script for the donkey's director for non-talents descendants of past movie stars. It is difficult to decide if a scenario worse than the actions or directing both worse. As for the character - it is a good belt for all, including one scene where he beats the living daylights out tough staggered open cabinet doors and smashing it against the window with him. And in another place he gets thrown through the window and falls 20ft onto concrete - not even blink - then immediately gets up and get stuck in the villain. This is a really funny movie. Luckily it only cost me $ 1 for rent.
