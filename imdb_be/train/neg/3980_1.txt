No, I'm not kidding. If they ever propose the idea of ​​the film, they have to be thrown out of the studio. I'm serious. Their films in the same way in everyone, and they consist only of visits to overseas locations, with the problem that they are easy to solve, in the hope of being popular and getting new boyfriends. Think about it. If you've ever seen the movie starring them with other subjects, please contact me and tell me your name. These "movies" poor excuses to be on TV and go to other countries. There is a reason that movies never go to the theater. I am sure that, when they were really young and did some suitable film, some studio boss bought all the rights to 15 years, or something, so that now, when they are, what, 17, they can make films in other countries, if they want to use the money the studio. Let me tell you, stay away from Mary-Kate and ASHLEY! It's for your own good!
