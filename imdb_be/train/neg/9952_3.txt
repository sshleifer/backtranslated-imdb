Just e-mail a friend who is in film school about this movie. Something to avoid when making the film - the characters are meaningless ranting, overwrought, confusing monologue on the screen, which ultimately banal and unconvincing. If the film is an attempt of social realism, these verbal barrage so over-the-top that they actually draw attention to the film, built in the film and it is the intention to neutralize effectively. Whether it's action or script that bad, or both <br /> <br /> The main character is also very incredible for social realism - greed consuming canonical English literature and the Bible while high, or hangover and is able to produce such a deep babble monologues while intoxicated? And so unsightly, dirty and harmful nature of words able to sleep most of the women he meets in a few minutes when confronted with them? (I had to applaud when one chick finally threw him into the street, despite his whining and self-banter unfortunately). <br /> <br /> The viewer encounters pretentious references to ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the Book of Revelation, the doom of mankind, in the form of a barcode printed on our foreheads or right hands stuffed in the biblical way, submitted to the character, which is about as deftly exposed in the role of guardian of empty space. <br /> <br /> The film script is finished and over the top. - melodrama awkwardly laced walking "philosophy" of the meaning of human life, etc. It is trite, overwrought and tedious <br /> <br /> There are some very small British movies are available with the same content of the film. "Do not swallow" is excellent, much more exciting excursion to the lives of people in such a social environment. The same applies to "The Warzone." And although the comparison is not even justified, to check something Peter Greenaway, who is much more elaborate It handles the dialogue, wit and absurd characters and situations.
