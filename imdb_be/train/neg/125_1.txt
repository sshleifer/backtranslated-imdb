If only to avoid this kind of film in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment, but says no convincing stories. <br /> <br /> One can feel virtuous for sitting through it, because it affects so many important issues, but it does so without any discernible motive. The viewer takes no new points of view (if you do not come up with one, and his mind wanders, as it is bound to do this senseless film). <br /> <br /> You can better spend their time looking out the window at a tree grows. <br /> <br />
