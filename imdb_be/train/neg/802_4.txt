Like many other media experiments, this amateur effort to contain the seeds of a very interesting social comment. In 5+ years since it was released, the room was made less outrageous real events in the world of software development, and I found it less sad than the previous commentator for this reason, I believe ... The director is clearly a supporter of Hitchcock, and this too bad that the film has not been made better, but in fact, it is almost a parody of fiction, including the soundtrack of screeching at us when we have to pay attention. You can almost see the exclamation marks and capital letters on the yellowed page. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I found it quite exciting for all these reasons and more. Sometimes the stain has less to offer us, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for educational purposes. Oh yes - and even if the seams are shown and creaked a lot, my pulse went up, and I did not want to get up and take a break.
