This film is more ghostly than ever, using an alarm actor looking like Walken to play in this part of the stuff to make it look like he did not have anything better than playing a sad role, like this one! And the fact that the film was to be about some kind of a witch, and you really do not see that until almost the very end of the film, and yet, you have to sit and watch this dull film while it receives, or trying to get to the meaning point, and you have to go through this whole sad trail of actors and actresses, thinking all the time, you have passed another movie and decided on this and you just waist your money just doing the whole point of useless time sitting there. I prefer to watch cartoons to good use. Let alone this one, please!
