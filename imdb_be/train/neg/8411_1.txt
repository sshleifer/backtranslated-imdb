We expected something big, when we went to see the bomb. It is basically a Broadway play put on film. Music clearly awful. There is no single memorable song in the film - I heard some hits from this film? You will not, because they do not exist. Some of the musical numbers are so long that I got up to go to the bathroom and get some popcorn, and it's still going on when I come back! If they were good songs well - but they suck. The pace is slow, terrible character development. Lead was praised for her singing, but it sounded like she was crying every song - it was almost impossible to resist. This film has nothing to offer anyone but diehard enthusiasts Broadway. This is without a doubt the most over rated film I've seen in my life. Complete waist of time and money. There's nothing memorable about this film, other than Danny Glover - who was not on the screen is sufficient, and whose character was not developed enough. Video Rent and you'll agree - this film was expensive, over production, polished dog to do.
