Semana Santa jaw-droppingly bad. This is so wrong in so many ways I do not where to begin. So let's see ... Mira Sorvino, who judge her husband had been shot, protecting it goes from Madrid to Seville for his police work. During Holy Week (Semana Santa, see? ... everything starts to fall sleep..told he was bad in many places, even from the beginning), the assassin performs its victims, like bulls in a bullfighting arena. It combines with the male chauvinist pig Olivier Martinez and good Feodor Atkin. She soon discovers that she is the next target of the killer (who wears a red robe). Why, oh why, but <br /> <br /> why .. the entire movie was in my head is questionthat <br /> <br /> Q: Why go to see that A: Because I am. love Mira Sorvino (I even forgive her for that at first glance shit) <br /> <br /> Q: Why we were only 8 people in the theater this Saturday at the end of the first week of release? A: ah, ah ah. Spider-Man got relaesed on the same day. . But the fact that the movie was a blast from the disgusting review <br /> <br /> Q: Why is this movie was made? A: The money I think. But the boy did the world need money. <br /> <br /> Then ... why ???????????? first of all, there's always something wrong with the European co-production. Here you get a French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish production. hoo-ha. <br /> <br /> Then he wants to play on the same playgroung as American thrillers / crushing / whodunit / puzzles / whatever. Even Valentine, though unnecessary and bad script and shot, was much better in suspense and fun. <br /> <br /> Then, to give some credit to the story, the writer would like to add some political view of history is wrong: made in flash-backs in motion, as the pictures, it is certainly the most interesting I n the film. Can have a stick to him, he would not have to sit through the entire movie. It is better to go directly to the spine Guillermo del Tros in the Devil (El espinazo del Diablo) for some smart fun. <br /> <br /> Then homophobia. Unknown! The first victims of S & M addict gay twins who received stab. Irritating Olivier Martinez comes to a dating agency conducted poorly shaved overweight transvestive with whitish platinum wig. It causes the character Mira Sorvino in a large dam permanently. Do I need this kind of things we? Nah. Total useless offensive remarks, as well as ol'times. <br /> <br /> Then the unknown. Yipee. It is not obvious motive. The first murder of a mere illusion, how they view the famous painting. But no. And the discovery of the killer (a terrible fascist, of course) can be done from the outset, as it appears at the end of the film, as I think it was time for the director to say "swirl time to finish that damn movie. let us now reveal who the killer is and why he kills. " <br /> <br /> Then the director thinks he is the director. Wrong: there is no feeling of uncertainty, it makes no sense to send the actor, not knowing the tempo change. Giant mega-depression. Scenes of Holy Week excess (perhaps usually co-production, saying :. OK to shoot at Seville, but show some creditsof this beautiful and historic city with the celebration of Easter There we MYSTERY film for tourists!) <, Br /> <br /> Then the actors . All grievances. Mira Sorvino bored himself to death: it does nothing except practicly getting stabbed in his right hand. All what she did best (replace Killers', Powerful Aphrodite ...) was like they never existed. Olivier Martinez ... Hello, anybody there? If manufacturers will realize that he is not an actor, but a dummy, without the possibility of speech, no feelings? Feodor Atkin, soft and translucent. But we pay a lot of respect for Alida Valli, one of the greatest actresses of the last century (and I hope that a few more roles in this current). She TX main attractions here, as it is the only one to give life to his poor line. I will not talk about other actors, they are only one-sided characters, uninteresting and shallow. <br /> <br /> incoherent direction inconsistent actors, improbable story. . The idiocy embodied <br /> <br /> Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
