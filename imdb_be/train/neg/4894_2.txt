Backup eternal boom shots useless, useless scenes that you find in this movie. In other words, it seemed to me technically poor. Musical diletantski bits sent (without synchronization to be used, dancing, after bad sync, bad actors and improvisation clearly from time to time, etc.). <br /> <br /> The film is long and tedious. In the end, he makes a few points and even less sense. <br /> <br /> There are some good ideas, though. Some of the comic elements are in fact effective, especially the opening scene. However, the film is getting worse and worse, so it is quite unbearable and impossible to understand until the end. <br /> <br /> In the trailer I saw a very dynamic, it is not so for the film. Then there is a mismatch between the trailer i present the film is something very close to a rip off.
