This film in a transient super-smart. This is a topic rhymes with every horror film ever made. Valentine makes ZERO attempt to be original. What is Valentine's anyway? This is a group of people giving each other the same flimsy messages that were given to the same people, a year earlier. There is nothing original in Valentine. <br /> <br /> I have seen him only once, and this is one sight here are some of the films thwarted. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4.Any other horror movie in which someone kills someone. <br /> <br /> I know that there are more, but my mind is slowly turning into a puddle of silk so they could not grab them as fast as they came. <br /> <br /> Valentine did not have a chance to be a good movie. How every horror film must have «Suprise» killer, people do not care about that, because their emotions turn every other scene. One minute a good girl turns into evil B - h, it is a dangerous woman, and so on and son on <br /> <br /> As a general rule, any horror movie (in my book) can be saved with blood ,. again Valentina does not have this. It was as if they tried to make it PG-13, but it did not work, so they have left the editing. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this too inspired, rip-off if you hate yourself and you want to die. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
