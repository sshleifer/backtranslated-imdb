I like watching Jerry as much as the rest of the world, but this is a poor excuse for a soft core porn movie unnecessarily offensive, does not have anything like the mind, and serves only as a means of self-promotion for Springer. Despite the fact that passes quick 90 minutes, the film drags ugly, and I had to have the good sense to get out. Just disgusting.
