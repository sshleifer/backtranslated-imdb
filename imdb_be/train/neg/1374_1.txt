Man, it was fun. It must be a comedy. Or STUPID. This would make the understanding that a bunch of stinking it was much easier. Seriously? I want anyone associated with this film tased, effective immediately. For anyone who thinks watching this "movie", let's go through a few plot. Oh, wait. There are not any. There is literally no plot. I think Wang Ding was bored and decided to make something with some random somebody, and by some miracle, he somehow got on videotape. This movie is literally the worst movie of all time. You do not believe me? Go look. Do it, man. Try it. But be prepared to gouge your eyes out. If you can sit through it, without destroying the cow, you are very strong and courageous.
