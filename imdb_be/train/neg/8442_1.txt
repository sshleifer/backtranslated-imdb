GUERNSEY (Maria Krakman - Belgium / Netherlands, 2005). <br /> <br /> mouse Maria Krakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties, who discovers her husband (Fedja van HUET) is cheating on her, but she doesn 't dare to oppose him. It avoids painful confrontation with people, her parents and her sister, so we have the main character in the film, which does not at all. We hardly know anything about its origin or motivation. Just a woman who seems to be stuck in a dead end, not only during this painful episode of his life. She apparently suffers from something, but why do we have to suffer in the audience as well? <br /> <br /> I'm pretty disappointed in the movie after watching this unwatchable mess. It was a very dull and painful 90 minutes. I usually try not to waste energy on a bad movie. I'll take the beating and roll with the punches, but in this case, fair warning on the spot. How can Nanouk Leopold obtain financing (a large part of the assets financed by the state) for that turkey? Obviously, there was no script to speak off. This can be offset by the brilliant filmmaker of cinematic ideas or gypsum with just a little more attractive. No better or worse, just a vague concept, "I do not want to do something with the point of view of women." The result is an insult, not a tribute to the female point of view on life. <br /> <br /> To make things worse, so not interesting picture can be found in the whole film. I can not think of a cast that could sharply this, but Johan ter Steege is (little) light in the dark, if it is possible with this severe lack of material. I try to imagine how Leopold tried to send Maria Krakman: "Mary, look at the horizon, we will shoot you in three minutes, just to express sadness" The perfect cure for insomnia Get a copy and watch it late at night, and are guaranteed to deliver.. you to sleep. <br /> <br /> Camera obscura --- 1/10
