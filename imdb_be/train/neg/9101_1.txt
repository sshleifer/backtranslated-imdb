This movie was like "The Disney Channel After Dark". Take out the "do not we naughty" language and themes, and you are left with the dialogue and plot devices that insult the intelligence of those who does not describe the "Saved by the Bell" as TV quality. Dialogue so ridiculously templated and deliberately contaminated, you might think the script was a product lock Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in a room with an order to produce an amalgam of every bad scenario every had ever had a hand in creating. If it is the intention of Roger Kumble, mission accomplished.
