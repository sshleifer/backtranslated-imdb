Unfortunately, the greater falls than rises. The site was pretty decent. I do not mean anything out of the ordinary, but it was the story, unlike other modern horror films. Another good thing was cast. I'm not saying that the action was good because it was not, but every actor / actress was hot and attractive. <br /> <br /> One of the downfalls is that the film will only become addictive after the first 40 minutes or so. The rest was pretty boring. The other down (or you could see it up if you want) is excessive nudity. All 4 girls topless for a few minutes, and all the guys showed their butts for a long time. This does not mean that I am against nudity, but it was a horror film, not a "Dreamers". <br /> <br /> If you are not desperate to see some guy took off his bathing suit and run around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl undress without cause, or you are a die-hard supporter Debbie Rochon, than it is a film for you. But if you are looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
