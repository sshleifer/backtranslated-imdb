This cult film one thousand nine hundred seventy-seven has two crazy lesbians (Sondra Locke and Colleen Camp), which appear in the house of rich secular Dr. George Manning (Seymour Cassel), in the hope of help in finding a place of residence, they can not find. But the two other plans in mind when they find out that George's wife is out of town, they will eventually take control of the residence, tying George, killing the boy delivery, destroying in one evening. An unusual and disturbing film, but there are only two to receive a reward in the same country as the film ends. Most either do not like or just get caught up in this funny movie about 30 minutes with him. In any case, some even consider it a cult. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
