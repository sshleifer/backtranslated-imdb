I can not say that I loved this movie very much.it has some funny moments, but do not seem able to make up your mind, whether it's comedy or drama.it does not really work as either.it too light in tone drama and the funny moments are few and far between.it also does not make much sense.things, seem to happen without any reason.and is also extremely convoluted.i I feel that they just did things as they were going.if they only have a little time to explain things, it might be better to movie.i said that the end was anti climatic, but these and would mean the rest of the film is actually building up to something, it's just sort didn't.it end, and it that.I do not think it's boring, actually, but, as I said, there's just no point. i'll give Winter Kills reluctant and weak 3/10
