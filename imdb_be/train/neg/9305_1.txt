Me and a friend rented this movie, because it sounds very good. But we were wrong. Firstly, the current .... wow ... the action was the worst consequences were very bad, and it seemed like a film college kid did. The plot was pretty good, but it would be done. The fact that the destroyed films, most of them were actors. The main guy was the worst actor ever ... it's a shame, I even called him an actor ... The only good thing about this movie was that it was so bad that it was interesting ... so if you want a good laugh to see him. ... but other than that ... stay away from this. I usually like B list of films and such, but this one ... I do not know how it was made, to even put on a video ... it's the worst one I seen..and I've seen some bad ones.
