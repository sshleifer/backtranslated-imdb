This film was probably inspired by Godard Masculin, f√©minin, and I encourage you to see this film instead. <br /> <br /> The film has two strong elements and those (1) realistic action (2) is impressive, undeservedly good photo. Moreover, what strikes me most is the endless stream of nonsense. Lena Nyman has to be the most annoying actress in the world. She acts so stupid and with all the poverty in this movie ... it's unattractive. Compared with the film Godard, intelligence has been replaced with nonsense. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that it follows from the differences in ideals between the French and the Swedish society. <br /> <br /> The film, its time and place. 2/10.
