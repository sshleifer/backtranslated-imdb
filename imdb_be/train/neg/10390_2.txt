I just rented the movie and watched to see what all the fuss. So that is the reaction to it. It is easy to see that this is a low-budget movie with bad actors. The main plot of this film about a woman to avenge her abuser. This concept, if done correctly can easily be very provocative film. Nevertheless, the film is not to shock or disturb me. I'm just bored. This film could easily be reduced to less than 45 minutes. All a lot of scenes, mostly there to fill the time, these scenes scenery and some of the scenes that I have described below. <br /> <br /> ************ Contains spoiler ******* ***** I believe that the rape scene entirely manual. I do not know, when I saw the cut and Uncut version, if there is in fact such a theory. I also found a lot of plot holes in already poorly written story. Here is a list at the top of my mind. <br /> <br /> Why do not rape rapists Jennifer during the night, when she came out of her house to find out what that noise. It would be a great time. <br /> <br /> Why do not they just gang rape her, rather than to delay some of the rapists enjoy and extending Jennifer tests for such a long time. This is likely to be more shocking and disturbing way. <br /> <br /> I've found that it's really silly that rapists left her in the woods, and headed back to her house. Perhaps to show that these rapists really degenerates. <br /> <br /> These rapists should at least be aware that if you want to do the dirty work properly, they should not send a coward imbecility to do the job. <, Br /> <br /> Jennifer Why not call the police if rapists finally left? What should be the first thing that pops up in the minds of most people, especially for those who is the author. <br /> <br /> Why do these rapists smell danger of miles, when they saw Jennifer's alive? <br /> <br /> I think it is really strange that the slender lady, Camille can lead a man up a tree and hang him. ************************ Ends spoiler ************ <br /> <br /> But hey, it the film is not without its merits, Camille Keaton is great, and I get to hear one of the funniest lines I've recently heard of the protest when Matthew back into the house and kill Jennifer, `Why me? Why me, I do not even ^ m !!!
