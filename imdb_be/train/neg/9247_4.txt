"Bank" (1915, Chaplin) Â«Bank" was one from 1915 Essanay Charlie movies. Although these groups of films more watchable than their counterparts in 1914, it seems to be slightly below average. Gag cleaner with dual combo locked vault and tough luck ending that has Charlie wakes up from sleep, in which he stroked the lead lady hair, only to be stroked mop head, which he used as a quasi cushions are classic Chaplin moments. They both ironic beginning and end. Middle filled with a struggle with the enemy and destroying his partner as a janitor to a bank robbery in order to win the girl. Mop, probably the biggest physical support of the film and Charlie uses his expert comic effect, or while it is the intention of his character or not. Mop seem alter ego Charlie does what he wants, he could have done, but not with his own hands. Interesting stuff, but there are better.
