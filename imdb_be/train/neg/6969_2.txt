Blue Monkey (1987) and "Invasion BodySuckersÂ», as it is known here in the UK it was pretty boring horror film about an old man who gets bitten in the greenhouse for some mysterious toxic plant !!!! Man gets taken to the hospital, where the worm-like creature comes out of his mouth, of course, it turns into this monster insects and continues to go on the rampage !! Despite Reylsbek and John Vernon, being in the film, I found it to be a sad, flat predictable storyline, nya-interesting characters, cheap special effects and omissions !!!! Horror fans really do not need to monitor this rare film down, you will not miss a lot, believe me !!! I give this film 2/10.
