Carrie Fisher said on more than one occasion that she made this film in the period of her life when she was a difficult problem of cocaine, and she does not remember much. This explains why she made this film, but it does not explain why anyone else in the cast and crew made; I can not believe that EVERYONE had a problem of coke. This should be one of the absolute worst films ever, and that says something. The blame can not be laid at the feet of "director" Tim Kincaid or "writer" Buddy Zhovinatstso, since it is obvious that this picture was not written or directed by anyone. Apparently it's just spontaneously came together, as there is little evidence, consistency coherence, design, story, meaning mind or anything else. What is really surprising that some actual experts, who participated in this glop. Co-star Robert Joy did a good job in other films, and composer Jimmy Haskell and filmmaker Arthur Marks are industry veterans, Marks also having been a director and not a bad one. Why they got involved in this steaming pile of waste is beyond comprehension. Tim Kincaid, declared "director", made quite a lot of low-rent Sci-Fi & horror movies, and saw most of them, I can tell you that not one of them any good. This one, though, of course, the worst thing he has ever done, and that is a major achievement in its parts. Everything, absolutely everything about this film 12 bet - at best. Cinematography terrible acting ridiculously, that the "special effects" to make "Plan 9 from Outer Space" look like "Spider-Man," the story is banal, derivative and silly. Do not waste your time, even though the lid of the box video, not to mention his lease. Full, complete, annoying, overall rags.
