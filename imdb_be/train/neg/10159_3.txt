More wide-eyed, hysterical hyper-50s vitality that gives new meaning to antisocial, pathological behavior. Danza and Grayson leave you beg for mercy. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that all the people involved in the making of this film are now dead (or in nursing homes). I'm kind of thinking about suing them to torture. As the film began to unleash his shamelessly operatic aggressive attacks on my poor, defenseless ear drums, I felt an instantaneous, severe pain enveloped my whole being. It's a hell of a muscular vibrato can destroy Soviet tanks in small pieces, Nevermind glass. <br /> <br /> «Why do not you change the channel if you do not like it?", you may ask angrily. Fair point, a fair comment ... The answer is that I wanted, but the pain was so sudden and agonizing that I fell to the floor, writhing in agony. With my last ounce of energy, I tried to reach remote, but could not. <br /> <br /> A silly little fisherman with questionable talent singing with opera voice annoying found Nivnoe, which then proceeds to "pigmalionize" it. Lanza in love with asymmetric Grayson, but it predictably treats him with contempt, until they finally connect. This may seem rather thin plot, but this bustling movie is so full of singing and music, there is hardly any dialogue. This film inexorably. Forget about the torture of prisoners of war with the hippies and Killer «Reign In Blood» (both in the South Park episode). Whatever little talk among the stupid adults who parasitize this amazing 50s music world, it's all infantile - as if they were all 6-year-old claims to be an adult. I can only be jealous of people who find movies like this is ridiculous. Must be nice to be easy to please: that the world is a miracle will open for me, if I could enjoy any silly old gag is funny, gut-busting comedy. <br /> <br /> But let's look at this phenomenon, '50s music. My guess is that the 50th year musicals offered more dreamy idealists we look into utopia or heaven (depending on whether you are churched or Lenin's-tomb of the current), or, at least, very cheesy version of this fantasy inspired place. TTONO more like a representation of hell, but that's just me. I do not seem to "get" musicals. People say there is a story - but then an all-in-and-suddenly all start singing for 4 minutes, and then they suddenly die down, and then pretend as if nothing unusual had happened! If you think about it, musicals stranger than any sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, TTONO (my favorite kind of pizza, by the way) is not just a '50s music, but one of the operatic screeching. Opera is a proof that there is such a thing as overtraining voice - to the point where it becomes ear-piercing weapons, and not a means to attract the listener's satisfaction. The clearest example of this travesty if Lanets Grayson combine Dark Side of vocal power to really unbearable duo. I tried to reduce the volume. I lowered it from 18 to 14. Then, from 14 to 10. 8. Then I eventually reduce it to 1, which is usually so low that it is heard only by specially trained dogs and some species of marsupials, and yet I can hear the two bleating like donkeys! <br /> <br /> Take the scene in a small boat in the river. Danza starts with one of his deafening, brain killing melodies, and then ... nothing. None of the animals anywhere to be seen. Even crocodiles, which are mostly deaf, but still remained. If you look closely, you can even see the trees change color from green to yellow, within a few minutes. No, it was not a continuity error, it was plain old torture flora. And these trees were matte paintings only! Imagine how real trees would react. <br /> <br /> The reason the glass is broken when a high C poured from overweight stomach opera screamer not because of any laws of physics associated with waves and frequency, but because glass is the only man - hence, It can only take so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self-explosion. I can listen to the loudest, least friendly death metal band for a few hours, but give me only a minute soprano, and I'm getting a headache.
