I would like to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on television. I went to the Dream Factory to see him last night at 7:40. I'm sorry about that day wasted my ticket to the garbage when I could have seen with something better. The beginning was a lot of sex and trash clich√©s. They exaggerate the way love works in reality. All the girls were stereo types. The guy was too stupid for his age. Exhaust gases that a pregnant woman barely kept you laughing. A bank robbery was completely bored with the jokes that have been used in other films. Their escape vehicle was knocked old Chevy van, they claimed that there were no breaks. Hey, why do not they get a good car for the girl's robbery instead? This could raise the auditor's opinion of the film. This film was very low low low low low budget, since there is nothing was damaged or destroyed. This film had a lot of things in it that will drive Christian nuts. Hey, I even did not expect the car chase scene, because all the movies rob the bank have a car chase, but I do, but have never been there. Therefore, I appreciate this film would be indicating a low budget, and 1 out of ten stars.
