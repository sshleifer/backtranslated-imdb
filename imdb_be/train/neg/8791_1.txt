Be careful! <br /> <br /> This shit that other shit is not even deign to be in the company in order because it is beneath them! Well, there's a way, let me say something more significant. <br /> <br /> I saw Ashes of Time for a long time thinking that it was a fresh look at the material, which is based on the highly regarded tome Wuxia novel because of the reputation of being a film director Wong Kar Wai. Well, despite all that WKW failed to adapt the novel to the screen in accordance with a large number of fans Wuxia; mostly just shots of dripping water, balls sweats, legs of a horse running, etc. I could not sit for most of the film. <br /> <br /> Fast forward many years later, when I wanted to give Mr. Wong movies another shot, after listening to a lot of praise, especially from Cannes. I was intrigued by his latest, 2046. A friend told me to start w / Chungking Express, because it is his most accessible films. So it is not so! I was just PV I got tricked to spend their time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness. Some professional analysts mentioned as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern city, blah, blah, blah. It's all good, when the director has a point of view with something to say, why these things happen, and tell him. But no, it just shows that there is. Faye Wong's acting style is very typical Hong Kong: garbled diction, deer in the headlights of a wide eye expression, try to be cute and girlish hails the action; rest of the cast is equally uninspired. <br /> <br /> I think that the words, Auteur, is a euphemism for the director, who is trying something new and different, which is welcome, but not the one who has not yet mastered the art of cinematic storytelling, that Mr. Wong, in the last 17 years!
