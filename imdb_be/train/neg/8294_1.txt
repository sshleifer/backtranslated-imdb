There is something poetically just that dentists suffer. They do suffer in this sad, really terrible movie, but they make the audience go through pain, Sun Dental variety too. If you ever wanted to watch a movie full of screaming children, untrustworthy children, sick children, a lot of long, long meaningful looks, quiet wife and committed husband: it's all here for you. Dull, debts, he stands out as one of those examples that scream: why? There is a saving grace? Yes, there is. There is a short scene with Nabucco, with some pretty good singing. Save your money, or if it's on TV or cable, to save time. You can always read a book or to make an omelet.
