For all its visual delights, how much better the Renaissance would have been in direct action. Animation is fantastic in the big picture, yes, but the characters are cold and hollow, as well as the history and style of this film. With the real actors might film the world would not be so lifeless. There is plenty to admire here, but in the end I found that all I could do was admire. I did not enjoy the film, which is a lot, and it makes it clear that I have not seen before: the visual elements can be determined by the positive aspect of the film, but without a good story and strong characters, it can all be in vain. I will not go so far as to say that this film comes nothing, but sometimes comes dangerously close. I love the dark science fiction thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two movies I thought were fine. But Blade Runner was a tragic villain of Dark City and had their food for arc reflection of history. Renaissance has a shadow and light, but little else. I wanted to like this movie more, but weak plot and empty characters stood in the way of this. The Renaissance was a historic and artistic explosion of color and life. How ironic, then, that one of the darkest and most lifeless films I've seen this year takes its name from the Renaissance.
