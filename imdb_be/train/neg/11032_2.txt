«I Love New York» another entry on the VH-1 (MTV Networks) shows the entertainment side of the piercing familiarity, backward, women. It was a simple decision to take the boldest, Ebonics saying crazy contestants - and her mother - and give them a show on the network. Many argue, "the show." True, it's not as bad as the previous show, "Flavor of Love". - but it's just as bad, <br /> <br /> This reminds me of parody with a 90-show «In Living Color», where Keane Ivory Wayans simulated boxer Mike Tyson on «The Love Connection» dating show, and he chose "Robin Givens" today. Mike talked about how this date was in order, but as unpleasant mother kept the pole. This show reminds me of this. <br /> <br /> Men choose and give names to degrade himself and a woman that they love more - (I think smart people looking to date an intellectual woman would not let her - and her mother - to give you the name, which is so ghetto, you'll embarrass yourself every time you appear on TV.), but they are professional actors reality, so why bother. <br /> <br /> He escapes me, to know that it is so entertaining about all this. The fact that it is a fake as her new embedded supplement? 15 minutes of fame, and hundreds of thousands of dollars at the time of the ad network? (. Well, you can not hate them for it to make a buck) may be surprising - who would want to be with this woman last hour? Or wondering if she and her mother the next show will be at the WWF! In any case, one may say, is a train wreck you've seen countless times before this, and now the shock value down to zero. <br /> <br /> A lot of turn or U-turn will make it more interesting train wreck, or no different than any of the others. Appeals to the lowest common denominator, and for those who are calling for "the end" in a reality show, it's just another nail in the coffin, why they should end immediately.
