We are not in a fairy tale of the naked emperor. We confess the truth about what we see, not stupid, I confess that it shows in many aspects simply incomprehensible, and that it is clear that much of this was created with pure intuition without a real concept. <br /> <br /> Well, apparently a lot of people as a material. I do not. I prefer a well thought out and planned for the show. And I confess that show many serious for my taste and sad ... those love stories and drugs ... There are so many interesting soaps with a lot of uncertainty (Dallas, for example), but Twin Peaks can not catch my attention . I do not care about those people, except for Cooper and Gordon Cole.
