I'm glad I saw this movie once Mr.Sandler became famous. <br /> <br /> This is bad .... bad, bad, bad. There is no plot. It's like watching a home movie painfully boring. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy his other movies ...... but if you're a fan like me .... stay away from this. It can change your thoughts to Adam. You may never recover from the horror that is this film .... I had the best time watching old people play scrabble in the house .......
