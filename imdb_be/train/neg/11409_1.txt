Indeed the early 80-ies the tendency hideous violence masquerading as a "horror movie". I was the target audience for this disgusting piece of trash, and I was disgusted then, as now. <br /> <br /> Oh, where we start. Let's look at the settings: You can return the people to live where they died a violent death. So ridiculously weak premise is an excuse to carve a man in terrible ways, because, well, it is necessary to bring them to life! It might have worked when he played for the black top laughing a la Re-Animator or something. But no, he played straight. There is a whole family terror in the car, which gets hunted down, one of the few scenes, at least where their demise excluded screen. However, almost everything else on the screen. There is actually a scene where a young girl who goes along the beaten and killed by a zombie townspeople who all shoot him and grinning with multiple cameras. Then, there's a close-up of her face, as the filmmakers with love - and consumingly time - lapse photography to detect in her face beat to be cut down to the skull and reconstructed to look like a "normal" again. This is done, of course, on the slum Jack Albertson as the undertaker for all. He likes to drive around in an ambulance / hearse playing old tunes Tommy Dorcey, I think it should be nice. <br /> <br /> In the end, of course, even the sheriff of the undead and the doctor offers to gently correct their rotten hands. It is not clear why the sheriff from the second townsfolk killed the child with joy and slicing off their face, sticking needles in burn victims eyes, etc. <br /> <br /> It is interesting, very interesting that people see a show in the programmer, as it is to give it a rating at all. It's not scary, funny twists, and overall it's a kind of sick. It's not even very well done "to see it on a bet" or enjoy at the level you can watch a bad movie HG Lewis. It's just God awful rubbish, made for people who are on this type of senseless gore, and made people pay for slums. <br /> <br /> Sad that Albertson was even involved.
