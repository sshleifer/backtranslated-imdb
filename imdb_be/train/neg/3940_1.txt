This film is a joke and Quinton should be ashamed of themselves, trying to pass it off as a Modesty Blaise Film. If you are having trouble sleeping, then by all means this film. A figure they called the actress is suppose to be Modesty Blaise was in the most boring person on this planet. Maybe it can be used as a hat standing on the back seat of a real film.seventy-five minutes nothing thanks, who ever invented Forward button. If you see this movie, if you can call it that comes your way RUN. I can not help thinking that a third world country could have used the money wasted with this shit. this film is boring boring waste of actors of color in the air they breathe exhaust If you would like to see Mostey Blaise movie then watch the one they did in the 60s, maybe that should be drawn from the director.
