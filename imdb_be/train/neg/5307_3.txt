What happened? "Doubt" had so much potential to be a great film - but instead he paused to drag a simplified story line that made me want to stop watching. The only thing that the film will have been shine Meryl Streep for her, which is not a lack of deserved Oscar nomination. Although it was not one of her best performances, it still gives a solid and true character to us, which bloomed across the screen. <br /> <br /> However, even gloss screen legends can save this film from a trip down the hill. From the beginning of the boring, which had no power or hit - to less than convincing finale, the film was really disappointing - especially as it provides a great potential due to the promotion and trailers. It was obvious that the director had problems with the simplicity of the plot, and he finished with a sad film that lasts too long, too much talk and not enough action. <br /> <br /> In addition, other Oscar-nominations were less than convincing. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance, this in no way worthy of an Oscar. (Especially since they are completely left performances, such as Will Smith in Seven Pounds). Amy Adams does not deserve the nomination. Watching Amy Adams, like watching a cardboard box - as it was one-sided and simple. It would make more sense to appoint her to the Golden Raspberry as I'm sure she would have left a winner. Viola Davis gave a short, but true performance, but the length of her performance made me question that the Academy really had to give her a nomination. <br /> <br /> In general, I think doubt be one of the most disappointing films of 2008. This film was a mess with a lot of potential, and I do not recommend. The only bright light in the film, Meryl Streep, who, though gives a terrific, high performance - not even make enough to save the film. *** / 10.
