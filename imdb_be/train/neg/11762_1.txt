In South Africa, it's insulting to think that someone actually paid to produce this crap! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the director was one of the authors of the original Shaka Zulu mini is "complement" to a series of terrifying! The original series was based on the historical facts about the man who was a great strategist, a leader and a warrior. A person who plays a major role in shaping the history of the indigenous tribes in South Africa. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film, however, is nothing like garbage, scraped from the bottom of the barrel writer who failed to hit the mid-nineties. <br /> <br /> while Omar Sharif and Henry sat good actors that David Hasselhoff was doing to save the drowning of slaves with his red buoy and bleached smile? <br /> <br /> I kept waiting, blond, busty woman appears out of nowhere and run across the screen in their little red bathing suits, no reason at all. Not that it would have been some more bizarre than the bizarre story line that probably dreamed after 10 pints of beer in a fancy dress party, where someone caveman costume inspired the writer to return to the African theme for his next "blockbuster" .
