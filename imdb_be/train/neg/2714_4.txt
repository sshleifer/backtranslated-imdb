In 60 years (1999) D: Mark Payznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. mini-series NBC (later released on video / DVD as a full-length feature film) of such unexpected 1960 as seen through the eyes of both the white families and black families. The first half of the film is controlled by the higher work Dutton as the Reverend Willie Taylor and distributes the storyline between the families. Nevertheless, the nature of Dutton killed halfway and the black family is completely forgotten in the stupid, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. Rating: 4 out of 10. No rating (later rated PG-13 for video / DVD-release).
