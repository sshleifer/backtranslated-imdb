Tooth Fairy about the ghost of the old witch deformed, which causes the child to her home to receive the prize for their loose tooth, and then takes his life. The first few minutes to introduce you to the beginning of 1949 the legend of the tooth fairy, and then switches to this day. Worn horror story largely retained bodily actions. They could do without the brothers Hammond and a few other scenes, but overall Gore scenes were bloody, but which had to quickly minimize the effect. eye candy is pretty good for both sexes. The camera work is good. Dialogue is fair, but poor. I expected the film to be a bare-bones, low budget slasher with very few redemptive factors. I was surprised by the quality of the film.
