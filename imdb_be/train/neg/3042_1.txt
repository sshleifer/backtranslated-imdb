I am allowed to write 1000 words about this movie, but one word can be enough: enough. Hubby and I have not laughed so much as a simpleton in this truly dreadful film. We kept looking at each other with our best "What the ...?" Expressions. There is no way to adequately describe this film. Killer Tomatoes were funny, but it's just sick. What the mind produces images like these, then puts them on film for others to see? what the mind involves innocent children in this strange, wonderful movie, and then packs it as if it's suitable for children? Parents, what do you do when your child still believes in Santa do not let him / her to see this movie Preteens can watch it -. ve agodna with "What ...?" expression on their faces. If you decide to put this film on the other, you may want to spike their eggnog. <br /> <br /> It may be the worst movie kogda ever done.
