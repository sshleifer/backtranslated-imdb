I liked it, but I think that may have been pressing at the same time. This adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is completely unpretentious, formulaic romcom saved from a direct to video shame upon its release in a sharp turn Janeane Garofalo. Playing Frasier pets, she finds herself caught in a love trap, when uncertainty leads her to convey her best friend (Uma Thurman) on how she is when you come-Courtin '. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting film in the fascinating career of Ben Chaplin. Average British actor, he gave the Hollywood treadmill shot with this film. He was unremarkable and Anonymity in the studio is not surprising on the basis of this, although he appeared in significant cameos in later films by Terrence Malick. Uma Thurman doing ditzy turn on autopilot and Michael Lehmann packs all this competently. Icky phone sex, though. 4/10
