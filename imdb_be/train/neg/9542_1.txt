I do not know what else to say about this horrible movie that has not been said. Honestly, I'm just very angry. I should have known better when I saw the title of this movie, that would be horrible piece of shit, but I loved war games, so I can give my whim. I will live to regret that decision the rest of my life. From the very beginning, when the government people explained that their super computer can determine who the terrorist was only by how well they played video games, I knew that I was in during the trip, although the land-good-and-forget writing. The list is very, very, very bad storylines, dialogue and action I would have smashed so long IMDb, if I tried to send it. For those people who say they have seen worse movies than this, please tell me. I'm really interested to see something that can exceed this steaming pile of horse manure.
