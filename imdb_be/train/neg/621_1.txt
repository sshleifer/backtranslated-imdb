Holy @ #% & this film was still warm and juicy pile of it was done. I tried to watch that pile of festering waste, but it was easier to cut my wrists and bullets Shooter ago Lysol floor cleaner than experience, more than half the crap that was on my screen. I rank it well below anything I've ever watched a movie or TV, and then say something. Once I witnessed the cow shit in the field. I watched a steaming pile of half an hour, who knows ... can be moved or something. Well, that was the time better spent than watching this tripe. Act did not exist, the plot was somewhere other than on the film. I think I saw a cut seen in the early stages, where the plot is able to escape and was riding away in the background on the back of an old pickup truck heading to Portland hoping to become a Stephen King shi77er. Tell me, please, the director receives medication he so desperately needs. It's pretty clear that he needs heavy medication and I'm ready to cash required for its reversal lobotomy. Bah ... I can not give this review the full impact they need, because none of this disease can never be done justice in typed words alone. Let me say that if you are looking for a swing pass for a while, and you see it Chilton at the front, walk to your car, start the engine and then stick both your fist directly into the fan, until he can not feel your bones vibrate more. Make sure your purse in your hand because you are going to spend the money anyway. You might also have the privilege to spend it on their own. <br /> <br /> By the way, I watched it after a "friend" of mine sent his girlfriend, so I can see. It dint come, she should too. To make matters worse, she had to see this @ $% & thing twice! I heard them married now, and he gets to visit him once a month an egg. I hope that it was because of this film.
