As a big fan of horror movies, especially J-horror and blood, I thought Nekeddo burâddo sounded pretty good. I researched the story, read the reviews, and even looked at some pictures to make sure it seemed like a good bloody and scary movie to see before downloading. So excited he finished and ready to be scared and recoiling in horror strange gusset I expected, I was terribly disappointed. The plot was ridiculous and did not even make sense, and left too much unexplained, gore was fun, then horrible, and it was a cartoon style of sound effects? The action was, perhaps, the only thing that slightly scary about it. I did not understand the idea of ​​the cactus and the way the mother's husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after the flashing light after they left both pretty inexplicable, or maybe I missed it, my mind could not understand what I actually saw. I appreciate, as it should have been; Shocking and several scenes (strange cannibalism and mother kissing?) Of course, there were, I just think they went a little far away and not even in a terrible way, they have made it unconvincing that made it more likely to be a comedy, but what horror on my opinion. However, this is a very interesting film and got a lot of laughs and a couple of my friends, but, unfortunately, we expect that the horror comedy entirely so it is worth looking at the entertainment value, but do not wait for dark, deep and terrible, terrible film; You'll just be disappointed. If this were a horror comedy / parody I would probably evaluate it at about nine, the culmination be amazing scene when her husband got into the belly of his wife and her wounds closed, but as fear, unfortunately, I gave him one.
