In order to get ahead of this review, I must say that I was, I guess, a little bit curious about this movie .. However, I probably would not have seen it if I had not twisted my arm lightly. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this film shows how depraved a person can be. In my eyes, the worst in all of this phenomenon Springer is not the type of people to «Jerry Springer Show» to act the way they do (which in itself is highly reproachable), but many people are so curious and pleased to see them and hear about their lives (yes, I suppose that includes me .. to any extent this is true). If not glorify this kind of behavior (as some say), at least we can be subtly corrupts the mind and / or desenstizing themselves to this type of behavior. <br /> <br /> But enough soap dish (sort of), Here's the skinny: the film has the R rating, and while he may deserve only that (I turn away in some scenes, so I'm not quite sure), I feel that NC-17 (hat tip to another reviewer) might be a bit more suitable for the vast sexual content (a cynic might comment that the film was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen). The plot is very strange, tying together the story completely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks care, which will appear at various Springer show. In the end, the film leaves one with some resolvement- and Springer rhetoric about the need for us to see the real world (apparently, as is evident from his show). I agree with him there- it's important to know how the world really so that we can strive to make positive changes. Having said that, let me say, you are a pretty bad- sight in the world newpaper news or seen, but let's not shell out good money to support the kind of sensationalism and possibly formulaic titallition Springer strives to give us.
