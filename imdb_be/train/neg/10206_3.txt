From director Barbet Schroder (twist of fate), I think I saw a little of this in-class media research, and I found the lead actress, so I tried it, despite the rating from critics. Basically, a tough guy Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling Half Nelson) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt Bully) combine to kill a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it by finding them without the police. Investigating the murder is murder detective Cassie "hyena" Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with a new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), which are quite puzzled by evidence found at the site, for example, entirely related hairs. I do not think that this plan will be completely goes well because Cassie and Sam is really quite fast in the Richard and Justin as suspects, it's just a question of whether they can swing them. Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn, Ray Feathers, R.D. Call the captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as the Asst. DA Al Svensson. Now I see the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Rope with the murder of a call things, but this film makes it very foolish, and even not good enough Bullock can save him from the boring and predictable. Adequate!
