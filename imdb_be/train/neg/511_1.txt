I was one of the very few additions to this big bomb. I just happened to be in the right place working security for the racing scenes in A.I.R. as it was to know how to back then.Thank goodness of my scene in the first few minutes of the film, and I do not have to sit through the whole thing. It was more than a great party set but hey, the payment was good.Attention to detail has not been a strong point for this, but who was going to know.The curiosity saw the car in the track at a very slow speed and then accelerated in the film before that was close to the normal speed.A lot of scenes were changed as they were taken, I believe, to shave costs and time.But everyone had a good hour, who cares!
