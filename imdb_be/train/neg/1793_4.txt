An interesting concept of vampirism have something to do with the virus. (But done several times now) On the whole, the film is too long and pulls a little. Editing can be tougher. I'm sorry to hear about the problem with the loans. Maybe the film was delivered to the market. The lighting was too dark in places. But the worst technical problem is audio. Level was enough to hear the dialogue is good, but many interiors are echoes of the sound on them, which is very distracting. Either they were not careful in recording or mixing the sound could be better. In addition, too much background noise was. We had to get someone to make sound effects for the martial arts scenes. Tinny clang of swords that hit just was not the sound of an epic battle. Especially in the action scenes editing to be tougher. <br /> <br /> In addition, the action was a bit flat. I'm sorry, but if I see that the same person wrote and stars in the movie, in my experience this is a red flag. <br /> <br /> But it was a good effort, so I gave it a 4.
