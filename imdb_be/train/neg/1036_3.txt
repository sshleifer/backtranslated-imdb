Ho-hum. (Horst Buchholz) the death of the inventor biological weapons is in danger of falling into the wrong hands. Unconsciously, his son (Luke Perry) works on antidotes together. Enter a CIA agent Olivia d'Or and the cat and mouse chase and shootout begins. Also in the cast are: Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and aging Roger Moore. Moore seems, haggardly traffic through this mess is certainly not one of his best efforts. Perry fans will take. d'Abo is wrong for the role, but it's nice to look at.
