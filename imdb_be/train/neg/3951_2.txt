1980 film Ulli Lommel «The Boogey Man» not a classic, but it is higher than the average low-budget chiller that is worth seeing. Continued, 1983s «Boogey Man II», is ultimately a waste of time, but at least it's an entertaining one if do not take the least bit seriously. Now II left the door open for another sequel, and I for one would not be inclined to see that at least one more. one day when I was looking at a video store in the mall, I came across a movie entitled "Return Boogey Man. When I learned that this was a continuation of bake ednih films that I was glad to lay out a few bucks for it ... I should have known better. Although the title of the opening of "Boogeyman 3" is not a continuation of the two is far superior to the films that I have named above. Well, not exactly anyway <br /> <br /> Pros :. Ha! This laughter. Is there anything good about this piece of cow dung? Let's see ... he has a staff of «The Boogey Man» and, um ... it's mercifully short. Yes, that's about it <br /> <br /> Cons :. Where to start? Decisions, decisions. First of all, this film is a common hole. He moves from one scene to another without anything remotely interesting or terrible happens. Acting tough at best. "Actors", most likely, friends of the director, who had no acting experience at all before, and probably one of those times. The plot does not exist and poorly written script. Direction is just awful. The director tries to make the movie look all artsy Fartsy, making the movement of the camera around, flashing lights, and filters, but it adds nothing. Music dim and difficult to hear in parts. Due to the original failed. SUZANNA nature of Love was named Lacey, Sun Natalie! And the events are shown at the beginning of the original did not happen in 1978. In addition, if it is 3 in the title, why there is no mention of what happened in the II? Finally, it does not add anything new or interesting or series or genre <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts :. People who are behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of yourself. It's one thing if it was the original film, which was the first director and sucks. Instead, it should be a sequel to the film that is not a masterpiece, but it sure as hell is much more interesting and more interesting than that. If ever there is a sequel, which I doubt, it should forget about this one ever happened, and be treated with either myself or someone who has at least some idea of ​​how to make a decent film Lommel horror . <br /> <br /> My Rating: 1/5
