OK, as each pointed out that this movie is a complete dog. To some extent, this is because it was a bloody film, sexploitation was a lot of material is cut (or darkened to near invisibility) to avoid the censor X-rated; but the film has many other drawbacks as well. <br /> <br /> For starters, the scriptwriter, it seems, got it mixed up werewolves and vampires. The villains in this film fluffy and not like silver, but in all other respects they behave like vampires. Now you just can not do it with a lousy flick genre, you have to follow the rules of the genre or supporters get all confused and irritated by the suspension of disbelief in the wrong things. In fact, the whole (confusing and poorly presented) story that has already been done for vampires, but makes no sense in a werewolf movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, werewolf costumes are Lamest you've ever seen. No werewolf Kinobiznes should know that the werewolf costumes and transformation is what the fans appreciate critical, but some of these werewolves are just stupid. <br /> <br /> There are some few good bits. I actually really liked the bill. Others mentioned in tit Sybil Danning. And ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if such a thing can exist) <br /> <br /> I also really liked the plan of attack on the fortress of werewolves. There are so many horror films that rely on the characters behave stupidly, but in this case they first become very smart and efficient anti-werewolf arsenal and go kill the monster. I mean, you can kill a werewolf with a silver bullet, and we have quite a powerful firearm these days. It should not be too hard to put two and two, as well? But in a traditional style, this film is on top and adds some other very funny and amusing anti-werewolf weapons.
