I rented this movie because I was hoping that it will be one the whole family will enjoy. Despite the fact that the film is a family, my family did not use, because it gives a false idea about God. If you obey God and follow Him, you are not guaranteed success. Your football team does not always win. You do not magically get better grades. Infertility is not always cured. You do not always get a raise. Sometimes, you'll be stuck with the old car. <br /> <br /> God does not exist to satisfy our whims. Most likely, we were created to glorify Him. Sometimes we praise Him most of all, when everything seems to go wrong for us. Live Christ; to die is gain.
