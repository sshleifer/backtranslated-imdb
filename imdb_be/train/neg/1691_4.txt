This film is really nothing more than a well-crafted series of admittedly intense sequences interspersed with the inevitable "gotcha!" At the end of each of them. In fact, there is no character development and no real plot to speak. There is only the skeleton of motivation for the characters to do anything, as long as they are pulled forward to their inevitable doom. This is just an excuse to show the terrible specter of a child (who seems to have got some of the cat family mingled in his ectoplasm) and his mother a ghost (with long black hair hanging in her face kind of «The Ring») accept. down pile of cardboard expressions, two dimensional justification for the human characters <br /> <br /> This is the English language version of «The Grudge» is the equivalent of cinematic junk food; meet for a moment, but it is not really what you need to live on. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended.
