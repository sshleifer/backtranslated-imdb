I only had the luxury to see this movie once, when I was very young, so a large part of the film vague, trying to remember. However, I can say that it was not as funny as the movie called killer tomatoes and had the most memorable things of this film is the song, and the scene with the elderly couple to talk about the bad Temi. In addition, the film is really just a scene of small and large tomato tomato, ride and people acting scared and replays, as people have to do in a movie of this type. However, just having a really silly premise and catchy song is not good comedy does. Of course, this film should be a film B, nothing to be taken lightly, but you should still make jokes that are funny and do not try to expand gently amusing room into a full movie. Perhaps a short would be good as the trailer, which shows an elderly couple mentioned above, and a man desperately trying to gun down large tomato was actually very good. Trailer itself was similar to the layout of the trailer, but they really have not done a full movie, and rather weak in this.
