My friend was in a cast as an agent of the Feds (non-speaking part, as I recall). He brought it on DVD, so I could see it. It was "interesting", but really felt like a movie buff. Well made amateur film, though. In fact, a sad and poorly written. It was probably fun to do and be involved in, but it certainly does not deserve any wide release. Maybe they are in Omaha, but this California girl was bored and honestly kind of embarrassed for my friend's part. <br /> <br /> If this film maker has done or is doing any more films, he really should try to have a very interesting story and good actors. I'm sure it was a great learning tool for them. I wish them success in the future, and I hope that they can improve their film-making.
