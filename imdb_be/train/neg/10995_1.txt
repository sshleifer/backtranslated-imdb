Anyone who has watched Comedy Central around midnight in the last few years have probably seen the ads of this film. The first time I saw the advertisement of the film back in 2001 it seemed that it might be funny, but I was not going to call the number on the TV screen and to order it, not seeing the movie first. I thought I would wait until the film was not available for rent in Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> About a half year later, I was in Tower Records and Â«DVDS for less than $ 20" glass, was a copy of this film. Seeing that the DVD is only $ 6.99, I decided to buy it. I went home, put the disc in the DVD-player, and was waiting for a laugh to start ... and I waited some more. The laughter did not come. <br /> <br /> I would have to agree to almost any other comments on this page, when I say that this movie was terrible. Patients desperately bland, and poorly written and directed, underground comedy is a brutal piece of debris and in my opinion, the worst movie of all time. No stars.
