I've never been to Paris, but after watching the «Paris, Je t'aime» I am crazy to visit this city! I was in New York a few times and I love the city and its districts. I kind of expected to be moved by this film to feel, how to jump on a plane and fly there immediately, but, lo and behold, I regret the time and money that I spent with her. There's no love story between people or man and the city. There's a lot of meetings and dysfunctional relationships or people who know each other, and it just does not work properly. Perhaps this reflects the characteristics of the city, where he is said to have thousands of people who live by themselves. Can not you find love in New York?
