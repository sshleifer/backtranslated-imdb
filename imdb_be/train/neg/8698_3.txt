Well, I remember watching the first one, and boy did it sucks. After watching, I just laughed it off and said to himself: "Oh boy, just another low-budget B-movie. I will never see the part 2 to this. "Then, about 1 1/2 years later, came the second part. She sucked even more. But, I just laughed it off again and said, "there is no way I will ever see part 3 of this." Then, about 1/2 years later, part of the 3 came out. I was stupid enough to take it off, and boy, I just snapped after viewing. God, I never realized how many movies can suck these days. Just save $ 7.50 and do not rent the whole series. Believe me, it's worth every penny.
