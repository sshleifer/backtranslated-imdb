I first learned of Wendy many years ago in one of the "horror stories" book by Alvin Schwartz: according to the story, Wendy - after calling your name in the wind - pulls you together, and then pull up into the sky and crushes you. While this sounds like a rather bizarre concept, history Schwartz turned it into a fairly consistent message. <br /> <br /> The film "Wendy" no. It basically consists of every horror flick clich√©s: the family moved into a new house and strange things begin to happen, anyone who harms them asking for it, and it was better to listen to the old Indian guy. I've seen this stuff so many times that I did not bother to count anymore. <br /> <br /> In any case, avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey on "Malcolm in the middle") did much better than that.
