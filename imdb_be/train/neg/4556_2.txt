I do not know what the other guy thinks. The fact that this film was made by yourself does not make it less scary. You can be as big a believer as you want ... the majority of the film meaningless drivel. I feel that I was offended to watch the first 40 minutes of this. And that just was not a feat. Not only is the acting is terrible, but the plot is never even close to the development. There are countless holes in the story, to the point where you can hardly even call it a story anymore. I've never read the book, so I can not criticize it, but this is the first review I have written here, and this goal is only to save all you viewers out there an hour and a half of his life. I can not remember the last time I could not even finish watching the movie. This one really takes the cake.
