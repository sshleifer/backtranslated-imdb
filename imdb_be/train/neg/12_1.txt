All I could think while watching this film was the B-Class slop. Many have said that it is redeeming qualities, as this film reflects a realistic view of the impact of drugs and the individual and their subsequent spiral into the perpetuation of the status of unfortunate events. However, in reality, the methods used (as many have mentioned) were too often and therefore inconclusive and does not relate to the whole film. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it was dull, prosaic, implausible and confusing. You can read most of the other reports on this film, and they will speak in much the same way as I would like. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the actors and actresses are attractive, but, faced with such unfortunate actions ... looks can only carry a film so far. The action of the poor and intermittent: a few punches thrown here and there, and the final shoot-through. Nothing really to write home about. <br /> <br /> As we have already said, "BAD" movies are great to watch on the grounds that they are "bad", you will revel in this fact. This film, however, is invalid. It's nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, if one really needs in an educational film to scare people away from drugs, I would seriously recommend any number of other films, there advice such questions in a much more efficient way. «Requiem For A Dream», «Trainspotting," "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" and "the Candy" are just a few examples. Though one should also check out some of the more careless films on the same theme as "the Go" (in general, as a serious and funny) and "soggy". <br /> <br /> On a final note, one may redemptive line in this film, which was delivered by Vinnie Jones was stolen from "Lock, Stock and Two Barrels Smokling". To think that this great little film was discredited «Loaded» disgusting. <br /> <br /> Overall, I highly recommend that you save money and time by not seeing this movie.
