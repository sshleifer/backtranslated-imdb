Penn takes time to develop their characters, and we almost take care of them. However, there are some real problems with the history here, we do not see any real motivation for the behavior of the evil brother and fucked up time line. Possible to establish in 1963, the music of the late 60s / early 70s. Links and dialogue 70s / 80s. The potential for a powerful climax presents itself, and Penn allows it to slip. But even with all these difficulties, it is worth watching, but not great.
