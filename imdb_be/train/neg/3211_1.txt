And it goes directly into the category of "frighteningly bad" - that is, the film drunk students surrender, to get pleasure from. I was at the Film Festival of Sci Fi and all I remember is the wave after wave of hysterical laughter as the movie premiere. Other critics will better describe the faecal nature of this film, and I felt so bad about the poor from the production company, which has turned up, obviously, to evaluate the response of the audience. What he got was the equivalent of Sci Fi drunken student audience, and after the "serious" anime movie, I think it was "blue sky", the audience was in a gloomy mood, then this film opened, and after a few seconds, all the room was rolling on the islands. Bullets show inferior part; <br /> <br /> Scenario: The funny thing, and the worst part of this film, he clunks linear and predictable way sometimes poorly thought out to the side. Rubbish, but extremely funny <br /> <br /> Animation :. Poorly done, and put together, if you can put up with a uniform background and gradually skimpier costumes for the heroine (! I know I can), and then follow the assembly, where it «trasforms» from the Swedish peasant girl in LADY DEATH !!! <br /> <br /> Characters: Yes dimensional it painful, there is a short backstory (with side splitting lines of dialogue), and a little light shining from the real motivation of some of the main characters. <br /> <br /> So, in a nutshell, if you have an audience and a few drinks lying around (try and make sure they 're drunk to relieve pain), and then slide the film into the DVD and get in the thinking of the "mystery science theater 3000". There's no other motivation to watch this movie, but to laugh at him, and it should not be a comedy. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM YOURSELF. It could possibly be even more boring to watch solo, than the "New World" with Colin Farrell, as you will not be able to laugh at the absurdity of a friend or two.
