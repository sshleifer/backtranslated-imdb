Let me start by saying that I consider myself to be one of the few (most!) Impartial movie audience ... Movies are my passion, and I have a great regular at my local cult movie-rental place. ..I also feel the need to add that they often ask me for advice about a movie every time I get there, and I never seem to be able to leave the place without having a complex discussion and exchange of ideas about what is happening a cult-movie-zone ... I love to shoot the strange things, and that's why one of the guys in the cult-film-video-place.He this film was recommended told me that he told me was to see it, as well as a cover It says something about that movie with Jodorowsky (one of my favorites!) atmosphere, I take it. <br /> <br /> I gave a vote is not quite true, because I did not think it was awful, I just do not know how to evaluate it differently. The question mark would be more appropriate ... <br /> <br /> This is the first and only film that literally made me sick: I actually felt physically ill! I'm the only one whose stomach literally turned? Nevertheless, I do not want to disable it, or maybe I just could not, because I was fascinated in a nasty way ... <br /> <br /> I never want to see this movie again. <br /> <br /> not awful 1 I said.Just not my cup of tea (or WÃ³dka for that matter) ...
