I can not understand, with Al Pacino. I watched him in the Godfather, scar, Carlito's Way, and I think I see one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years. Then I see him in two for the money, every Sunday and the revolution, and I wonder what the guy thinks. <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon the revolution a few days ago, and I thought that I would invest it in the next two hours. Here's the news flash: You want to talk to the prisoners? Make them watch it again and again ... they'll confess to anything. <br /> <br /> I will not retell the story, because there is no single story, but it actually takes place during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated peasant, who does not want to get involved, but ultimately does. Despite the fact that he had no money, no education, and dresses like a cave man, very passionate Natasha Kinski Sun falls in love with him without good reason, since they have only two minutes to communicate with each other. <br /> <br /> To be honest, when "Al Smith" played a major role in this film, instead of "Al Pacino," it would ruin their careers. The script was terrible, but Pacino's performance and motivation obviously fake accent made it even worse. The role of Donald Sutherland was ridiculous. I really can not describe it. Natasha Kinski protagonist, but has 5 lines in the film. In fact, no one is saying a lot in this film. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest room in the movie, as Al Pacino and Kinski have this uncanny knack to constantly work with each other on the battlefield. It, like the rest of the North-East is a Starbucks. "Hey, it's ridiculous to have you here, in another field of battle ... 100 miles to see you in a few months." <br /> <br /> I have to give this one a star on IMDb, because there's nothing here for a negative assessment.
