If at least cruelty and elongated deaths were the goal of history to justify their inclusion, but the script was simply incomprehensible and just stupid. <br /> <br /> It did not go anywhere, the story did not have a legible continuity. It was just a bunch of meaningless elongated snuff scene and really stupid ending tacked on, as if to say .. "the end of * beep * you are my haters, and there are several defenders to see my garbage." <br /> <br /> I do not understand, masked killer who was never removed his mask in jail, prison rape scene that was suppose to be the guards raped aa ugly warped serial killer, and to be killed by them, and nothing more ? no explanation, no punishment, really weak police chief character that was a waste of an actor as a couple who did not attempt to from a guy who killed his policeman torturing a child, a woman and a dog, and sent them to you to look at the video. <br /> <br /> The cops, who for some unknown reason, all scattered in the dark by themselves (individually) in his farm house at night, like a bunch of poorly written characters teenagers who will be killed one by one, while a bunch of idiots and no one else can hear police, they die in the dark one by one and just keep wandering around for no reason, until one is killed in turn. <br /> <br /> pile of horrific real-life animal snuff scenes in the beginning without cause or explanation, he was recalled, he was watching him masturbate, it is a comedy for him ... what was it? Ball do not have a thought to throw it in animals upsetting .. anything fans. <br /> <br /> Then Pare judging word psycho path, to go to his family, when he kills himself ... more gullible, stupid cops you've never seen in the film. <br /> <br /> I do not know why I try not to hate his work. I'm trying to find some reason to explain the horror of the authors of art, but this stuff ... pure crap. <br /> <br /> Ball's what you do more? I hope you understand this, because I know a lot more deserving people who can not even dream to get the budget you get over and over again to make their films. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Boll really in his best finish «Postal» it was actually okay.
