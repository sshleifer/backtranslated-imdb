This film was not so bad when compared with the first two sequels to the original. It is directed by Martin Kitrosser Friday 13th of Fame. Actions are very bad indeed, but the gore and special effects help to make it interesting. That one I like Screaming Mad George (makeup artist for film effects), its effects are so off-the-wall, and surprisingly, they will keep you watching a bad movie just to see how crazy they catch, on film Indeed, not all the mountains, but there is a very unpleasant eyeball chew scene in the middle with a toy larva (what!?!) Mickey Rooney as a guest, that he probably was not too optimistic, but needed money at the time, perhaps? If you like a pervert 4th installment (my favorite of all the 5), you'll probably like this one. I liked it better than The Matrix! Enjoy.
