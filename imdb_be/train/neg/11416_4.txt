The fact that this film was entitled to the most successful film in the history of cinema in Switzerland makes me shake my head! That's true, but at the same time sorry. Click on the Swiss army could be much better <br /> <br /> The story sounds interesting, at the very beginning :. Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) gets forced to withdraw his military training in the army, while it is in a church wedding of his love Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter). <br /> <br /> The acting in a way not very different from only a few recruits drunk and stoned in reality. Melanie Uiniger plays its role as a strong Michel Bluntschi mediocre, I personally found it very annoying. <br /> <br /> storyline contains comedy combined with the romance that does not work as expected. Roman part is too bad, and part comedy is not funny, it's just a cheap attempt and does not change throughout the film at all. It's funny for preteen 12-13-year-olds, but not for such as those who are looking for an entertaining comedy. Humor weak for some shots except. <br /> <br /> Drug? Cool! Theft? Cool! If you want a proper Swiss comedy about the RS, make sure you do not loose their military training again, and even then we should not expect too much! <br /> <br /> I'll give it a 4 out of 10 stars because Marco Rome's pretty funny at the time of your screen. Nha hell of a time a lot of the screen, although
