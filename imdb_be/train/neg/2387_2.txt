I could not believe how lame and pointless it is. In principle there is nothing to laugh at in the movies, almost no scenes that you are interested in the rest of the film. The film pulled in some huge stars, but they were all wasted, in my opinion. I think Keanu Reeves must have taken some acting lessons through FEWS years after this film, before he looked at the matrix. Uma Thurman looked very simple and modest. Fortunately, I got this movie for a very low price because it is certainly not a film to remember for any valid reason. I will not say anything about the history of film to write, but you should know that it is meant to be the most famous hitchhiking across America because of her thumb. I would give this movie 2 / 10. Before I watched this movie, I wondered why this movie got only 4.0 / 10, and now I know why. Very disappointed with the film. Do not buy it, even if you see it for $ 5.
