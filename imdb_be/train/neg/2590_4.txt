American Pie went at a great distance from the first. At first I think that the actors do not have a clue what they are doing, and instead it's just a remake of the college party went nuts. History establishes two guys, a college freshman (with the participation of the young Stifler), which establishes the dream of attending college just to experience late night partying, sex and of course drinks. The plot is silly and follows the path of the original cake. In fact, they do not have another apple pie somewhere in the movie. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I work in a video store, and can rent free. But please remember that this is a waste of time if you do not use a mindless sex movies with absolute nudity and crazy drinking. I am a teenager myself and I think even Evan Almighty would have been a better choice instead.
