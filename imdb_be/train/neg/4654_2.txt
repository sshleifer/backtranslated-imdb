Female vampire kills young women and paint with their blood. She has an assistant who does not want to be a vampire, so he has to do what she orders or be turned into a blood sucker. After a few kills, assistant gets remorse and falls in love with a homeless girl. <br /> <br /> What can I say about this movie? This is his stimulation is more slow, that he has some strange sound effects (never bite sounded so strange) and the atmosphere (the new jazz here I come), and that does not seem to be included in a set of lights. It looks like a "filmmaker" horror film with all the self-sufficiency within. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely stupid and, as you can guess, it is a female vampire, which explains how to kill her, even if she doesn "t have to do it; Of course, crosses, light, garlic and sticks do not work. <br /> <br /> It's not even funny lousy movie. Perhaps with some friends and a lot of beer, it can not have its funny side (to be honest, it's funny for 10 - 15 minutes, closer to the end of the film). Do not be fooled by the label three is a bad film they represent.
