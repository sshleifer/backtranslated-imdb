This is the worst documentary film to come out of Canada, ever !!!! I am pleased to see that the guys did not make another film. All they want to do is to get the film made, and it should not be the one that they wrote. They are constantly changing scenario number of the person they are pitching. I could not get out of the theater quickly enough when I saw him at the Toronto Film Festival this year. Please never seen this movie.
