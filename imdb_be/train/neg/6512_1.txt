If there is no affinity to any type of film production, and health promotion documentaries, I can honestly say that I was angry at myself for trying to sit across "20 Dates" length. I will not waste my time with the story, you can read the other reviews. I will say though that the hyper Berkowitz, in the Woody Allen-style narration was very annoying. You either want him to lay off coffee or ingest some tranquilizers. And it's potentially obviously Berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea, as part of its tests in detail the financing of the documentary. Forgive me for concealing the icon, as a compliment, but I'll give Berkowitz credit for the fact that the skills to persuade some idiot to fund this horrible piece of ****. I appreciate the intention of the border & movie here, but even relatively Berkowitz sets standards for himself, he shoots and gets on all levels. In conclusion, I believe that many of these companions were ill at ease going out on dates with annoying filmmaker wants-to-be, so I question the meaning of the authenticity of the film. Hey, Miles, I loved your movie for the first time I saw him ... when he appeared in an episode of Seinfeld or was Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
