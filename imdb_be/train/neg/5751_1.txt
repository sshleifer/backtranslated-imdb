The film must be shot in the day, there are scenes where you can see the reflection of the camera and its red pointer, even the green light scenery that blends with the actors !!! The plot line and really awful, even the slightest inspiration (at least, as a thriller, a genre film) .Everything, what to do with Poe in the film, and has a shallow children's film approach.The full clise not thrilling.If you want to watch funny bi -movie for a relaxing evening with friends, then go for it, you will enjoy it (as I do), but there is no way to take this movie seriously!
