From the beginning, this film had a few flaws. The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a rich young tycoon, who had inherited considerable wealth and power of the father, and he with all forces are trying to fill the shoes of his father and mother to cut the apron strings (and co-CEO) holds too tight. It also has the problem of heart disease and waiting in limbo, which is Organ Donor Register. There is also a small back story that your first instinct is to largely ignore that becomes important later on, such as his friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his affair with a middle-class girl (Jessica Alba). Uncreative storylines, but not so bad to spoil the movie. The only real "oh wei!" Moment of the character's name was Lena Olin in. Bossy woman named Lilith ... thin! <br /> <br /> surgical scene is not a censorship. I appreciate that people who are afraid of surgery scenes can not. Horror wakefulness during anesthesia has been done well in the first. You look in emotional agony Kristensna yelling through an incision inside the chest and rib spreader. The moment of irony with trailers then comes, where at that time it is one of the lucky few to stay awake during anesthesia, he also excelled in that it helps him realize that his surgical team plans to kill him. <br /> <br /> the big twist, however, is very predictable and sends the film delving into conspiracy and his recollection of the little signs that were there, but he, like us, he missed the first. <br /> <br /> There are two twists at the end, related to his relationship with his mother. One of them is an impressive gesture Olin, which comes as unimpressive due to bad writing. Another secret about the past of the family, which seemed very tacked on and pointless. <br /> <br /> Initially, well-made drama anesthesia awareness is lost in a poorly written conspiracy drama. There is one last attempt to bring him back, which provides a flat, taking the whole movie with him.
