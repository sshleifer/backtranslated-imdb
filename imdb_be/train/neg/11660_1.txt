Keane Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors, I swear that he has no real knowledge of how to make films. he made a brilliant film, and it's a scary movie. horror 2 was also ok, but everything else Keane made a real disaster. avoid such names as not Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood ..... I know that is the name !!! Obviously, this film too, just something that has Keenans name in the credits. <br /> <br /> It was a half hour on the stupid crap that never made me laugh. just trust me on this one, maybe a woman could this film a little bit because of some things that happen, but in general, this film will never be preferred by anyone with good taste in movies ........ 1 / 10 .......
