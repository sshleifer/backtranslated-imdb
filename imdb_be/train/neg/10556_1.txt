This is a good example of how NOT to make a film. <br /> <br /> There is very little sense of dialogue, not the context of events and constant gaps between seemingly unrelated scenes. The resulting confused, ignorant viewer; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented meaningless without listening to director's commentary. <br /> <br /> This film has much in common with human brutality and tries to show how wrong it is, with a focus on child abuse. It includes some stock footage of real, terrible acts of violence, including in wartime punishment. Although it works in the context of the film, I feel that the idea of ​​the film could be provided without resorting to such extreme content. This film is absolutely not for the weak stomached, or resentful, and should not, under any circumstances can not be shown to minors. <br /> <br /> The culmination of a disappointment compared to the content of the rest of the film. If you do not listen to the comments while this happens, you will probably miss it. <br /> <br /> The comment was directed by one shot, "the guy sitting down and allow him to speak, does not cut" type comments. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, the director ends up awkward and often spend a lot of minutes, while complaining about college, a condition snapshot, producers cooperatives, bad film, and a dozen other things. Permanent adversely detract from what otherwise is an essential tool for understanding the film. <br /> <br /> The film was made many years ago by 16 mm and Super8 film for four years at a very low budget. Because of this, video and audio quality is poor. This in itself does not make it a bad movie, but it makes a bad movie worse.
