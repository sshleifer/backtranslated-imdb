* WARNING * Contains many spoilers <br /> <br /> Let me start by saying I have great respect for the incredible talent Gillian Anderson as a diverse and versatile actress - that's why I can not understand why she agreed to do this film, she saw only the script (or lack thereof). <br /> <br /> premise of the film, in my opinion, is a great idea, and there were some really thought provoking in there, but it ended up as a rolled souffle. This illustrates why I hate 99% of British cinema. It feels too long, it's tedious, for the most part, not much happens after the first twenty minutes. Just when you think there's a chance that picking up some speed it frustrating as Paula Radcliffe to run a marathon. With a little creative directing and minimalist plot, there is not much to keep the audience from pecking nose into their popcorn. As for the script, I can only assume that the author is trying to save a few trees, with the average of the scene, read something along the lines of "Alice: F *** OFF (Adam looks Adam flees into the forest.) (Alice follows) Alice : ADAM ADAM "! I suspect that, word for word, the actors are likely to pay more than Kate Moss did for her Virgin Mobile advertising. Those few lines were not very many variations with frequent use of the F-word, which would make a Bridget Jones, Shazzo, proud. There is little creation of the main characters before the main event of the dirty, which leaves the audience lacks much sympathy for the characters outside of the automatic "Oh, it's awful" reaction. <br /> <br /> Alice is not the woman who takes care of or sympathy. She got a lot of work, expensive London flat with the space of the roof is to die for as long as it comes across on the screen as are arrogant, bitter and unhappy before her life takes a turn for the worse. After the attack several layers peeled back, which would, explain why it is so, to begin with; she grew stiff as an old soldier's boots, thought to teach her how to shoot his gun was the ultimate expression of love so that, instead of moving in his footsteps, she ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel her life is worth living. Instead, she found a group of stereotypical middle-class Toffs, who look down on those who are not rich enough to ride on the Lexus and luxuries that come with integrated security / activities (ie becoming Mrs. Robinson Wanna-be cockney widely boy electrician) Someone pass me a tissue. The saving grace of this one character is that she plays Gillian Anderson. In the hands of a lesser actress, she would have been unbearably one-dimensional, but Ms. Anderson actually manages to enter a few fleeting moments of humanity in this otherwise dead man, first of all, if it sincerely apologizes for its aggressive behavior on the road in a vain attempt to stop her attacker continued to advance. <br /> <br /> I can not say that Adam fared much better either. Danny Dyer played him well as fish-with-water Jack the Lad but a good performance can not save him from a lack of both the script and the complete absence of any signs background. <br /> <br /> This film has relied mostly on the shock, but the timing was off, and he felt too engineered from the beginning to the end. As for the shock, the most shocking thing about this film is a shameless demonstration of how painfully thin Ms Anderson became; it was almost as anxious to see how severe the attack scenes. On a side note, only British film to be a gang of violent sexual attack to take the time to offer one each contraception before continuing to encourage his teammate - to talk about the stiff upper lip, brought to the limit! If this kind of film that the National Lottery donates money to do what I am not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pound every week. <br /> <br /> To say that I hated this film gives him too much credit, I did not care enough about any of the characters, to ensure that strong emotions. I want to one-and-bit hours of my life back, please!
