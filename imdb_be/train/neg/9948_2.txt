Ice-T stars as Mason, a homeless African-American man who considers himself rich hunting hunting (Rutger Hauer, Gary Busey, Charles S. Dutton, F.Murray Abraham, William McNamara and McGinley), but Mason is much more complicated production, the usual goal in this funny and a slow pace of an action movie that takes too much time actionscenes settings and then completely botching them.
