I ran the group to stop the operation of the comic and I spent the last 2 months of hearing horror stories from comedians who tried to audition, «Last Comic Standing». If they do not have a good agent, they do not even get a chance to be heard as more than 80% of the comedians who turn up are rejected before they can show anyone that they have a talent! If they make it to the audition, I was told that it was "predestined" when they get a second chance. So that viewers can see it's not the best comics in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you make it a comic show, most of them do not get loans IMDb. I know this because I have made loans for all 6 seasons, «Last Comic Standing», and I do not pay for work of producers. It's really a shame. A month ago, I asked: "Last Comic Standing 7" on Facebook, why manufacturers do not give loans to IMDb, and I was banned from their Facebook Page !!! I'm not a comedian, so I do not have a vested interest in this. I just want people to know the truth. I do not want to see ANYONE getting exploited, so I'm helping comedians. Comedians get exploited on HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is a Big Three network, so those who are responsible should be ashamed of the fact that this operation will occur. <br /> <br /> Please check out this video of a comedian, who was persecuted: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
