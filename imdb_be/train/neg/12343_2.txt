Oh, brother. The only reason it is very irritating to the film avoids getting full "bomb" from me, because it is, at least historically noted as the first film Three Stooges (if they were not on their own, and is still difficult, it hurts unfunny Ted Healy), but even I would have to say as a fan long the Stooges, the young Moe, Larry and Coeur badly used here as three rebel assistant janitors above cleaner boss Mr. Healy. They have not shown consistently across the movie and their silly on-and-off again, got to draw them more like hyperactivity idiotic cartoon characters are trying too hard to be funny. <br /> <br /> The majority of these transactions toothache Jack Pearl seeks in vain to get some chuckles from the audience itself, like a man who embodies Baron Munchausen (here is a good example of the level of humor: "I object!" "on what basis "" coffee grounds "?). His sidekick is not nothing like a young Jimmy Durante, but even the schnoz sad.
