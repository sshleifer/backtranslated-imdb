Before watching "Dahmer," I thought that no film can not be worse than the Â«Freddy Got Fingered." I was wrong. Summing "Dahmer" up, is the story of a gay serial killer who shows almost no killing, and consists almost entirely of Dahmer meetings with gays before they were killed. There's no story to be found, and it serves no purpose, as it tells us something about the "Dahmer". Everything you learn about Dahmer from watching this film is that he liked to have sex with men. Terrible action directorial terrible, terrible written form, all the terrible ... If you have to choose between watching "Dahmer" and projectile vomiting for three hours, to go with vomiting .... it WLL be less painful .....
