Does anyone edit this movie? Or is it only the DVD release, which had a huge thirty-second gaps between scenes? It's ok though, I fell asleep while watching it the first time. Then I fell asleep a second time and a third time. The plot is actually not the worst I've ever seen, but it's close. Act is not the worst that I have seen or ... but it's close. Manufacturing .... Well, I can honestly say that it was the worst I have ever seen in my life! Not trying to be mean, but Frustrated could use a little more production. <br /> <br /> Please do not think that I am a hater of horror movies, or even the fact that I did not enjoy this film. I just felt like I was laughing on the film much more than I felt I laughed along with him. Terrible moments not too badly done, but could have done better, even with a limited budget. <br /> <br /> The characters seemed uncomfortable developed, or ignore all together, twist ending was very bad, and the exposure took forever without putting a lot. <br /> <br /> I would recommend to avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
