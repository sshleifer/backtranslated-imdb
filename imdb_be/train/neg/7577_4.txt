These are just a few attractive to fans of "bad film" entertainment. It is more appropriate for students of the 1970s pop-culture fashions, furniture, attitudes, and that the large "emancipation of women" at the start of the 1970s, when it was still fresh and new to self-employment, independent woman there. <br /> <br /> «Superchick» (Joyce Jillson) was helpful if monetary stultifying career (after all, it is a flight attendant, but the waitress at 30,000 feet - this goes for men too) she slept around with a few men, can protect themselves and others (karate) and was not attached to anything. It's kind of emancipated woman who scared juice with anti-feminists, those retrograde idiots who believe that no woman is complete without a husband. <br /> <br /> «sexy stewardess" was a powerful archetype of the late 1960s to the 1970s, (geez, even to "the partridge family," I remember swinging bachelor Reuben Kincaid constantly its way from flight attendants) and from this point of view, this is silly film is an important pop-culture time capsule prior AIDS, free love, the emancipation of women, swinging Seventy. The plot is pretty creepy, though. And for those cave in the audience, there are a few bare breasts to look at.
