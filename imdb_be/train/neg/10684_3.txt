This film was craptacular. I was so emotionally uninvolved in every character that the greatest antagonist of the movie was, in fact, himself. I played beautifully throughout; Promise yourself that would go away, but just drink more beer in the hope that it will automatically magically transform into something exciting along the way. Even in this state, I could not help but notice that acting in Cuba was flimsy, tracing paper. His obsessive attachment to the work done was not convincing, and it is one of the night drinking after the failure of their own standards of idiots. Burt was released in a general, that's for sure, the general (who wears too much makeup). I fell into a frighteningly quick drink to compete with Cuba, except mine was real, and I put out my thumb. Coverage! my recompense put out a sock!
