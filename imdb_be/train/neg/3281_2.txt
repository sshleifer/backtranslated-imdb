I had a suspicion the film was going to be bad. I am a supporter of the duke from way back. For three years the TV series on DVD. Well, I was right. I took the family to see him. I really wanted to see the general jump over and some of the hopping chase scenes were good. But to sum up, the film has been simplified down to work to release TV shows. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson has been dismal. While I can honestly say that the original Daisy meetings were also demonstrations, interpretation of Jessica Simpson's Daisy was just terrible. Sorrel, Beech and Denver Pyle must be turning into their graves as well. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money. If you are an old tried and true Dukes fan, I and three of my children, you will be very disappointed.
