This film was bad from the start. The sole purpose of the film is that Angela wanted to get the highest score of the body. The acting was terrible. The murder played out very badly. For example, if Allie was stuffed down the toilet that, I think it was in an abandoned cabin. But when at the end of the movie comes and Molly, and the second man in the cab so you can see Ally Angela should go to get it. The part that really I had when a black girl, and Angela was in the cabin and Angela took a guitar string and choke her. One thing that was horrible actions and two, why do not you just turn around and slap a bitch?!?!? Then, when it gets chased by Angela, if you have a neigh, why not just turn around and hit her ??? So silly. This movie sucked ...
