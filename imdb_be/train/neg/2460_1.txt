I really wanted to like this film, but he never gave me a chance. It basically means to be Spinal Tap with the theme of hip-hop, but fails miserably. It feels like it was written and acted at the high school for some school project, as well as the level of humor seems to be directed. There is no subtlety and more deadly for the mockumentary, it never feels like a documentary. And while the line is not funny in the first place, an attempt to dead pan delivery would help - of course, everything would have been better than shrill replay we subjected <br /> <br /> E. d recommend people who love "comedies" in the spirit of "Big Momma's House" or "Norbu"; people who think that words such as "example" in nature hysterically funny. Other people should stay away and do not waste your time.
