Liongate yet to prove themselves. Each film with Lionsgate was deplorable. I tried and tried to give them more opportunities, and they just keep slapping me again and again. Fever And, of course, is no exception. <br /> <br /> I could not even pay attention to most of the film it was so unpleasant and bad. <br /> <br /> Now the plot. Man cuts dead dog for some reason. Infected with a virus randomly, transmits it to the children in the camp, the children begin to become infected and die, the town finds out about it, and instead of helping them, kill them. the water is contaminated, and everything dies. end. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this whole movie. <br /> <br /> All the characters are completely backward, do not care about any of them, and the child should have stuck with the boy meets world. My friend and I found that talking about how fat and bitchy our one classmate had to be much more enjoyable than to pay attention to this film. We managed to make it all the way through, screaming bull $ @ t, because this movie will make you do it. <br /> <br /> I still confuse occasional slow motion carat moves one random child, and how, apparently, everything in the country is fully retained and hickish. And besides, why the dog attacked the girl? why Hicks tried to kill the child to sit in a chair while waiting for them to kill him? which was part of two of the plan? wow. the best plan ever. I can not believe that this film got a theatrical release. I, not to mention the need to digest the DVD could barely sit in the theater does not move a half hours. It was not scary, or funny, or cool, or anything. it's just a waste of 90 minutes, which you could use to ... I do not know, plant a tree or something. it is more productive than this piece of garbage. Action, special effects, and the script is a joke. I never take it back. <br /> <br /> Fever gets a nasty leg shaving scene 10
