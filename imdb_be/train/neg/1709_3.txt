I got a copy of this movie thinking it was a 1964 movie with the "Zombie Bloodbath», as one of its alternate names. Persistently, this film really has a better rating on this site than the above-mentioned title; which may mean that the other is very bad! This film is very bad too; Obviously, you can not go to a movie that calls itself the "zombie Bloodbath» and expects to see a masterpiece, and in fairness he lives for the title with the amount of gore on the screen ... but it all feels very old and tired, which does not help brutal action and silly storyline. It's just your average nuclear spill causing people to turn into zombies, etc. etc. The film starts with a sequence that sees the people melted and that pretty much lets you know that you are within; low quality zombie debris. There's plenty of gore in the film, and it's a real good job otherwise the film would be very boring. Zombie Bloodbath looks really cheap too, and was clearly inexperienced filmmakers together! The main impact seemed to be superior to Romero the day of the dead, though this may be really just about anything that shows the zombies and gore. It all boils down to, I can not as a rule-based, predictable and pointless end and in general to say that I was impressed with it!
