The reason this is such a bad film because it is so very badly written, and it is completely wine schlock novelist Robert James Waller, also the author of Bridges of Madison County. Drafting is bad, because the plot is completely banal and wooden dialogue and implausible. The failed pair ?? Locked American writer and pretty Mexican woman with a history of which it is ashamed ?? It shall be made up a strong, self-directed criminal, and after a few adventures (mostly terribly violent) alternates with scenes that show the warm side of the murderers, it leaves an impotent partner for the killer, who, bad as it is, to see it more clearly than anyone else It has before. Nothing can help this film will not even sewn face Scott Glenn as a murderer, not attractive Latinism Giovanna Zacarias like pockets, and even productivity grew Harvey Keitel as a CIA specialist, designed to track the killer down. A serious waste of time.
