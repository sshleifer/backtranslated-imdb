I've never seen this movie, but I can tell you one thing about their products. While the comedy / oldies radio DJ in 1988, I received a call from the production company. They asked if I would write and record a little, they served in the soundtrack as eminating from the TV (television screen itself will never be shown) sounds. I said that of course, wrote a parody of '50s sci-fi clich√© monster, rounded some sound effects and called in another DJ, Pam Landry to play the female lead. As it was in the air at the time, she put on a long song, joined me at the microphone on the production floor and cut voicetrack in one take. Giggling, and then she went back to her show while I mixed in silly sound effects. We've never done it, if we knew that the "massacre garden shredder" was supposed to be a turkey - but, then again, we never got paid for our efforts, either! - Gary Theroux
