Although I enjoyed the Bing Crosby in other films, I think that this film will be particularly grating. Maybe because I'm from a different era and a different country, but I found the constant references Crosby to the good old USA enjoyable at first, commonplace after a while, and then finally irritated. Do not get me wrong - I'm not anti-American at all - but it seemed that the English language can not make any law and / or need this courageous, so smart about the American visitor, to show them the way. This is a "fish out of water" story, but unlike most films of this kind, this time it's "Fish", having the upper hand. . To be fair to both yourself and the movie, I watched it several times spaced over several years, and get the same impression every time, <br /> <br /> (I watched another movie last night Crosby - Emperor Waltz - and it also produced the same reaction in me and to my surprise, even my wife -., who for what it costs Americans - found the "in your face" attitude of the American Crosby annoy too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it.. ) <br /> <br /> As for the premise that the film is quite unique for St. ygo time and the supporting cast, of course, very good. Decorations and music as well as great costumes - although I agree with the previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix looks awful (photo Moe Three Stooges) <br /> <br /> In general. for me it would be much more enjoyable picture without regard Bing Crosby, but because he almost every shot is quite difficult to sit through this movie.
