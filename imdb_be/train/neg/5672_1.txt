It is a shame to have this film in my collection. The most redemptive factor DVD ownership is a short film in bonuses. My vote for the film a big fat ZERO. Do not get me wrong, I'm a girl horror. but I want a little meat for the story, not to mention I prefer evil to happen to the people that do not introduce error to see what seemed like forever, animal tobacco clips. Acts of cruelty interrupt aching long silence and bad action. When I was forced to make a comparison with another film, the only one that comes to mind is Cannibal Holocaust. Poor, boring, meaningless and totally uncomfortable to watch.
