I've never seen a comedy, which was most of the routine work, to sit through ... not one laugh in it. Well, maybe one little chuckle for Michael Clarke Duncan's a bit like a big, black, bald gay virgin. But otherwise it was a strikingly non-funny. In addition devoid of any laughs "skits" are forever! Stay away from this if you value your time and money. Scary !!! Worst of all !!!
