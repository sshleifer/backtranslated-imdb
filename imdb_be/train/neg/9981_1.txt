This film was billed as a comedy and mystery. It is not bad at both. The only reason someone would do such a poorly constructed film. The only comedy laugh I got when I saw how high the readers ranked it here. It can be two films of the same name? The film, which I saw, was shot woman with very blue eyes, and a story that was not there. <br /> <br />
