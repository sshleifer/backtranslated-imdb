Those familiar with the previous two movies Cube rather numerous know what they can expect: a small group of people trapped inside the pile minutes trapped in the room, paranoia, poor actor ... This one is a little different, though. Approximately half of the film takes place outside of the cube, where we get to see the people watching the people inside the cube (or, at least five of them). <br /> <br /> I think Cube Zero seeks to explain the deal to cube, but you can not really know much more than what was covered in the first two films. Of course, there is some kind of an explanation in there, but it feels pretty lame compared to what was proposed in the first film. <br /> <br /> Cube Zero looks pretty cheap (as his predecessors had done), and the fact that the show is more than just a few empty rooms only accentuates this feeling. I also fell pretty safe to say that there is no risk that some of the actors will win the award for the foreseeable future. They returned from the bottom of the trap 1, though, (I mean that they are almost the same, a little shame). <br /> <br /> I know that many people like to evaluate this film and its relation to the first, but I just feel that this is totally unnecessary contribution to the franchise, which was not so great to begin with.
