Give me my money back! Give me my life! Give me a little credit. This film was vomit worthy. Unnecessary and time-consuming. Which is a waste of energy and completely pointless. Well, I understand the idea of ​​space and sound, but give us a break! Next time just give me the money and let me hold it. Lost child, the mother of remorse, accused her husband! Clichés and ~! Get a life! Sorry, but this movie was a waste of my time, my money and my being. I prefer to look to cook eggs! There is no real explanation as to why this happened. Prison? Why? Loss? obviously, but why? Acting deserves What am I doing here Oscar cinematography, and I just do it for the salary? How to make this film? Well this is nonsense fool hired copy. enough said
