Poorly written script, without the cute characters. As for the fact that it is a comedy, I forgot to laugh. It is vain about 2 friends who scam to get a woman in bed with them too (no sex scenes), and the other one (which is odd-discustingly floor), which is sometimes also a scam, but it is generally considered that the man, which masterbates. The 3 friends separately meet and fall for the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow it is not actually a romance. These 3 guys are no longer friends, because they are separate from it. She fraudulent them with their friendship, because they are fraudulent woman. - Bad Movie
