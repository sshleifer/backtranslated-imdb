DeNiro master ... one of my favorites. And I love a good sports movies {rather than baseball so much, but hey, it sports movies, is not it?. I expected much more for this film. It seems to start well: DeNiro what I expected, Snipes {I do not really like} very good, like spoiled star. Barkin role, I have to be in order. She is a good actress, but seemed to have no place in this role. For me, they always seemed to rush the scene, and then drags a bit in places. It just seemed to me thio so bumpy! Given the cast and plot, it could be much better. I appreciate this "4", and I was generous ~ I firmly one with numbers!
