«Trigger Man», of course, the most boring and stupid movie I've ever seen in my life. Video aunt holiday more fun. <br /> <br /> The actors seem to work in uglypeople.com. They have no talent to act in a convincing manner. <br /> <br /> They walk and walk and walk through the woods. There's more to walk around than in all three parts of "The Lord of the Rings" together. After the first hour, I began to read the brochure Porsche while watching «Trigger Man» along the way. Awful. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time and money. I give this film 0 stars out of 10, since it is not possible, I have to give 1 star.
