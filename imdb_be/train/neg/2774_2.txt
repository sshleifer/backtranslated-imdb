It's just a bad movie. With a seemingly pretty good budget it had the potential to be much better. It almost was. With excellent heroine almost like Salma Hayek, the hero fights almost like Jackie Chan, battles and fights almost like Crouching Tiger ... music is almost like, say, Conan ... etc. Almost. But in the end it's just boring and hard to find something interesting in it. Perhaps with the exception of John Rhys-Davies to fly in combat, these soldiers in the Hero or the aforementioned Crouching Tiger ... I am really ashamed of the poor old John. He did a pretty good actor and deserves much better. Because you - so if you still have a chance to just watch something else.
