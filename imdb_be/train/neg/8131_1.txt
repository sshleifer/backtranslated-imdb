If the name should not be some kind of spoiler to transform wife (Dogs! Ruining it for us). ANYCASE, if this movie was not made for television, it had to be, it's so strange low-budget, underscripted, underacted and hits every 70-clich√©, except discos. No one is nice, and you could not care what happens to anyone in this. Eminently forgetable for bad, bad performances for the exception.
