Good: <br /> <br /> The effective color scheme. Good costumes. Top expressions set of products. Well detailed CGI buildings and vehicles <br /> <br /> Cons :. <br /> <br /> Horrible mixture with all the actors cast CGI mixes fifth element of Final Fantasy. CGI actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago. Flawed logic. Giant pyramid shows, and no one examines it, no one even questions it? And there is no explanation as to why the god Horus was even expelled, and there was no reason why he should do something as trivial as feed Jill <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> The terrible scenario . So a lot of unnecessary podagovorov with too many ideas that are not fully realized. Conversation was almost ridiculous at some points. Random characters and events that are not needed. Stupid characters. Jill must have this mystery, but apparently it was a mystery writer. There's nothing to it. It is uninteresting and boring to watch. It has no substance, no texture. Her character has no redeeming qualities. In fact, there is not a single character in the entire film, which has any purpose, any purpose (other than the obvious Chora), any motivation. They are weak and ill-conceived. There is no bet - the key to writing the screen. Chorus will not be immortal, but no big deal, he's a bad guy. No one can even decipher Horus or Jill, is the main character. That is the problem: by dedicating half of the film on each symbol means that the writer never fully explores one character, never brings one to implement. They cardboard expressions that go around and say and do almost nothing, but to explore the thin part of the kit. First time director of the pacemaker. Slowly, slowly, slowly. I still watch the film, as I write this. I can not pay attention, because it's sad. All the apartments. Even the action is not interesting, because it is short-lived, and sometimes there is no need <br /> <br /> In general :. <br /> <br /> Do not look. Battered history, character development subpar banal entirely CGI maintains a good set of production.
