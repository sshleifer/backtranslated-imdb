It's sad ending Koen Wauters' career has come to my attention through the "Night of Bad Taste". Judging by the comments index I was not the first and I'm not the last person in Western Europe, to find out what this musician (undoubtedly one of the best in our modern pop scene, even the Dutch have agreed to that) was trying to be an actor. Should he tried to or not can not be judged. <br /> <br /> In the "intensive care", he is very cute, but he seems uncomfortable with the movement in which he participated. One can not blame him. It deserves its ranking in the Hall of Fame VERHEYEN all means and standards. History of the bloody maniac who supposedly died in the crash, but alive and angry had to say ten times, and even turns without original director can deliver more than an ordinary story with the help of innovative systems and Cinematography. <, Br /> <br /> IC content himself with the hospital wing and a few middle-class homes. Temp dim. Tensions loses last broken his trust score for each occurrence of the killer is accompagnied by a tiring ugrozhayuschima melodies, orchestral and then gusts during the killing, or are largely proposals and in any case, as bloodless as a small budget can make them. Sex scene is gratuitous, but no less attractive. A pair of cursed Amsterdam could make it work, though. When dealing with a pair of object: all the plot between Wouters and a woman does not work. More effective emotional connection can be established on the screen if they have just been brothers of the victim, to be who ease their nerves halfway through the physical communication. I will not even provide other member of CAST merits mention as they were chopped into small pieces of fat. In fact, the majority of them. Those I remember where it is obvious for the genre: a beautiful nurse and two policemen. <br /> <br /> Thus, in the slasher, the cavalry arrives just in time to need rescue themselves. The hero (anti) is to remove the villain, mainly due to rational thinking, the former Red Berets do not often get a part in these films; they could overcome the illusion of invulnerability, which surrounds the killer. Translated into events, Wauters kills the doctor and saves a lady in distress. <br /> <br /> I do not No man, I'm not finished. This is not how the story goes. Wauters makes him heroic effort, but beaten to the fury that is close to "A Clockwork Orange", so that for a girl to pick up a driller killer act, and to pierce through the doctors brains. Although this method guarantees the death of the murderer more than conventional cartridges 9mm bullets, Doctor survives to allow the IC to reach the 80 minute mark. <br /> <br /> I had to make my point right now. Intensive care is a bad film that can be enjoyed only bad taste lovers, who can check VERHEYEN catchy statement and make some for yourself and thus trying to sit through it. For example, the (unintentional) Parody value clown doctor mask (Halloween), and the final confrontation in the park (the chase at the end of Friday the 13th). <br /> <br /> However, let me conclude by giving an overview of a few miserable elements that give IC a little credit. George Kennedy is not one of them. All he has to do is to go through a terrible monologue doctor colleague / French actor and watch in horror when they let him go in the fire, to mark his big name on the understudy. He could once again played its part Naked Gun, in the end, like beef, but with a longer screen time. Finals may be one of them. I've never seen a maniac, brought by launching fireworks in his guts to crush him against the flexible skirt. It's good for a laugh. <br /> <br /> The name of one of the show really good resuscitation ... Koen Wauters learned his lesson and completely devoted himself to a career in music. It makes me wonder how many editions of the Paris-Dakar race, he had to interrupt before the arrival of his feelings. <br /> <br />
