Twist the end can be really cool in the movie. This is particularly interesting if a turn is right before our eyes, but we just do not pay attention. Those type of twist endings are their own, that make people think. Then we have a twist as this film has. Turns that you pay attention, you have no idea what is going to happen. If they show this kind of random twist, not a shock, it is somewhat dumbfounded reaction. The film begins as it will be an interesting look at the horror, but after about 20 minutes, it is anything but boring and silly dialogue turn. <br /> <br /> Three young women go to a concert, so they get lost wandering through the woods and hit a tree trunk. They end up in some kind of horrible old lady house that hates people, and they greeted her daughter's home Marion (Laurel Munson). Strange goings on happen as these girls stay in this house for a few days, rather than trying to get away or home, and the unknown is progressing in a dumb slasher. <br /> <br /> This film too caught up in this dialogue, and it is always only between a few characters. We have a basic three girls, a terrible old woman and the virgin, and the conversation of any significance does not go beyond these five. To make matters worse, they never have anything interesting to say. It's actually pretty crazy sitting through their conversation. We want to know what is happening, and instead they just talk and talk and talk (about). Hole <br /> <br /> land in abundance here. In the house the girls are when they get in a car wreck them, seen three miles from anywhere ... wow, three miles! Two hours or less walk will kill them. Why do not they get a ride with the employee for this house, which was traveling in the city? Did he have a seat? How do these girls will never question the care and just happy to stay, rarely even checking on each other? Why should it have been so many twists stupid? Maybe the answer is in the boring scenarios. <br /> <br /> Having a slasher with five characters really bad idea. It does not carry, it's not terrible, but the end is planned there, but certainly dumb <br /> <br /> My rating :. * 1/2 ****. 79 min. R for nudity and violence.
