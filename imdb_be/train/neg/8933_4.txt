Watching this last night it struck me that F spent so much money on it, and got so little back on their investment. It's kind of disaster that must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the first morning of the shooting Raquel Welch brushed off the shelf above her fireplace to prepare a place for the Academy Award, she definitely wins for this daringly original film. Unfortunately. This is not what happened. <br /> <br /> strife on set has been described in detail in the print Rex Reed, and this has helped the film achieve a reputation, before it was even released. When he was released it was not the usual three-ring circus of publicity. If I remember correctly, in Houston it was opened in the drive-in and the theater district, and never played any of the big sites. <br /> <br /> I lay most of the blame on director Michael Sarna, who was hot after the director (not all that well) JOANNA, the movie with the music of young people in the swinging fashion in London. <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, Fox wound up firing him and piercing the film with the best that they could. That's why the scene to play in no particular order and are symbols, and then disappears. A large supporting cast (Kathleen Freeman, Jim Backus, John Carradine, Andy Devine, and others) for nothing and do nothing. <br /> <br /> In order to extend its full length has numerous clips from Fox films with the participation of stars such as Carmen Miranda (in odd frames with ALL HERE gang) andLaurel and hard, who never dreamed that they would be play X rated movie <br /> <br /> Evaluation X due to accidental language many sexual perversions. However, none of the characters do not give up, have fun. Maybe someone has something to do with the film were perverse Puritan sensitivity and realized that if they could do these things unattractive it was not bad to use them. <br /> <br /> This was one of the "youth" paintings that are almost bankrupt Hollywood in the 1970s. One writer joked that Easy Rider (what has been done to change the bag) was the most expensive film ever made because so many films, after which tried and failed in the worst way to duplicate his success. Sixtyish, when honored filmmakers such as Stanley Kramer and Preminger made films such as RPM and snowmobiles in an attempt to attract a younger audience. White directors and writers have tried make films to attract audiences Black th. These films are closed somewhere in the vault and the two names, and many others of the genre ever, as far as I know, has been on home video or cable. They are deep dark secret studio. <br /> <br /> performance Raquel Welch is all things considered, very good. At the right direction and the script she played the type of arrogant liberated women Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck specialized. it looks good and have strange costumes. Mae West is a lively seventy-something actress I've ever seen. On the one hand, it's kind of heartbreaking to watch her attempt to seize its glory from the past, but I'm sure she needed the money. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a big-budget X-rated films from this era to test the limits of the valley dolls (also on Fox), because it does not take itself seriously. This is crazy children play with the equipment at a major studio. MYRA BREKINRIZH trying to say something. There just was not anyone who would listen.
