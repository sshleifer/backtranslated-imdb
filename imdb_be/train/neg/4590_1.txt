Anyone who has studied physics, or any cognitive science will go disgusting after 40 minutes. As my wife and I. Ignorant masses could be entertained by hand rejection of the arguments and absurd "conclusions" drawn (even without trying the logical mind) of real science. I was offended by such nonsense, presented under the guise of "science." I can only conclude that the authors I picked up a book of quantum physics, did not understand a word, and then watched the matrix about a thousand times, and began to write the film. <br /> <br /> For example, the Washington offense experiment was made by the transcendental Meditation program. a brief search will reveal the science of their methods.
