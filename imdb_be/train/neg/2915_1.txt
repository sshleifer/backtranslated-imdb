It's a bad film, it seems, there are only 5 police in HK, they did not use a weapon there, and it makes me feel like Jacky Chan movie. All this time they used their weapons to show only suspicious. When they finally use their guns when they are killing each other, what a funny movie. In the film, it's all good guys died for no reason. <br /> <br /> They storyline of the film also sucks, the story of jumping up and down and boring people. But if you want to see a bloody film, I think it's only the CI type of the film, I think that made the US the zombie film is more bloody than this
