Drawing Restraint 9 directed :. Matthew Barney <br /> <br /> How do you know if you are in the middle of a pretentious movie? Is it that there are only 8 lines of dialogue in the 140 minutes of the film? Is this when Bjork wearing what looks like a giant fluffy pita bread on her head in a pseudo-Asian ritual? Maybe when the mammoth dung and spinal columns used in whale blubber experiment. Or, if you're going to want to kill the composer to create a minimum, and still annoying version of the bill Philip Glass? In any case, Drawing Restraint 9 is one of the most ambitious contemporary art films. At 135 minutes, it adds to its pretentious, being boring to boot. I would call a stunning use of color and interesting opening sequence, but the rest of the film looked like he was a documentary Discovery Channel has been removed. That is, as long as it does not appear that they were trying to shoot his version of P-SS of Christ, but that will come later. <br /> <br /> In fact, Documentary-squire parts were the best part. The surface of the plot of the whaling ship, and then the ritual of whale oil. Then, there are guests in the form of Björk and Matthew Barney, who greeted the ship, being put through humiliation ritual, which includes transmitted from the shaving head (thinking, fraternity boy antics), nicotine patches and giant fluffy pita hats, then there is mutual evisceration, cannibalism, and let's not forget the giant dung. <br /> <br /> Matthew Barney wrote that we are talking about "the relationship between self-imposed resistance and creativity." It's almost like saying "if you do not get it, then you are not creative in your interpretation, so Fuck off, because I'm an artist. "Oh, wait, that's post-modern interpretation of the proposal and that the film will be about when he was a post-modern. But, it should be contemporary art. about art itself. <br /> <br /> Thus, let's start is only 3/4 of a serious and dollars all of this interpretation a little bit, is not it? the following lines us understood as any real attempt to interpret the film. <br /> <br /> The first half-hour comes to pearl divers and the construction of a giant stingray. It is obvious that the ramp symbolizes the need for self-aggrandizement that the rules that you value, and a bench looking pearls pearls of wisdom. Then, on the whaling ship, they're building a box that looks like this in the form of raw whale. it is obvious that the omens cheeses element. <br /> <br /> On the ship, they make whale oil in the form of a whale, and remove part of the fins. They replace it with the spine, and later a giant dung. They should be the state of the film. When he was fat, it is entertaining, but it is bad for you. If this is the spinal column, his "important" part of the movie, or the spine, so to speak. Then a giant turd is Nedra film, or if the movie is crap. <br /> <br /> Björk and Matthew Barney arrive on separate ships, contained in another's humiliating outfits that are not even well done, or symmetrical, one suspects that they have run out of money, and Barney tries to quit smoking. SO, they put a patch on his head. They go through the ritual of the ship and learn about the Japanese sage who tells them that the ship was injured when another vehicle struck him; accident or intersection, if you will. It inspires Bjork and Barney, what different on the outside, to start cutting the legs from each other and eat them, so that they can turn into whales themselves and the same person. They intersect. Oh, I forgot to mention that this was done in a video Robbie Williams? Then, return to the bench of pearls companies of full of gems of knowledge that can help provide a Venn diagram to make stupid. Barney made it through 8th grade geometry, obviously. Or maybe at least some social studies. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I forgot the ear dolt Bjork I-want-to-kill-her account? Sometimes it's a sleeping pill, but in others you just want to kill her. <br /> <br /> The feature film is one thing, but if you just throw all kinds of symbols in the hope to get a reaction out of people, it becomes self-destructive jokes. If you cross the line between becoming a joke in terms of art? Dali and Bunuel often made surreal pieces of nonsense, but was more consistent and / or entertaining than this piece of garbage. Andalusian dog had sensitivity to cram as much symbolism as it could in less than half an hour. <br /> <br /> So, I can recommend it? Only if you like stupid movies of high art with a lot of symbolism and flat images. <br /> <br /> D +
