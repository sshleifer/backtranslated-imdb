Against All Hope is very poorly made, sometimes painfully so, the movie. This is the first film Michael Madsen, and it shows that he is not as good at it. Some people might find the story funny; alcoholic realizes that his life and the family is falling apart, so he calls the preacher as a last resort to help. Preacher telling his story, he receives Jesus Christ into your heart. <br /> <br /> I actually found that many of the religious scenes, like when Cecil Moe (Madsen) goes to church, but leaves it quite realistic. I also liked how Cecil knows that his life is falling apart and trying to get help, but only God can help him understand. In the end, he realizes, with God's help he can get through life without drinking again. <br /> <br /> This film is not very well done at all. Acts bad, the script could use some work, and looks worse than my home videos, but it has a good message. Now, just because you are a Christian does not mean that you will be able to automatically stop an addiction or cure a broken family, and Cecil understands this and works hard to stay on track. In general, if your Christian you will appreciate how the film portrays Christianity, and if you do not, you may find yourself called to learn more about the faith.
