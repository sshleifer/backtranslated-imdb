* Spoiler * Some people say that Congenital Killer brilliant critique the media's obsession with violence. But this assertion ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could show his serial killer as evil, inhuman murderers of innocent people, and this contrasts with morbid fascination media. Instead, it gives them an excuse. The film reflects only about each victim, as someone who deserves to be hurt. Participation in the stereotypical evil, Stone is the victim as a nasty caricature - stupid redneck, broken English-speaking immigrants, lazy people who are overweight. One person who homicidal lovebird is also a stereotype. Of course, they make friends old, hallucinogen-using US-Indian - because they are trendy, dude? Let's make it a lovely character. Fat Chinese clerks and "Hicks" are loose, so let's do it, it seems like and deserve to die. Instead of a twisted, hateful, that have been damaged their offenses, their rowdiness makes them happy and in love. Mickey and Mallory made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are linked to entice more impressionable people. Justice mocked. Police and prison officials are portrayed as tough, ugly and frowned when compared with killers GQ. Again, it's not in the media within the framework of the film, but in "reality" in the film. There's no nuance or subtlety in the film - a bloated performances and visual effects. The film says nothing new or particularly about the obsession with violence. Proof that the film can not, in its communication is in real real reactions to it. Some vulnerable young people who have seen the film brought him as inspiration for the murders which they had committed. "Message" of the film is a failure, because it inspires people in the opposite direction, with terrible results of real life. Reasonable message was nowhere in sight.
