I thought that the whole joke of the film will see some rich white guy acting like Chris Rock, and then see Chris Rock responds to people's reactions. Instead, you see only Chris Rock to be themselves, and people did not understand them. There may be 2 scenes the film, where they use their trick. It should have been much better.
