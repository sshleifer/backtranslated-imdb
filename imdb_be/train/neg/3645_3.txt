The young man gets a bad hair day, out on the hill, and empties into which he can not escape. Then he meets MR. ATLAS, Â«mythological" man 2000 years ago, as well as his best friend, and Arnold Schwarzenegger look and sound alike. His Herculean strength to help the boy out of danger, and then adapt to modern life. So the big deal? It's a lousy idea for a "family" picnic! In any case, it should have not been tested at all, in fact! Our fictional character strength and brawn no more than a typical stranger, which is common to the rest of the universe. To add to the blasphemy is the absence of anything new or attractive, and before you know it, there are some attempts at violence, sun qualifies it as a "family" entertainment. The scene in which Atlas complains of his pants is gaggling, though. Just a nice, quiet day at the park for a change.
