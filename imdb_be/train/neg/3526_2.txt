(Spoiler included, some say) <br /> <br /> This film is not possible to take seriously. In some parts it is so very stupid, I just can not help but laugh at it all. I try to sequence where Stallone's character jumps about 20 meters with full or reduced transmission (and it really is a favorite) to extinguish the bad guy, attaching it to the stalactite. So that it is the wicked force put together to perform such feats? I do not know, but it sure gives a real run for the money.
