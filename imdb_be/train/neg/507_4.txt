Unlike my fellow reviewers, I always try to find something soothing in any movie I see.Yes, dubbing quality and coverage plaintively, wooden acting and opening sequence greatly misleads the fact that all of these lustful women with lesbian vampires dripping.Something blood must be lost in the translation of the word "vampire" with the Italian in the title; almost as if the producers originally intended to film the story of Gothic vampire, and then changed their minds, but can not afford to abandon its dramatic opening sequence, so it stuck to the film in any way. <br /> <br /> This movie made! in 1975, was recently released on DVD and comes with its own theatrical trailer, which in some respects is more daring than seen in the film Now, anyone who buys this film, probably in any case have already read it and knows synopsis what to expect - from the middle of the Italian softporn 1970s.I bought it, because I'm attracted to Christa Nelli (consuming more often as "Christie Nelly"). lack of character I find most disappointing in many of these Eurosleaze films from the 60s and 70s.I hoped IMDB shows cast of characters, as one hears their names in the film, but without a list of the cast, it is very difficult to connect them with the actor thinks concerned.I Christi Nellie was playing "Kara", but under this massive hair, costume and make-up is difficult to distinguish it accurately. <br /> <br /> There are basically two-dimensional image of the actors their parts and no one is really not worth out.Maybe is lost in the dubbing process.What were positive aspects? Well, the music was atmospheric and, of course, if you are in the beautiful lesbian soft porn used it there.The outer seats were good, and I would like to know where they were shooting the lock on his island.It wants to be set to "Ireland" (North or a republic?) in 1902, so that each piece of sports during costumes.Some scenes that I found randomly funny especially those sex scenes !! in any case, a nice romp.I rated it 4/10.
