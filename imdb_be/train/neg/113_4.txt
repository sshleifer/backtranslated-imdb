Today I found, "They all laughed" on VHS for sale in rent. It was very old and very used VHS, I did not have any information about this movie, but I liked the links provided on the cover: the name of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and especially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low, and I decided to take a chance and buy it. I was looking for IMDb, and User rating 6.0 was an excellent guide. I looked in the "Guide for Mick Martin & Marcia Porter video and DVD of 2003", and ?? wow ?? Four stars! So I decided that I could not spend more time and see it immediately. In fact, I just finished watching "They all laughed," and I found it very sad film overrated. The characters are poorly developed, and I spent a lot of minutes to understand their role in history. The site should be funny (private eyes who fall in love for women chasing them), but I was not laughing at all of history. Matches in a big city like New York, ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive people, women fall on him, as if it was Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and George Clooney, is quite funny. In the end, the more points of interest, of course, the presence of a turn Playboy and Playmate of the Year Dorothy Stratten, killed her husband rather then release of the film, and whose life was manifested in the «Star 80" and "Death of a reversal: Dorothy Stratten Story", the amazing beauty of sexual Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards, is always cool, even when fifty-two years, Audrey Hepburn, and the song "Amigo", Roberto Carlos Although I do not like him, Roberto Carlos was the most popular Brazilian singer from late 60s called. his supporters as «the King». I'll keep this fi lm in my collection only because of these attractions (brave Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. "Muito Riso e Muita Alegria" ( "A lot of laughter and a lot of happiness")
