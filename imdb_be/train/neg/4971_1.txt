I work in a store, and Blockbuster every week we have movies that come with the use of only a few instances, this kind of a movie that shows the channel Sci-Fi. A film that nobody wants, and only what idiots for rent when they bring it back, I ask them, "was it good?" They say, "No, we excluded it in 15 minutes!" Films with a terrible generated computer, super imposed monsters and the like, it is very unattractive. <br /> <br /> This is the same type of film that Grendel, and an absolute waste of time, if you want reasonable (and only reasonably) well-established film Beowulf then try Beowulf & Grendel, starring Gerard Butler, who also plays a major role in the long-awaited 300 I King Leonidas of Sparta. <br /> <br /> Plus, later this year we have another film Beowulf, with a star studded cast from Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson, to Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. <br /> < br /> But do not let that hope that we all did with Eragon, or we are. for another big disappointment <br /> <br /> as far as the rental, that's my rule :. If there are only one or two instances, not rent, because his load of crap (This is true of 99.9% of the time, as a rule, does not correspond to reality, if the name of the foreign or documentary ).
