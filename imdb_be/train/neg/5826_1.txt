Slow and beautiful images succeeded each other, sometimes with annoying music (you know, Bjork) in the background, for the first 75% of the film. If you have not had enough sleep, this is a good time. <br /> <br /> But, in the last 20% of the film's director decides to bring the idea of ​​rebirth, reincarnation or another, through S & M images "spiritual lovers" cut each other's body with a knife. For me it was very unsettling and actually change the overall impression of a combination of abstract art and images of modern Japanese mystery. <br /> <br /> The operator and the director is great, but it is strange. <br /> <br /> I do not like at all.
