I can not tell you how angry I was after Seing this film. Symbols not the least interesting, and the plot is non-existent. Therefore, after the wait to see how the lives of these characters influence each other, in the hope that over the past two and a half hours in the lead up to some substantial finish what we get ??? Storm frogs. Now yes, I understand, a reference to the Bible (Exodus) and the main theme, but first and foremost, he was presented with absolutely no authorization, and secondly it will be lost to those who do not read the Bible (a significant part of the population) or Charles Fort (still a big part of it). To some extent, well-read man, I thought that this film was self-indulgent poor imitation of the Seinfeld episode. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. It would be better spent on reading ... <br /> <br /> ... well, nothing, to be honest
