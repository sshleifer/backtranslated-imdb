I rented this film about 4-5 years ago and was immediately disappointed. <br /> <br /> I would like to see the film Chopper movie, but in the end with the feces in my eyes. The action was like watching the grass dry. I've seen better acting in a film ... erotic <br /> <br /> The idea that a crazed killer comes out of nowhere confused me. As it was a horror film? <br /> <br /> cost of production of this film, was laughable at best. There was no panic. It seemed that a high school student received a new camera for Christmas. The site has been around, if it exists. If you get bored looking at a bad horror movie rental, you can skip this one. There are much better B-movies there.
