Russian film "4" follows the lives of three (rather than four) strangers who meet one evening at a local bar. One musician, one frozen meat dealer and a call girl. <br /> <br /> "4," I understand you want to show boredom and hopelessness of life in post-Soviet Russia (the characters have to make up stories to make their lives seem more interesting than they really are), but the film so inconsistent and sad that I seriously doubt many people will be able to sit all the way through it. There seems to be a proposal passes through the film, that the phantom government of Russia to some questionable actions behind the scenes - running secret cloning facilities, sales decades, frozen meat, etc. - but the film is so formless and incomprehensible that I doubt anyone could see that someone actually up here. <br /> <br /> Despite the decent action and more acutely directed scenes, "4" is two o'clock long endurance contest, which should be avoided at all costs.
