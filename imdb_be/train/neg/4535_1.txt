slow, strange, sad. Three enthusiastic words describing the book the film. This is certainly the case when the film was never meant to be at the expense of the book. Much of the film was the scenery beautiful. Worst of all was that the low-speed interaction of the actors, which, combined with endless meaningful glances. Editing cool and heterogeneous. However, despite this, the actors worked very hard, at least try to be a little bit true with a horrible scenario. It was strange that, although set in Peru was hardly Peruvian origin man wandering about the set - even in historical scenes depicting Peru in the 17th century. If you have a sense of history, try to avoid this movie.
