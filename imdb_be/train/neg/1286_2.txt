As a Scotsman in a kilt love in Bonny purple heather? Very, very carefully.Now I have a distinct advantage over many other reviewers that I was born in Scotland.Far too many Americans to accept this simplistic nonsense seriously.It a joke, people, "four legs good - two legs bad" both Orwell was. Jessica Lange has emphasized that Wells - next - - Sea production amateur dramatic society of «Brigadoon» will turn down. Liam Neeson - apparently popular with women - wearing his kilt with all the authority of a man whose great grandmother once got off the train to Edinburgh Waverley. And Auld Enemy? Wherever the Scots without them hating and blaming all? Gg Roth, Cox and Hurt should be ashamed of indulging in such racist stereotypes. "Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves" seems a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison.And at least Alan Rickman was funny.
