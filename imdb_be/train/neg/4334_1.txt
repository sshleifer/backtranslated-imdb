This film had the potential, and I was willing to give it a try, but there are so many problems in the timeline, which is so obvious. - it is difficult to swallow treated as such an idiot <br /> <br /> The Rise to Power is set in the late sixties. Carlito's Way is set in the middle and late seventies. For this film, to be realistic, it must be set in the fifties, if not to the end of the forties. <br /> <br /> The ascent to power has no signs of Gail (Penelope Ann Miller), no signs of Kleinfeld, no sign of Roland that Carlito allegedly fled from him "hey-day." None of the main characters in the original film was not in this movie. We must believe that Carlito met all these people for several years. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power Carlito ends up walking along the beach talking about retiring in paradise, which is what he wanted to do in the original film. In addition, pre-Kel creates characters Rocco and Earl - what should happen to them, because they are clearly not in the Way of Carlito? It is also difficult to understand how Carlito could have a relationship with the Italians, he is in the original film, watching the events coming to power. Where Taglialucci in this film? There are probably seven years between the two films, and he spent five of them in prison. It's like trying to put a square plug into the round hole. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story, and that they were more interested in a few bucks by making the average gangster film and cast a character named Carlito Brigante in history. The film had a few good moments, but I think they would be better to leave this film stand on its own, rather than to make it a prequel to Path Carlito. <br /> <br /> If you feel, I decided to watch this film, the only advice I can give is to not think of the film as a linear pre QUEL. Think of it like spaghetti westerns with Clint Eastwood's man with no name, in other words, two films that have the same character, but not necessarily related to each other.
