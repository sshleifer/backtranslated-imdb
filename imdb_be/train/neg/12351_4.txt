A recent post here a woman claiming to be a military background, contain comments "woman's life is not more valuable than a man." <br /> <br /> This mantra is not politically correct as history and biology of the show. The Company was able to recover from the heavy losses of the male population, sometimes with surprising speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 and 1914 despite the war in 1918 in which more than two million of its people were killed. During the war in South America, the Triple Alliance (1865), Paraguay had three neighboring countries, while almost all of its male population was destroyed, but fought to a standstill in 1932 the Chaco War against Bolivia significantly more. <br /> <br /> No society, however, has not, and could never survive the loss of its female population. Only when the life of the nation itself is threatened women sent to fight. Israel faced with the situation in 1948, but since then never looked distributive combat units for their own defense force, despite the popular image of an Israeli girl soldier. <br /> <br /> Â«GI Jane" Hollywood fluff.
