I have just recently been able to catch up with Marilyn Miller movies, as they are not shown on the in UK.I were very intrigued for many years, because it was one of the superstars 20s.What it was really like some of the stars of this .Dl era as Zholsona part of the magic is still shines, but, alas, not for dancing Miller.Her seem awkward and poorly choreographed, her singing is somewhat limited, and as an actress she does Ruby Keeler seem like Hepburn.Even worse this film as the public is tired from musicals virtually all musical numbers were deleted.S o we are left with the comedy of this period with little real appeal.She paid $ 500,000 for it! so that I have only two conclusions. or it was poorly served by the cinema or it did not have any talent at all.I think that the truth is closer to later than the first.
