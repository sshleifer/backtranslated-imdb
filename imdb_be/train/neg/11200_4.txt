Good guys Webster Logophobia determine how ?? Fear of words. I can only be Logophobic. After all, a word combination of scares me more than when in the beginning of the film, the credits contain the words' Produced, Written and Directed by: "and followed by the name of one person. Think about it. There are carpenters, electricians and plumbers, but so little jack-of-all-trade. Even the most experienced directors like Scorsese and Spielberg rarely take such control over his films. But there I was, all set in my theater seat, popcorn in hand and how to observe the order when looked at me like Fastball Nolan Ryan, were the words' Produced, written and directed by Brian Helgeland. " Wow! <br /> <br /> As a film buff, I knew Brian Helgeland. As a writer, his filmograpghy over the past 10 years will be the X-ray as the company's share price of the dotcom in 1998 there were so many theatrical trouble (Assassins, postman, Conspiracy Theory), as there have been critical successes and awards (LA Confidential, Mystic River). They seemed to alternate ?? one good, one bad, so knowing that his latest film, Bloodwork was one of the most effort into the career of Clint Eastwood, I took a deep breath and hoped for the best. In retrospect, I should not have expired. <br /> <br /> Order of the Star Ledger (Helgeland in A Knight's Tale) as Alex Bernier, a priest in the order, known as the Carolingian, who summoned to Rome, where fellow priest killed in circumstances that the arch bishop thinks ?? curious. Meeting with Father Thomas (also order and played perfectly still standings Mark Addy), they began to piece together the puzzle left to premature death. <br /> <br /> priest Complicating matters is subom plot involving Marie Sinclair (played Sossamon), who escaped from the institution which was the result of her attempts to kill Alex during an exorcism. Alex has feelings for Mara, and for some reason unbeknownst to the public, they were going to Rome. <br /> <br /> Nary good night sleep passes and Alex faces William Eden (Fyurmann), which states that age-old Sin Eater. Eater sin are said to be those who eat the sins of the dying man, when the church does not, thus allowing the entry into heaven. William, as luck would have it, is tired of life healing and looking for Alex to take on its role and to free him from worldly duties. Alex does not want to, but after the death of his new love, Marie, Alex is drawn to the ritual Sin Eater, to save her and the conversion is complete. Alex then looking for answers to their many questions while his father Thomas reveals Vatican conspiracy behind the passage of the powers of his friend investigator. <br /> <br /> The Order of the film is not terrible, but it's terribly boring. Were funny special effects and no connection with any of the characters. Even in the most dramatic scene - that Alex to go to a dying Mare - pale and insipid, and leave us without any emotional reaction towards the plight of the couple. Everyone seems to be talking so quietly, and do not care what the film flat lines and the smell of salt could be brought in to keep me from trying to grab a quick nap in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> So, Mr. Helgeland I ask you not to try it again. Share your vision with others and allow the more experienced to help steer you in directions that are not so narrow and selfish thinking. By the time there's nothing coming, which shows that you are capable of anything more than two. Two stars. <br /> <br />
