film Lou Ye purple butterfly is a secret organization (purple butterfly) against Japanese troops in the war torn Shanghai. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her former lover Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict, after a chance meeting. <br /> <br /> I agree with the reviewer from Paris. The film replaces confused, half-historical conflict on land, not giving the audience any reason to care about the characters and their causes. Flash time a coin is not helping the cause seems to be completely unjustified and pointless. Normally I do not mind the dark film, but the absence of light, the bones annoying rocking cam footage, and usually poor shooting techniques really make it a hard film to watch and stay interested. I also agree with the audience from Georgia that the film "has a chaotic style editing and claustrophobic cinematography", but I do not think it helps the movie. The background to the film is one of the most powerful events of the 20th century, and I do not believe you can do it any justice, editing it, as if it was a film directed by Michael Bay. Overly melodramatic moments do not add it watchability. <br /> <br /> The actors all suitably melancholy. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that it has an extremely limited range of acting as she spends the entire film does what it seems to be doing better in all his films, thoughtful and looking generally annoyed. However, at least it adds some variety to the role and participation in chainsmoking worst scenes of love-making, as Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton in Terminator. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very disappointing, especially seeing as it comes from the director of the Suzhou it. 2/10
