I'm a fan prior best of the best films. But this was terrible. Not surprisingly, I did not have such a hard time to find it. I tried 4 video stores until I found a copy of this film. Action was awful, the story was a joke, and the action was bad as well. <br /> <br /> I miss Alex Grady Travis Brigham and kickboxing original characters and themes that this film was the first 2 films. <br /> <br /> John
