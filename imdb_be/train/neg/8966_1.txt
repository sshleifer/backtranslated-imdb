The original "Cube" is a fantastic movie is rich in B-paranoia, fleshy features, and more fine-stamp statements. It's terrible, mysterious and cool. And it should be fine by itself, without the stupid sequels like "Cube Zero". <br /> <br /> This is the third (!) in the movie Cube series is part of a new tire (most boring traps recycled), part of the aberration. It takes a bold step to explain that the cube - that was never revealed in the first film - but, as said, an explanation bland, I would like it kept secret. There are some potentially interesting links on the society that exists outside of the cube, but they never develop for hints about some political-religious totalitarian state. Thus, there is little social commentary there feels flat and focused. <br /> <br /> What works? In principle, nothing. Acting purely amateur hour, Shagan slowly (much of the film consists of two nerds watching the screen?) And Gore effects, while disgusting, is not able to convince. In short, the "Cube Zero" reminded me of the "Cube" fan fic, neglect and babble clone a good film, which, of course, do not need a sequel.
