I was hoping that this film will be mildly entertaining, as well as other types of the genre. Nevertheless, he was lame, and I do not consider myself to laugh a lot. See it on HBO, may be, or if you have a free rental for waste and you need a movie to pass the time. But I do not recommend paying to see it. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and straightforward, and it might be funny, maybe, if the script was better. Jason Lee can be fun, and it gets a few laughs here and there, but the movie falls flat. Just do not see it. The guide is dim, but for what it is, the direction is not so important. I think its main drawback is that it's just not very funny. Watch something else, do not waste your time here.
