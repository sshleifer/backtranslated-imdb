There are bad movies, ie movies that are so bad that they are almost art. This is one of those films. My partner and I still somehow shell shocked, you know, looking into space, drooling! You can tell that the people involved (I hope they have changed their names to protect themselves) had a blast, and they are definitely not shy. I give it three out of ten only because of the gratuitous smut and gore very bad effects. I laughed throughout most of the film, so I guess you could say that he showed me a good time. Beware of the viewer, the above words in no way explains that this is a good film, because it is not. All I can say in my defense, it was impossible to miss the film with such a great name!
