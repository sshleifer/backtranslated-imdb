This movie makes no sense at all, there are plot holes big enough to drive a huge ship NYPD later. Symbols do not act in any suitable form whatsoever. Deposit your comments in the chat board, but to save time and money, this is nonsense. I can not stand it when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on a flash explosion equipment and uses fancy editing and great music, and does not hurt to have a story that hangs together, even at the most basic level. But it's nice to see Denzel W. prevail over a person who comes in 3 flavors, Jodie Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Captain Von Trapp. There is even a sweet little kid with a video game, which is nice.
