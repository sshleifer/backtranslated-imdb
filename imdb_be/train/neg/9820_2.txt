I am glad that some people liked it, but I hated this movie. It was a very good idea for the storyline, but that's where it ended. It was poorly written, poorly acted and poorly done. <br /> <br /> He had some interesting moments of the story, but they were just passed too quickly, the authors need to understand that to keep and expand these bits as lying, why she was kidnapped, and ditches slag. Instead it was "what's going on?" After 5 seconds, they tell you. <br /> <br /> This film was not unknown, and I was sad from beginning to end. I just wanted to finish. <br /> <br /> Go and rent suffering, or better-designed plans, if you want to suspend or twists that keep you guessing until the end.
