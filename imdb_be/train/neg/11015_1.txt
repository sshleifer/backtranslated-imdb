I foolishly read the back of the DVD cover of the film at Best Buy for about a year ago, and said to himself: "It seems funny, plus he has a Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose!" I continued to pay $ 15.99 plus tax for it. I took it to the home of friends, and we both stood in horror how bad it was written and acted. Wooden presentation abound. All the "fun" and "excellent" speech promised never seemed to come. After 90 minutes, I lowered my head in shame, knowing that I could never get that 90 minutes or $ 15.99 back. I literally almost cried as well, because if it were something that could be considered a "comedy" I do not want to believe in the movie more. My friend and I are constantly informed our friend from the horror of this film to such an extent that he needed to see it just to see how bad it was. During the holiday season this year, I watched it with him, because he did not want to watch it alone. That was my next terrible mistake, because, as I watched, I was just angry. I started yelling at the movie and I'm not one to talk with the period movies. Everyone I know that even flashed the film agreed to his worst they have ever seen. A sense of humor is sick and twisted, and often insults his friends, but could not save this film even. The fact that this film is not to lower the top 100 on the IMDb strange. The fact that his approval rating (at the time of this writing) is 3.6, a crime against humanity.
