... but it's just not working, and I am surprised to see how many people consider it a good one. On what basis? There are some free hints here and there, but all of the material on their own indulgent and unconvincing. Lynch's films are usually intriguing, because they create a sense of confusion and yet, very playful, doing this. There are some visual sense, there are some plot lines, characters, ideas, etc. But it's boring and let meaningless. Because all that is to examine it either "small" or too far-fetched, or simply said earlier in excellent shape. It's just the DV Lynch studying, nothing else, it should be treated like this. 1/10
