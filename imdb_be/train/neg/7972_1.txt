I love B movies..but come .... it is not worth even a class ... The ending was dumb ... B / C was NOT the real ending !!! .. not to mention the fact that we are talking about life itself ... I do not mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic forces ?? Slow as hell, but then they just start killing the characters one by one in the time period of 15 minutes ... and I'm not even going to start killing things from a guy without a head .... and you can not even see that Jigsaw even makes him a so-called "new puzzle" .... If you do not have anything better to paint ... Id hours dry before Id recommend this God-forgotten movie anyone else ... oh, and make it even better than the other film totem you can see that the guy throws the one being in the basement scene with window..that was funny as hell, and is probably the only good part watch that film waste
