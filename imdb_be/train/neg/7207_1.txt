I was a big fan of the original cartoon series, and I look forward to finally see the gadget on the big screen - but I have never in their wildest dreams expected something so very, very scary. The pace was too fast, there was no plot, and "militant teetotaler! - what the hell is this ?? It was 'WOWSERS !!'.
