Given the history of the director of this film, it is difficult to believe that it was so painfully bad movie to sit through. I was at the European premiere last night, and one of the executive producers were there. He had not yet seen the film, and boy, it was a surprise. I have not read the book, it is based on, and I do not know when he is praised and appreciated, but I read the "mandolin captain Correll" and given how bad that was adapted for the screen and how bad this movie was, I I can only assume that something like this has happened here. Acting is not bad, though, that there were a couple too many raised eyebrows by Farrell. Honestly, I can not believe how little I cared for any character in this film. Situations play on the screen in an empty sequence of non-existence. Donald Sutherland portion includes a few scenes where he opens the door, he said something, and close it again. I kept looking at the clock when I was not cowering in a dialogue on the screen. I never went to a movie, but I was tempted to start during this. I gave this movie rating of "2" for reasons that seem awfully shallow for me, but it's the best thing that I can say about this film. First of all, I really enjoyed the all-too-short scenes of the earthquake, and the second, that Salma Hayek got naked and looked beautiful. I can tell, there is little positive about this film. Do not ask anything of dust, he can not talk!
