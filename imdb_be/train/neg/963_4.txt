"Chances Are" is a big mistake to see. You might know the director Emile Ardolino with "Dirty Dancing" and "for Sister Act" is to be expected that something funny on it. But I think I have to disappoint you. He did a very, very bad film. <br /> <br /> According to a story by Christopher McDonald dies for post-combustion as a child. The child grows up, Robert Downey Jr. and Jr. returns to his former hometown, where she meets her former daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson (complex, huh?). <br /> <br /> They fall in love with each other. Then there Jr's ex-wife, Cybill Shepherd, Jr. and falls in love with her too. I believe that I did not even mention the fact that she loves Ryan O'Neal. <br /> <br /> In one of his first roles, Robert Downey Jr. at his worst. It copies the Michael J Fox <br /> <br /> After the pastor "moonlighting" proves that it is not appropriate to be in the movies <br /> <br /> In any case, there is one thing this unfunny comedy .. it can be used: as an antidote to insomnia.
