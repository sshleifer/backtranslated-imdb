"Children Like These» could be a decent movie, considering the subject. But instead he was below average, mediocre TV movie of the week, with not much going for it. The current stale, predictable plot and direction of a non-existent. For the best film on the same subject, try the excellent «Le huitième Jour», a film that really cares about people with Dauna- syndrome. The "Kids Like These» they are simply used as a basis for sentimental sentimentality. Pretty awful. 1/10
