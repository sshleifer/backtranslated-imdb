It was a strange film. He started very well. Solid soundtrack behind flash images of gore and mayhem, as our psychopath has done his job. <br /> <br /> Next is his "fall down" So I could say that I was for real cheese «B» cinema. Bad actions, I mean, how hard to bear arms and act like a cop? These guys could not. After the death scene of our psychopath we get credit opening and the film begins ... <br /> <br /> Since then, he is bad big tits, occasional bucket of blood and bad made the death scene. <, Br /> <br /> However, I gave the film four, because, despite its shortcomings, he did keep the kind of horror that I just could not lose. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, but I have to admit that there seems to be worse.
