Sometimes I do not understand what makes directors think if they make a movie ... I had an injury after watching Welcome (2007), and thought that they would not do it again. But after loading the strange promo, Tashan, finally ended as a heart attack <br /> <br /> Such strange 3 song promo -. Dil Haar, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ..... and that was in the film? Zero History, predictable plot, a lot of tricks and Akshay Kumar anything interesting, except for watching Kareena after significant weight loss ... !!! <br /> <br /> Musically another major disaster ... in the music album they have spent time on giving these pathetic little dialogues 4 Joker, and they did not think to give the background a song from the scene when Akshay Kumar doing tricks .. .! the song is so good, quite comparable with Tashan Maine and that is not accepted in the music album !!! :-( If you want to watch this movie, I'd say, watch it listen to that background song that goes something like ... "Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ... <br /> <br /> In general, very disappointed even with how Bhaiyyaji made an attempt to speak bad English! <br /> <br /> Go man, I need to puke!
