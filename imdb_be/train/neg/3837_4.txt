I've seen (too) many clicks from the company - is one of the middle of the pack. One good side, its a little more stylized and controlled than some of their fare - less than a babbling attempts at humor and more attachment to history (for what its worth). Many of their names like Sexy Sixth Sense, buried baaaad performances and amateur sensuality. On the other hand, I found that the simulated sex scenes are not as hot as some of his other films (eg, Vampire Vixens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mrs. Frankenstein). <br /> <br /> Misty Mundae always 10 meter on Peter as Darian Caine. I found Barbara Joyce hot-MARM school kind of way, and chop LaRocca sexy little beauty. <br /> <br /> Look at it with the remote firmly in your (free) hand, at night, if you need a break from porn. Do not waste your time, wanting to check out the story - you have better things to do w / your life. This is not a movie, it's clean water T & A, but not bad for this standard.
