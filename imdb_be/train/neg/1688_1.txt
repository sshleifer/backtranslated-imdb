Gee, that crappy movie it was! I can not understand what people find so frightening about «The Grudge». The director plays a trick (I must admit, very good, that led to a life very stylized), and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again. As a result, I started several times in the first quarter of this film, but as soon as I knew that I almost fell asleep drill as The Grudge became more and more predictable in the match. In conclusion, I can say that there are many better films in the genre to begin with, that the so-called precursor of «The Ring» was way worse and what to buy a ticket for «The Grudge» is a waste of money.
