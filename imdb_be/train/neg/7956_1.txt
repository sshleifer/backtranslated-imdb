This film should be number one on the bottom 100. The acting is so awful that when my son and I looked like we almost physically ill. And the story is worse. I could go on and on about how it's bad, but all I wanted to do is to add a warning frankbob review as I do not see anyone else go into trouble to do it again. Do not waste your time, money, energy or anything else on this movie. Thank God, we've seen it on TV, so we do not waste it. If we had, I would have been forced to write the person responsible for this abomination and will be forced to throw a curse in their general direction. In conclusion, I would like to say that I have always enjoyed watching Carrie Fisher act. But I'm sad to say that it is not worth watching in this particular film. Do not spoil your mind about Kerry, viewing it.
