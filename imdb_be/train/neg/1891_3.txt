A documentary film about the nomadic Persians make the treacherous traverse massive mountains to get their herds on the grass. Watching the silent, black and white, feature partially overshadowed by a blink-blink-handsome Oriental scores, which could not be used in the original show, even more boring than it sounds. Spectacular scenery is lost on the small black and white screen, and there is a complete failure to establish any kind of storyline. I loved Nanook of the North, and March of the Penguins, but despised the film, in spite of the similarity of theme. some physical difficulties simply not interested.
