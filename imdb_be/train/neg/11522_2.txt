Firstly, the title character is not even the main character of the film. He is a cult leader Koresh. The actor, who draws Igor thought that scream loudly, laughing hysterically, and with a wry smile, while bugging your eyes will be a great way to scare people. Igor also had an annoying habit of yelling (because he never talked only) in a high pitched voice. He would also like to say idiotic acuity. For example, if the cult of the leader of the murder of one of his followers with the buzz saw Igor, I saw it, yelling "Paul! Lot Sex! Why would you do that? I could cut it clean! So clean! "In another scene, Igor tells the victim that she would have to" get their own tools for surgery, because right now, it was his time to act. In addition to the bad action, the end did not make sense, because while history creates what little steam it to a climax that Igor gets crossbow shooting in the head, and the rest of his crazy friends was killed, he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining "good guys". the film does not give any explanation for this only tells the viewer that Igor has escaped from a psychiatric th hospital. What ??? The bottom line is, do not waste your time watching this movie. I would go back I lost moments watching this.
