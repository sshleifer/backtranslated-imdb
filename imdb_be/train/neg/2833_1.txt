Because of the film Derek, viewers receive only what they expect. Paper thin plot and a few shots at Mrs. Derek naked. "Ghosts can not make it just that. The first fifteen minutes is the usual TV drama, as long as Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor with extensive experience in many different roles, but it seems that even a famous actor should work just for the money time. After all, Derek contrary, always plays a very beautiful young woman, with or without clothes. The film is a waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see a naked woman or bad ur , Rent any porn movie.
