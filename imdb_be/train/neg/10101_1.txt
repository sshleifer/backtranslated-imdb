Notice that I gave it 1 star if the option was given, I would give it a zero. I put the DVD into my TV and sat down on the couch, I expect that some of the worst filmmaking at its finest. I watched this movie on IMDb and saw that it was the worst movie rated, so I guess I went into it every critical error. But that does not prepare me for the crap that was going to throw out my TV screen. <br /> <br /> The box makes this film to watch ?? at best, well OK. Do not let that fool you. This film should be banned from all the shelves around the world. <br /> <br /> The best way I can describe this film as porn, but no sex scenes in it. Actions (if you can call it), the "conspiracy" (as many holes should look like Swiss cheese) and the special effects are really just awful. <br /> <br /> Please do not seem to me to make this film because you think it will be funny to watch. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm not saying that I can do a better film than this, but I mean it.
