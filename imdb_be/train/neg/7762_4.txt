Given, John Doe, obviously inspired by the creator Kyle XY, I expect that it will be very interesting pilot. However, I'm probably too high expectations, because I was very disappointed with this. Firstly, they have turned into a monster hero, who had the crazy idea of ​​showcasing her amazing knowledge of the audience, in public places. Thus, after this scene, I began to worry, it was just fun. But the problem is even worse, as none of the other characters were not properly represented. They focused too much on John Doe, who made history of far less intriguing. I was also a little disappointed with the performance of Dominic Purcell, because I found that he did not believable John Doe. Another problem was the story of the police. It really felt like deja vu, and it was not a pleasant feeling. This brings us to the worst questions regarding episodic format. I've seen vehicles that come one after the other. <br /> <br /> So all in all I was very disappointed with this and do not recommend to anyone. Given how bad it was, I understand better now why the show was canceled. Somehow I got the impression that he missed his target, character development, to help the protagonist to find their own identity. It's sad, because there was the potential, as well as the people he met at the club. Production quality was also quite good and the rejection of the right. But I'll never know if it's even better, probably not, because I'm not going to watch the next episode.
