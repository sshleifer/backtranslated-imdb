I noticed, "Fire" was on cable the other night, and I started to look, because I could not do anything concrete about it, but me remember it being a terrible movie when I saw it back in 85 to remember. Twenty years later, the film was still awful. In addition, synthesizer, saxophone was the most common instrument in pop music during the 1980s, as can be seen in the title of the song. Hearing the song again I wanted to stick a screwdriver in my ears until the end of the sound flour, apply to them. And to compound this musical assault of Rob Lowe's character played the saxophone, and there was one scene where he played solo, which went on and on, it was Charlie Parker, but his high-pitched tone and play more like a monkey playing Kazuo. All the characters were highly unattractive, although I must say they did a great job casting equally unattractive actors to portray them. Actually, I thought that was attractive Mare Winningham, and at first I felt sorry for her character because she was wearing underwear fun but towards the end of the film, she decided to have sex with the character of Rob Lowe, who is likely to be voted most likely convey various sexual diseases, when such things were to vote.
