Direction was clearly stated that the idea of ​​the film and the plot is completely original .... but as for those who have read «Slam Dunk» comic, we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes ... <br / > <br /> Another note himself Jay Chou did not know kung fu, he just will not leave anyone indifferent, when he tries to act like he is, many people are now able to see the differences .. Fortunately, the film does not contain a lot of kung- Fu fighting and many are Enchanced of stunners and visual effects ... <br /> <br /> I think that acting D EYA still a pain to watch, especially when almost everyone else in the movie so much better. The only reason I think why the main actor Jay just because of its popularity. <br /> <br /> In spite of how much I want to stop someone from viewing it, thus making it a «Orginal» movie to get what he should not have, it has become one of the best budget films in China this year.
