First of all, let me be frank. I did not watch the whole film. I watched the first five minutes, and when I realized that I almost fell off to sleep, I decided that perhaps as fast forward and see if he got more fun later ... This is not the case. This movie is just a collection of lame attempts to make history, which is already uninteresting and poorly told that he would never become: a decent horror film. Because I feel that it is important to say that even a movie with bad special effects can still be good if it is well done. This film is not only put you into a deep sleep, when you are trying to view. Finally, I feel that it is important to say that I think that this film is in the public domain, so if you feel that you must absolutely look than littlesearch the Internet, of course, will show you a place where you You do not need to pay to see this pile of cinematic manure.
