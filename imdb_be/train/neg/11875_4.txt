Hmmm, not a big stack of pancakes sound good? Maple syrup and canned fruit on top. Take a piece. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. Another. Another. EAT. EAT it, thank you !!! Continue raking his throat, while the face is green with nausea. You just had the experience of Ally McBeal. <br /> <br /> I stumbled on this show in the winter of '98 and was instantly hooked. How does this stack of pancakes, I gorged myself on it. But the joy soon vanished, because the character Ally McBeal (which we see to be nice and to conquer at first sight) will soon become the most annoying, dangerous, whining complainer you will ever meet. (Call me a feminist, but I prefer my woman leads to the spine.) Gags & tricks show also was beaten, music Vonda Shepherd (who actually pushed into the face) becomes grating and ongoing changes and rewrites to make the show in the damn soap opera. <br /> <br /> My advice to you is to take the show in small doses, and to quit smoking as soon as it gets annoying (and will). I did it in 2.5 seasons before my pleasure was completely spoiled. It was good while it lasted, but as crazy, neurotic ex-girlfriend so it has turned ugly after she overstayed his welcome. <br /> <br /> And the next time you go to IHOP, skip the pancakes. Make something healthy like fruit cups. He will sit with you much better.
