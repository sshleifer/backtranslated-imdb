I think I've seen this movie, but do not quote me as I may have fallen asleep during his show, as it was not quite "grip my excitement and imagination." At least I know I saw enough to know, I will not watch it again soon. Or ever. <br /> <br /> Jeez, talk about the lame ... Really lame. Completely inaccurate. It would not even refer to the six. It basically had no standing dramatic impact. Sheesh. Nada. Just shlock turned into dreck. Comedy? This was supposed to be a comedy? I coulda fooled me-ee-ee ...! <br /> <br /> Now that the aliens were insatiable carnivorous, like in the film "Critters", we could have human characters do something deeper than to be too smug coy ... like yelling and screaming and running for their lives that they would not eat so the story can be something more exciting than watching paint dry. <br /> <br /> do not bother watching it. It's not worth the effort. You can find something more interesting to do. Like watching paint dry. Or falls asleep.
