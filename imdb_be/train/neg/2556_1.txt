Well, it all has been said about this film, and I hate it when writing reviews where everyone else has said, what should be said. But the fact is that I have seen countless movies, and I'm working on writing reviews on all the films that I've seen. Thus, I have to write something. <br /> <br /> To act foolishly. It's really stupid, like a news anchor expressed his sorrow in relation to the plane crash. Nun nice, although a professional assistant who comes to care for the child. three major killing in the film just so weak that you wonder how stupid are the creators of this film will be. They do not understand that even rip-off can still be scary. We do not see how killing Granpa. Dentist and his assistant made me feel that they deserve to die, you just do not sympathize with them. Uncle Tony's garage die in a way that could have worked better. We only hear his cry, and we do not see anything!
