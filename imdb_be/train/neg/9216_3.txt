Hoo boy, this was a real test to pass. The housing has a DVD Tom Hanks mug plastered on it, and this is the only reason that someone will buy. He looks about forty on the field, however, the film was made in 1982, so he still has his best friends' doing and, of course, about forty pounds lighter. The site belongs to the Dungeons and Dragons, as the games that are played Hanks and his three friends, and Hanks completes think it all really. Chris Makepeace boy genius named Jay Jay and the best thing about the film is that it is a series of funny hats. Oh, look, it has a yellow hard hat on a tuxedo! Now he is dressed as a pilot of the First World War! It was really a terrible movie, but in poor condition. Beam vets emerge mainly as the parents of children. There Anne (I Honey West, dammit!), Francis and Louise Sorel, who actually looks sort of hot. Murray Hamilton, Mayor of jaws has ingrate roll as policeman. Crewson, love interest to Hanks and some blonde guy I had never seen before or since. There is not some annoying music here and there, and absolutely no stress or feelings of danger or excitement. There is a monster that only Hanks can see, because he, you know, nuts. Monster is played by the late, great Kevin Peter Hall, he Predator fame. My friend got it with the PR "discount bunker in MallWart and told me to throw it in the garbage, not even looking at it, so naturally, I had to see if it was as bad as all that. It was. The night before, I watched Apollo 13, so after that, the film was a bit of a shock. Do yourself a favor and leave it in the trash. Oh, and after Hanks almost jumping from one of the towers of the World Trade Center because of his delusion, he returns home to recuperate and visit his friends. Hanks mother, drunk Vera Miles, says that he is coming along nicely now, but when they go down to the lake, to visit him in tennis suit, it is madder than ever. end
