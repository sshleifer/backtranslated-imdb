The protagonist of Lance Burton is killed and the sky ahead of time. If the sky finds an error, it is given the body of a deceased rich old man and white, Mr. Wellington. <br /> <br /> A young black man in a white mans old body still behaves as a young black man, maybe funny when you see what is being done with the help of an old white actor. In this film, I ended up reminding himself several times: "Chris Rock to be the old white guyÂ» <br /> <br /> In general, the concept does not play, as suggested :. "Illusion" is not transported well and love story is not believable at all. The fact that everything you see, Chris Rock plays a young black man, because the old white man everyone should see only indicated in small scenes, is a great test for viewers' suspension of disbelief.
