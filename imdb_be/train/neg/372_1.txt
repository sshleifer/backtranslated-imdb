I saw this movie once a long time ago, and I have no desire to ever see him again. <br /> <br /> This film is about Preston Waters rigidly lucky teen who always seem to forget his family and always seems to be enough money. All this changes when the bank robber is working on the bike Preston and gives him a blank check as compensation. Preston uses a check to eliminate $ 1 million from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank robber, who gave him a check). Preston then buys the house and said that he was working as an assistant to the mysterious and wealthy patron named Mr. McIntosh (named in honor of your computer). After that, he just goes crazy with money. <br /> <br /> On paper, it sounds like a great idea. However, on the screen, this one empty films I've ever seen. On the one hand, it is too incredible. I know that some parts of the film were to be unbelievable, but I draw the line at the twelve-year-old boy, leaving thirty-year-old woman, and to be responsible for a small fortune alleged human. In addition, it was a shallow film with weak acting, predictable storyline and characters that are less memorable. The characters were either cheesy, over the top, annoying or underdeveloped. But the "Juice" was a funny character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good movie to watch with your family, you can skip this one.
