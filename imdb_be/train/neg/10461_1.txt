It is interesting to read the comments from the audience regarding Omega Code ... many overwhelmingly positive reviews were taken almost word for word from the transmission TBN ... film looks as if it was made to go directly to the video to be stocked, but three -Frequently series delight that has been done by other religious group in the 70s .. I do not remember it? You will not remember this one, or a year or two. This is the first film I've ever seen, which meant that it was your religious duty to go to him and buy as many tickets as possible in order to save souls ... very shameful ... it just goes to show that if you are the son of televangelists, you can also play at the high roller Hollywood producer of pouring give tithes OLE money ...
