I could not say when the "Screaming Skull" Hitchcock is trying to be a rip off or a modernized tribute to Edgar Allan Poe. These days, who would have chopped it up a bit, and presented it as one of the TV episodes of the anthology of the old «Tales From The Dark Side" ... but only after extensive rewriting. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is, there seems to be a good, nasty little story of trying to get out from under the rubble of the film and the actors are obviously doing their best, and with their talent and material, they have to work. But the director did not know how the scene or the rate of dramatic scenes ; effects simply does not work, the script telegraphed his hackneyed story so clearly that the butterfly could see and the next, and the soundtrack went on to play the German «oompah band" music, when she was trying to scare the audience <br /> <br /> They tried;. they tried really hard, but it is of interest only as a period piece.I imagine someone very much. young, who has not seen a lot of uncertainty and fear can get charged with "screaming skull", but someone young, probably did not get the majority of the subtext, or the motivation of the plot. ( "Mom, why is this a good man trying to scare winding dual Scaredy-cat lady ??")
