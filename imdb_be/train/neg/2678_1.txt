There is nothing positive to say. Meandering nonsense, huffing and puffing with the "message". New Russian (former Soviet) films can be very good (Cuckoo comes to mind), but many of them have a bunch of cardboard and aftertaste of asbestos (Nochnoi Watch is a good example). This is the "Watch" type of void. Responsibilities would be terrible if not saving grace quite unattractive and incompetent directions editing, sometimes it's so bad that it detracts from impotence actors. Special award for cameraman making sure every shot is questionable (someone needs to understand that the Blair Witch Project has 15 seconds undeserved glory?) And takes aim at the lack of attention seat teenagers falling down on CounterStrike and masturbation. The female lead is trying to look seductive and too often, the man in need antihero diction coach (although genetics is not bad :. Most expressive eyes) one (middle) finger to piles of irrelevant non-art. Anyone who sees it is better to be positive (a distant) cousin "of film directors."
