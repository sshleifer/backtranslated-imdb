The plot of the death of young children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the murder. In the film, it appears that he has some problems with his daughter. In the end, a serial killer caught. That's all. But before we find out who dunnit, you should see some terrible acting by all the actors. It's unbelievable how bad these actors, including Hopper. I could go on in the same spirit, but that the majority of my time waste. Just do not watch the movie. I warned you.
