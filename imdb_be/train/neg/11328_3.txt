Every once in a while I'll shoot / adventure activities as well as a way to relax and take your mind of anything important. That is why I have a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - not quality of the film, but it makes me laugh and makes me relax for a while. One of these days I'll probably buy a copy of The Princess Bride, and some Monty Python movies for the same reason. <br /> <br /> In any case, I rented this movie because I wanted to have fun, it is not disputed, for the most part, I got what I wanted. The site has been something along the lines of poorly written episode of Xena, and acting on Kathy Long was very amateur theater (not bad for a professional kickboxer and amateur actress). There were several high points on the part of the cyborg. Somehow they were able to get some pretty good actors to play bad guys. - unfortunately, most of them die rather quickly repaired <br /> <br /> Like most martial arts films, the further you get in the movie, the more emphasis is on action and the plot (which was not strong to begin c) degrades almost as fast, how to act. However, the more Kathy Long fights, the more time the director devotes her ass. By the end of the movie I was seriously considering to watch it a second time just to count the number of times the tight red shorts Kathy Long were at the center of the screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there just was not enough meat to make this film, to make the appropriate curiosity worth seeing the film for the second time. If you are a hard core fan of Xena needs something Wile away a few hours - by all means, go to the store and spend .50 cents per rental. There are some strong similarities between the show and this film. <br /> <br /> Just nothing more than a little surprised to be within a few hours is not expected. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you happen to like ass Kathy Long. Then you can purchase a copy.
