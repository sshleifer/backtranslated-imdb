These reviews, which say that this movie is so bad it is good way to go overboard with that. This film is not gloating hazard that Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gili had. These films were entertaining their awfulness, but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad it is painful. I was not in that much pain to watch a bad movie, because I was watching the baby genius and Superbabies. Before you begin the review, let me tell you a story. Theodore Rex million dollar bust $ 35 New Line Cinema has refused to put in theaters. They reduce the loss by sending it directly to video, making it the most expensive film directly to video for decades. Whoopi be buckled in the crash after the huge wage <br /> <br /> The plot :. Millionaire dinosaur clones, so that it can launch missiles at the sun, which will kill the mankind and begin another Ice Age. Woman cop named Katie Coltrane and stupid dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a friend of a dinosaur. <br /> <br /> The plot is given to you at the beginning of the film, which robs the film all his secrets. Then you have to deal with the fact that this film is actually quite horrible. Whoopi looks nervous and tries to wing her performance, but to no avail. Theodore Rex thins annoying and awkward behavior wears thin after five minutes on the screen. Most of the jokes revolve around him threatens to bite people and hit people with his tail (in the accident and on purpose). I thought that the attacker was bad, but it takes a back seat to Theodore Rex :. Whoopi worst film career <br /> <br /> Do not let anyone tell you that this ugliness is bad enough to be enjoyable. I did not see that when I watched this movie. All I saw was a train wreck that was written by people who were supposed to have a morbid fascination with the movie Howard the Duck. Humor on this level, and Theodore Rex looks inbred cousin Barney. Through painful from start to finish.
