The easiest way to describe this film as a satire. The purpose of satire is very wide, from the US government in corporate America. In addition, not searing satire, but a foolish one. <br /> <br /> Think about this film as a mixture between film Kentucky Fried, aircraft and a series Police Squad, made with a much smaller budget, but not as funny. I can see how this film is a satire of many movies sci-fi disaster of the 50s and 60s. I see this film as a major influence on Mars Attacks Tim Burton. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple enough. Genetically giant tomatoes are "crazy" and started to attack people and the city. The ground cover is, and then it subsides into war <br /> <br /> The film controls the characters and gamut characteristics :. Lois «Fairchild» (a clone of Lois Lane), a very ambitious president's press secretary, Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (FIA agent, who has not worked since the Bay of Pigs), president of useless (which seems to be only in order to sign his name and attack New York), even inept Congress sleazy CEO marketing and Mason's team, consisting of smooth East German "female" swimmer, diver, mad world war II paratrooper and expert African-American camouflage (masquerading George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Mr. tler and finally, like tomatoes). Perhaps I forgot to mention, lots and lots of tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes from small tomatoes, tomatoes in a giant plastic to broken tomatoes, tomato juice, and finally, people dressed as tomatoes. <br /> <br /> In addition to all this, you have a few musical numbers as well. They are not as good, and seems to be duplicated. Best Tone to date the film's theme ( "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"). It's too flashy, and you might end up humming or singing in public. Be warned. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is quite funny and shows the absurdity of the different situations, as well as various entertainment genres. I do not believe that I had to laugh, but mainly smiled and scratched his head. I would definitely recommend this film for fans of B and C grade films, but only as a rental. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
