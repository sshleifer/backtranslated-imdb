Odd slasher film from producer Charles Band. In the days of the greatest success Full Moon Group says that he will never do the "real killer films," because he felt that little dolls and big monsters added element of fantasy that made the films better - people kill each other, so that the actual and less fun. Good philosophy and a true shame that the Band, destroying the studio Full Moon through possible shoddy business relationship has become so desperate for a home theater arrived, he began to do exactly what wanted like Blockbuster and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality. The team behind this also worked on 'Delta Delta Die! and "The Rite of birth" - are both equally fresh standards Full Moon. Debbie Rochon on the usual top form here as a novice in the gang dude and dudettes, who have decided to make up a story about the "murder of the club." It is - as one might obviously - that's all it can to join, and then panic because it was not a true story and silly Ms Rochon believed, and now all will run to get into the blood and possibly killed each other or may be not. The choice is with regard to this film it for you ... it is not recommended, but not really bad.
