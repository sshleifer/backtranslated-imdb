Rick Sloane was allowed to make five films more difficult to believe than cold fusion. This film is absolutely criminal. Before watching this movie I thought Manos: the fate of arms was worse piece of shit I've ever seen, but at least, Manos is moving so slowly that you can fall asleep, thereby saving the eyes from the pain she would suffer. The biggest tragedy of this movie is that old man who keeps house "locked" up making it to the final stage. The time I spent watching this film was an absolute waste of my life.
