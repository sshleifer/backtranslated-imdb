Just another Jason Lee film, were some of the films that were funny. The subtext of the move to live on the edge, I guess. These types of movies that I think 14-year-old girl looking at a slumber party. It was all right movie. It's kind of one of those movies that you have in place in the back and watch every now and then, if something attracts attention. I think that Julia Stiles and Selma Blair is a good combination, and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot. It just kind of boy meets girl movie. This is the perfect movie, they will point to Comedy Central. I am glad that I have not seen this movie in the theater, I would be angry. But I think that's why I did not see it in the theater.
