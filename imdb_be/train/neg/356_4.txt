film form is that of the unknown Shocker. There are surprises, twists and turns, reversing and excitement. Sometimes it really is "edge-of-seat 'film. But it is disappointing and upsetting heavily <br /> <br /> villain entirely believeable. his character is not holding together. I refuse to "spoil" the movie, but I can only say that the character we meet in the beginning, simply can not be the one we see in the end. <br /> <br /> The second major disappointment of the film is that --finally, it becomes a little bit more, that the bloody slasher. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the "Friday the 13th" movies. Not that every film should always be completely tasteful, but this film does drip Gore about. <br /> <br /> Although the film shows beautiful Sean Connery, even he does not measure up to his usual standard, and often just seems to be going through the steps.
