I go to a lot of movies, I often take a 5-year old son, I am so glad I did not bring him to it. There are many references to the floor and bathing nude scenes, but it's not the main reason, I would not take it back to him. Trailers lead you to believe that this light-hearted comedy; Nevertheless, almost all of the fun moments in the preview. I kept waiting for it to get interesting, funny or anything, but seriously; however, I almost fell asleep, as the plot at least the story dragged on. I understand that a dog can be a big company, that being said, the whole story is centered on a poorly behaved dog that the owners were not savvy enough to exercise. If a person has caused this much damage and chaos, that person will be denied. The worst film I've ever seen with Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson, wasting their talent. The best way to sum up this film, the couple gets naughty dog, the couple falls in love with a dog, the dog dies, it's time to get bored. End.
