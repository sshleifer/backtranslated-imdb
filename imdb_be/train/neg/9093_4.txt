I saw this movie for the first time today, and I've never heard of it before, probably because of his poor communication. <br /> <br /> First of all, pretty good directing, the actors played well and CGI (I'm not a fan of CGI) fine. But this in itself does not make the movie. None of history in general, or one message at a beautiful exploited talents. <br /> <br /> Or do I have to get people to remember, art director, not only the vision, but to know how to tell a story. And this is what is missing as many as 7 minutes. <br /> <br /> There for a simple 4 rating.
