For a film with so many promises that this was a disappointment, thin plot and act in a range of horrific and unbelievable.The plot had more holes in it than Swiss cheese, and this is the worst clichéd endings I've seen in a movie for some time. The final scene broke my heart when the entire movie was not so painful to start with. I was speechless! From the very first scene - one was left wondering if the sister is trying to reach out to her counterpart for help, or just to scare her to death, which would have been better for the spectators and saved us from the worst two hours of acting I «ve seen so far. It was a horror in the true sense of the word.
