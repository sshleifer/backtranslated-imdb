This movie is terrible. Bad action, bad writing, bad music. It's just awful. Not only is it incredibly misrepresentative role-playing games, but the key elements of the film performed poorly. May God, I do not believe in the mercy of the soul unfortunate wretches who became pregnant and gave birth to this mess.
