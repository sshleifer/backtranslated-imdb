This is truly one of the worst movies ever. I consider myself a big fan of zombie movies and usually tolerate bad acting, lame "special effects" dumb story and everything that you may encounter in the movie a second rate if the film has a good atmosphere / history / suspension or suggest something. This one has essentially no positive aspect to it and the third or fourth course, it could be worse. Some of my friends and I made a short film during the festival week's and definitely did a better job (not a zombie movie, though). <br /> <br /> This film is not even funny, not to speak of anything else. Really bad and unnecessary special effects, zombies that look like normal people (for white extra skin pulled down over their faces, except), the way to a lot of fake blood (I love the realism of many, the combination of realism and zombie movies, controversial, but presented gusset is just stupid). The camera is fairly long with scenes feedings, it gets boring, and you can not help but wonder why the zombies use weapons (!) To kill his victim. I will not go into the details of dubbing (others did). Although I am from Germany itself, and I, at least a bit curious about the original version, I'm not going to spend more of my time with this film. <br /> <br /> Stay away from him, as far as you can.
