Located in the 70s, "Seed" centers around a convicted serial killer Max Seed (Will Sanderson), who scored 666 people for 6 years. He was sentenced to death, but the electric chair, he does not die, even after a shock three times. <br /> <br /> Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Pare) and other officials to cover up the secret hiding live Seed Seed explodes and goes after the people who put him in a living tomb. <br /> <br /> Filmed worst director in the world (Uwe Boll), Â«Seed," is nothing more than a snuff film about an attempt to stretch the envelope a decent society and not being able to put in any aspect of the storyline. And he said that it is based on real events, because if a person survives the electric chair after shocked three times, they will be free. It's an urban legend, and it would never have happened. Like other abominations in Boll ( "Alone in the Dark" for one), "Seed" is just completely terrible.
