No one goes to the movies, like The Hills Have Eyes 2, and expects that the second coming of Citizen Kane. The same is true for the majority of low-rent horror, especially Roger Ebert called the "Dead Teenager Movies." The Hills Have Eyes 2 is determined qualifies as a teenager Dead movie, only here, the teenagers received a superficial appearance of military students. <br /> <br /> Some say the line "it's only a movie," when questionable facts grown in the review of the film, but I have always firmly believed that all good imagination must be rooted in reality in order to be effective. The Hills Have Eyes 2, we believe that the main characters in the military exercises, but they look and speak like high school kids to camp in the wilderness. Dialogue terrible and often vulgar in excess. Although the films are not nearly comparable, I imagine these "soldiers" are in the platoon, and trembling with fear <br /> <br /> Very little of the character is a soldier, except rifles and camouflage :. transmitting carried out as a teenage telephone conversations; Colonel is the address as "Hey, asshole," private. And it seems no one has any idea what to do, or any sense of the command structure, when things start to go wrong. I think the soldiers in Aliens, James Cameron, the film is pure fantasy, and how even those futuristic Marines behaved like real soldiers, in spite of the fantastic situations. Fantasy rooted in reality. <br /> <br /> I try to start watching the film 5 on a 10-point scale, and to judge it's strengths and weaknesses, from there. You should allow for the assignment of the material; there is no way, Star Wars, how good of a movie as a godfather, on equal terms. But both are excellent examples of their type. <br /> <br /> In this connection, while in The Hills Have Eyes 2 pretty terrible exercise in amateur and immature writing, this is only a little worse in this regard than the typical teenager Dead Movie. On the technical side, the film seems to have a decent production values ​​and is quite well done with this point of view. Scenes that are designed to shock, or that are intended to cause the urgency or the suspension of work at all. For example, while watching The Hills Have Eyes 2 can actually be worse than death, is, of course, much worse horrors in circulation. <br /> <br /> It is worth a look for those who love this type of material is usually Fanboy without luggage, or those who are not inclined to think every movie they see, or the best ever, or the worst of all time. If you do not "get" the horror, especially the various dead teenager, you probably do not have a good time with it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
