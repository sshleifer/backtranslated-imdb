Let's take it this way. I really get this movie. I get what the writer / directer trying to do. I understand that the dialogue should be dry and indifferent. I understand that the plot was to be the culmination and stale. It was that writer / director was going for. Very very very dry humor / comedy. With all the understanding, I still think that the movie sucks. It seemed that the writer / director trying to recreate Napoleon Dynamite with this film. He had all the same function. Even the main character behaves like a Napoleon. But Napoleon Dynamite was actually funny. Her script worked. This film is not. It makes no sense. Well, let me rephrase. Its sole purpose is to thwart Napoleon Dynamite and try to capture the look and feel. It is a pity that it does not work.
