Final Justice has great Joe Don Baker running around Texas to shoot people who shoot people. Then he goes to Malta where he fires more people. He gets locked many times for taking pictures of people. Then he gets into a shootout with the bad guy, who is dressed as a monk. There is a chase boat, and Joe Don winds again in prison. Finally Joe Don by Elaine «Seinfeld» kill the bad guy, blow up a boat or two and someone gets shot with flash. All this and catchy song, just like Mitchell!
