I'll give it a 3 because it is history has shown that we need to know about in order to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the comments of Mr. UK. The film was pretty awful. All clich√©s, no real story. Historical and technical inaccuracies abound. See Technical Specifications DE 529, or any Everts class destroyer escort, and you'll see what I mean. I'm his black history month in the United States, and I'm going to be called a racist just for saying this, but the history of this ship is not so great. They make certain that accompanies the work pursued "submarine", which turned out to be cool, they rammed. Alas, but black people have done a lot more in the Second World War, it is nonsense film gives them credit. This film makes them look whiners. Let start swearing, I can handle it.
