There is the observation that one of the characters was raped to "drunken excitement" Russian soldiers, completely untrue. This film should not be given just because of this. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a statement by someone that the KGB persecution "Jews, Gypsies, etc.", which is "worse than the Nazis." KGB was looking for so-called "Zionist" agents who were (KGB believed) imperialist agents. This is completely different from the orientation of the Jewish people as a whole, as the Nazis did. Roma have never been brought to justice. The KGB was a political tool and is used politically, but also from the point of view of an internationalist. Communists do not really distinguish between nationalities. <br /> <br /> Total movie stinks like a fake. The protagonist does not speak Russian, signs in Berlin contains spelling errors, KGB general looks quite false. Some so-called "Russian proverbs" completely made up, and the list goes on and on <br /> <br /> We do not recommend to watch. - this film is full of lies and fake material. Go to the Â«Good Shepherd" instead.
