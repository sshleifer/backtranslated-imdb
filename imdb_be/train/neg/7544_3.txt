Firstly, this film was not that bad.It was interesting ... at least for me, probably all the wrong reasons. I've never seen the original so it can not compare the two. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of the strange Christopher Reeve movie Village of the Damned. Two films have different stories, but it's a terrible feeling of disgust and unintended comedy to exist as. <br /> <br /> The Wicker Man is suppose to be a mystery / thriller / men, please do not offend woman's film. I do not know, the whole thing is pagan, and the victim was at a distance. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage, it is very nice bad in a secluded island called Summerisle, when he receives a letter in calligraphy with his long-lost fianc√©e who claims that her daughter was taken and hidden by other islanders. <br /> <br /> The cage policeman and future weary cop it, he goes to the floor of an uncharted island, leaving no word of his whereabouts for those who are in the real world. Stupid. <br /> <br /> Things get more surprising when large Amish-squire women who inhabit the island growled at him and lying about the whereabouts of the missing girl. His bride will not help, who seems elusive and constantly hinder. The cell remains on the island, when he learns that the missing girl, his daughter, and he is a lucky man to cheat to come to the island as a sacrificial sickness holiday island harvest. <br /> <br /> In this film entirely in men fare so well. Sick twisted display of feminism? <br /> <br /> I found the film a ridiculous time especially when the cell strikes some women and runs in a bear suit. I think there were too many potholes in this film. I find the whole concept of angry women secluding himself on an island without any help for men is very exciting, but the way it portrayed was just amazing in this movie. While most of the women had some breakthrough pain and their anger is obviously a form of sexism. I would turn the film with disgust, if roles were reversed. This film is something to watch, can only be once or twice. This is NOT a thriller should be classified as strange.
