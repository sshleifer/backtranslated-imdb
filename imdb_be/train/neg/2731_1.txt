Really bad and easily the worst episode I have ever seen .... ever. <br /> <br /> They tried to make up for it by giving him "we know that we are doing it" routine. It would be funny if it were not for the fact that "The Simpsons" has already done it. And it still would not do for him, if they came up with the idea in the first place. <br /> <br /> Memories occurred as part (mostly in J.D) fantasy of conventional character. The memories were not real events that took place only collectors will say, J.D fall or I do not know .... Elliot fall. If I wanted to look like a collection of Scrubs, I would go on YouTube, instead of spending half an hour of his life. <br /> <br /> Scrubs, will eventually fall into the trap that most sitcoms have, and it's disappointing to me, they were able to go through 5 and a quarter of the season without an episode like this. <br /> <br /> I was hoping scrubs should not be this kind of sedentary anyone. <br /> <br /> And just as a fleeting thought, why the hell was Dr.Cox bald?
