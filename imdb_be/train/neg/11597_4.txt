I stat with the plot of Alice, having survived the previous games Nightmare series, finds the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger starting once again. This time, the taunting murderer is surprising through the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child. Its intention is to be "born again" into the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy of his dead mother, but can Alice free her spirit in time to save his son? This film really started really well, as we see, Alice wants to be Amanda Krueger, who are stuck in the room and get raped by 100 Manics then being rushed to the hospital, but then it is no longer than a pregnant woman, but then she was giving birth to Amanda Freddie again. <br /> <br /> Alice and Dan are the only two people to return from the 4th movie and then got some new friends not long before, of Freddy begin to kill again, I did like the first dead it is good, not as good as the other death or dream. <br /> <br /> Freddie himself is not giving up, Scary in this film at all, just a nightmare boring in fact they were not terrible or awful at all. <, Br /> <br /> Acting in the movie was good for 5th film in the series, but in general I think that this film was very dim. (It is not the worst film in the series, Freddy Dead is the worst) <br /> <br /> 4/10
