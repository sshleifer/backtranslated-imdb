Without a doubt, one of the worst movies I've seen in years. The story centers on four women brought to the bank robberies, which we somehow supposed to sympathize. It's hard to sympathize with characters who continue to do such stupid decisions. Oh, no, the police on us, they know who we are, what we do? ... Let's robbed more than one bank, we are here! What!?! Each character is a stereotype, and it's easy to tell who's going to end up dead.
