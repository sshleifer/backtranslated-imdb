This film bridges the fine line between satire and stupidity. While the system is the bridge, which has no rules can promote harmony in marriage is, of course, can not contribute to the victory of the bridge, so that satire does not work for me. But there are some things that I found pleasant in any case, especially with the big match of the bridge between Paul Lucas and Ferdinand Gottschalk closer to the end of the film. This is seen as very similar to the boxing match of the championship. This is not only an arena for competition in the square cordoned off the area as a boxing ring, the referee there hovers between the contestants, and radio Roscoe Karns provides continuous chatter about events. At one point he even touches "One ... Two ... Three ... Four ...", as if the proposal of the four diamonds were a knockdown event. And people were glued to the radio for all of this, the total event for championship boxing matches. This parody has worked very well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, few actors provide comedy needed to maintain the intended satire. Paul Lukas is not full of smell for comedy and miscast; lovely Loretta Young and the usual comic Frank Mack had not been given enough good line; Glenda Farrell has a good comic turn as the forgetful blonde in the beginning of the film, but it practically disappears after that. Which is a waste of talent!
