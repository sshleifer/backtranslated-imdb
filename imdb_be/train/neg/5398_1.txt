This self-indulgent mess might kill Mr. Branagh's career as an adapter for Shakespeare movie. (Released 4 years ago ,. And not squeak adaptation ever since), I just finished watching it on cable - Holy God, this is terrible <br /> <br /> I agree with the sentiments of the reviewer below who said that . considering that it is so obviously and unfortunately awful this ignoble act, which comes in a piercing. That being said, I'll take a chance, if only because * * Love's Labor's Lost is a great reward for those who overestimated the ability of Mr. Branagh directing in the past. Branagh has always been pretty lousy director: grindingly literal-minded; star impressed; unforgivable ungenerous his fellow actors (he loves his American stars, but to love yourself more, making damn sure he gets all the good lines). <br /> <br /> In the same spirit, the sad fact remains that Labor lost * Lava * hardly worse than the endless, hideous, bloated * * Hamlet since 1996. In fact, this film can be overwhelming if only because about 1/3 of the length. Branagh has decided that it would be a good idea to update this bad early work of Shakespeare in an environment of Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, yada. Thus, it sets the thing in 1939, it takes about one-eighth of the text intact for the benefit of egregious interpretation thirties standards (wait until you see the actors are taken up by wires from the ceiling during the "I'm in heaven"), and casts of actors not known for their dancing or singing (and himself). As a result of the disaster is so surreal that one was stunned that they just did not call scared stop at all after the first look at the dailies. I do not even blame the actors. ! To paraphrase Hamlet, "The script is the thing" Nobody could have come off well in this hodgepodge: RSC famous graduates do not fare no better than Alicia Silverstone who could act in this matter <br /> <br /> The first mistake.? Branagh was thinking that * * Lost was a game worth filming love Labor Believe me, it is not an anomaly in the canon of the Bard, especially for the educated circles of the court -.. not the usual audience for which he wrote Thus, there is a lot of (. and exhausting!) play on words, references to contemporary scholastic g lupstva, parody * Euphues Lyly in *. ,, In other words, it is hardly the kind of stuff that appeal to a wide audience. Hell, he does not appeal to an audience that is already prone to Shakespeare's comedy. The game can not be delivered without a radical reduction of the text and desperately "update" it with any trick that comes to hand. The question is, why? <br /> <br /> The second error Branagh was to think that the cream-pie Shakespeare can be served with a side order of marmalade Gershwin. It is obvious that the idea, or hope, was to make a strange Elizabethan exercises appropriate for a modern audience by introducing a nostalgic American pop culture down the throat at the same time. But again, the question is, why? <br /> <br />
