This movie is a blatant plagiarism of one of the best novels of all time, Silas Marner by George Eliot. <br /> <br /> The details of the film shown on the IMDb really gives confirmation of the original writer, but I did not see it at the beginning of the film, only the loan at the end of it, saying, "I suggested in the book, Silas MarnerÂ». As? It was nothing other than the complete elimination of all major RIP-history items: <br /> <br /> A hurt and sad old man, an artisan, a poor and lonely, have all their money stolen. One night a child wanders to his door as her mother lay dying in the snow outside. A man takes her and brings her to one day of the local squire (or rich policy here) needs to adopt a child. I am the one who gave birth to a child during illegal Affair years earlier. The battle then flows out who should have custody of a child. <br /> <br /> In this and every other aspect of the film, the story exactly the same. Only one thing I can tell the difference. Silas Marner had epilepsy - but perhaps that would have strained the existing capacity, Mr. Martin too far. In addition, he has his hair dyed in some carrot juice bikes (presumably to make him look younger, but actually makes it look like a clown, he is)! There is also the addition of senseless jokes that this unusual comedian could not resist involvement in the story, who do not have any role in it, and just ignore the depth of history. For example, if a child crying in the court declaring the building, it can only be happy with a man who adopted her all these years. It is transmitted in the film Girl applying nasal decongestant to the bridge of the nose to make it a tear! <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the legitimacy and integrity of the film industry within the authorization of such a film to be made. If I was a confidant of George Eliot I insist on compensation. If I were Steve Martin, I would have sent the profits in this estate, or poor. At the very least, he should have the right to Silas Marner - Adapted S Martin. Or better yet, removed from the archives <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this story - and I hope that you are - to dismiss it entirely and watch Silas Marner. Or read a book! BBC did an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980s.
