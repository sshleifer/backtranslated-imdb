I have not seen the trailer of the film, when I went to see the movie, and I based my opinion on the opinions of others. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this film just falls flat on his face. <br /> <br /> In the film, Rock delivers a couple of funny jokes, but, unfortunately, the film is sorely lacking in the comedy. The film seems to want to integrate and laughter, love in one and the fact that he does not seek. Love story in the film straight ahead (thankfully), but this does not detract too much from the film, making the Rock serious and bland. In the end, the film is primarily intended to be a comedy where laughter should be the main concern. Not so much that in the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is also fairly uninteresting in general. Some parts were broken as a whole. If the supporting cast had to be fun, of course, they did not do a good job. A pair of angels from heaven, tried to make a few jokes, which were dry and dull. couple the first embodiment of the rock-improvised were also fresh. If there's one thing they did do well, though, they did Rock seem ridiculous comparison.
