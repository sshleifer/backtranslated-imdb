Loved Part One, The Impossible Planet, but whoops, that is frustrating part two 'Satan Pit'. The culmination of something, apparently, that rises out of the hole was - nothing comes out of the hole. Then age had to crawl round air to inflate out of this story, beast roaring things empty of intelligence, so it is not the doctor / villain confrontation I anticipated. The TARDIS is inside the well, in spite of the well not be opened until after the TARDIS failed planet Earth's crust. And finally, one more ready-made solution that there is no logical reason - I mean, why not immerse the animal in the hole, once opened the pit? Why not put him in all those years ago, instead of in any way to put it. Why not - I could go on, but I lost interest ...
