In order to make the film a prequel straddling and "real" Star Wars Trilogy will tax even the great filmmaker .... Mr. Lucas is not what the film-makers. <br /> <br /> in order to reflect the fall in the dark is a good man needs a good actor ... Mr. Christensen is not that actor. <br /> <br /> the first 60-80 minutes in most cases only a few pockets sad even more light saber fights, but there is no edge, because you already know what the main characters survive in the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) is very fleeting role and a better idea to have Jerash Binks silent! <br /> <br /> A lot of the film picks up only to turn to the Chancellor and the Jedi is one big (extremely long) sequence of lava falls
