This film was a big disappointment for me. I was waiting for this movie to come out for years, and I've been a faithful follower of Chaos Comics, until they went bankrupt. Not only do they cut half the story line, but they have changed the information. The claim that Lucifer is the father of Hope is untrue. He raped her father, but he is not her father himself. Voices also did not suit the character, and as soon as you hear the voice of a favorite character, the voice you hear may not be returned to your mind. I can not even remember everything about this movie, it was wrong. The bottom line is that if you like Lady Death will not watch this movie. It just does not do justice at all comic !!
