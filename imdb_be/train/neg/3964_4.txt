For all the inspiration on this film, I kept an open mind as to what I would ultimately think. And, although a little slow at times, the first 90% of the film is quite good, with more than a few "old" time panic that make one nervous and unsettled. I actually thought that the cinema was very rich in regard to many of these scenes. Where Dark Remains fails, however, to its climax. The ending of the film and the isolation that seems to be a mile from her body. The storyline is completely falls on his face to the illogical conclusion, and in response I was looking for the best - what really happened with Emma? - not clarified on! Justification of negative energy was laughable at best, and in the end, I felt very cheated. What might be the perfect horror film was eventually pursue terrible denouement.
