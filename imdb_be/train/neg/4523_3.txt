If this film was released, it has created one of the all-time great reviews capsules movie: Sphinx stinks. He does, but fascinating kind of way. Casting silly, starting at the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as the Egyptians? Not enough makeup in Cairo that, at least not while the film is done. But it's pretty fun to see them try. Performances run the gamut from the mummy as (excuse the obvious follow-up) to the over-the-top, with very few stops in between. The character of Lesley-Anne Down, it seems as if she could not find on a map of Egypt, much less explained archaeological treasures. This is due, at least in part to some very bad writing, one of the curses that will visit every viewer of this film. It is my opinion that the films with the participation of a curse or that draws the basis of the subject that is somewhat esoteric, such as Egyptology, ripe for a fool, to rewrite the dialogue. He did not disappoint, and the convergence is a double whammy. The plot has a single source of dramatic tension driving: Can it get more stupid and less believable? The answer, usually, YES. Shots location beautiful, and set design, as a rule, very good, just consistent reminders that this is not some sort of low-budget production. That and the fact that there are so many famous people doing service in this involuntary laughter. not cheap, no; Cheesy, yes.
