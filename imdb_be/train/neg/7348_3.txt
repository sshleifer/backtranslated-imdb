I was very disappointed with this film. Waters first film I saw was Serial Mom and I loved it. Then I saw Pecker and I loved it. Then I looked Polyester and really kind of hated. The only thing that I liked was that the film was divine. She / He was a hell of a lot of talent. I was really surprised. Overall, I would not recommend this movie ...
