Platoon of the Vietnam War, as Rocky IV is a heavyweight boxing championship. History of Oliver Stone's Platoon experience of the US Army in Vietnam in 1968 as overdone funny. While most or all occurrences in the Platoon took place during the 10+ years of the passage of the US military presence in Vietnam to reflect these things happen to a small group of men in such a short period of time (weeks) gives a distorted picture of terrible war. The platoon, people platoon to see all future within a week or two: American soldiers killing civilians, US soldiers raped civilians, a US sergeant killing another American sergeant, private US murder US employees Sergeant, US soldiers killed / wounded by friendly fire, 90% + killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone, to try to pass on this film as a typical American soldier experiences in Vietnam, it is a shame. Two films of the war in Vietnam, I would recommend it, we were soldiers (a true story, possibly the worst fighting for American soldiers in Vietnam) and the bright shining Lie HBO channel.
