Bruce Lee was a great master of martial arts, but this film is still probably one of the worst films ever made. He Bruce Lee dies in helicopter crash after hitting a ninja knife to the back of the neck, but it does not explain how he came to be a helicopter, as to the scene of his near but not on the helicopter, which has 200 feet in the air. It just becomes completely absurd since, like something out of cheap comics. This idea may not be so, but it's not done with any degree of artistry from the point of view of filmmaking. There are dozens of martial arts bombers, there is usually done in Hong Kong. I think Jean-Claude Van Damme has improved with the addition of a genre of plausible stories in his films and filmmakers, who know how to use the camera. Even the movies of Steven Seagal is much better than 90 percent of the martial arts of unsuitable films made in the 1970s and early 1980s in Hong Kong. "Game of Death IIÂ» falls into the category of junk movie, in my opinion, in spite of Bruce Lee, being in it.
