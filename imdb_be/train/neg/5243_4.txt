Make up your own mind. Personally, I found it as much fun as getting Spinal Tap by Stevie Wonder. No offense, Mr. Wonder. Maybe it's a comedy, but I found that this is nonsense. Not exactly the first two options to babysit your children; Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two energy drink salesmen to avoid imprisonment in court ordered the teacher to two children from the development center run by Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch). One of the losers Ronnie (Bobby di- Thompson), a fifth grader at the ugly, and the second Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a shy young man who plays a roll in a fantasy medieval world. Wheeler and Danny are desperate to give their precious charges inside view of life, love, and heavy metal. Lynch is hilarious with her dry wit analogies. Support are: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kenney-Silver, Righetti and David Wayne.
