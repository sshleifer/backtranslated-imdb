This film is so, so, so awful, that makes the angels lose their wings. Shaq was trying to make other efforts crossover, as well as his work in the Shaq-Fu for the NES and its wealth unbearable turnip albums, and later, the epic serving awful film, which is steel. <br /> <br /> there is not one good thing to say about this film. I've seen it a bunch of times when I was very young, but I must have been stupid then, because this film takes care of all that the pleasure of the movies and tearing it apart. It's fun to tease. I saw it on the Disney Channel some time ago and spent a few minutes making it. . Although, once the thrill of mocking this is done, you are still overwhelmed by the fear of him <br /> <br /> If you see on TV, try the following: consider how your watching a movie by removing from it all the scenes in which Shaq uses his magical powers genie. If you do that, it becomes like a movie about a kid chasing a pedophile and a knock to seduce him. It's pretty funny, and anxiety. <br /> <br /> horrible example of the film. Niya, if you want to tease him, to see this movie.
