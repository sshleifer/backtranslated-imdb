"NAT" (voiced by Trevor Gagnon), along with his friend geniuses "the IQ" (voiced by Philip Boldny) and always hungry "scooter" (David Gore) are children with big dreams. They want to be the first to fly in space. And what motivates their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon, Apollo 11, waiting for his historic trip to the launch pad near where three hang out. <br /> <br /> The first thing you will notice, the animation film. I found that it was done very well done. The scenery was a depth to him, as things at a distance actually looked like they were behind the focus scenes. I have not seen this movie in 3-D, because it was shown on HBO. However, I could see that there really were no scenes that took advantage of the 3-D effects, in addition to the fight between the characters towards the end. I also was not really impressed with the character design. they were not like me for anything resembling a fly, especially in color. Flies were an unusual blue-gray, which was kind of distracting me. <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors were not bad, but it was not good. There were many times I focused more on my computer than the story. Drafting was written, of course, for a younger audience, with comic moments that make younger children laugh. I did not see anything, for adults, as well as jokes that they get the punchline for adults to understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> The story was not followed in this film. In fact, I think he was completely ignored, because the focus was on the fly. I hated it when well-known astronaut appeared on the screen, and explained that the stories about the flies in the movie was a work of fiction, and no flies were on Apollo 11. I did as he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration, though. <br /> <br /> If you are an adult, it's not for you. This was not done for the whole family. This, of course, only for children. But apart from this one for a rainy day.
