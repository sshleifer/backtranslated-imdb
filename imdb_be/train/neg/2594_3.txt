Despite the fact that this film R rating, I doubt very much that you really like it, if you're not a teenager, <br /> <br /> Why? Because there is no real plot, no character development, no funny jokes. <br /> <br /> The only thing that this film has a lot of it is nudity. Tons and tons of naked or almost naked chicks (pretty good ones I might add) to admire. <br /> <br /> I really can not understand why the film is called American Pie, as it is only bad combination between the erotic cinema and comedy with no success in being one of them. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chicks, but you're too shy to rent / buy erotic film. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1/10 for 2 smile I had on the entire film, and even 2/10 for a good chicken
