I did not enjoy this movie on one all.for, I just found it rude and vulgar, as neither reason.i also did not feel that this is a misogynist (in relation to women.) Also, the film does not really seem to anything, and I did not find any of likable.really characters, that is, does not seem to be any point in it all.maybe I'm missing something, but for me, this film is pretty much a waste of time, if I could do something more productive and enjoyable.like using my face as the breadbasket of the contact cushion.James in this case, as C.Th omas Howell and Shirley Jones and James Cromwell.a wasted here, and I'm sure it was the lowest point in each of their respective careers.Jennilee Harrison (from Three years later company) is also in the film, and it's nice to see it in the Sun ditsy role.but, in addition, it can "t rise above mediocrity script.for me, the tank is 3/10
