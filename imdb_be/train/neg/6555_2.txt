So the other night I decided to see Tales from the Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson. Or power, passion, murder, as it is called in Holland. When I bought this movie, I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was starring in it, and I thought I had to say something about the quality. Unfortunately, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> 1) The film is really confusing. There are two storylines running simultaneously during the film. they just do not have anything in common. Throughout the film, I waited for the moment these two storylines come together to plot would be clear to me. But it still has not. <br /> <br /> 2) The name of the film said that the film will be about Natica Jackson. Well, sometimes. As said, the film spans two stories and a portion of Natica Jackson is the shortest. So another name for this film would not be a wrong choice. <br /> <br /> At the end of my story, I actually recommend leaving this film, where he is on the shelf in the store in place, no one can see it. By doing this, you will not spend 90 minutes of your life, as I do.
