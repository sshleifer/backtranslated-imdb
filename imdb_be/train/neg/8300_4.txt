This in-name-only continuation of "A Christmas Carol", originally titled «A Summer Story.» Ralphie tells about his family adventures during the summer, when they moved to a small provincial town, in the middle of nowhere.

I felt sorry for him <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen is given little to do, all of the templates, and you have to wonder why they even worked <br /> <br /> And I mean, come on .. - competition with Turk ?! Unfortunately, this is the best part of the film ...
