Anyone who might find mitigating importance in this part of crap should explore their heads. We have a submissive, heroin, part Hooker's wife with wounds all over his body, cuts obtained from repeated beatings, abusive son. Now she splashed breast milk all over the kitchen floor, so the release was a bit like Helen Keller with his hands in running water. We have a man who begins with patronizing a prostitute, who just happens to be his daughter (she is upset with him because he has come too quickly) and ends with the murder of his colleagues, have sex with her corpse and then grinding it. We have a child who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates, and who comes home and beats his mother. You see, all of this circular. Deep, huh? The only decent moment in this terrible pile scar, when his father killing the executioner of his son. It's a good thing, it's turkey was shot on video, because otherwise, what a waste of expensive film would be. If the guy who thinks that artists should be interested in this slop really serious, it is not surprising that most people do not think of crazy artists. We have seen this lousy movie, and then put on a "Zero woman accused." Oh my God, it was a tossup, which one was worse. What's going on in Japan these days? Sick, sick, sick.
