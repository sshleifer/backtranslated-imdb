It crappiest movie I've ever seen, but in all fairness it's watchable and quite funny. I do not think that the filmmakers have appointed to be your typical Hollywood blockbuster quality. It's just a silly movie about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste, causing the reaction to it, and the snow (as it is the middle of winter). Then he turns into a killer snowman, which is enough to make you laugh on his own. This film is really stupid, but this is ridiculous. These murders are hilarious.I would not advise you to go and buy it (like I did -The cover looked good!), But if it happens on TV one night, and you're up for a laugh and then stick to it.
