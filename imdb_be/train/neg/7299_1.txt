Of course, I've seen bad movies in my life, but this one was so bad that I actually got angry at the theater. I want my money back. I wrote to the director with a request to return your ticket to the movies, of course, I did not get a refund (or answer), but this is the point that matters. On a scale of 1-10 I give this film -42. Why "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer ??) do not work on hitting the bat? Why do they fall into "JeepÂ» (Chevy Blazer ?????) with the bat in the first place instead of a skull fracture in the ass? The plot was thin, the film is filled with obvious cliches, and some parts of it just does not make any sense.
