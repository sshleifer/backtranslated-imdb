The highlight of this film was for me, without a doubt, Tom Hanks. Mike Sullivan, he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle unconventional (for him) role. Hanks, as a rule, a good guy in the movie - the one that you love, admire and root. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It is true that in the context of the film, he came across as a noble - his goal is to avenge the murder of his wife and young son. Nevertheless, he was a gangster and a murderer to the killings. So Hanks took on the role, I would not expect it, and he took it well. <br /> <br /> good Hanks performance aside, though, of course, I could not call it a nice film. After the discovery that I would be better described as mysterious (it was not quite clear to me at a time when it happens) it turns into a very dark film about the complex relationship Sullivan worked as a Gangster - mostly raised by Rooney (Paul Newman) someone like a mafia boss and trying to raise their two sons and keep them "clean", so to speak; isolation from their business. Once the eldest son witnesses a murder, the gang tries to kill him, to silence him, gets the wrong son (and his mother), and leaves Sullivan and his eldest son (Mike, Jr.) on the run. It becomes a strange sort of father / son bonding film. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the ends on an optimistic note several (at least in the general context of history) is really dark around, the mood is enhanced with many scenes being shot in the dark and heavy rains. I must admit that while I appreciated the performance of Hanks, the film as a whole just does not get me. 4/10
