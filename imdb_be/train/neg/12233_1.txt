I just do not understand how a film Concorde-New Horizons director Jim Wynorski and featuring the acting talents of Andrew Stevens and the puppet can be bad. It just boggles the mind, does not it? <br /> <br /> Well, let's not be mistaken about it. «Munchie Strikes Back" really bad movie. Munchie doll that has been around for centuries. For reasons not fully explained until the end of the film, he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son. The problem is my mother (her main problem, at least) is that it has a one-time payment because her mortgage in two weeks ... in a not so tiny the amount of $ 20,000 Josh. It can not come up with the money, because she just got fired. OK ... It's just a key word in that sentence. What the ...? Was she planning to pay him a salary? Maybe it would be a good idea to have spent the last few years, going at it ... I think? <br /> <br /> Munchie has magical powers similar to gin had to ... but it's not the limit on the number of requests you can make! Munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night, but if the child asks for it to be sent back to the mall Munchie was "borrowing" it from. Irritating Furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy to win a baseball game with the help of deception. Baseball hit so hard that it orbits the earth several times. Unfortunately, these stupid parents watching the game, I do not think it's at all strange. Hmm. <br /> <br /> In any case, I'd like to wrap it up, because it is already dried up enough of my life force, like this. You will be truly touched by the scene where Lesley-Anne Down plays a mother kicks the dog that barking at her. Your heart will melt on her charm when she sees dollar bills came down on her front yard, and she wonders how it can be snow during the summer. «Munchie Strikes Back" loans "s promised another film to follow the right, I believe," Munchie Hangs Ten. "To date, the movie viewing public was robbed that was certainly a cinematic tour-de-force. Heh. 1/10
