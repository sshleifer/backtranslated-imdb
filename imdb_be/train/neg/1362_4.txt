Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very unlikely pair of very cute movie entirely in general. <br /> <br /> The film shows promise for Ustinov is released from prison for embezzlement. He convinces Robert Morley to leave so that he could assume his identity and start second only to computers with a very bizarre firm manages Karl Malden and Newhart, another unusual duet for the film. <br /> <br Morley /> sounds just like he did in "Marie Antoinette" in 1938. Maybe he needed to return to this genre. <br /> <br /> This movie is ridiculous at best. Hard to believe that in the next year, Maggie Smith completely changed her way and gave a crushing performance in the Oscar Â«The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." <br /> <br /> Ms. Smith made here to be imaginary head dumb red color, but by the end of the film, it is the brain-dress. It is a pity that the letters do not go the way with it.
