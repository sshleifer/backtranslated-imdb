Because the others went plot summarizing trouble, I would like to mention a few things about this film. There may be spoilers here; I do not care enough to filter them <br /> <br /> -. Given the low budget of the film, the creature design was pretty good. It's really good to see a horror film directly to video, not plastered with terrible CGI. . Unfortunately, the digital quality of the film is quite grainy in places, and this is especially noticeable in bright white halls shelter <br /> <br /> - Funny lighting design annoying part of this film, not to mention variations in the course of time. I understand that the director could have tried to mimic dementia, but for it to be effective according to the flow of time to install. Once there, it just seems amateurish <br /> <br /> -. Plot twists were many but always predictable. I had no doubt in my mind identity robed cultists, or the fact that some lame evil-trumps proper development will surface at the end <br /> <br /> -. This may seem like quibbling, but the characters in this film is definitely not use any common sense. First of all, regulatory commissions will be only mental health center, which unilaterally declared all deaths of patients and staff of a cardiac arrest induced. Why the chief psychiatrist also is able to perform an autopsy? Why not plot a point with this impressive qualifications, or its introduction in his strange choice of religion? What background? That should cause us to take care of those who are in it? And just as importantly, who in their right mind would go through an introduction to the site, to see all that was so frighteningly wrong with it, and then draw the conclusion that it was still a great place to continue the residency? This film does not even respect his characters enough to give his intelligence to the benefit of doubt <br /> <br /> The result: cm. The Wicker Man instead.
