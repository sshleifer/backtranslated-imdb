Incredible Melting Man plays like a long episode of The Six Million Dollar Man, but with violence and some nudity. I know that this film is a bit shabby, but I found it impossible not to something like this. <br /> <br /> The acting and the script is not better. But the effects are good for the 30-year-old movie with a budget of $ 50 - the name of the character takes a lot of time to really ignite, but if it does it is large enough; We also have one inventive death scene involving electrical current. Remark as music, this is crazy - cheese-tastic nonsense mess <br /> <br /> There are highlights :. <br /> <br /> * Marvel at the nurse slow, jumping through a window glass for absolutely no reason. <br /> <br /> You will be surprised the day in the life of a severed head. <br /> <br /> * Avoid psychotic cannibal melting humanoid. Steve called. <br /> <br /> * Be surprised when our hero takes a break from hunting a crazy melting have a bowl of soup and complain about the lack of crackers in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> This film is too 70 to hate me. It is sticky and bad, but I thought it was really fun. You could do a lot worse.
