This is a bad film by any standard. History Match Point had some intrigue, and the direction and write a certain delight (Woody Allen mixing their own culture that classic English murder and explore what can be done with it). <br /> <br /> scoop, but does not have any of it. It is poorly written, the two wires is hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest at all. A genre that he forges requires at least some scene with witty explanation and link box (why tarot cards and keys are stored under the horns locked?). <br /> <br beautiful and witty versions /> Elena various Hollywood genres (The Curse of the Jade Scorpion / The Purple Rose of Cairo, etc.) give us so much pleasure over the years. Even Hollywood ending had a great central idea. Unfortunately, his inspiration threw it at this time.
