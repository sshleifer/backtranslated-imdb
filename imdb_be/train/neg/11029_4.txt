Anyone who has visited a drive-in in 1950, the 60th year, and 70 must have seen a movie or two of American International Pictures, the distributor, which resembles a 1980s giant Cannon Films. Where moviegoers risked, the AIP would be here to put the last name of fashion - in the 50s came to horror movies like «Voodoo Woman» and «The Undead;" in the 60s were Frankie Avalon-Annette Funicello beach comedies and cyclist click as "Thank Stomperov;" and in the 70s, the AIP churned out garbage Grindhouse level as «Cannibal Girls» and «Sugar Hill». <br /> <br /> «Dillinger," released in 1973, is one of the more "sophisticated" efforts of the AIP, which capture the true spirit of transit in the film industry; It is one of those rough, over-the-top clicks that satisfy the thirst of the masses for fun, skill and common sense be damned. In general, "Dillinger" is typical of its era: entertaining and worth a couple of hours, but certainly not memorable. Heavy on action and short on action and as a historical fact, "Dillinger" was fair efforts writer-director John Milius ( «Magnum Force»), but, of course, out of the room to improve his extensive career. <br /> <br /> 109-minute "Dillinger" - an epic scope to the AIP - worth Search Home Midwest FBI Melvin Purvis, played by Oscar winner Ben Johnson Prize. Purvis was the investigator, who was looking for revenge for the four FBI agents who were killed in 1933 in Kansas City ambush, which helped the gangster Frank Nash, to escape justice. On the big were the people who are supposed to be plotted on a graph, a breakthrough, including expert Bankrobber John Dillinger (Warren Oates), Pretty Boy Floyd (Canal) and a psychopath Baby Face Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss). Dillinger eventually teamed up with Floyd and Nelson, taking Homer Van Meter (Harry Dean Stanton) and Harry Pierpont (Geoffrey Lewis). He also met with Billie Frechette (Michelle Phillips), a prostitute French and Indian extraction. While going on for several months in 1933-4, "Dillinger" in the main chase film, with suite Purvis seeking to run down and kill people wanted J. Edgar Hoover. <br /> <br /> «Dillinger" is a documentary feeling, listing the date and place while Johnson delivers a free story as Purvis. Milius keeps the honest opinion of depression, using authentic fashion, cars, weapons and construction; He also sprays around the black-and-white photos and footage of gang warfare. The film is never boring, is moving quickly, when haphazardly paced. Scenes are supporting Dillinger, competently edited Fred Feitshans Jr. in his last professional efforts. Thousands of empty ammunition cartridges should be used to make this film, not to mention the pounds of explosives. This film is certainly not for the faint of heart, with people getting shot and dropping dead everywhere. Violence, while the free, brings a glimpse of what a pogrom organized crime dumped into American life. <br /> <br /> This film never goes beyond its operating status, however, as it requires the writing just is not there. John Milius, somewhat overrated as a director, puts too much emphasis on action. Scenes (mostly filled with the blood of the shoot) is impressive and comparable to any major crime film of its era, including 1967 in "Bonnie and Clyde." But we just do not get to know much about Dillinger and his gang of friends, people; vital relationship that develops between Dillinzherami Frechette and barely touched, with the pair meeting in a bar during a scene and jump as amateurs just ten minutes later. Porvis also seems to wander in and out of the story line, becoming a prominent figure only when Milius need to keep the film from unraveling. Too often, the film takes up poslematchevyhem person when his characters could be studied in detail. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main image a crime is ignorance of historical fact. Although many say that "Dillinger" is just a movie, it's films like this that create the stories and make them permanent. Those with knowledge of the history of thuggish show that John Dillinger was not the last of his rings to die because Milius script and documentary-style film encourage us to believe. In fact, Dillinger died before, Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter; He is also said to be carrying a gun on the night of his death, he had Billie FRECHETTE in tow. While these inaccuracies could make for high drama, there's no reason why Milius could not stay with the facts, and wrote a great story around them. <br /> <br /> performance of Warren Oates as Dillinger is pretty good, although it sometimes looks unconvincing. Oates is a humorous and draws well as Dillinger began to use its larger-than-life image in the American press; However, we will never feel threatened, he called in his life. Ben Johnson gives some life Purvis, courteous, but fairly flat. Michelle Phillips brings the emotions of the character Billy FRECHETTE, and it's really too bad that Milius script entirely specifying its relations with Dillinger. We will never know what drew her to the killer restrained except stereotype carefree girl who is attracted to people of danger. Supporting role with Kanaly, Dreyfus, Stanton, Lewis, and who appeared briefly Lichmny are acceptable for such a talent. <br /> <br /> As part of the operation of the 1970 th years, "Dillinger" is doomed to retail unsuitable bunker, it was there where I got a DVD-release of MGM for $ 4.99. The film is well presented in widescreen (the need for a drive in movie) with subtitles in French and Spanish. Theatrical Trailer Dillindzhera supplied as a single addition. Largely forgotten except gangster movie lovers and enthusiasts screwing, the film does not really require a lot more in the way of additional material. . For fans of the genre, it is definitely worth checking out <br /> <br /> ** 4 <br /> <br /> Roving Reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr
