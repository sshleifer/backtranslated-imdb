I saw this movie a few days ago ... What the hell was that? <br /> <br /> I love movies with Brian Oholloranom, they are funny and pleasant. When I saw the title of the name and genre, I thought, great, this could be very good ... some slashers Parody of a gore film ... but .. then I read the preview and thought that this might be the right well anyway ... but it was not ... <br /> <br /> my opinion: if you like a movie, they look a bit like a documentary, with a bit of comedy to try some movies Moore or alien autopsy, they really about something, this one was empty. <br /> <br /> and put the title of a comedy ... no comment ... really bad joke
