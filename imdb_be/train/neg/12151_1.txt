it is quite possible worst actor I have ever seen in a movie ... ever. and that with the casting. leading lady in this film has some nose Dis-figuration and almost impossible to watch for any period of time without becoming fixated on her nose. You could go to the local grocery store on a Sunday afternoon, and easy to find 50 more qualified, better look possible leading lady. I made an unfortunate mistake rent this movie, because it was "coolÂ» DVD case. This film looks like it's just some kind of class project for a group of media students at a local technical college. I would like to spend an hour or so that this film was to watch public access TV ... at least, better special effects, and the people on there are more attractive than the one you will see in this film
