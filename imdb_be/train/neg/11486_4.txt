Because some people, like me, wanted to know everything about the movie, even if they are planning to see it, including the final. Anyway, here's the ending, as I remember, because I could not be more than 8 years old when I saw him for the first and only time on TV. But I tell you, it sure scared little child that I was, and I thought about it for a few days after that, and it still stands in my mind to this day, although some details are a bit vague. Abe Vigoda was in this film? I do not remember that! I do not even remember that old man Barnabas was in this film, and I loved Dark Shadows. So, in the end, the main character (? Belinda Montgomery) drew the judge (Joseph Cotton, I believe that, even though I remember it being an old family doctor or something instead of judges, to see how memory fades?) at the wedding place, which, as I remember, he was in the cave of some kind? Maybe I have, what is wrong; and Shelley Winters there laughing, and the judge has a cape on, and angle of the camera, looking at him, and he throws his cloak, and his goat legs, and he declares that he is actually her father, d ' yabal and it played right into the hands of (satanic cult), because "death" the guy she fell in love (I guess it Foxworthy) appears also to be the guy, Satan wants to marry her off to, demon with yellow eyes, and so, Of course, they show Foxworthy and his eyes glow yellow. There are plenty of close-ups in the last few minutes of the film. They all laugh and rejoice, because Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy, and cries or screams, or anything but, and this is the end. The bad guys are winning.
