Thank God! I did not spend their money to rent it, but I downloaded it! It happens the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, f ***** g visual effects need blood and nudity! Away from other zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and others. There are a lot of loopholes and errors in the film. The OK, if you get time after reading this commentary, please check (Ulli Lommel) side directors. Seeing that I was itself an explanation of why a film like this, I mean every film directed by Ulli Lommel receives a score from 1 to 2. And now I do not want to look for some kind of films they directed at him, but I can finish all this, saying one strong proposal. Even for pleasure or passage of time or even in an extreme situation, boring, please DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.
