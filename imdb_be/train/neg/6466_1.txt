Marlon Brando have long lost interest in playing if he made this film. His performance as "the Swede" is the worst of his career, and that's exactly what he wanted. He did not overact. Instead, he simply acts in a bizarre fashion and ridicules his strikingly enormous girth. The scene where Brando rises above the toilet cubicle, perhaps worse, the funniest moment in the history of cinema. As we have seen, he fell head in the toilet, it is difficult to believe that we are seeing the same actor who played the title role in A Streetcar Named Desire, on the waterfront and The Godfather. <br /> <br /> I think the real question is why Marlon behaved like this in recent years. Was he sick movie business? And it is the same as making a full and complete fool of yourself? I believe that we will never know. But this film is a fascinating study of what a bad game is all about. <br /> <br /> On this note, watching the guy acting veteran Donald Sutherland as he struggled to deliver his lines, embarrassing yourself for agreeing to take part in this travesty.
