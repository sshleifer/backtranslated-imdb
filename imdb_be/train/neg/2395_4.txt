Could this be the same director as Do not Look Now or Bad Timing? Poor <br /> <br /> acted, clunkily changes. You only have to compare the different accident scenes in this, with the same in Do not Look Now, to see how many lost Rogue <br /> <br /> touch. <br /> <br /> Even the overall reliability of Theresa Russell (looks a bit squat these days, I'm afraid to imagine) can not keep this. The plot is pure pseudo scams, wooden acting and try Roeg in his trademark pity time dislocation. <br /> <br /> Avoid this one like the plague.
