There are some really great ideas in this cruel film, which, if implemented well, could have raised him from the Spaghetti Western lethargy into something special. Unfortunately, the city called HELL is one of the worst imaginable edited movies! Scenes begin and end suddenly, the characters left in long stretches, the performance (and accents) actors rather contradictory, etc. <br /> <br /> Robert Shaw is a Mexican (!) revolutionaries who, after to take part in destroying the village is to be a priest (!) ... ten years through the village run by "mayor" Tel Salavas. Stella Stevens arrives seeking revenge on the man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Landau arrives looking for Shaw. They were all shouting at each other a lot, and they all shoot each other a lot. Fernando Rey in it too (like the blind). Views are not bad, but they are very unevenly. Savalas has accent sometimes makes Landau (who actually grille here). Ray Shaw and prove that they are unable to really embarrassing himself and Stevens looks pretty Foxy (if a little ridiculous among the sweaty dirt).
