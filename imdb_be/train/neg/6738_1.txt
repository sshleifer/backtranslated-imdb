There has been so much a lot of movies based on the same theme. cute single girl needs a beautiful boy to impress the former, to pay him, and then (guess what?), she falls in love with him, have a little fumbling go straight before everyone does before a happy ending ...... this has been done many times. <br /> <br /> The fact that I knew it before you start playing. But despite this, I still look forward to it. In his right hand, with a good cast and a brilliant script, he can still be a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> It was not one of them. <br /> <br /> It was scary. <br /> <br /> A woman's role is not lacking in charm or wit, which completely failed to ignite even the slightest spark in me. I do not really care if she "got her man" and remained one and miserable. <br /> <br /> A man's role which, after some of his infinite wisdom of words, I wanted to kill. Easy to remove this smug look. I had no idea that the male lead a life of a whore was a path to enlightenment-seeing all-knowing. <br /> <br /> It is not realistic film is filled with unrealistic character. none of them seemed to not have a job, they have more money than sense, the groom, who is still going ahead with his marriage after he learned that his fianc√©e had slept with his best friend .... plus " I'd miss you even if we had never met "!!!!! I could go on, but I just realized that I spend more time on this filth ..... I could talk about the introduction of the character just to have a very cheap laugh at the "tree" name, but in truth that was only remotely humorous that happened in the movie.
