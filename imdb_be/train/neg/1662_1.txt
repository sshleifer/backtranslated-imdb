This is undoubtedly one of the worst films I have ever seen. This makes your ordinary TV movie look like Reservoir Dogs. Based on the book by one and only Britney Spears and her mother is trash with nothing bar a reasonable performance from Virginia Madsen (I hope you are well paid) to save it. The history of the country's red neck gills, who wins a scholarship to a prestigious music school is small, but the car pedal Ms Spears music pants to the consumer and are in general agreement that low forehead should be the way. There's nothing good going on here with all the blows as predictable as night following day. Never ever again.
