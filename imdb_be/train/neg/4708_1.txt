Darling! The first time I heard of it was a bad show, when one of my friends were yelling like an idiot "JOHNY TEST», when we played video games. I thought that he was misleading «Johny Quest» (incidentally, one of the best animation I've ever seen in my life ", and change the" Quest "with" Test ". Its strange that I'm wrong, but in fact, I was wrong, it does not change anything, he had heard about this show. <br /> <br /> One day, while watching TV, I heard that Cartoon Network is going to be released. I was not sure that was the plot this show, so I valued myself to watch it, and here is my answer: "I want my hour back Damn" (because I watched that shit and "my room partner monkeys» <br /> <br />. this from zine of the worst shows I have ever seen. First, start with the most stupid song in the world, the story. Oh, where are my manners? I did not say that the plot of the show. there is about a boy who must be amazing intelligent sister, having a laboratory and do experiments with his brother. OHHH, now I understand why his name is Johny tEST, it is a test of his sister's experiments. <br /> <br /> you know, I truly Miss La Dexter b (before it was converted into a NEW Dexter, total crap too). This is a bad copy of the good old shows, except for the fact that this show is surprisingly bad. Do not look, do something more productive in this half than watching this crap.
