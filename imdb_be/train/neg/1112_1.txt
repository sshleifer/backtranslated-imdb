I love watching western movies, but this film takes a bun. Screenplay and dialogue are ridiculous. The acting was terrible, where they get them from? Music in the manner I have to say. Fortunately, I do not buy or rent a movie, but it is currently utilized. <br /> <br /> I was pointing up at the beginning, when a stranger (Martin Sheen), began to tell his story. I have to admit, I really enjoyed the confrontation between the Hopalong and Tex, where Hopalong Tex finger shot off and told him to practice for 40 years to reach its league. But the one where it all went pear-shaped after that. I had to watch the whole movie in the hope that it will be better, never did.
