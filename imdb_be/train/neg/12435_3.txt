Alex D. Linz replaces Culkin as the central figure in the third film in the Empire Alone at home. Four industrial spies acquire missile guidance system computer chip and pass it through the airport inside a remote control toy car. Because of baggage confusion, grouchy Mrs. Hess (Seldes) gets the car. She gives it to your neighbor, Alex (Linz), just before the spies turn up. Spies rent a house to burglarize a house in the neighborhood, until they find the car. A home with chicken pox, Alex calls 911 every time he sees as theft in the development stage, but the scouts always manages to elude police while Alex is accused of prank calls. Spies finally turn his attention toward Alex, not knowing that he rigged device cleverly booby-trap your entire home. Home Alone 3, it was not terrible, but probably should not have been made, you can not just replace Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern and. Home Alone 3 were some funny parts, but I do not like when the characters are changed in a series of films to watch at your own risk.
