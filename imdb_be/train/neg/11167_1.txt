Jack Black, tend to make me giggle just breathing, but in this film ... <br /> <br /> In addition direction, writing, lack of plot, the constant looting (aided and abetted by a constant direct-to-camera shots) and 0.050 joke average, it was still a complete waste of time. The idea sounds promising, but that the potential was there gets wasted with a complete lack of comedy and some of the worst areas I've seen this side of you-tube. <br /> <br /> I constantly hear that this film reflects the Mexicans are very negative. Despite the fact that there is no doubt, though, I really do not think this film is meant to be racist. I think this is more a result of "creative" team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess. You can almost hear them calling from behind the camera, "Hey, look, it's ugly Mexican Laugh, people, please, for the love of all things tenacious, LAUGHTER!Â» <br /> <br /> But to put racism charges in side. If you get down to it, is the one who flopped a lot of money and time to see the pile of remaining refried beans, to be insulted, IMO.
