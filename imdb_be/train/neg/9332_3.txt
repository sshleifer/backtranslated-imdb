It's not a terrible film, in fact, and Glen and Keitel are first-class actors. Furthermore, they do an acceptable job with a very weak script. Lush scenery and the story has some interesting twists. Also, I umderstand why these actors and the crew made the film, they are professionals, and they pay for it. But I wonder why the studio to spend time and money to make the movie, and then hold it for a theater audience? Even if the movie box office failure, of course, it makes money. If you are a fan or Keitel Glen, take a video, or catch it on television, as did I. Of course, the film does not solve the immigration dilemma with Mexico, but the experience is much better than 90% from the standard TV fare today.
