I can not believe that this show has rating of 9 out of 10. I could see where the voices were in the first 2 seasons, but what would possess someone to continue to evaluate its high then? I was a big fan of the first season. I caught - all the mysteries, suspense, unexplained events. You never know what will happen next. For 2 seasons, I still saw exactly, but get a little disappointed that some of the basic things that have to be explained. And instead, to give you more answers, it just seemed more questions. I love the unknown, but you have to throw people to the bone, then keep them watching. <br /> <br /> At the moment, I can not even remember what finally turned me off, but somewhere in the 2 seasons, I had enough. I'm not a big fan of watching destination - and you obviously can not miss an episode to stay on what is happening. Thus, it is no longer worth the effort to me. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that they could not be a little bit smarter and more carefully loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that it is ABC just got greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch it to show. Do not they realize that in the end, they are going to lose more fans than they could possibly get.
