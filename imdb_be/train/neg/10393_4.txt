Well, you have: <br /> <br /> Penelope Keith as Christmas trees Miss Tweed, B.B.E. She is killed in the first stage - it is right, people (Backbone of England.); this show has no spine! <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole as Ol »Cricket colonel from the First War and now emblazered landlord. <br /> <br /> Joanna Lumley as ensweatered Lady estates, 20 years younger than the colonel's and 20's of the last of its prime but still glamorous (Brit spelling, not mine) enough to have a toy-boy on the side. It's good that they have full knowledge and consent of Colonel Cricket (they guy even goes' round at Christmas!) However, it is attentive enough to the Colonel, said toy boy her age (which Gal!) <br /> < br /> David McCallum as a toy-boy said, just aimlessly glamorous as it squeezed. Pilcher could not think of any cover for him in this story, so she gave him a hush-hush job in the circus <br /> <br /> And finally. <br /> <br /> Susan Hampshire Miss Polonia Cup, St. Director respectable girls boarding school, serving tea in his office with deep shooting range, touching tips for life in the outside world just before graduation. Her best bit of advice: "I've only been in Nancherrow (local stately home in England), I thought it was very beautiful, but, anyway, is not part of the real world," Well, we can not say. that they did not warn us <br /> <br /> Oh, Susan. - There was a time when your character would run all the show. They do not write them like that any more. Our loss, not yours <br /> <br /> So -. With a cast and setting like this, you have the makings of a repeated "Brideshead Revisited" right <br /> <br /> Wrong ?! They took the 1-dimensional supporting roles, because they paid so well. In the end, the action is one of the oldest TEMP jobs there (you name the other!) <br /> <br /> The first warning sign: lots and lots of lighting. They get around shooting outdoors - "hey, it's just sunshine!» <br /> <br /> The second warning sign: Leading Lady cries a lot. If you do not cry, wet eyes. This is the law of love novels: The leading lady <br /> <br /> In the future, the leading lady should be known as LL <br /> <br /> The third warning sign "dewy eyes.»: LL actually has stars in her eyes when she is in love. Nevertheless, I'll give Emily Mortimer award only to act with the attention in her eyes <br /> <br /> And finally, the fourth warning sign (I wonder if they used the contacts.?): No on-screen female character "Mrs." She's either "Miss" or "Lady". <br /> <br /> When all was said and done, I still can not tell who pursues whom and why. I could not even tell what was said and done <br /> <br /> In summary :. They all live through World War II without anything happening to them at all <br /> <br /> Good. in the end, LL said that she had lost her parents in the Japanese camps and child comes home sister consciousness. At the same time (there is always a "time"), a young man LL was in love (if I do not know) comes home with some wartime hard place and are living on the Lady of the Manor Street (there should be some street if it is going to find it there.) And military losses whisk away to recover in Nancherrow (SOMEBODY has to be "taken out" somewhere in these love stories!) <br /> <br /> Most of the drama.
