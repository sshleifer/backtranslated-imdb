When Ashanti was a serious attempt to film the institution of slavery, still prevalent in third world countries, the film might have been better received. Instead, it turns into a star studded disaster film, which came to the stars, said their line, and took their salary without much conviction. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine and his wife, Beverly Johnson, working in the United Nations World Health Organization and busy with her humanitarian thing in East Africa. Along comes Peter Ustinov, who can hardly cause enough ham in it, to make the movement of the hand as a slave Muslim dealer. Johnson was black, he still miss her, along with a large number of children and a few adults. <br /> <br /> Of course, Caine entirely supportive of the abduction and the rest of the film is carried out in a rescue attempt. The rest of the cast there are people like William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and Indian film star Kebir Bedi in parts and they look so incredibly bored with it all. <br /> <br /> Usually, something like that talented people like those mentioned above, just replay the defiant and holiday decorations on a diet. But Ashanti is not even that going for it. <br /> <br /> What an incredible waste of time. The aroma fills the air tax write off.
