What a ridiculous story, blackmail, murder, child sex charges, homosexuals and the church ..... absolute tripe. How is it that the majority of the UK-based TV dramas, sit, etc. KM should include obligortory gay, it does become tedious now. Everyone recognizes that there is a Gay people in society simply is there and other minority groups, but we do not want, it is ramming down our throats (I'll pass on that) in every show. Apart from the above, the drama has gone from what could be an interesting little story in pantomime, the priest was a pedophile and gay men have run where everyone, oh yes just to be completely PC one gay couple was black. I wonder gr Ecclestone even for this contemplation, when he read the script.
