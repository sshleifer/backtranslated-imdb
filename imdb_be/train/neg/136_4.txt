*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Do Teen Slasher click suffering from drought originality? This is terrible so it seems. First of all, this noble premise that may have been used well. Rejected by a young botanist who grows stalks and murders of girls who tortured the hell out of him when he was in high school? I can not say that you did not have anything to work with. But the film goes through the same motion, as well as all other recent slashers. Everything from the score to the angles can accurately predict when a false alarm comes exactly when the killer strikes. We know that the sample now. These silly Slasher films push the envelope of trust more and more with each passing minute. Let me ask you something: Who, in their right mind is going to surprise a friend of theirs in the dark, dreary morgue in the middle of the night and just surprise her out of the blue, as it all alone, surrounded by corpses? This makes any damn sense at all? <br /> <br /> «Valentine» rarely innovative. One good shot involves cutting nature of Denise Richards. She is trapped inside the pool and a killer pokes at it with a chainsaw. There are some good songs on the soundtrack, including a cool track on orgy. Music video, see the special features on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Even the acting is mediocre at best. Actors sleep all their roles. Of course, David Boreanaz often stoic, even in his portrayal as the title character in the «Angel». Denise Richards is a good actress, though, and she keeps Stoneface throughout the film <br /> <br /> «Valentine» in the same way as one would expect :. artsy, unlikely to forget the cheese and without a good scare in sight. Do not even bother <br /> <br /> My Account :. 4 (10)
