My comment to the Russian version of the space race called Space Race (Space Race), shown on Channel One Russia on April 10-13, 2006 Tell us some of the details could be destroyed, but I doubt that this is so. The number of actual errors, such that it is impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (the development of the first rockets). Even half of the US film contains some errors and omissions. Viewers or not said V-2 / A-4 launches US Three different Jupiter C missiles are launched with the same serial number «UE» on board. Apollo 1 will be launched to the moon, etc. In the Russian part, everyone is inappropriate. The Queen is afraid of the NKVD, Glushko is the saboteur and traitor, Mishin alcoholic, etc. Men as a function; no motivation, there is no life at all. Uniform and decorations are terrible. Gagarin sing frivolous songs in anticipation of the launch (I think that was added specifically for the Russian version).
