This movie was so relentlessly bad, I could hardly believe what I was watching it. Directing, editing, production, and the script all seemed as if they were made by students of junior high school, who do not know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sense. Great emotional moments and climaxes (as one early between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and the relationship of character (for example, an allusion to the very beginning) came completely out of nowhere and did not set up as they would be more elegantly and effectively made the film. Nature, unfortunately, is not sufficiently developed, which makes it difficult for us to have any connection with them. Action, surprisingly, it is not bad, but the worst literacy extinguish the relatively strong performance. The film plays like a particularly bad Western / TV epic, and, unfortunately, reduces the exciting (true) story that he is trying to say. I have read many reviews that protect the film as it is important to Australian because the subject. It's all very well, but only because Ned Kelly is Australia's major historical icon does GOOD MOVIE. Nobody says that the subject is not good, only the quality of the film itself. Pearl Harbor was a very important historical event for Americans, but it does not mean that I will defend the film and said that it was good because it was still bad. Failure all around, though Heath and Orlando are excellent to look at.
