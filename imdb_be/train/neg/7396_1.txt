Unfortunately, I have to agree with the critic written halopes. <br /> <br /> In the short film cinematography, costumes, sets, sound, editing, and everything else is very, very good. This may seem strange at first, but I was told that the technical team is working on it consisted of professionals, so the quality can be expected. The problem, as usual, is in the story. <br /> <br /> The fact that it's actually not a story. In order to tell a story (or in the case of cinema, show history), you must plot and conflict. You need things that happen to the main character: the event. These things happen because the protagonist wants something and, for some reason, he can not get it. Tim Watcher does not have any issues or problems. He is a kind of supernatural entity who observes humanity. That's all. So what we have here is pure exposition. Instead of being shown the story, we just learn things about Tim Watcher person. Of course, given the specific nature of Tim Watcher and the short duration of the film, it is difficult to give enough background about him in the movie refers to voice-overs. In this case, it is used in the worst sense of the word, which is to provide information that otherwise we never Clay. In fact, if it was not for VO we would have thought that the character was just a kooky old man going around looking at things. To make it worse VO also explains what is happening on the screen! The images we are shown only the decoration for the text we listen. <br /> <br /> I would say that this short film will make a good video for the band or something, so that the images Don "t stand on its own, it is impossible to say. What was left obviously has value as a measure of the technical capabilities of the crew (not incredible, but good), but do not entertain, entertain, thrill, or at least show the history.
