The first point that draws attention to the Â«For Ever Mozart" is the absence of a short story in the IMDb. The explanation is simple, because there is no story, the script, the story, or something that can remember the minimum structure of the film. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most overrated and pretentious directors of the film industry, and it's pointless crap is one of its most hermetic films. I believe that neither he not realized that this story is about, but there are intellectuals who elucubrate justify or explain this dirty movie, and it's funny to read their reviews. <br /> <br /> My voice alone <br /> <br /> The name (Brazil) :. "Para Semper Mozart" ( "Forever Mozart")
