Uh ... this movie sucks. LOT. <br /> <br /> I've read some of the other reviews. Apparently, there are many people who think that everything Woody Allen writes and stars in automatically good ... <br /> <br /> I've watched a few of his films, all hoping that something I was missing. But no, they just suck. Badly written trash. The characters are all very stereotyped (not to mention the rather silly). The plot ... I think she must be mysterious. Not sure about that. character Mr. Elena ... Woody Allen, in any other movie you've seen it. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Woody Allen, go see this movie. If you are under 50 years old, do not worry. (If you're a fan of Woody Allen and you are younger than 50 years ... well, you are unusual. I do not know what to say.)
