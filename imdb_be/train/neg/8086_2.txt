When I first heard about the "Sunny crisis" that is, the load of gypsum, I wondered why I had never heard of such a large cast of the film before. Then I saw it. <br /> <br /> Now I know. <br /> <br /> For the film, which covers the outer space, sun, vast deserts and sprawling cities, is badly cramped and claustrophobic function; it feels like a squat close to each other, so that the camera will not pull back too far <br /> <br /> And the effects, while good, is quite destroyed. we are talking about the imminent destruction of the planet Earth, when a team of scientists and soldiers can not take deadly solar flares. But besides crying, sweating and red glow of all that there is no real sense of emergency. <br /> <br /> Or do not get me started about the cast. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle and others in making this film did not even act with any sense of the material, we can only guess. Makes you wonder who else condominium is not paid in Hollywood .... <br /> <br /> And as far as the end is .... Well, let's just say that a tense and intriguing, but it's too little, too later, in an effort like this. If he maintained that pace throughout the film, maybe I would have heard of «Solar Crisis» before. <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mainly for missed opportunities and bad career moves. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Alan Smith keeps his job making garbage like this?
