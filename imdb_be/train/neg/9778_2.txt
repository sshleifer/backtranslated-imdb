I am confident that the operation will was a favorite on the back of the drive module on the same day. There's absolutely nothing in the way of the story that you might miss if you were otherwise absorbed. And if you need to get in the mood for other activities that you did have a gorgeous cuties on the screen to get you in the mood. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, there is not much that the operation will give to it, it is set in the Korean War, where a platoon of American soldiers, along with the British Tommy gets a little too far ahead and should return to the UN line. It's bad enough, but these guys also come across a bunch of stranded mustache girls and choreographer in the same predicament. <br /> <br /> You know what is sad about this film is that it took generations of women has finally accepted in the army and in combat situations. These girls only from the USO set of women's liberation light years ago. In fact, not even hard bitten professional soldiers, the sergeant in charge of these people can keep it in their pants. <br /> <br /> But it's probably better to recall some of what they were in for screwing. This is not the name of the cast better with me not recognizing any of them for any individual effort. <br /> <br /> Operation Dames is definitely a flop team.
