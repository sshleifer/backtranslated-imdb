This documentary begins with an interesting premise - it's intriguing and persuasive argument that the story of Jesus as it is considered to be probably a myth. Unfortunately, however, after priming us with this, the film shifts gears completely and becomes little more than a non-stop attack on Christianity, and largely focusing on easy targets. <br /> <br /> The author / director clearly has some problems with the Church (a former evangelical Christian and has some legitimate anger), and this film seems to be his form of release. It would be interesting to see the first 20 minutes extended, but on the whole, the film is disappointing.
