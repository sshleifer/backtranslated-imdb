My main comment on this film, as the nail has been able to obtain reliable actors working on this film? Impressive cast ?? even the minor characters, none of which makes this film really is. I must admit, though, cameo Tom Hanks almost made it worth ?? What was that about Tom? You lose a bet? Best cameo in the film of Joe Isuzu, though - today a classic! The room is good. Basinger character, in the struggle with existence as the Pink Lady, makes his way to Vegas motel the motel pitching glorious pyramids cosmetic sales. This occurs as a character Corbett is on the way to Las Vegas to put a suit Elvis to his soon to be ex-wife ?? motivated. What else ??. Extortion. As they both make their way, they have a lot of run-ins with Elvis impersonators, who on his way to the convention, which pretends to Elvis in Las Vegas. The FBI is drawn shortly and begins to keep track of what they think is the Elvis impersonator serial killer. Unfortunately, space does not mean that the film was good. <br /> <br /> When watching this movie, imagine that you are back in first class ?? when storylines and continuity is not very important. It's much nicer to just watch Basinger look pretty in her Pink Lady outfit, rather than wondering why is that it really does not make sense. The film tries his best, but in the end falls way short of the path way. In the end, it is filled with ideas that could theoretically have been funny, but in practice it was not funny. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst, but you may find you do feel like to leave the building while watching this one ???? Do not say I did not warn you!
