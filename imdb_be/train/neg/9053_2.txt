Simply, I found the TV show "Mash" banal instructive about ever so "politically correct" again, pretentious and the greatest sin of all, and this? it (was) extremely boring. Do you have Alan Alda as the main lead "(star)", which is so in love with himself and his intelligence that he really made me embarrassed to even try to sit through an episode. The original series was like McLean Stevson, and Wayne Rogers, whom I am pleased to acknowledge had a certain panache and style of presentation of his character. Nevertheless, Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farrell, both individually and composite together, like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. Loretta Swit, which I also found a dim, and through no fault of her own was amazing to watch, and Harry Bourgoff, which was good in the movie tired look and act as the show went on. Having seen one show a year showed that for me. Jamie Farr was just low brow "comedy" and not even worth mentioning really here at all. So I did not give him (one) rating, which is reading this right now is interesting, that the ratings of any kind is not only a subjective call, but relative. Television, in a relatively rare exceptions, the exception, there is such a waste. This is relatively speaking, Mash had some quality products (by television standards) of that era, and today, and so it deserves two. Rob Ritter
