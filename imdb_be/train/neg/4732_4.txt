When I write a review about the film, maybe it will follow me ... but in fact, I expect that I forgot that I saw this after only two weeks. So why? Because I would be back to watch the film with a low rating, it was fun to watch. I did not expect that I would have to be able to stay in the room while it was on. <br /> <br /> It was not great, but at least it was not unbearable ... nya comedy of errors which always makes me wince. It was just a sweet fluff ... and if you can not accept it, stay in the locker room boys. I agree with those who advocate this film, because it is sure to please their target demographic, and will not be a total bore for an adult. <br /> <br /> It offers a few good chuckles here and there, but not a drop side of the splitter. Of course, it is foolish and only mildly entertaining, but at least it does not suck (like many have said that it does). Maybe these people are afraid of their sensitive side? <br /> <br /> I have a tendency to grade on a bell curve, so that the 4.5 or 6 really good all-around ranking in my book. Giving it 4 makes sense and will maintain its rating at the time of this writing. Give it 1 or 10, as most of them done so far, making the rating figures are meaningless. I can not believe how much people feel one way or the other about this forgettable fluff (or that I did not even bother to write about it). Am I missing something? <br /> <br /> In any case, it should be noted that Emma Roberts is fulfilling its role Clairedycat quite convincingly. Ariell Kebbel is often written in the L * CH role will not be disappointed when her character gets her due. You might also recognize Bruce Spence plays Leonard, although its role supporting. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can skip it if you are an adult. But if there is a pre-teen girl in your life, make this film for her ... and be prepared to hate it entirely (you can even enjoy it).
