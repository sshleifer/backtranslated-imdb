I'm not going into this film bag for all the myriad technical e | in | with | to | in | p | s, it would take two days to map out how all this is not even remotely possible. Others have shown all relevant stupidity already. <br /> <br /> Given all this, I still could have some sort of liked, as long as they do not include all tearfulness, nauseating, rabies, Disneyesque sentimental crap that is so out of place anywhere, but nowhere more so than in space where the smallest mistake could mean instant death. <br /> <br /> «crew», as well as "real" astronaut were equally guilty of putting all your silly nonsense ahead of the rest. He has completely destroyed any value of production may have left. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised NASA let this garbage so that so many people would get so much misinformation about something so important to them. If you have not seen it yet, but himself irritation. Watch Apollo 13 times. At least he tried to be a kind of real.
