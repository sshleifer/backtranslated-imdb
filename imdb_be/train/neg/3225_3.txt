Kids love dinosaurs. This is somewhat a part of their culture. But they have a Land Before Time. The original. At least, the film had a heart. This. This film is just pathetic. Just because kids love dinosaurs does not mean that you can just cook any old story and show it to the children. This movie has no plot, the entire premise is stupid, and it's more numbers thing. Not so, as the soul sucking, Theodore Rex, but light years away from being The Land Before Time.
