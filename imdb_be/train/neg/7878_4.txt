I'm a big fan of the original book and this adaptation is simply bad. First of all, it was very difficult to make a decision if it is children's cartoons or adult friend that has caused a strange mixture in the history of adult and some pretty harsh scenes with a silly little duck, it continues to give "funny" moments in the beginning. <, Br /> <br /> But it hardly matters that the film just boring, not moving and not true to the original stories. He's just not able to convey a picture of all the points of Orwell tried to do in his book. <br /> <br /> {spoiler} <br /> <br /> The second revolution? !! Do they have the guys do not know anything ?? Who will be the next Napoleon? Benjamin? !!
