Is it just me, or that the child is really annoying? <br /> <br /> Hideos sister, spends most of his time running after the naughty little so and so. As for him, well, I know that he is a child n all, but his acting skills about the same as wood dead tree. So far I have only half-way through, and I'm fascinated by the history, but the people in it, let it down, I just hope that he will recover before the end, because I can not know what it's all about. Although some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a laptop, shows all in the opposite direction, that is, the dog is God, Live Evil, etc. ... just seems a little obvious at the moment, has no mention of his obvious meaning (yet anyway) If my opinion will change at the end of the film, I will update this post, but if your reading this, well ... ... See the above statements.
