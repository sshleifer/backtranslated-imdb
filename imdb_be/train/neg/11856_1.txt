I just saw this movie last night at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2006 and seriously makes me wonder, when people actually on the festival films screen before selecting them. The film was awful - I say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives - it was awful. Modine days as a leading man is way more. Gina Gershon sported inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she should be ashamed of their participation in this film. Gloria Reuben was a strange small cameo in her - she, too, should be ashamed. The script was terrible and we did not give absolutely no reason to care about the characters. I very much doubt that it will be picked up, but then again, people in Hollywood are known to sometimes make mistakes. I really think that the "pair of shoes" is a strong contender for the worst movie I have ever seen.
