"Dahmer" an interesting film, but I would not use "terror" or "Thriller" to accurately describe. This is more of a minor character study that seems strange sympathy killer. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Renner reflects a serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who narcotic killed and divided his male victim. The film focuses on the relationship between Dahmer and "native", plays well Cleanup Kay√†ru. <br /> <br /> Kindred almost interesting character: love Dahmer and once escaped the attack, he returns to the Dahmer for sex and survive a second attack <br /> <br /> I think the film. is incoherent, since it is not enough to reflect the years of formation of Dahmer, the events may have created a monster man we see on the screen and does not provide information about the faith Dahmer, he can create a sexy zombie ~ d their victims. <br /> <br /> roles played well, but the story is thin.
