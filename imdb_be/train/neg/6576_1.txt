I do not agree with those remarks, who said that it was a good movie. This is completely sucked into the film. I mean sucked - S.U.C.K.E.D. The history of development of the country. Mia Kirshner has changed from an innocent girl to a party seeking to meet chick for no convincing reasons at all. In addition, all of the actress looked too old students - college students looked about 30 years old - you figure out the rest. I only watched the first ten minutes, and began to fast forward to search for sex scenes. all sex scenes lame, hasty, and, most importantly, do not front at all. All the sex scenes are funny, considering how much clothes they had on. Do yourself a favor - put it down and save a few dollars. Conclusion: History - 0, sex - 0, performing the duties - 0, number - 0 out of 10.
