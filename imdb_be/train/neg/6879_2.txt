Rosie wasted a lot of time to talk about television Tainos, as if they were a super effect on the dynamics of contemporary Puerto Rico. They were not. The truth is that African and Spanish, and she knows it. What kills me is that it is on the screen, looking like some kind of medium light black chicken skin (with obvious black dad, cousins ​​and aunts) pretending to be honest about the true essence of what makes them modern Puerto Ricans, but barely mentioned how Africans affected they speak spanish, food and music. It is so common, and I lost a lot of respect for her, and anything else that it will not support. In addition, because she wants to dance around her African-ness, it is not necessary to take more roles associated with black (ie Blues varnishing). We can find Vanity Black Latina next time (thanks to Zoe Saldana, Gina Torres, Gina biking and Melissa De Sousa). <br /> <br /> In Puerto Rico, there were told that they are in Africa, rather than "black". ... Thank you. We "negros", of course, have nothing to do with "you", so that there is no love lost. But, as you're probably in the United States took advantage of the civil rights movement, we would like to see you give up any decent human treatment you received blood courtesy, sweat and tears, "black" out of the back do not share anything with. <br /> <br /> If I have a terrible image of Puerto Ricans in the media, but we negros do not waste time trying to disrespect you, because we know that the media like to use the low scores and the behavior of all minorities to maintain meaningless generalizations. However, you probably had to deception, that one you somehow white or above ... you are not. In addition, you somehow feel compelled to believe that black culture BET ... again you are wrong and need to take a vacation from the hood. Try to visit Atlanta, Ga., Houston, Texas, Charlotte, NS Sun Trust me, none of these negros want to demand "culture" either.
