This is without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen ... <br /> <br /> The plot is so full of holes, the story of how bad bad Remek suspense movies and actors sound as read directly from the manuscript for the first time. Worst of all, Steve Guttenberg. He plays his character as he was in the "Police Academy" - the same stupid womanizer -. And it is not suitable for leading man that was a thriller <br /> <br /> It's really hard to believe that Hanson will make «LA Confidential» ten years later ... <br /> <br /> To avoid this like the plague ...
