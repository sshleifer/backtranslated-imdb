Writer / director of the film obviously does not know does not know anything about the film. I think that the DP for this project was tied up and replaced by a monkey, because everyone saw was either too dark or had a hot hot spot than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible, the characters were very one-dimensional. For someone to say that this film was made for poker enthusiasts and fans to shoot that someone is cheating them myself (this was probably the writer / director). Not one fan of poker in the world does not love this movie. Even your money man hates this project. To go to the casino and play a few hands does not give you the experience to write about poker. Keep your day job. And if he plays poker, then you should be hurt'n.
