Yes, there are worse movies out there. Most of them are made for fun, on a shoe string budget, or TV film of the week, but even if it was a "Film Week" will not vote no more than two stars. This is a bad movie about a serious subject with the participation of an abused woman who flees, king of slurry people to protective hands of the king wussy people. (If this is an attempt to show that it does not need a man to protect her, than a weakling human superfluouse the film and should not be in it at all). He has no suspense, no development of character, and a character who can be outwitted in rotton onions. (I think she washes off her engagement ring on a boat off the contained tank, not just release overboard into the ocean (where her body should be anyway), and after her husband finds her, demonstrating that it is a moron she still makes children's assumptions that lead to almost get killed her.) I'm always surprised when I see the kind of overall high rating of the film as it gets, and it makes me realize that Dr. Seuss still has a huge untapped market of people who will be challenged by his work . After I made to humanity laugh, I cry.
