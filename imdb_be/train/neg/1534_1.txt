With a block of digital video to acting, making Keanu "I'm so wooden I could be me Plank" Reeves looks like the Oscar winner this movie bites (pun not intended). The best thing about it eRATicate box in the 2nd segment (which of the three seemed to be the strongest part of the plot and the "twist" plan). I wish I had spent the Â£ 3.99 it cost me to something else, as the ERM .... Congenital Killer: Directors Cut. If you buy it, you're really in for a disappointment, do yourself a favor and avoid it like the plague. If you are looking for something and amateur actors, which are more than a wooden 2x4 and then go ahead. However, if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere as Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta: The Werewolf Hunt.
