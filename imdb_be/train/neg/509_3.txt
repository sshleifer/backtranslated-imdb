This movie about British prisoners of war from World War II escape from the camp in Germany. <br /> <br /> I believe, "Wooden Horse" depressingly boring. The subject can be an exciting and suspenseful adrenaline fueled, but "wooden horse" told in a very simple way. This is a collection of simple and poorly narrated events, without suspension and thrills. The first half clearly shows how the prisoners dug a tunnel, but things are so simple, with not enough blunders and shave close, to make me on the edge. The second half of the film is even worse, they are just moving from one place to another without the cat-and-mouse chase. Maybe the characters talk a little bit smaller and more action in an action movie! I'm disappointed, "wooden horse", the wasted potential to be a great film.
