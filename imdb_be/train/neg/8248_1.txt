There have been more interesting Polish documentaries about worm farming, brail_ !! Competition (worm farming) was a better story and more interesting characters. I was physically ill after watching this movie. Cheating husband (I think dougray_scott_) was a joke in every sense of the word. Poor Jennifer must really need a job, and that was with an accent !!. Location and random encounters reminded me of a high school prank, and showed humility 10-year-old in a cooking class. It was so bad that I think I'm going to write a sequel, entitled "This is not laxitiveÂ». Thank you for listening to it was a large weight of my conscious.
