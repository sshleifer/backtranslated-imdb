I have also gone through hundreds of children's films in the past, believe that this is one of the worst I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1) I am outraged at this day and age in order to explain to your children that Russia is not "bad guys". Besides that mocks Russian names like «Poopchev» inappropriate. <br /> <br /> 2) birthday scene flies grandfather contain quasi-sexist jokes in which he meant that the men drink beer, and a woman talking on the phone. The other two also flies without having to use the word "shit" twice. <br /> <br /> 3) The entire film is a lot like the 1950s stereotyping and propaganda, I thought that we, as a nation, proudly raising above. <, Br /> <br /> as a whole, it's just raw, poorly animated, even a poorly written and do not waste time browsing.
