We bought the movie from a store called Poundland. We were looking for more inspiration, as we have already bought the movie No Big apply redid it. <br /> <br /> We expect that this film will be very inspiring, so that we can alter and put it on the tube. However, it was a shock. It is a sad thing word that comes to mind. Bad effects and the script is not enough to get you to look at. The main body of the woman seems to be shouted at suitable moments in a pathetic attempt to keep the audience interested. However, it only makes you wonder, they blow the budget, getting her to take her clothes off? If so, then I would ask that the payment! It looks like a home movie footage did not correspond with each other and work as an amateur camera, which makes our remakes of bad movies look professional. I can not believe that it is currently being sold as a commercial product. <br /> <br /> it's just a sad and ugly to look at. Actors bad, and there is no degree of professionalism about it. There are no words to describe how terrible it is.
