... which is not really a ringing endorsement. In general, "Dinocroc" was much better than the movie. Of course, in this movie he played Matt Borleni complete wimp bag that held the whole movie was crying about his little brother get eaten Dinokrkami. But the special effects in "Dinokrkah" were better storylines were better, and the effect was better. That's the problem with «Blood Surf» - 1) killer crocodile looks like a model of a baby with a sliding jaw. 2) plot funny. Matt Borleni & Co. get shipwrecked on a desert island, where they encounter a group of frenzied ugly Filipino natives who try to force yourself on a woman in the group. What was a waste of 15 minutes of the film. And 3) there is not enough time crocodile. There are some redeeming qualities "Blood Surf" - the actress is quite attractive and Matt Borleni gets eaten by a crocodile until the end of the film. But if you're facing death, and just enough time to watch the one Matt Borleni / killer crocodile movie, skip this and fire up "Dinocroc" instead.
