I never thought that a film could be so brutal, but unfortunately I was wrong. Terrible acts terrible story, terrible consequences. The crocodile was a terrible and stupid sex / murder scene all in one that was a bad move from the word go. It was really shocking, and it is not a compliment! How can someone make this film, watch it back, and then actually say: "Yes, that's a good movie. People will see that "If you have not seen it, I beg you not to worry :-(
