* Chisel * It's a fake! All this is fake! There are no ghosts or zombies, Alan Lord and his cousin or brother or half-brother or something like that, he wants to castle and a name for themselves. Thus, he puts it too complicated and unnecessary senseless plan ala Scooby-Doo manage Alan suicide. Much of the film he is gaining ginger and attack them. He did not even killing them. He falls to sleep and the girl disappears, and he thinks that he buried them somewhere. If he looked at the so-called ghost of Evelyn, he could tell that she had been wearing gloves! My God, what a waste of time. Do not bother to watch it, rent and if you bought it and have not looked yet, sell it. Quickly! Do yourself a favor and stay away from The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave. I give that bitch shit-O-lanterns.
