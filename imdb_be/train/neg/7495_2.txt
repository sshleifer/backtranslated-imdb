Fox, "The True Story of Jesse James" (1957) is an extremely wide-poor remake of its prestigious 1939 Tyrone Power / Henry Fonda classic "Jesse James." I'm not sure where is the wine, but the cast in this version of the two central characters, uneven direction of Nicholas Ray and awkward scenario must, of course, something to do with it. <br /> <br /> at the end of the thirties and forties Tyrone Power was a major leading man of Fox, but in the fifties, his star began to weaken, and the studio head Daryl Zanuck began to groom freshman Robert Wagner, to take his place. It was a big mistake on the part of Zanuck, as Wagner was less suitable replacement. With the possible exception of Â«Broken Lance" (1954) and "Between Heaven and Hell" (1956), it is difficult to think of Wagner having determined nothing! In addition, Jeffrey Hunter was nothing more than a contract player, Fox | before being assigned to play Frank James Jesse Wagner in the "real story of Jesse James." Borrowed from the studio last year, another feature of the actor was his beautiful and index performance in the John Ford classic "The Searchers." But it is to play along with Wagner as the second half of the James Brothers, nothing else how boring. no player brings no Soba, or the color of their respective roles. They totally miss the mark, lacking the charisma and appeal so vividly reflects the power of Foundation and in the original. The film is also marred by too many memories, and throughout the film script of Wagner as the Robin Hood of the American west, comes across as an unattractive introverted reproach that you can not feel any compassion for all. The supporting cast is hardly worth mentioning, but it's a shame to see such a great actress Agnes Moorehead hardly get a look in as Ma James. <br /> <br /> The best aspect of this uninvolving so-so western is great cinema Cinemascope / color big Joe McDonald and excellent music score underrated and little-known composer Lee Harlayn!
