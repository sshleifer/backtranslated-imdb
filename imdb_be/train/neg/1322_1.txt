.... because if I was, I could have wished that it was me crucified on a wooden cross! I'm still trying to determine the plot of the film - and I have to be "generous" that there is even a story to begin with. As mentioned earlier, this is wrong on the cover of the DVD, Richard Dreyfuss is actually a star. He was either in the film. And if he really was "disappointed", as the back cover showed that he was, well, it's probably because he said, so as to be in the disaster movie and could not get out of it! The film really seemed to focus on Jared Martin, and what is his role in the film was supposed to be, except in extreme close -ups, was not as big a mystery as to what was in fact the role of Gene Barry - was not, And if we talk about the "big" ... who would be a great idea to meet Gene Barry clothing Lightly, who demonstrated his pants literally pulled up to his chin, he should be sentenced to hard time watching this film broke sober. I could go on and on about how terrible this film was a dialogue does not match the "actors' mouths (thinks Clutch Cargo), a random jump from scene to scene (again, being generous, even calling picture frames" scene "), due to lack of plot .... However, if you are in a bad early '70s the genre, and if you are in a cottage in Michigan nothing but the movie and a box for a child and a cat photos, I recommend to have a good bottle wine before proceeding to this strange trip to the cinema, because you'll be thankful that you can not aux the thread that the next day!
