I think Philip Kaufman read the Cliff Notes version of Kundera's novel, and then set about making this film. Well, of course, it will not have an impact of the original. Kundera's novels are great because of his manipulation of narrative concept, its ability to step and of the stories that he constructs. This film does not even try! One dream sequence Teresa, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, revised and does not make any sense. In addition, and this is perhaps less a point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks like Ben Stiller in it (I know that this is not really a complaint is valid, but hey). An excellent example of Hollywood-ising otherwise fine literature.
