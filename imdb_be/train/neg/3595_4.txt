I was not as "lucky" as some of the others commenting on this film, I had no choice from a number not seen ... let's say ... "fertile" mind Sarni. I agree with many: some of the actresses who spend a lot of time and topless (go-go) Dancing is not so attractive. I kinda liked Fraulein Crank (?) ... she was so ugly, she is cute! The action was pretty hard, as well, though, and deliver lines in a second language may have had a lot of problems. Trying to follow the plot was a major chore: there was one, really? I heartily agree with one other comment: vampire film, there is not a lot of blood. So, if you want a good blood-sucking clicks, check out these classic Hammer as "Horror of Dracula" and (my personal favorite) "The Brides of Dracula." <br /> <br /> The most (unintentionally) humorous part where the lady doctor gets her clothes torn cloud of bats ... that you've never seen! ... bats, I mean. <br /> <br /> Well, as a time-waster, if you happen to catch it on cable here in the Great White North, but for God's sake, do not rent it out!
