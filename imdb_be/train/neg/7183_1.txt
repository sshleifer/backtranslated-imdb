It's worse adaptation of the classic story that I have ever seen. They are without the need of modernization and some things really just sick. <br /> <br /> The songs rarely move history. They seem to be thrown in at random. Aerial scene of gauze pointless and absurd. <br /> <br /> This is not only one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but it is by far the worst musical I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> this is only possible as a classic because «A Christmas Carol» is such a classic story. Just because the original story was a classic does not mean that some low-cost adaptation.
