I have read a couple of good reviews on this forum for a "Mr. scar," but for those who are uninitiated in the genre of Italian gangster films, like me, the picture will be probably makes very little sense. Indeed, after the initial installation, with the participation of ten million lira fraud, the picture has become a fairly common revenge flick with a slight twist in the identity (Al Cleaver) character Rico. The gang war, the site was fouled for me to include Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Capriol), but, like most of the other spectators noticed that he was going only one who gave this picture of any life with him is often ineffective attempts of violence. I found some incredible that thugs Manzar, who raced through the streets, Tony does not actually blow before Tony even put his hand on them. For all his savings as the main character, Jack Palance was spent rather unceremoniously in disappointing about the finale, which makes working title U.S., «Mr. Scarface», a controversial issue. I've seen enough of spaghetti westerns, to know that they do not do all the work; I think in this case, my first look at the spaghetti gangster flick not quite do it either.
