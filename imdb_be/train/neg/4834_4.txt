I look forward to the movie Kathryn Bigelow with much anticipation after an endless deceit and 6 Oscars, he was honored. Unfortunately, this is not really a good movie. Description of the situation, of course, seemed to be accurate and believable at all points, but other than that the story just came across as incomplete and the direction of the film turned out to be uncertain and haphazard. Actors throw effort, but I do not really get what the movie is trying to be for me. It's not as thrilling and atmospheric as Full Metal Jacket, but not epic like brothers band, not as action-packed as ... well, anything. Of course, I can not understand why he has been nominated for many, and why people are "hyping its" these epic proportions. Keep in mind, given the caliber of films in the past few years, I believe that it is not so much to choose from.
