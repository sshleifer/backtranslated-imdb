This movie was terrible. The plot is sucked, the action was bad, the editing was inappropriate, and this movie makes me want to poke my eye. I wish I had the time I spent watching this movie again. Balloon scene was stupid Mormon jokes really old soundtrack sucked, I have not seen the chemistry between these two terminals, it is full of stereotypes, stupid local "CelebrityÂ» cameo's..most was said Del, "I'm going to go as fast as I want .. "computer idiot. What's the worst that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side, even they screwed so. This film will help create a long line of dull efforts to mainstream LDS beliefs in Hollywood. IE RM, Church of the ball, etc. etc. I would refrain from watching this movie, and instead run headlong into a brick wall. You will be more entertaining than watching this poor excuse for a show.
