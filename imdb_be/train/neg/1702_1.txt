But you know what? Even David Lynch can make a piece of shit. <br /> <br /> Maybe Lynch wanted you to go beyond the limits of normality and absurdity of the experience in itself as a pure subject-of-the-know. Can be brutal, cacophonist sounds, and chicken scratch visuals should be kept in mind is something about the place of humanity in the world, about our relation to the real, about the absurdity of it all. <br /> <br /> Instead, he simply said one thing to me: I just lost $ 20 <br /> <br /> If I wanted to insult insulting, I could crank Hansen on high and let me ears bleed ... If I wanted to absurd for absurdity, I could just take a shit on a plate and see that for 33 minutes <br /> <br /> There is one redeeming quality to blunt the country - is meta, Meteo funny, I mean, it's so bad that not even funny, because it's so bad. This fact, however, it's a little funny. <br /> <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, and then buy the Land blunt. If not, save yourself the agony.
