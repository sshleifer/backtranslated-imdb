In one respect, it's like "The Wizard of Oz" from Paris in black and white and in color Riviera. But this, they say, of possessive love, destructive and moral decline, while in fact be a designer dress, Riveria shots, a lot of big expensive cars, as well as musical and dance interludes offering Vincente Minnelli on one of its output days. Watchable, but fine desperate example, a dark portion of the material and compelling type header in opposite directions. (Was this a model for "The Talented Mr. Ripley? Does anyone feel the closeness between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon?)
