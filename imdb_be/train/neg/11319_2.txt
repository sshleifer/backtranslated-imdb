cyborg vampire rule the world and the use of human blood as fuel, but will shift power by renegade android (Kris Kristofferson) and a warrior woman (Kathly Long), they are faced with Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels (who played a cyborg in this funny movie) C all the questions left unanswered that terrible movie, the most piquant is who invented it, to throw the country singer Kris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to give as good as he gets, no, do not get me wrong, I could see Kristofferson how lincheva ator or something, but not as a cyborg. Ironically one suspects that it was written for Dolph Lundgren, but Lundgren must have the wisdom to do so. However, despite the catastrophic casting Kristofferson easily the most enjoyable thing about the film. He provides insight into much larger man then fuzzy Kathy Long. (And Kristofferson plays a robot), despite the miscasting, Kristofferson gives several points of interest. Lance Henriksen is a slum and Gary Daniels wasted, but mostly knights knocked to the failure to sense. You go in terror wondering who the hell thought it was even a good idea on paper. (This is a film where the shared Kristofferson fighting robots in a backpack) The worst is over, if continued, fortunately, it has not materialized, although I still have nightmares on offer on the likelihood of such an event. <, Br /> <br /> * with 4 (Poor)
