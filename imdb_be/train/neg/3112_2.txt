Let me start by saying, I'm going to try not to put too many spoilers in this. I usually like Robin Williams movie, but the stone was not one of them. It has been declared as a disturbing thriller. Night Listener deceptive. To be blunt there were 6 people in the opening of the theater of the day, 2 out, for good reason. The film was in my poorly written and directed. The action was good, but again there was nothing to work with. The film is about the narrator, who reads a good book of a dying child. However, the * insert here * ghost no one can verify the presence of children. So Williams went to Wisconsin to try to find the author, but all he gets is a headache and excuses from the watchman boys. There, that's it, that's all. Wait for about half an hour and the film ends. It had so many thrills and chills as a dentist office visit. Homosexual undertones or overtones was not really anything to do with the story, and the movie was a bit of profanity, but it seemed to be thrown in there to absolutely no reason and little sense. In conclusion, I really can not write a decent review of this film, because there was nothing to it, it was so exciting as watching paint dry. I gave him 2 because the actor for what it is worth in the order and it was not directed by Uwe Boll.
