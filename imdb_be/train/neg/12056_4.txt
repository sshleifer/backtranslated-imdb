This film is a good example of how through manipulation of the media, you can sell the film, which is nothing more than a very unfunny TV sitcom. In Puerto Rico, a daily newspaper with the widest circulation constantly written about the wonders of this film, almost silencing all others. By coincidence, the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners. Weekly Claridad only newspaper on the island, which has analyzed the form and content of the film, and showed all its drawbacks, clich√©s and bad writing. <br /> <br /> Just because the film makes the audience laugh with easy and understandable jokes, because you can learn the actor and scenery, does not make it acceptable film.
