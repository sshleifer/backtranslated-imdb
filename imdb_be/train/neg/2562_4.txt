Let me start by saying, this film has an interesting point at the very beginning with the exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator: And? Wait a minute! Who the hell are you? George: I'm the new George. Studio too cheap to pay Brendan Fraser. Host: What do you part? George: New George just lucky, I guess. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is only funny in the whole film. <br /> <br /> It was still entertaining ... But then again, I'm easily entertained ... <br /> <br /> I would not say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen (this name is very funny nya-disaster movie ...), this film falls # 7 on my list of the lower 15 ... <br /> <br /> If you have a small child who is easily entertained, you will enjoy this movie . If you are a film-Watcher, who wants a good, funny movie, you'll end up shooting yourself halfway through it ..
