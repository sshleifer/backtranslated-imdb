FLIGHT Fury takes the mantle to be very WORST Steven Seagal movie I've ever seen ... until now. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible longing without any scene no interest actions Segal Sun really try this - it is thick, and its voice is not dubbed times more <br /> <br /> Co-star fare will not better, being rather sorry-3 appraisers load <br /> <br /> on the direction of .. Keusch very bad, and it's not surprising that he is also responsible for a couple of ugly types Segal (SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE) scenario co Seagal himself ridiculously incompetent. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb $ 12M was spent on this sad load of old tosh. - If these figures are correct, I feel a lot of tax fiddle, how far, this amount was spent <br /> <br /> FLIGHT rage actually shot for shot remake with Michael Dudikoff flick BLACK -. Thunder, who will be better than this tripe <br /> <br /> this is not a quality to redeem Anyway, give it a miss! 1/2 * to *****
