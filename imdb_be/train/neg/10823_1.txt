I do not like to use the word "terrible" to describe any kind of work in film, for which a lot of time, effort, talent, and money is spent on its creation, but Zefferelli attempt to adapt the novel by Charlotte Bronte's "Jane Eyre" is a waste of time. < br /> <br /> script lacks the grace and strength, all the viewer explained in no uncertain terms, leaving room for the imagination. The leading actors are woefully miscast, obviously hired for their star names, as well as the musical accompaniment of sentimental and dull. Charlotte G nsbur and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with each other at all. It looks like a wet noodle, even worse than Joan Fontaine, who at least was capable of a bit of emotional involvement in what should be a story that did not take place passion. William Hurt and operates the entire movie on a single tone, and the tone is flat and devoid of energy. of course, limp and insipid script does not help any of these fine actors differently in their efforts to blow any life in this film. <br /> <br /> Joan Plowright in Mrs. Fairfax, the creation of Disney, which keeps popping up sweeten the scenes in which she would have been better to leave out. <br /> <br /> There is no mystery surrounding the history of the first wife of Rochester. The potential role of the second wife played as dolls Barbie on Elle MacPhearson, is null cipher. <br /> <br /> Fiona Shaw, a very great actress, is completely wasted as Aunt Jane, Mrs. Reed. It would be better cast as Mrs. Fairfax. Only Amanda Root as a teacher beloved school Jane is any genuine sympathy or plausibility. <br /> <br /> I saw this version of "Jane Eyre" after viewing Robert Young for British television, made in 1997, starring Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. There's no comparison. life, romantic and deeply moving version of Jung as an exploding supernova, compared with a damp squib in Zefferelli. <br /> <br /> I'll be interested to see the version of 1970 with Timothy Dalton, which I have read some good stuff on this Web site. I am amazed at how many people liked Yorkshire picture book Zefferelli in. <br /> <br /> About all I can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and brightly colored cinematography, for which a complete dud.
