They probably should have called this movie the map, because most of all the stupid movie revolves around the cemetery map. Not to mention how many of the same boring pictures map there. The only thing that they show more than the card itself is small droplets of sweat, which is constantly growing on the forehead of our protagonist. This, of course, was the way the filmmakers show us how incredibly stressful things get on Immortal Hills Cemetery. Let us now, could not they have shown us only one of the scenes of death? We hear a lot about how all those listed on the map is reduced, like flies, but we do not get to see anything. Some how I Bury The Living experienced to hold my attention, so I was pretty generous with the rating I gave it, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. If you have a deep admiration for cards or sweat, I recommend renting a movie better than I like I spit on your grave, or I'll drink your blood.
