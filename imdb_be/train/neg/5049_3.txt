A group of us watched the film, which is really ugly. We were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite hero Joe was not on (it is not, as a writer / producers could do anything about it). Drafting was poor, the script was subpar. What really annoyed us: 1. If two guys realized that they were both dating Natalie, they do not just leave them to put up with this stupid (and eventually destroys) the competition - but only because they were brave guys competing and not because they really wanted to Natalie. 2. Despite the fact that he can not choose between two guys to reunite, Natalie suddenly decides that she really likes one of the guys and is now ready to marry him? (And there was an omen that he was actually the best man, it is as if the authors have thrown a coin, and then just spit it at some convenient point in the film). 3. Blair makes a point to say that she does not want children, and then all of a sudden, when her husband says he wants to have children, she sweetly agrees.
