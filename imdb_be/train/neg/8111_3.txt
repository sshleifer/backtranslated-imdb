Another great film Costa-Gavras. This is an excellent presentation of the situation in Latin America and the US involvement in Latin America policy. These facts may or may not be accurate, but it is a fact that the US has been deeply involved in the coup and supporting Latin American dictatorships. <br /> <br /> In spite of this, although the spirit of the film follows the typical leftist / communist propaganda during the Cold War. Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathies and his films are always biased. For example, it is the United States acts as a cruel and inhuman, representing extremist activity Tupamaros' as something positive. <br /> <br /> As it turned out, it was a blessing to Uruguay and the rest of Latin America, the United States became involved. Europe is full of poor Eastern European prostitutes. I had never heard of the poor Uruguayan or Chilean girls prostitution on a massive scale, as is the case in most countries in Eastern Europe. The United States is fighting a dirty war, and God bless all of us monster of Soviet Communism was defeated. Unfortunately, the US had to do what he did in Latin America (and elsewhere), but sometimes you have to play dirty. This is not the idealistic world as Costa-Gavras and Matamoros wanted to believe. If Matamoros to come to power in Uruguay, we would have other Ukraine in Latin America. <br /> <br /> In general, this film is worth a corrupt and bankrupt leftist ideology of past times, and tries to pass it as idealistic and morally correct.
