This movie was stupid piece of shit. Poor all. Why are we, who love western movies get thrown nine out of ten times when renting westerns. It seems that if you do not see the names as Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner, Tom Selleck or attached to the lid, it is not worth bothering with. For the most part the main action Shiloh Falls occurred in 1892, but the guns of the 1860 models have been used. Even the shooting was bad - in one scene, Marshal fanned his six-shooter about nine times and could not get into any of the three big men, who were only about twenty feet. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this senselessness. Perhaps those who took part in this film could take some lessons in the school of acting Sunset Carson.
