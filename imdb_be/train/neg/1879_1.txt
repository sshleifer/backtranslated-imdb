Hard to believe that this is a continuation of Henry Fool. Hard to believe that the same director and actors have been involved in both films. While Henry Fool refreshing, witty, comic, Fay Grim slow, sad, and does not go anywhere. Where was the wit? I'm confused. <br /> <br /> It is 10 years since I have seen Henry Fool, and many of his dialogues and scenes are still vivid in my mind. Fay Grim painful to watch. This is not the fault of the actors who are well (Posey) or large (Jeff Goldblum) - fault lies entirely plot, dialogue, and even some of the filming (low budget is not an excuse). Huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I could not pay attention to the story, I was so boring, so disappointed ... if you liked this, you might not enjoy Henry Fool so much ... two the film has absolutely nothing to do with each other ... there is no continuity in the faces of the characters ... it's all trickery to induce a supporter of Henry Fool to see the sequel. <br /> <br /> I turn off this now - Henry in a prison with the Taliban?!?!
