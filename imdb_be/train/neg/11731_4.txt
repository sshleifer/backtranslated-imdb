As far as I'm concerned rusting version of The Merry Widow worst case ever made. There is no tenderness or love, or spiritual about this version, it's all terrible, German, sinister nonsense. It reminded me of the Nazis fall; who cares? <br /> <br /> This silence Edition von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story. In this one we carnivorous John Gilbert and his gross relatively Prince lusting after this stupid American actress, played by Mae Murray possessed modern perm hairstyle and a feminist implausible way that left me again and again. I like romance is light and beautiful, with a slow assembly of the window; Sun harsh and sadistic as this. And let us, that the bee has bitten lips to get rid of them, girl! <br /> <br /> Just seen a live performance show, if you want to get a real idea of ​​the sweetness of the original operetta Franz Lehar. Otherwise, wait until the TCM shows Jeanette MacDonald - acoustic version of Maurice Chevalier. It's much better.
