I love books and Henry James Washington Square was an exception. I was very pleased to see a new movie coming out, based on the book of that name. Jennifer Jason Leigh is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin is good enough to play major roles. Albert Finney is miscast, and does not perform the role well. I wanted to make Maggie Smith .... or, more precisely, its stupid, tasteless role. The real problem, and what is lacking in this latest version is a good screenplay, music and direction. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep in the theater watching the long, drawn out and extremely boring film. There are a few pauses in the dialogue than Pinter Play. In the book, I felt a deep concern for Catherine Sloper and her life. The film had the opposite effect. I also did not like the twist, where her aunt has a sexual attraction to Morris. Eeeeeeeek. YUK. <br /> <br /> See if you can not sleep, it's definitely snoozer. Do not look if you have depression. You need Zoloft after that. <br /> <br /> Of course, "The Heiress" was exceptional with Olivier Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the lead roles. The actor, who played her father was on the mark as indifferent, cold .... the parents are still grieving for his dead wife Catherine and hating him. The film was not faithful to the book, but no one is. <br /> <br /> This film was a box office failure. I have no doubt as to why.
