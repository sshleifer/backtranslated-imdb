My family and I are screened Underdog night. And as bad as it Underdog (my four-year loved it), Hot Rod makes it look like an Oscar worthy material. The only thing that could save this film would Evel himself came out of retirement to slap Samberg in the face to create this film. I admit, however, that the soundtrack was good. I was not sure when the film was set in the 80s, but with the majority of music from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I'd pass. And just stay home and watch the test pattern on your local TV station. Or, if you are determined to watch this, people under the influence might enjoy it.
