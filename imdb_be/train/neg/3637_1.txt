I'm surprised by the positive reviews for this film thoroughly boring. <br /> <br /> Often, with foreign films I jump reviews that complain about the slow pace and seeming "lack of action", as many of the best international films do not live up to the Western model of Hollywood cinematic history. <br /> <br /> I love frequent tweaks and lack of clich√©s in the international arena of the film. I really like the fact that many foreign films are not tying things in a neat bow delicious. <br /> <br /> However, this film did not offer a redemptive value the time I wasted watching. A lot of significant development of character, entirely attractive plot arc in no way emotionally communicate with any of the characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: A bunch of immature emotionally disturbed preconceived colonists tortured their slaves, and the little girl will suffer from her only friend, when a "house boy" finally gets satiated and takes his abuse of her, <br / > <br /> while in the above acute and dramatic, this film will bore you while you play the script. I was so empty, it took three sessions to finish it, and I would not do, that would not be for the positive ratings. <br /> <br /> If you have an academic interest in the period I strongly recommend to sink to this.
