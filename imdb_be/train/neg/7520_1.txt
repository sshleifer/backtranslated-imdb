This film proves that you can not judge a film by a strange art on the DVD cover. He also says that you should learn more about the film before you buy it (or get it to someone for Christmas). At the beginning of this movie actually it looks more promising. Well, until you meet the characters. Pumpkin Jack (the old guy from down the street) brings a college co-ed book full of spells witches, which it leaves to its annual haunted house (where the film takes place). After that there is some booze, fights, and soft core porn. Then, the film finally comes after an hour. <br /> <br /> In general, Hallow's End were predictable, unsuspensful, and resemble a soft-core porn. This film is probably best seen with a group of friends who have nothing better to do, so it is a good movie, to deride. And for the first time the audience, it's really fun to make predictions right people who die.
