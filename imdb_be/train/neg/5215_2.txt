It's the same old, "If I can not get funding for my project, I have to inject myself" monster movie. There's nothing new. This is similar to Jeff Goldblum film «Fly». Man manages to retain some semblance of common sense, but in the end succumb to the effects of his experiments. Action is very bad. There are people who act stupidly all along the way, putting their lives at risk for no good reason. The guy continues to go to the lab, he was denied entry. Then there is his relationship with the young woman and her son. It must be recognized that he looks good, but it seems like a lot of trouble. It's just a pretty big waste of time. Even his tyrannosaurs suit looks like it came out on a rack on a Star Trek convention.
