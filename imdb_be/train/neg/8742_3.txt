After watching the trailer of the film in the cinema, I thought that it was the original concept for a thriller by setting it in the competitive world of computer companies. All star cast was another message that this film is likely to be good. But if I had not gone to see him in the first week of release, he was gone for 2 weeks, I was afraid of missing something. Patiently waiting for his DVD release, then I bought him rushing home to see a pleasant evening. Premonition on the way home was much better than the movie. To begin, the direction is appalling. There is no thought left in her at all, and the director is simply part for himself, so that he may appear in the film. I would not be rushing out to use it in the future. Secondly, the leading role fully as miscast Ryan Philippe. Philip is usually a cool character in Cruel Ways and guns, but that it should be awkward hero, which he is trying to portray hooked when it is running and causing friends, but it just does not look right. The female stars, Rachael Leigh Cook and Forlani does not have enough, but if they do none of the performances are close to them record. The only aspect of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could be done for him, and this is his temper and mysterious ways that pull the film together. The final point is that this film is one that fills trailer with scenes you do not see in the movie, but instead is only available in the DVD section deleted scenes. Causing even more frustration, as though some of these scenes are imperfect, they fill an important gap in the history.
