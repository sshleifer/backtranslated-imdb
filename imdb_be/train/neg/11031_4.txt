It is interesting to see what the director was trying to do with this film. But the problem is that it is not very good. There was nothing really original in the film, and while the site was well presented, the main characters were all a bit on the small and you do not bother for any of them. <br /> <br /> Instead of fresh (and sometimes downright bad) photos leaves much to be desired, but I guess you can not expect much from people who are just doing a low budget film by its handle. It's unfair to review the film and compare it to other big-budget films. But, unfortunately, this is what needs to be done. By itself, this is not very good. And compared to the others, it's still not very good. But it is not without good points! I liked the story. It was built quite nicely and are connected with each other well in the end. Sometimes in very dark scenes, he managed to create a horrible feeling, as well. <br /> <br /> However, in the end the film is not impressive. Symbols are largely non-existent, and we do not care about any of them. Any of them may die, but it is possible to determine the final "survived" with very early.
