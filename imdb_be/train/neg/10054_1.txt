I'm not alone in admiring the first film of Superman, the film that made Richard Donner's masterful. I'm not alone in despising Richard Lester's Superman 2 ... which brings us to Richard Donner cut of the same film, unfortunately, it still is an absolute abomination. <br /> <br /> the world of Superman is when disbelief suspension needs strong doses, but Superman 2 reaches too far. It does not matter who directed Superman 2, because the script insults the intelligence grader. In a sense, there is no story because the characters have zero motivation to act in the way they are, unlike the original Superman. With or without power, the power of Superman (or lack thereof) is treated in the least believable way. There is too much to criticize, so I will not bother. I condemn this film ... maybe farce Lester version more suited to the idiotic script this movie is based on. Super-duper bad.
