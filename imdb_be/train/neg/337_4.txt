Well, what to say. Golden child falls into the category of "so bad it's good." Eddie Murphy has some funny (and sometimes very annoying line), but you still entertained. Chales dance has never been worse than his role as a villain Sardo Numspa (that af *** ed up the name of this ??). <br /> <br /> Who should follow the golden child ... um ... hard to say, but my guess would be those who love films and malfunctioning can be entertained by bad acting, bad story and even more awkward dialogue. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
