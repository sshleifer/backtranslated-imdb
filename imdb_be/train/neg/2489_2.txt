Star Rating: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night Monday Morning <br /> <br /> McBain (played by Gary Busey, before the name became synonymous with the character in the Simpsons) is a (usually) unorthodoxy cop who gets results, but it gets to the head of something rotten. How to avoid the clichés of his partner was killed at the very beginning of the film, the plot instead takes a different turn, and sees that he intended to travel to Mexico, where a top-secret American super tank with incredible firepower and processing capabilities images were smuggled, only to be taken in hostage, together with the crew, a gang of terrorists. <br /> <br /> This is a cheap look (even the '80s standards), the sad little film action was a strange career move, Gary Busey after impress, as the flame-haired villain Mr. Joshua in Lethal Weapon. He just goes through the motions with his character cardboard here, sharp and funny, as always (with «butthorn» is his calling card is suppressed for the bad guys), but no material to back it up. Henry Silva has a presence as a screen villain, but he is completely miscast here as an Arab leader (in red beret!) And terrible script gives him some really stupid clumsy lines of dialogue that make his speech off as ridiculously wood. He's just one of the many militant character actors, including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who pop up, but does not add anything to the mix. After the sad first half without much exciting action, things pick up a bit at the end but it was too little too late, and none of them can not be the task of not fun. *
