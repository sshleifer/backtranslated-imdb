The only reason to give this film at least one star, as the ending made me laugh. I had high hopes, as I usually like bad campy horror holiday, but it simply has no right. It's really just a bad attempt at showing the nature of the slide slowly into madness, which again, is not a bad story, but made bad here. There are some scenes (eg, end) which are not intended to be funny, but it really made me laugh out loud. There were a few times when I thought that the film would actually go in an interesting direction, but he never does what it can and should be. In my opinion, if you are looking for a Christmas slasher flick, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
