Whoever did this nonsense completely missed the point. Jane stupid comics tickle, without being fired. <br /> <br /> This huge mess trying to be fun and exciting, but it's just a mess. There is not a decent performance in it..even usually reliable Zhasperli Karrotty painfully unfunny. <br /> <br /> The American guy whose name escapes me just rubbiush, as it was in flash Gordon. <br /> <br /> Maud Adams tries to villianess, but it's a bit long in the tooth for this kind of thing. All of these things does not matter if she was sexy, or funny, or likable.She is not. Kirsten Holmes sank into obscurity after that and so much better. <br /> <br /> I blushed more exciting things than this down the toilet. avoid
