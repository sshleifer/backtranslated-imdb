We can start with a wooden effect, but this film is a disaster. Growing up in New York, I can tell you that this film is an insult to those who are familiar with the community or nation. I do not even culture, in any case, and found it to be Hollywoodized debris pieces to fit its own fictional, humorous presentations of culture and language, someone who looks Seinfeld knows is inaccurate. This is a colossal waste of time and, what is worse, it is not interesting, because the result is obvious, and the confrontation scenes are laughably bad. Who acts in this way? Nobody. <br /> <br /> writer's name sounds Israeli, or something like that, but it is clear that he has no idea about the subject he writes about. Looking at his bio, it is shocking, he lived in New York, and I wonder how much real connection he had with the community. Even mediocre films like "Stranger Among Us" better and closer to the truth than this dreck. Reading loans this guy is not surprising that he has written all C class films that somehow point star. shocking. Maybe he knows someone, because this scenario is even below par for a bad movie Dolph Lundgren.
