"Secretary" is one of those cheesy, formulaic, "thrillers" that one tend to look on a Sunday afternoon, when there is almost nothing else on. Although the plot (and the crazy woman is jealous of anyone who does well on it in the office and decides to do everything she can to stop them) may be one of a kind, I found countless twists, probably taken from other films for television I was subjected to for the same reason. <br /> <br /> what's worse, I was not wild about the cast. Mel Harris is one of those actresses who are in many television movies as either "mama" or some "victims" of foul play or abuse, that one should be surprised the kind of life she leads. In this, she enjoys playing mothers and victims of psycho-secretary Sheila Kelly, who was not a very good choice as a villain. While Sheila Kelly made some good career movements (Singles, hacking, and I think that law and order), it also suffers from a string of helpless television movie roles, and this one just adds to it. As for the rest, I do not have any precise memories about them, so that should say something. <br /> <br /> This one will play for the entire term network services (I think that's where I saw it), but don "t bother to watch it, if you are not too boring for words. Not that it will make you more excitied ...
