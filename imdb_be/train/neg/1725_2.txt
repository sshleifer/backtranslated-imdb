- The film begins with a meteor crashed into a lake. Unnoticed by the locals, is also a dinosaur egg on the bottom of the lake. Meteor heats the lake, turning it into a giant incubator. You guessed it, the egg hatches, free dinosaur coming to terrorize the community <br /> <br />. - What is the total garbage. This does not mean that I am against the dinosaur-lapse clay, it is the rest of the film that bothers me. Brutal act. Dialogue is totally inappropriate. Comic nothing but comic books. Logic does not exist. Any resemblance between "scientists" in this movie and the actual teaching is purely coincidental. I could go on forever on the bad aspects of the film, but you get the idea. I feel that it is safe enough to cause this disaster Â«MST3K Worthy."
