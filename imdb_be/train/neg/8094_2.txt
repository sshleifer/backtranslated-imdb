As someone also read the novel and seen the movie, I have a different view of why the film was a flop. Firstly, any comparison between the novel and the film are purely superficial. They are two different animals. <br /> <br /> In the novel, it is probably meant as a satire, but it comes as a cross between a tragedy and controversy instead. Any comedy elements such as those formed after a base of shining stylistic are merely uniformly random cynical thrust author. And to the ubiquitous white suit poster fool you into thinking that this is another Mark Twain, think again. More inclined to literary precedent would have been the ghost of Ambrose Bierce in top hat and frock coat. Tom Wolfe equal parts clown and hack more celebrities than the author, always looking for new grist for his mill introspection. <br /> <br /> It is therefore not surprising that the excellent production skills and the direction of handing on the making of the film was condemned from the start. In contrast to this satire, which translates very well in the movie, the controversy is grounded not everywhere available observations on some form of human behavior, but targeted attacks on specific individuals - whether real or imaginary straw men - who somehow earned the ire of the writer. Any effort to create a successful shot story or the story of such a beginning must have a clean start, free from interference or influence of the writer. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I too find fault with the casting. It's not just that Incompetents as Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith is not measured, but that real talent like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham, and Morgan Freeman or completely wasted or given roles that are just cartoons. <br /> <br /> There is enough relevant material here is really great satire of the film, but it can not even come close.
