Well well well. As well as John Carpenter Season 1 outing in the "Masters of Horror" was the exact opposite. He certainly proved that he was still master of horror with «Cigarette Burns», but «Pro-Life», probably the worst I have seen from him. <br /> <br /> This is stupid, completely devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and he overstays welcome it, although less than an hour-time work. nonsense script characters irritating and non-attractive and conclude beyond the absurd <br /> <br /> And for those suckers who actually bought the DVD (one of them myself). You saw how Carpenter describes the film? He really proud of it, and he says this is his best work for a long time, and he praises the script. And the commentary track, where he notices an obvious twist that made it into the final version, he simply said that he did not consider it necessary to correct the error, and he just let it be there. I am afraid that the old master completely lost touch. I sincerely hope that I have refuted. <br /> <br /> I want to leave on a positive note and note that there is an effect is strange, though. Technically speaking, this film is a highly effective lighting scheme and make up effects.
