Well, I watched this movie twice, I researched it heavily on the network, I asked a few people on there mind. I even went to the length of the original reading Sheridan Lafanu Classic «Carmilla», the book, this film is supposed to be based. I feel that the best way to view this film, to describe the game to play while watching it. As the plot of the movie does not seem to make any sense at all, there is a plot of the book. <br /> <br /> Laura lives in a castle in Syberia with his father, Mr. de la Fontaine. They carry on their lives happily and peacefully. Once they get a letter from the «General» a man who made his mission in life is to avenge the death of his daughter. He makes statements about the supernatural forces that occur at work, and explains that he will soon visit them. Meanwhile, a chance encounter with a strange woman leads to Lafontaines looking after her daughter, Carmilla, in a few months. Soon Laure begins to be overwhelmed by strange dreams and begins to go down with a strange illness. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And just what has it to do with Lori condition and in general? <br /> <br /> I came up with this game, and I would like as many people as possible to play, and let me know that their results. I even have a catchy name, and I will have a bell, but I can not be concerned about it. This is called "the film does not make sense" of the game. <br /> <br /> All you have to do is, while watching the film, try to come up with a complete story that explains what is happening. I mean complete, all questions, everything makes sense, absolutely full. <br /> <br /> He will have to answer questions such as ... <br /> <br /> * Why vampires to walk in the light of day? <br /> <br /> * Why do they all lesbians? <br /> <br /> * Why she called Bob? and why does it shoot? <br /> <br /> * If the movie is a dream, and if it's real? <br /> <br /> * Why is killing zombies, it seems an accepted part of life, not doing anyone broken eyelid? <br /> <br /> * Why Travis Fontaine place and run down zombies without delay during his driving, but when faced with a woman, with apparent hostage in the back of her car, taken on the basis that she is a zombie too? <br /> <br /> * And why he had let the girl he later openly says that he knows that it is a vampire's head, to go with him in his car? <br /> <br /> And then let her drive off, alone with his daughter in a stolen car? <br /> <br /> What the hell is all refuge scene? <br /> <br /> * What features green sticky all? <br /> <br /> * Why did the vampire's head suddenly starts to dress up as a nurse? <br /> <br /> * Why is there never any fights vampire Zombies? <br /> <br /> What is the value of the necklace? what is it made of? why he kills vampires? and Jenny knows that? <br /> <br /> In fact, sod it, it's so much fun trying to figure out how a lot of questions about the movie, too. <br /> <br /> I have a story, and I must admit that it is not quite there, but it's a very good job. <br /> <br /> After <br /> <br /> «Vampires vs. Zombies" is not a moment in it where it actually vampires fight the zombies. Everything in the film seems to know exactly what's happening, but they seem to be very reluctant to allow the audience to it. And somehow it is based on the classic 19th-century horror novel. How? Why? What the hell is going on?
