Regardless of its name (author and director) should be closed in the hopes of garbage like this is never made again. This is one in a battle with some of the worst films of all time. Sometimes bad movies so that they are actually kind of nice. Not this one. It was so bad, I was angry. Seriously. The drunk 10-year-old could come up with the best scenario. What a waste. All the actors were totally uninspired to work at all, CGI almost acceptable, a sequence of scenes are fully backward and hurt a little history there was, it's like he just decided, "I want this to happen, and it's going to happen, but I do not care how we got there, just shoot it and put it in. Whatever ", I go back to my trailer to pick up my nose, when someone calls me, I'm not here. Shame on you all, that your name. You should be ashamed.
