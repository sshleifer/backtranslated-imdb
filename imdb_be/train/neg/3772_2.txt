I just saw Dick Tracy, and I thought it was terrible. Paintings on urban background looked awful. In addition, the crowd characters looked too strange. Warren Beatty did a terrible job, Dick Tracy, but it's definitely not one of his best performances. Madonna should just stick to singing. Glenne Headly did a good job in this film. I gave this film 2/10 only because of the strange actions of Al Pacino. It was not a high note in his career, but he still did a good job.
