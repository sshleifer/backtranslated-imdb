The basic formula for the original series was; take someone to get the audience to love them, and then put them in mortal danger. This formula has worked for 32 episodes made between 1964-68. <br /> <br /> Now we jump forward 40 years to 2004 .. We meet with Alan Tracy, slightly smaller than a bona fide college students, with his friend, farm, young nerdy, they whisked Lady Penelope in her pink Ford Thunderbird on the island paradise where Tracy family live for the school holidays. Almost immediately, they are left in the care of Kyrano and his daughter Tin-Tin while the adults go to rescue John from Thunderbird 5 that has been damaged as a result of the step of the accident. This is all part of the hood circuit to take on Tracy Island, so that he can steal the Thunderbird car ... <br /> <br /> ?? To rob a bank! <br /> <br /> Yes. The plot, as lame as that! <br /> <br /> banal dialogue, acting more wooden than (fiberglass) dolls, effects, nothing special but the price and Hans Zimmer ??? What little was glorious theme Barry Gray shone dim orchestration Zimmer. The rest of the score was highly forgettable. In fact, part of the score was shown on the radio next week, and did not recognize him! I did not even remain a witness mediocre effort burst with the end titles <br /> <br /> To be fair, Ron Cook worked very well as Parker, he and Sophia Myles as Penelope seemed wasted. With the right material, they could show stopper. CGI work was what I would call the front edge - 5 years ago <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the main ship was simply wrong. Models of the original series, at least moved, as if they were mass <br /> <br /> Another sore point is that all the products, it seemed one long set of product placement, on each vehicle built by Ford everything Tracy Freezer content produced Ben & Jerry's. <br /> <br /> My son (9) liked the film, but it's a hybrid and Spy Kids, "" stops the clock, aiming right in his age group, adds nothing to the Thunderbirds to legend, when Star Trek came to the big screen in 1979 year with «The Motion Picture», a whole new life breathed into the franchise, which is then continued for another 20 years or so. With this film, Frakes has produced an excellent opportunity to do the same with the Thunderbirds franchise. <br /> <br /> I predict that this film, like "The Avengers" and "Saint" in front of it, sink into obscurity within 6 months of leaving the original series to its "classic" status.
