A handful of critics have awarded the film with positive comments. I do not want to argue with their opinion, but I strongly disagree. When I first watched this movie, I was a little surprised. But after comparing it to other films, especially with the late master, Bruce Lee I quickly changed my mind. In fact, if it were not for the name of the movie, I would never have bought it. Game of Death 2 is not true to the original game of death (except shares one character Billy Lo.) <br /> <br /> I was stunned to see how the game is similar to the death of 2, compared with Enter the Dragon. The plots have a striking similarity: Both Bruce Lee and Bobby Lowe are on a mission to avenge his relative. Two places are like, where they are both very isolated and surrounded by thousands of Blackbelts. There is an element of prostitution in both films (two women sent to the rooms in both films.) And Khan (Enter the Dragon) and improvised Lewis has a hand missing. Their underground drug operation in Enter the Dragon, believe it or not, there is one death in the game 2. Han pet cat Enter the Dragon, the director used his imagination and gave Lewis a monkey! The list goes on. <br /> <br /> As for the other aspects of the film, such as scripts and actions, I felt that it was very bad. It seemed to me that the director is looking for a group of martial artists will be removed in the film, and prayed they could act. <br /> <br /> On the positive scale, I can not deny that the choreography is impressive. Although martial sequences have strong acrobatic elements in them, they are nevertheless not able to run. However, as the plot is not enough, I could not relate to the characters, so the fight sequences were more exhibitions and not having a sense of the film. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would like to say that this film is recommended for all fans of martial arts, but also for those who love hard action movie with a good story and strong characters, I seriously would not recommend this film My opinion in relation to this film may seem very bias and one-sided, but when Bruce Lee set a new standard in the martial arts movie, especially after his masterpiece: Enter the dragon, the film could not get up to these standards. If all that they imitate really brilliant martial arts film, in the hope of achieving the same level of fame. <br /> <br /> In connection with my assessment, awarding the film a very severe 1 from 10, the film is watchable barley, and should be grateful that she had had done battle sequences.
