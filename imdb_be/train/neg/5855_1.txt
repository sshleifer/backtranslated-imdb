The film is released in early 2000. Both disasters Alongwith MELA So sad turn of the millennium with such nonsense <br /> <br /> The film seems to suit the 70s, but it looks like unintentional comedy 2000 <br /> <br /> Anywayz some classic gems from the movie: Paresh Rawa I do not understand its role to laugh or cry reason: he is searching for his mother in the village worst of all, when he realizes that the secret to Anil it keeps secret in the stomach which becomes large and causes him look pregnant, I remember as a child my teacher told me the same as t Urrf !!!! as a child I laughed at her that time, but here? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a joke can not explain, we have a dual role in Anil (one senior and junior) and Rekha playing the old wife and Ravina in youngers We also reject Harish and Shakti plays the son Arun Iran who fight and who has the worst wig <br /> <br /> music Direction outdated bad <br /> <br /> Anil tries his best to look too old in the junior role and too young to old role even good effort Rekha adequate, well-Ravina Harish bad Shakti Kapoor awful Arun Iran as usual Rajnikant normally in a cameo
