I'm definitely in the opinion of the minority on this one. «The Hurt Locker» won more "best picture" award from the critique groups than any other film this year. However, I just do not like it, I found it difficult to sit through. <br /> <br /> There is a minimal plot and not enough character development. They disarm the bomb, combat, and eliminate more bombs. That is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing was that the camera never stops moving and constantly shaking. It was a recent craze in the film industry, and it must make it seem more real, because it has a cheap, documentary look at him. The camera was shaking so much that made me sick to look at the screen. <br /> <br /> I usually do not care about war movies and «The Hurt Locker" was no exception. But you should not take my word for it, because the critics love it.
