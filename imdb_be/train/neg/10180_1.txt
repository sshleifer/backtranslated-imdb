This movie is a disgrace league franchise. I live in Minnesota, and even I can not believe they dropped Cleveland. (Yes, I know, while these Indians were pretty good, and the twins took their place at the bottom of the American League, but still be consistent.) Anyway, I loved the first major league, like the second, and always hope in the third, when the Indians finally go all the way to the series. You can not tell me that this was not the plan after the second film was completed. What happened? In any case, if your a real supporter of the original Major League deign i do not look this garbage.
