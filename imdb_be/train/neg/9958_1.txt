If very lightweight, regressive, one indulgent, anti-establishment, anti-civilization youthful appeal to you, then this is a perfect movie. Too bad the script, often inaudible dialogue and annoyingly tedious manual camera throughout, is a film that presents a world in appealingly simplistic, Manichean terms: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests and doctors) is insensitive and clumsy at best and carnivorous monsters in the worst case. The only way out of the horrors of civilization as a whole lot of screaming primitive (yawn) and infantile regression (literally) in a primitive cave, as the space in the forest, with the utopian taking the form of a rave party - again, in the forest (of course ...) . It reflects all the weaknesses of the first film, and much more.
