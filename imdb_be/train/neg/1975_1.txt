To be completely honest, I have not seen that many western movies, but I've seen enough to know that a good friend is.This much worse Western on the planet today.First yonder black people in the Wild West? Come on! Who ever thought it might be cool wall film that everyone will love was little, no, no, absolutely retarded! Secondly, in this day and age women, especially black women were not inclined to carry and use or guns.Thirdly, What Asian chick speak perfect English? If the installation of Western Asia is not where your going. Finally, the evil gay chicken was too much of the movie was just crap out beginning.Now not get me wrong, I am not a racist or a white so do not tick after reading this, but this film, this film is the worst representation of black people I have ever seen!
