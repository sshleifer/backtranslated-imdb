Ted V. Mikels film Corpse Grinder 2 is 103 minutes of cinematic painful swipes. The plot is pretty much meaningless mixture of business relationships among the people who milled troupe in cat food, cat and aliens who are losing a war with aliens dog, looking to get a piece of the cat food. Watching this film, I started looking for a distraction, anything to reassure myself that I'm doing something else besides going crazy from the inside out. <br /> <br /> Several scenes last too long, and the characters take forever to do simple things. I heard that Mr. Mikels not like to use jump cuts too often, for fear that they will confuse your audience. I'm not sure if this is the attitude, "avant-garde" or just "silly." Try as I might, I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters are too huge cast, and with the possible exception of the old, who are the custodians of the plant. Most actors bunch nya-talent amateurs who do not even bother to learn the lyrics of «Amazing Grace», before they have to sing it on the camera. While there may be fault should go to the poor sound quality, since I really only heard about 80% of the dialogue while watching a DVD. <br /> <br /> This is quite possibly the worst film ever to be shot. I listened to excerpts comment, and Mr. Mikels comes off as a sweet old enough, what the hell, he does that makes this kind of garbage? I would like to hear an explanation from the old, who have been lying shirtless on a metal conveyor belt, which offers ground. Movies I've been hated suddenly seems much better. I long for intermittedly appropriate music Excalibur and consistent coverage of Dawn of the Dead. I need to go and do something, anything. Nha see this movie.
