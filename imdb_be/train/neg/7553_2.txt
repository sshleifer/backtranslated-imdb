A phenomenal achievement in terrible. It's actually funny terrible. <br /> <br /> In the pervyhi ... Nicolas Cage must now reached the finals in the category of excessive Emoting in his acting class. Wearing new caps for hair and persons who were shot so many times, it seems, he pinned back his ears to be straining to touch the back, it exudes not only the patient smarmiess but creates a "hero" character, that you have no selfish interest . <br /> <br /> I do not know what it is with LaBute and female characters. He makes the woman to be totally deviant and evil ... and pay them back with Cage hitting a few of them right in the face and call them all "b **** es" a few times, too. I enjoyed the early LaBute films and several of his plays ... but it's a strange hobby he has. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie 2 out of 10 based solely on the performance of Ellen Burstyn in. By the time she finally makes its appearance (bold soldier through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on the forehead), it seems like all hope will be lost. She deserves the Oscar right here and now says her line with a straight face, and if she is wearing a white Mumu and blue, white and gold face paint develops on The Wicker Man, you know that working with Scorsese and Friedkin did it aims for. this role is dang good <br /> <br /> This film is so wandering i cuckoo, which must be seen to be believed <br /> <br /> Features include :. Nicolas Cage escapes from a swarm of bees, and then falls down a hill. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage stealing a bicycle and looking like Ms. hollow with the Wizard of Oz to travel around it. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage running around the island legs down doors in search of the missing girl. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski with a cheap once-promising acting career in the "fight" with Cage. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn dance around said while Mumu. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage shouting "Who burned? Who burned? Who burned? Who burned? Who burned? Who burned? "For no reason. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage in a bear suit (I'm not kidding), which runs through the forest, removing a suit (but leaving his feet to bear), and then do some steps in karate at some villains. <br /> <br /> and you have not lived until you have seen the last 15 minutes of the film and its terrible epilogue, which looked like it was shot yesterday in the basement of your cousin. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if you can make it through this movie, do not laugh, you deserve a medal. There was actually a point in the movie where I stopped giggling wonder, maybe it was not a difficult promise to "hysteria" movies ... just remind them when the cell would scream / shout / whisper their dialogue, that he really actually I had to take very seriously. <br /> <br /> I think it's destined to become a cult again ... just because it's so awful.
