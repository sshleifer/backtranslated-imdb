I'm a big fan of Steven Seagal. Hell, I probably weigh as much as he does, although I have no street cred to sport a curly-mullet-tail. Outlining his own bias and love for the beloved full-bodied American stage and screen hero, he is with a heavy heart that I have to say that this is his worst film ever. I'm not sure that he could make a movie worse than that. <br /> <br /> In its defense, the main problems associated with this film seems to occur in post-production. It is painfully obvious that this film was supposed to have a different storyline. This results in a gloomy voice, in which Steve's voice is almost synchronized with the fate of duplicate votes. Pisspoor editing and generally it starts bad, gets worse, and eventually you'll wish you rewatched Da Vinci Code instead. Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> After that, I do not know what to expect from Steve. My friends still laugh at me, listening to his CDs. This time I started to check out some of Van Damme straight to DVD walnut logs? If you tend to watch this movie, rip your eyeballs and wash them down the toilet. The service life of the dark is better than 89 minutes of this.
