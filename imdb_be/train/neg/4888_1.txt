Nick Millard aka Nick Phillips had to leave well enough alone when he made a "mad criminals" for 10 years before this god-awful waste of time and effort. The fact that the original "rabid criminals" less than an hour in length must be well aware of it that it is likely to be milked that storyline for all he was going to get out of it ... but instead, he prefers to use a ton of footage from the original in this one, as well, until the disposal of the original opening credit sequence! Unfortunately, with the result that once again rapidly aging Priscilla Alden did not save it. With a little bit of the original video was in this film it looks as if it has been removed from the rented camera manual! If this film is worth more than $ 100, so I would be very surprised, and I would be equally surprised when he did anything close to that amount! Avoid this one and watch the original as well!
