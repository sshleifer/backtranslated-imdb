I read EVEN Cowgirls Tom Robbins bored teenager. I loved every word. It was sexy, funny, and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. But when I saw the film, I could not believe that stupid, sour, joyless was a piece of junk. How did this happen? I think that someone in Hollywood to read this book and gave it a «Gay Pride - Women -. Lesbians" (. This Congress subject headings Library) Now any wishing to over 12 years old who reads the book will know that has nothing to in common with real lesbians, more than the STAR WARS about real space travel. Book, obviously - and I mean the obvious --written from heterosexual man who likes IDEA lesbians (in the nude, all the time), but never actually met one <br /> <br /> However, ,. someone in Hollywood said, "oh, oh, it is better to give it a gay or gay director will be in trouble." So they handed him over to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against the man, but - nevertheless it can Homosexuals sure - he does not have a clue about how to make a funny movie. Gus Van Sant took a playful fancy a direct human guilt free girl girl action / voyeurism and the man turned him into a dull, literal-minded Lesbian forces recruiting poster. It's like Oscar Wilde comedy turn into a tragedy of Arthur Miller. Not very. <br /> <br /> The main sign that Gus Van Sant did not have a clue what to do with the starting material is incredibly poor casting. His flap allowed him to hire the best. His ignorance of the real subtext of the novel (fantasy a straight man, not gay recruiting poster) forced him to make a choice, it was not only bad, but strange. <br /> <br /> Let's take a throw EVEN Cowgirls GET blues. <br /> <br /> Pat Morita as "well" Well, there's some name recognition Asian actors. And Pat Morita, in the happy days, it was pretty funny. But casting his wells were wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that Chinese is a very funny man. (Gus did not tell him.) Pat, too, seems to know that the Chinese have. ,, Well, SEXY !!! In the book, he is not an old wise Mr. Miyagi. It's more like Hugh Hefner! He randy old goat, and he knows a lot about pleasing marriage and responsive Sissi and Bonanza Jellybean. (You can see in the book, they are actually lesbians. You get that fantasy is a straight man has done?) <br /> <br /> John Hurt as the "Countess." It is good that he is gay friendly person. But he was serious, Shakespearean actor !!!! You need someone who is fun, and camp for the role. John Hurt to be cast as a dumb guy like Countess tragic and sad. I kept waiting for Paul Scofield to roam all dressed as Thomas More, and shook his head sadly. "Now, Dimitri, you know that you have lost your soul completely. For shame, my former student! "And so, John Hurt was funny (and quite hilarious) as Caligula. But it was the black humor, not playful and fresh humor, like books. <br /> <br /> RAIN PHOENIX as "Bonanza Jellybean.» no talent, no training, no problem. In addition, in the book Bonanza funny, playful, fun, (mostly) heterosexual, and love. In the film she sullen, passive, impassive and grim. As for her taste for women, Robbins in his book puts it so. "God knows that I love women, but nothing can take the place of the person that is right." Uh, Gus? Have you read this book? <br /> <br /> Uma Thurman, as "Sissi Hankshaw." It's a tough role. The book Sissy really unusually passive and timid character. However, more experienced actress might have made a gleam in her eyes, or dominate her gait, involves some hidden force or covert meet their adventures. Uma does not pull its probably because Gus never told her Sissy, presumably enjoying a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and huge fingers. Mind game is more like it in the TV movie about a girl dying of leukemia. <br /> <br /> This film is sour and dull. And I blame you, Gus Van Sant!
