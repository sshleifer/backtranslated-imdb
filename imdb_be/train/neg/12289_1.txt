I'm getting tired of movies that sound entertainment in one line synopsis then eventually no matter what you will find in the center of the bottom of the compost pile <br /> <br /> Who knows :. «Witchery" may sound interesting field for the studio, even with a "big name cast" (as Blair and Hasselhoff - wink-wink, nudge-Shift) and effervescent like Kneph (I do not know what kind of woman ...) <Br. /> <br /> But in the movie, it just falls apart faster than papier-mache sculpture in showers. it seems that these unfortunate people are trapped on an island mansion off the east coast, and one of them (a woman, I think) is the target of a satanic cult to bear hell child, and the rest in the cleaning of the grotesque, winding path. <br /> <br /> well, right you have n pyarochny section of land from "The Exorcist," "The Omen," "Ten Little Indians" and a few other smaller films in satanic worship-run- amuck line. None of them are very interesting and for the most part, you will crawl your way from scene to scene until it is over. <br /> <br /> no, not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff questions help. They're just there to pick up the salary and did not seem very intention of giving it to them " everything. " <br /> <br /> From the looks of it, Hasselhoff probably would, he returned to the beack with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda ... well, who knows; celebrity PETA benefit, or pro-am golf tour or something, and that it these days. <br /> <br /> A torture scene! Ecchhhh. You see that people get their mouths sewn, hung inside the roaring fireplaces, hung on the trees during a heavy storm, the ships escaped from the neck, etc., etc. Sheesh, I thought: "The sign of the devil" was the most sadistic film that I saw .... <br /> <br /> do not bother. It's not worth your time. I can not believe I told you as much as I did. When you look, just to see if you can count cliché. And yes, Blair gets possessed, as if you did not see that the left Main Street followed by the orchestra. <br /> <br /> a lot of stars. "Enchantment" - the witch will give you itchy.
