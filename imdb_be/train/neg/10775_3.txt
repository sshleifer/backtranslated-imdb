This movie is terrible! It rivals "Ishtar" in the amount of strikingly bad moments. I would rate it lower than 3, with the exception of a few funny lines; but, on the whole, this movie was crap! He watched as they did over the weekend in a bankrupt resort somewhere. Joe Roth is to join Elaine May, the leading side forever!
