Earlier today, I got into an argument as to why so many people complain about modern movies, where I encountered a curious statement: "the development of character in the new film just is not that good or interesting, as it was before." Depending on the film ( s) in question, it may be due to a number of things, sometimes generic special effects and story-driven Hollywood garbage like War of the worlds, but in the case of over-the-top, uninteresting attempts at social commentary, and a desperate struggle to put an "art" back into the movie, it's movies as Dog Days, are to blame. <br /> <br /> I do not usually have a very high tolerance for movies, no matter how boring or pointless, I find them (starting from a good, long, as Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to those I have hurt to sit la through Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West). I closed this film by 45 minutes, which is 30 minutes more than I actually should be. I was not interested in any of the characters whatsoever and found nothing substantial for the thin veil of pessimism focused. In an attempt to say something about the waste of society, this film is too easy to fall into being the most-indulgent, banal, and operational in a very sincere way. Of course, I've seen a lot of disturbing films on the same theme, but there are so many better movies out there about gnetuschihah, helpless people (Happiness, Gummo, kids, Salo, Narration, irreversible) that actually contain characters great emotional depth and personality. Dog Days was nothing more than a dislike of the eighth graders to society, choosing to ignore any true understanding of how people really are, and instead choose to be boring, terribly and hopelessly banal attempt to work "art." This nOT characteristic of the unknown or the reasonable observation in the dregs of society, it's just boring and nothing is worth caring about.
