I agree with most everyone that this show was bad production and written.The action was not much higher than the low production values, but I feel that an actor can only rely on the materials presented to them and make the best of it, in accordance with this, I feel that it is important to note that one actor stood up and held out far beyond this mannerism before the gaudy production, has become a respected and very talented performer.I mean Laura Harris born Canadian actor, etching its way through a lot of bad yrablyayutstsa shows and movies, to find a place on the HBO hit «Dead Like Me», where she plays the role of Daisy Adair, and to her credit, she handles this role in an effective manner.I remember typical boyhood crush on a young actress in this series where she played Ashley soft spoken yet clever 7-grader.I felt that if someone can "make it" in this series will certainly be Laura Harris and true to its nature, it operates in the current field, to win the respect of many manufacturers who now recognize her talent and unique Scandinavian Belyaev vai appeal. If you ever have to watch this series, I recommend that you have something epic to monitor the wards, such as "The Godfather", or perhaps "Beaches" to remind yourself that there are still more true integrity and value of production there, and this series of low-budget only reminder that Laura Harris may simply state their time on the show, and I bet she will cite many young actors of protection words, saying " it is the beginning! "
