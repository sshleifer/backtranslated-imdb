I, unfortunately, disappointed with this film because he felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the movie rather feeble attempt at horror. The main idea of ​​the movie was interesting, but unfortunately, it was not in a position to initiate, really scare or shock me - was a part in the whole film, which I thought was awful, but even that did not redeem. I really like the character of Kate got to the end of the film, when she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic before the end of the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not really necessary for this film, and I think that the director / writer carried away with a lot of symbols used to to anything, if he left his main characters, which makes it more a solo effort on the part of Kate, maybe he worked - Jeremy acting was wooden, to put it mildly, and I felt uncomfortable watching bad chemistry on screen - or lack thereof. Such a shame. Disappointing.
