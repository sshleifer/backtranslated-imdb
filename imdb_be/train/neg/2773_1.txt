Up to this point, Gentle Rain was a film that I have found the worst in history. It was displaced by "blockbuster" of Asia. It has a "star", and it is John Rhys-Davies. He is out of the mold to be removed, the magical flying villain will be thrown here. The rest of these people can not work their way out of junior high school games. Many clichés were not allowed in the dialogue, as well as special effects called as often as possible. <br /> <br /> It's pretty easy to see that someone in Asia was a few dollars and you want to create a vehicle for some of the actors they wanted to throw money at. Or maybe it was the director or the writer who needs a loan. I think that any career with this film in his credentials <br /> <br /> Do yourself a big favor and do not watch this movie. One hundred and gratitude can not eat this turkey. <br /> <br /> A funny scene was unintentional. He appears on the scene the king's brother. King? Beautiful, senior, short Asian actor. (Bad actor.) Brother? Six feet in Europe. (Also a bad actor.) No excuses were not made for this. They're just waiting to see what we did not notice that my brother this poor man was Jett Lee wannabe Pierce Brosnan in a cheap Dimestore «Indian" wig straight out of an old western movie from the forties.
