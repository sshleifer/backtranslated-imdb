I have been known to fall asleep during the movie, but this is usually due to a combination of factors, including, really tired, being warm and comfortable at the Sette and just ate a lot. However, on this occasion I had fallen asleep, because the film was rubbish. Development of the plot was constant. Constantly slow and tedious. Things seemed to happen, but without any explanation of what was the cause of them and why. I admit that I may have missed part of the film, but I watched most of it, and everything just seemed to have occurred by themselves, without any real care about anything else. I can not recommend this movie at all.
