Please let me forget. Please. Please. This is the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I believe that the film is an insult to my brain, and my ass, both of which have suffered from me sit and watch this movie. I still have to see what kind of damage it caused my vision and my ability to finish the sentence. What a load of rubbish !! And do not get me started about the acting ... Someone please help me to forget !! "Weird Science" - return !! All is forgiven ... <br /> <br /> I am "proud" to give this film the first one here IMDb ... I voted for hundreds of movies ... many of them with ** p, but it's so bad I can not even believe it. Someone actually came up with the idea and thought it was worthy to become a movie? Someone actually read the script and decided to release the film? Someone read the script and auditioned for him? Who has seen the film and decided * nya * put it on the shelf to gather dust for eternity? * * These questions I want answers. Nha philosophical question that tree in the forest, and well, you know ...
