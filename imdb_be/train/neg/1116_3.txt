This film seems to have been on a training exercise work for Coppola family. It does not seem to know whether to be «A» or «B» Western. I mean, the hero known as Hopalong Cassidy for God. William Boyd must be spinning in his grave. <br /> <br /> All the «B» Western clichés here. Dvuhpushechny pearly toothed hero in a white hat with a good horse ( "Let's Thunder»), an all-in-black bearded villain, the heroine is in trouble, the owner of the ranch is in trouble, cowardly sheriff, over the bad guys, etc. <br /> <br /> action, with rare exceptions, strictly from Yakima Kanatt school of acting. Chris Lybbert (who?), As a hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) As a villain to see how they would have been more at home in the 30 Poverty Row substandard. Adding to the throwing the veterans artists Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, K Gallager and Will Hutchins helps a bit, but they do not give enough to do to save it. <br /> <br /> What's the point Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine framing sequence? Are we to believe that Sheen character was a ghost? What was the purpose of black gloves? It just does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of westerns of all genres, I tried hard to find some redeeming quality in this film. The cinema was very good and the setting looked very authentic. Besides the hero and the villain, the other characters look real <br /> <br /> If manufacturers are going to resurrect the character Hopalong Cassidy, they may have given some thought to reflect it as it was written. - gray swears ranch hand with a chip on his shoulder, partial view of Lee Marvin would have succeeded. <br /> <br /> I can still say but..on Thunder, a big guy.
