I read a comment on the US Chris_m_grant <br /> <br /> He wrote: "Fantastic 1924. This documentary in the early twentieth century the geography of today's Iraq was the powerful." <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Chris and people who are interested in the Bakhtiari nomads of Iran, the Zagros Mountains and landscapes and watched the movie a Grass, fight for the nation's life. These traditions have you seen in the movie survived for centuries, and will continue throughout life. I'm from this region of Iran themselves. I Bakhtiari. <br /> <br /> Chris, I'm sorry to bother you, but the Bakhtiari region Zardkuh in Iran is not Iraq, as you mentioned in your comments. Iran and Iraq are two different and separate country. Taking Iran to Irankian almost like an American to Mexican. Thank you, <br /> <br /> Siwa
