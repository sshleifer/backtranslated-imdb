If you read my review of Syfy in "dinoshark," you know that I can appreciate the low-budget schlock that these made-for-TV movies can provide. They are stupid ... they are stupid ... but they are still pretty fun in the "so bad it's good" kind of way. So, still whipping with a sense of guilt for sympathy (and recommendation) on the indisputably false "dinoshark" I sat down to watch «Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy», SyFy Original Movie about a half-human, half-hammer monster terrorizing people on the island, C surefire recipe in the Syfy Channel to create a B-movie creatures and features a cast that includes William Forsythe and Tile as it could possibly go wrong? Well, to my surprise, he actually misses ... a little, but enough to make me recommend it. Why? Well, first of all, its titular monster, scary sickle-human hybrids, takes precedence over a bunch of artificial military thugs who really became the main villain of the film. Although Hammerhead makes dials the number of the body, he (or she, or whatever you call the thing) only comes just before someone is going to be chewed on and leaves immediately after. The rest of the film coating, pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers. It seems to me, is simply not convincing, like watching a walking Hammerhead eat people! <br /> <br /> Please Read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
