It starts on a good note only to stumble and quickly lowered expectations. <br /> <br /> Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Sam (John Abraham) characters are not correctly built to the boss Mac decides to attach it with three flight attendant rest drama about how Mac, Sam and Mambo (Paresh Rawa) has an uncle deal with situations that sometimes seem forced. <br /> <br /> About the cast, Paresh Rawa very talented actor, I thought, was wasted in roles capricious cooks. Akshay Kumar tolerant, John Abraham is very poorly kept stumbling over the furniture and Razhpal Yadav is the only salvation in the film. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film's funny sometimes, but all the cotton rags (sad songs) and the main let down if you are looking for a wholesome entertainment and comedy.
