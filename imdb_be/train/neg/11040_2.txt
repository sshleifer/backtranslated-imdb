You have to watch the show once saw them all, the formula is exactly the same in every episode. Jim does something his way he is, but he is worried about his wife, in the end, she learns that what he did was for her, she caressed his cheek and gave a gummy smile when he looks at the shy. In fact, the story lines are so lame and formulaic that I'll take a stab at one right now. <br /> <br /> The episode «Valentines Pay» <br /> <br /> Jims wife notices that all weekly pay JI disappeared, he explains to her that he had lost at the casino. She screams and leaves the house lamenting how terrible it is. Then, on Valentine's Day, when he finds himself in a limousine with tickets to a ball (thus explaining the lost wages). She understands, "Her" error and the usual "Oh, Jim, you're so beautiful. ..The end <br /> <br /> Another very obvious point is the fact that the character is based on Jims Homer Simpson, which, like a cartoon character can get away with being a warlike and ignorant, if it is an attempt to people he does not work, and Jim just comes as an arrogant jerk yourself in the center. <br /> <br /> IMO the only reason that this manage, simply because we have so much now in terms of human beings with a TV, these days you would with upholster show about a man who isolates the wall and you will get the audience. <br /> <br /> «Two and a Half Men" on the other hand, is a fantastic and fun.
