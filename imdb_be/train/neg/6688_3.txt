This film is pretty awful, but I have some interesting information about this: <br /> <br /> It was filmed in 1976 at the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona, as well as in the Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, State Arizona. Good most of the extras in the film drama with students while the NAU. I was a freshman that year there, minoring in theater, but for some reason I do not get involved with the production. I did however know a few people who have done, and we can put this rather strange fact: <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the film where two of its directors, as part of their hazing ritual should run naked in the woods. They saw because in the film, is doing just that. The fact is, these are not the actors, in all but two of the guys I knew from the theater department. The identity of these "stunt posteriori" will remain anonymous, at least on this site, if they do not solve the, ahem, "reveal" themselves!
