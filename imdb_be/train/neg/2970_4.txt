I returned Batman movie and TV fans. I loved the show (old and new), and I loved all the movies. But this film is not as great as some people hopeing it will be. In my opinon, this is a big let down. I think the problem was he did not have any drama. Batman: Mask of Phantasm and Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker was a lot of drama. Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero had some drama as well. In addition, I think that this film is to light for Batman. The only scene that seems a little dark is a big fight with Bane in the end. In any case, it's okay Batman movie. But I would just rent it.
