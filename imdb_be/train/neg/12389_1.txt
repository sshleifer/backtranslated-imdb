Model Chris McCormack (Margaux Hemingway) brutally raped teacher (Chris Sarandon), her sister Kathy (Mariel Hemingway). He appeared before the court, but is completely free. He then raped Kathy! <br /> <br /> unwanted and sick rape movie. This movie has been touted as an important drama deals with rape. That it is badly written, and (mostly) poorly acted drama. It purports to be sympathy for the victims of rape, but the scene shoved in our face. To be completely honest, however, Hemingway's acting is so bad in the sequence that it loses any real impact it could have. Trial scenes were boring and predictable. And the film simply gone too far, when 15-year-old raped by Marielle (fortunately, it was not shown). I admit, however, that it will lead to the big finale where Margaux grabs a gun and shoots Sarandon dead. But seriously - having raped a young girl just outrageous <br /> <br /> duties will not help .. For example, Margaux was not an actress. She was certainly a beautiful woman (and the actual model I believe), but its action leaves much to be desired. This reduces the film. Mariel was just okay, but it was one of her first films. Sarandon is doing what it can be like a rapist. It was not bad, but terrible scenario worked against him. <br /> <br /> I remember learning that at this screening in 1976, some women got up and cheered when Sarandon was killed, so maybe it works for some people. I found it sad, Simplified and really hurt. A 1 all the way.
