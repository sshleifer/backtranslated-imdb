The only good part about this film beautiful landscapes. This film was long and boring. The Minister shall have departed from the pulpit of the time when his son Paul has strayed from the teachings he declared. How many times his boys can take the Lord's name in vain in this film is from Presbyterian background? It does not fit. I wanted Paul was brought down the river without a boat in the beginning, to redeem us stupid, smirkish, selfish story of Paul (Brad Pitt). Since norms become a teacher, and Paul becomes a compulsive gambler who wants to save the norms, but it does not apply, so. This is a very uninteresting. We see that being prejudiced white rose Paul with his native American girl. It was the only part that had some interest, and perhaps could be developed into a real wild west. "What we see is only a sleepy town, where the sons of two ministers have nothing to do but chase 1. Normal lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2.Paul is dumb stories in a newspaper shop, scratching his head and take a lot of sips and involves a lot of flies. I would like to watch shows about fishing, that this film again, which will never happen.
