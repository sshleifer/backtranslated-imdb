Before you comment on this movie I just watched on YouTube, I have to admit that the reason I checked this out was rewatch something I first saw on television advertising in 1980: the splitting of Barbara Bach. And since the film was rated R, I expected to see her naked. Unfortunately, not a bone for her or the other outstanding actress who appeared here: Stacey Nelkin, to be a teenager, but actually it was 20, when she did not. Seeing it in bra and shorts, and then to dress the belly dancer was as exciting as Ms. Bach. They provide some of the scattered laughs this film gives. In fact, I do not blame Ron Liebman, because his name from the credits because of its role as a hard-fisted Liceman quite embarrassed that I did, as a "seduction" scene he did with Ms. Nelkin. This also happens debut Ralph Macchio who loner among the losers, sent to the Academy school. The rest of the black child who truly loves his stepmother and Ms. Bach, an Arab who worships the engine oil, and the son of a politician who loves his girlfriend kendo (character Nelkin c) so much, he risks to sneak into the middle of the night to see her girls academy. Among the supporting cast, Tom Poston swishy plays a character called Sisson, which I found kind of funny. With Writers Tom Patchett and Jay Tarzes and the direction of Robert Downey Sr. (whose son Robert Downey Jr. has a cameo at an early stage in the football scene), Up the Academy is uneven with politically incorrect humor, but if you are really offended by the scatological and sexual content is actually quite harmless comedy Mad Magazine and its cover brand boy Alfred Newman-shouldn't be ashamed of, even if they once had his name and nature took a picture .. .ps Another one of the "losers" was Harry Teynauits kind all in my home city of Chicago, Illinois. He played Relatives Ververgaert. He also says that one of my favorite lines: "I try to come."
