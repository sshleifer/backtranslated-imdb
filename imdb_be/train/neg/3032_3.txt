Someone told me that it was one of the best adult films to date. Since then I have discredited all told me this man after watching this movie. It's just awful. Without going into lengthy descriptions of various scenes, take my word, the sex scenes are uninteresting at best. Jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning was the highlight of the film (she looks good), but it's getting worse.
