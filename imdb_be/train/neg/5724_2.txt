I agree with the last reviewer that this film was a terrible act. Yes, there were a lot of gore and some nudity. But it was marred by clumsy, pointless story and dumb ending. Where it had to be removed in any case: Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? The hostel was much better than the movie, and I would recommend to see that instead. Technical irritation I had with the DVD, if you turn off the Spanish subtitles, they come back after a few scenes, and then you have to go back to the main menu and then turn them on again. Also, do not waste your time on a distant stage, because no one, and it looks like a tourist video.
