This is an amazing comedy of sex, because it`s very little comedy, but a whole lot of sex, most of which takes place in the rear of the car and so it makes the graphics look like BASIC INSTINCT edition Teletubbies.

This is quite a grim hyper-realist British film, made at a time when channel 4 was the main investor in British films, which explain its made for low budget television feel
