Firstly, it takes a full half an hour to get out of jail Hackman and start doing their job. What a waste of time, we all know, Hackman out to do some work for their masters, why spend almost a third of the film in these sequences. Then Hekmny stays at the hotel and again the story arc is going nowhere, just proves to us that Hackman is under close surveillance, and everything he says or does, knows the master. Again, another 20 minutes. Then there was the lost time showing the reunion with his wife. All this should be taken 10-15 minutes maximum just as the settings for real action, intrigue and plot twists. By the time when the real action gets going, I was so sad that I just wanted the film to end. Hackman big as usual, and the other participants as well, but it's hopeless first magnitude.
