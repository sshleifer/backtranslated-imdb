DCOM worse I have seen. Ever. Well, maybe not as bad as the smart home. It was just bad. Action and the story was good, but the effect is sucked! <br /> <br /> They were so fake! The only good fight scene between brother and Shen. It was, perhaps, the only scene in which I was excited. <br /> <br /> In general, I found this film very boring and the film seems suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> I will give him four for Brenda Song, who is a very funny actress and one fight scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
