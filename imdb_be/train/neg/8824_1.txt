What can possibly be said about this film, but "beware of the viewer." Christmas Evil should come with a warning label, as cigarettes do, because it's bad for my eyes and ears. I seldom is unsatisfied with the "b" Flick horror, but this film could not even bring a bit scared to five years. Point permanent madman who has a thirst for blood in the film is that he / she needs to seem almost godlike, nothing can stop them maniacal rage, but in this movie resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim, and, of course, to follow along with all of the popular legend of Santa Claus, is a reminder of the viewer that this man is in no way dangerous, because he was too stupid to be dangerous. Total film in general waste.
