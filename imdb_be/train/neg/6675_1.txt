This weekend just passed, I watched "28 Weeks Later", which was very good. After that I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that this is one of the saddest of so-called horror you could ever watch. Scenes were unrealistic, there was no script and no plot. Alien creature was unreal. And the fight scenes are soft compared with a school yard fight. And to make it worse, named Cody guy was loose uncontrollable foul language, which diverts attention from the main movie <br /> <br /> Forget about the movie. and go and watch 28 Weeks Later. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Mesake C.
