It is not only considered my verdict on this film, but also a large part of what has been written about it. Do not get me wrong here, too, I'm not a complete man in the street, I do not hate this movie, because it was not enough as the "Police Academy 9" or something, I like it more than my fair share of high-brow or artistic material, I swear . <br /> <br /> «Magnolia» poor, and I sincerely puzzled why is it seemingly so well known. Long winded, forgiving himself, awkward nonsense from beginning to end, there is only so little that can be true that people love about the movie. There's a high caliber cast is fair enough, and no one receives an average or worse performance. In addition, my wife (he confessed hater of Tom Cruise) tells me that his career best performance to date. But the plot is so unengaging, wandering between the stories of several characters loosely coupled in such a snail's pace, that even when a significant life changing events are drawn they seem meaningless and uninteresting, you find yourself shouting for someone to get blown up or something. <br /> <br /> This does not help that none of the characters are not very easy to identify and empathize with (well, I do not think so, but I do not like most people, admittedly). They all play pretty unentertaining his life story to the big length, showing their defects of character and emotion in the ever so complex parts and playing their deep and meaningful relationship to the nth degree with a lot of chatter by monologue. Yadda yadd yadd. Soundtrack for dire and, with this brain-suckingly irritating quality that I still considered unique in music Alanis Morissette. <br /> <br /> In general, it was about as enjoyable three hours later as was repeatedly forced to watch an episode of "Friends" while the future periodically poked in the ribs disgruntled goat. Bit well with frogs, though.
