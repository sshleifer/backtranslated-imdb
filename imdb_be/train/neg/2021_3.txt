Ronald Colman won the Best Actor Oscar for his stunt as a popular stage theater, which completely loses himself in his role, in particular, as Othello by Shakespeare. Critically-praised Cukor film has a fine pedigree, having been written by a respectable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, witty banter comes off as self-conscious here, and the scenes of business ripe. Miklos Rozsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has some great moments tough waitress (if Coleman Theater breath talking to her, she asks him, "What I have some nuts?"). Otherwise, this scenario is very obvious, strange draggy, and not very funny. * 1/2 ****
