This is a terrible film, a terrible script, poor direction and senseless end. Furthermore, bad characteristics, with the exception of Clancy Brown, who is criminally underutilized and Michael Pollard. Watching this film was purgatory - you do it to relieve a bad movie karma enough to actually see a good further down the line <br /> <br /> The film is a father and son, who look like they can not everyone. It may have been related. The male lead is not very well written and seems uncharismatic in this role. You can see the plot points per mile. Actions female lead and her brother, a policeman, also do not have any sense. Thus, the main action on its part in the end of the film does not make sense script wisely.
