I went into this movie with expectations of deception, it would be insightful and uplifting. It is known that some cheaper advertising group «Wilco». <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a lot of moping and whining about the "process" shameful and without doubt one-sided picture of the band members Exiled diva lead singer / songwriter, gut wrenching recognition from one of the fallen member - for 18 years as - saying that "friendship is outdated," and this whiny, uncompelling story about how a label "hurt their feelings", dropping them, just so that the team could immediately get 50 offers from other labels (on voltage ... not!) They tried their best to make it look like this tension, but I suspect that it was all smoke and mirrors to create a tragedy that does not exist. This does not even take into account the long stretches where we get a lot of their new songs shoved at us in full without any storyline, understanding, or even a decent job in the film. Strenuous attempts emotional sincerity or reasonable point of view on life made me sick to watch. <br /> <br /> From the film, this band sounds like a bunch of ugly, little children, to dig, to find a voice, they do not have and think that they are the guardians of a kind of music, they definitely are not. And I thought the music sucked, and I could not even understand the lyrics because mumbling style of the soloist. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2/10.
