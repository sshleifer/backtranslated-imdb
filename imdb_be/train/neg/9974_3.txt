I must admit that I caught this one a few times on the USA Network. There's just something, well, the stupidity of this flick, which makes me want to see him when he goes. Yes, you're right about the poor action, the plot, which is only seven years old can enjoy, etc. But I can not help feeling sympathetic to some of the actors. Again, some of these actors have signed up for an even more brutal sequel.
