In fact, he had never been. I do not know why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s screwball comedy. Which celebrates the slaughter! None of these people do not come near to Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, etc., and in any case, today's audience is not so receptive to this easy manure. Record trivial. Hackneyed plot is razor thin and clear. The chemistry between the leading characters do not exist. I wonder what Julia Roberts seems to think that she is the reincarnation of a great star of the "Golden Age of Hollywood", whenever it may be. This is the effect of it is trying to, and can not reach again with Richard Gere in Runaway Bride.
