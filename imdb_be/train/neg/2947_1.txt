There was very little, I was not able to sit through movies. I made it through the battle field of the earth without any problems. But it is the only one of the worst films ever made. I understand Whoopi Goldberg tried to move him. I do not blame her. I would be ashamed to have this in the summary. I believe that this is a rare occasion when almost every gag in the film falls flat on his face. Well, what's going on here. Not to mention the SFX, look for Dean with suspension cable management with its rear end !!!!!! In the middle of the film, I was still looking for the plot. I never found it. Save yourself the rental of this problem and to save 90 minutes of your life.
