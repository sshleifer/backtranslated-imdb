Herculis Poirot, in general, well-organized "hero" we know from books and films. This film or the story does not work, and I felt he did not mistake Agatha. The cast is not good, the actors of exaggerating and making silly gestures, costumes are so clean and tidy, everything (even the Arab clothes) look fake and for good spectator who thinks two times the film can be regarded as a comedy instead of mystical drama . The actor plays a Hercules Poirot does a good job, but nothing fancy. Scene, as mentioned earlier, a perfect and fake looking. History is not very cheered, though the murder mystery, but who cares about death and evil psycho 45+ blonde woman in the Iraqi desert? "Victim" is not pretty.
