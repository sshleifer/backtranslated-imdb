This movie is a blatant attempt to the left in Hollywood, to reflect the Reagan administration incompetent and bungling. Some errors can be made during the crisis, but I am sure that is not the extent depicted in the chrome film. My first reaction was that this film was to be directed by Oliver Stone, but I was wrong this time. There are apparently many others.
