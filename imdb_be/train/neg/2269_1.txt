Allows you to make a film about a talk show, which already exists and is, in principle, there is everything that happens on the show! Well, if this idea does not intrigue you, that she should not stay away from the arena. I had the displeasure of seeing it in the theater, and actually be able to sit through this mess of a movie. I believe that the canister Springer does not play itself, as it shows of cheap props for his show (yes, it looks even cheaper than the real Jerry Springer Show), and he is known only as the canister in the film. The plot (if you can call it that) of her daughter, living with his mother decides to sleep with his mother live in another. So brilliant mother's idea to call the canister Springer show, and get it to the boyfriend of his daughter. (Is it a coincidence, they live in a trailer park). At the same time, somewhere in America, a woman finds her CHEATIN 'man with his friend in bed. So, of course, call the therapist of America Jerry Springer! I would talk about the rest of the film, but even to think about the film now gives me a headache. Jaime Pressly, who plays the daughter looks very unattractive in the film. And remember Michael Dudikoff to kick ass karate master from the American Ninja series? Well, look at him now like a white trash drunk. The fact that it looks really too badly out of shape and to call it "in contact with his charecter». But if your idea of ​​fun to see Jerry Springer sing country songs of his own show or guys throwing a transvestite ... well ... just watch the show together! ... at least, Steve was smart enough to stay away from this movie.
