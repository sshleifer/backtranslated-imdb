The question is, when one sees a movie is bad, it is not necessary, "As the film is bad to get done?" Or even, "Why do I see it badly in the first place?" But, "What have I learned from this experience?" That's what I found: <br /> <br /> - simply because the "rules" of horror films have been cataloged and satire countless times over the past ten years, does not mean that someone will not go ahead and make a film that uses all of them, without any humor or irony <br /> <br /> -. If the film is to be described as ** ** loosely based on the video game, you have a problem scenario <br />. <br /> -. black mark can not always die first, but the Asian character does always knows kung fu <br /> <br /> - while you can be proud of what you have learned how to make a "matrix effect" on the budget, it does not necessarily mean that you have to use it again and again, ad nausea <br /> <br /> - .. as a brother Ron Howard does not guarantee the choice of roles <br /> <br /> - whenever scene Do not edit together, just use some footage from a video game, no one will notice <br /> <br /> -. If rap metal band your cousin offers to write the subject of your film for free, politely decline <br /> <br /> -. Zombie movies are not fighting people kill zombies. They zombie killing people, mostly in the worst way. This is what makes them terrible <br /> <br /> -. White people who can pay $ 1,600 to get to rave deserve to die <br /> <br /> -. If you find an old book, it will tell you everything you need to know. Anything else will appear on their own two lines after someone asks: "What was that?" Or "Where are we?» <br /> <br /> - Bare breasts are not a panacea for a horror movie <br /> <br /> -. Helicopter booming shot and license agreement with Sega magically transforms your movie with a "student film" with "primary studio release" Try <br /> <br /> -. Just because you can name drop all three "Living Dead" films, nothing makes you George Romero .. Or even the US Paul Anderson <br /> <br /> I've seen worse movies, but only because I have seen «Mortal Kombat:. Annihilation»
