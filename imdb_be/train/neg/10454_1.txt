when discussing a movie called "Snakes on a Plane", it should be noted that early snakes pretty darn important to the plot. <br /> <br /> What we have here is very bad CGi snakes, nor appearance, nor the movement as a real snake. snake scared because they seem to have slimy, they crawl, they glide. These snakes do not do anything like that. they glide along as they would in a video game. They cartoon snake. I would go so far as to say that even someone had a big phobia against real snakes would not find these the terrible <br /> <br /> why on earth you would like to include extreme close-ups of these CGI failures? why not hope for the unknown .. all the "less is more" ethical. or better yet, why not just make them look good in the first place? and then, perhaps, still use them sparingly <br /> <br /> take a look at the Carpenter "things". here we have a real slime, blood and horrific dimensions. 20 years go by, and we get that pile of stinking "snakes on a plane» SFX shit. if these people wake up and smell the coffee? special effects go back! <br /> <br /> you could say .. but the film is a joke, get it? Sure, I'm with this idea, but to do it well! in addition to the above, the film has dialogue shit. and music and sound effects are not terrible or memorable in any way. <br /> <br /> I could handle any other actors being part of this film, except Jackson. What was he doing there? the man who starred in Pulp Fiction 10 years ago. is career development? Do you offer people value for money? no. I would like to know, I thought that Tarantino when he was halfway through this bitch movie <br /> <br /> the current generation seems to have very low expectations. Hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want. on the way out of the theater I saw a number of advertising for some really horrific promising future releases, including ... DOA: Dead or alive (other) CGI animal movie called "washed out", and the other looks crap comedy called "click." in addition to this I have seen some terrible trailers, including (other) buckwheat British horror / comedy. I really did not see the film in a mess like this in a long time <br /> <br /> we expect to see this movie for sale in addition to section 1 DVD £ 6 months. and if you are expecting to see a black comedy with a ton of great looking snakes, and some bad-ass cool dialogue emanating from Samuel L Jacksons lips. forget it.
