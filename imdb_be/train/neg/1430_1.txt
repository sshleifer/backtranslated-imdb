While flipping channels on a Saturday night, my friends and I came to this film. First of all, the Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as a Native American? Seriously?! His focus was to break through so much, even though his character was apparently Scottish. Next, I was amazed to find that this film was made after he had played James Bond / 007, at least twice. This film plays with stereotypes, with an inspiring professor figure. The girl who played the ponies must be paid to keep their mouths shut. And this film won an award? I can not believe it. Brosnan is an attractive man, but we seriously want to evaluate our eyes after watching just 10 seconds. We have moved from the "Legs and screaming" before, and we wanted to switch back. We watched the 1995 children's classic Â«The Indian in the cupboard," earlier in the night, which also discussed the Iroquois. The next line is our desire to escape, "Take me on the street, land Grasper." From the "Great Gray Owl": "If you do not like, you do not have to watch."
