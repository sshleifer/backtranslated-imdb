Inconsistent, unclear, bad script, bad picture and direction ... in general very clearly ill-first efforts to commercial filmmaking good people on TBN. <br /> <br /> Pictures TBN has been a great success in the past, helping to bring «China Cry», the story of Nora Lam, on the big screen. But "Omega Code" is an unfortunate miscue. As a Christian, maintain alkalinity and a lot of its programming and loving «China Cry», I still believe it is possible to recommend this film to anyone. They do a lot of good ones of service, but this is not an example of this. Do not waste your money ... go «China Cry» rent instead.
