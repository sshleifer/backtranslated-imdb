First of all, I'm not a big fan of contemporary Turkish cinema, which is because the usual pattern creates a box office success, pushing below the waist. This film is nothing artistic masterpiece, which deals with restrictions, as director of marketing and ads have in mind. In my simple opinion, the only purpose of this film make money by touching tangible morality (in fact, it is generally considered taboo in the home country) Cheap populism can provide a short definition of what I had in mind. <br /> <br /> However, the current near perfect. In fact, most of the cast has a theater background and tried hard to make up for what was missing Altioklar; talent! All members of the cast were fit perfectly into their roles and are well qualified for the job, even less aware. (As Yanset) At least, Altioklar deserves a little gratitude, just because he knows how to choose the right shade. In addition, it is just media monkey, providing the director with an artistic flair. Well, art is not something that is exclusively of combat with naked / half naked women. And just because the media can boast off, no director has not become a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema. Just close your ears and something real art, I look forward to cheering your next job. I hope this time you managed to achieve artistic approach <br /> <br /> In short. Pros> Good acting, hot women (kidding!) :) Cons> Each and every thing, except the cast
