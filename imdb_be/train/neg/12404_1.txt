I have to say that this film is Mork & Mindy knock, while viewing it, I got chills, I even moisten himself a little. If the Korean guy with a spider in his neck began to beat people, I was as my lord Asians smell and suck, because they eat the dog all the time. Any way back to the track Chuck was a bit horrible performance and enough intelligence regularly entirely robotic humans. Some people compare him to his early days when he was Analyzer car wash and believe in the Holy Ghost and the ghost of Christmas past. This film is so bad, I put a newborn baby in the box and left it in Mr. Norris mailbox. It can raise your child, I will not let him into a world where he thinks that Chuck Norris is a karate expert Ill let him see that this is a hack, as in real life for the rest of his life.
