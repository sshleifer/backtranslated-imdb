A great example of how Hollywood could (and still can) take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly pollute it. <br /> <br /> In the case of "Big Sky" writer Dudley Nichols and the company confidently assumed that they can improve the classic pioneer novel prize Pulitzer author, AB Guthrie. At the same time, they took the soul of history and every edge and affect it may have been as a film adaptation. <br /> <br /> epic nature books Guthrie and the evolution of its main character, Boone Caudill, from naive, Kentucky looking for a seasoned and competent survivor / mountaineer, was replaced by the downscaled river farce which bears little resemblance to the author's intention. In the version and film, the presence of Boone there is nothing but destroyed. <br /> <br /> intriguing and even shocking story elements that give the effect of a novel and excitement Guthrie have been removed for no apparent reason at all. The most mysterious of all is emphasis on character Zeb Calloway, who was a casual, minor character in the book, only taking a few pages. on the other hand, is a very important and exciting character, Dick Summers, a veteran pioneer non-existent !!! It is also obvious that the director decided Hawks Zeb character in the movie, played by actor Hunnicutt, not annoying enough. So Zeb / Hunnicutt has received a considerable amount of time doing the nasty, the voice-over, which is the shortest for Hollywood screen incompetent writing, editing and direction. <br /> <br /> Some movies have really improved the book on which they were based (Wyler in "Ben-Hur" is a perfect example). But it's awful and depressing, not only as an adaptation of the novel, but as a film to itself <br /> <br /> The story upset and formulaic, and the characters -. At least those that were not cut out the script - just petty and sad shadow of the literary vision of Guthrie. And, unfortunately, the star of the call, Kirk Douglas, who helped to raise this film, was flooded by milktoast role he has been given. <br /> <br /> If you can believe it, the film adaptation of the Pulitzer prize-winning Guthrie continued, «The Way West» also starring Kirk worse. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, «The Big Sky» further solidifies place Howard Hawks, as one of the most overrated, cool directors in film history.
