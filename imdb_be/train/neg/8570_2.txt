There is only one thing that needs to be thoroughly happy Indian Runner. Unzip his pants. Look inside. There is evidence of chromosome Y? Well, you do <br /> <br /> This film has all the details of the men's blood, guns, chases, admired women, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, alcohol, violence, pyrotechnics - that is me. I left out? -. Oh, yes, blowtorches <br /> <br /> As a woman, I seriously hope that Sean Penn believes that it is as `when I was a kid ... kind of effort. Since he wrote and sent the case, it is almost solely responsible. Uneven cast (Viggo Mortensen, as usual brilliantly demonstrates how the work is supposed to do) trying to save Peng. Too late. Lines and actions there. Even a dedicated and experienced incumbent can not change them. <br /> <br /> I found this film frivolous and stupid and predictable. Dialogue reeling together - Sandy Dennis has my respect to trying to breathe life into the wood without maternal motherly monologue authenticity. Then she dies. After a bit, as does the father of the main characters, played by Charles Bronson. Their absence is hardly noticeable. <br /> <br /> During the breaks, pyrotechnics, etc., mentioned above, liven things up and scare the audience, thinking that something significant is likely what is happening. <br /> <br /> If you are male and under 25, you may love this movie. Plan to come back to it in 35. I think you still love him? <br /> <br /> I do not think so.
