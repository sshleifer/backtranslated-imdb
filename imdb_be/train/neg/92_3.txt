In fact, I can not believe I spent $ 5 on this film. I'm a huge zombie fanatic and thought the film could not be that bad. It was a zombie is that correct? I was wrong! To be honest this film had moments ... I thought it was cool when a guy got his head ripped off, but that was about it. In general, I believe that it would be more enjoyable to slide down the razor glides over my bare nutsack into a vat of vinegar, then watch this movie again. The film could have been better if we could see a fool, but I had to watch trailers for other films produced by this company to see that. Buyer beware ... if you're not in masochism.
