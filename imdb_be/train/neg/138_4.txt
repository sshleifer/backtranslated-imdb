Good: I liked this movie because it was the first horror movie I've seen in a long time, that really scared me. Acting is not too bad, and the killer "Cupid" was plausible and disturbing <br /> <br /> Poor :. The plot and the plot of this film is incredibly weak. There just is not much to it. Methods murderer killed the victim was very horrible and disgusting. I do not recommend this movie for those who can not cope with the baked blood <br /> <br /> In general: .. A good scare, but bad history <br /> <br /> ** to *****
