I was not expecting much from this movie, after the terrible "Life is a Miracle". It turns out that this film is ten times worse than the "Life ...". I have the impression that the director / author just joking with the audience: "let me see how much you can void (the audience) to maintain." Dialogues are empty ... minimalist scenario. After a few moments, photography is very nice. Several sarcastic lines are half-funny, but it's difficult to genuinely laugh during this "comedy". I laughed at himself for the opportunity to not watch the movie until the end. If you can raise yourself above the collapse of the director, ... you will find good action of the few legends (Predrag Manojlovic, Berchki), and a very good performance of the son of Emir Kusturica Stribor <br /> <br /> In short .: Too bad for this great director! Emir Kusturica is still young and needs to do a top-rated films. Instead, he wants to make it a low-budget in exchange for my-private cinema, with an arrogant attitude to global trends and negligence towards their old supporters.
