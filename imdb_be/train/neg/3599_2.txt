Mmm .. I was very surprised that someone actually this film praised. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... Tori Spelling was not a great actress .. and this movie proves once again how her "talent". The film was weak ... I bet idiot who came up with this concept was something perverse radar. If there is a good thing about this film, I would say that the daughter of Tommy Chong, only for the fact that she was his daughter ... and then there is the soap-opera-ish male role who looks somewhat decent well makes it attractive, but stops to help their dramatic abilities. * Why IMDb require at least 10 lines? How many more ways you can simply say, "This movie sucks?"
