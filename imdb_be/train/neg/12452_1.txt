This film is so bad that I can not even begin to describe it. What's in a burning pit wrong with writers, producers and directors? How did they get the funding for this abomination? The plot is ludicrous, poor acting in the best case, the story ... What's the story? The first battle in this film all right, but then he continues to repeat until you do not want to turn it off. <br /> <br /> I think I was the more free to not turn this silly film is turned off after the first minute. <br /> <br /> *** spoler ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I've only seen this film because Scott Adkins was there ... and he's in it for 30 ... seconds. .. <br /> <br /> I give 1 out of 10 because it is the lowest score IMDb offer <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. See the movie by Uwe Boll instead ... twice ... it is more worthy of your time.
