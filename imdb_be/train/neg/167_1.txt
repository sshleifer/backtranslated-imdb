Anyone who has ever been a supporter of the original series, or even have a clue about the story line must be puzzled by this series. Borg does not come around until Q does not bring the company in the sector Gamma, the Klingons have never seen as Kirk does not interfere with them, NCC-1701 was the first ship to bear the name Enterprise .... whether we should continue? Berman and Pilliar made mockery of Gene Roddenberry's creation. After he died, they saw only the $$$$, and just went on his way. Not surprisingly, Majel Barrett was in every episode of Star Trek in this series. I do not blame her for not being involved in this mess. Poor Baku. He's a wonderful actor, as well as the entire cast. I love them all, but the plot is tragic and ignores all precedents in the original series. Just check the ratings. I think that more people watched Deep Space 9 (which was untimely canceled).
