It occurs to me that some of the films that were banned during the history of the movie were actually very important and very good films. I would argue that, rather than banning the complex, ambiguous film censors should consider banning movies that are so bad that they pose a threat to your IQ and your common sense. If they were to make it one of the first films to be quickly hidden, no doubt, will be «Stroker Ace». This movie is awful with a capital "A". This is the worst movie Burt Reynolds ever filmed in .... quite a feat for a person with «Cannonball Run II», «CPC and a half" and the «Rent-A-Cop» on his resume! <br /> <br /> The finest story introduces us to successful production car racer STROKER Ace (Reynolds), a man who loves fast cars and fast women. He is stuck in a humiliating contract with a crooked promoter Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty). The contract requires him to do some humiliating promotional work for the new fast food chain, such as dressing as a giant chicken. Abandoned in the mixture are lugs (Jim Nabors), blunt buddy Ace and Pembrook Feeney (Loni Anderson), Bimbo with brain fractionally less pea which tended Ace. <br /> <br /> Hal Needham, director of the low-grade waste was formerly a stunt, and he made many films that relied on his experience in the production of spectacular stunts and chase / race. Some of these films were in order, as "Hooper" and "Stunts Unlimited", but with "STROKER Ace", it reaches the lowest point of a career. Characters so stupid that you actually pity the actors playing them. Anderson is particularly difficult in such a stupid role it makes you gnashing of teeth in frustration. Humor is weak and infantile everywhere and tricks and racing sequences unremarkable. Even in-takes during the closing credits (which can be found in all collaboration Reynolds NEEDHAM), usually unfunny that gives the impression that, perhaps, the film was a lot of fun to do. «Stroker Ace» bitch is of considerable magnitude.
