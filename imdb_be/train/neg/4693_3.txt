This is exactly the type of movie that excites me the most. The large cast, a great director, great story potential, they will destroy all this with a script that is not going nowhere ... and do not say anything, and go! There's no depth here at all. A lot of the depth of the characters, no plot depth or depth of surprises, suspense, or common sense. We know what is happening, we are told how they plan to solve this problem, they solve the problem, to throw a surprise we near the end, which does not generate any uncertainty, then they finish the movie once. Wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Glenn Ford leads a cast of British (and one French) actors who are all fantastic, makes an incredibly poor job with one-dimensional writing, they have been given. One of the absolute favorites Herbert Walton as "Old Charley", which provides some lovely bits of humor and warmth in the dark and serious film. I also thought that the film had a great look at it ... all the shadows and fog ... very noir film in a sense. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the actors are doing their best, and directing nice, she still just not enough for me to recommend to take the time to watch a movie. There are much better movies out there Glenn Ford: The Big Heat, Gilda, Affair in Trinidad, etc.
