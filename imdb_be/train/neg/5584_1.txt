Do we really need more narcissistic trash on the baby boomer generation? Technically, I boomers, although at that time, when all the "idealistic young people" from the 60s read Marx, burning their draft cards, and even prolonging a war that has destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in elementary school. But I remember them well, and 9 out of 10 were just senile fools who would believe anything at that time, as it was devastating. <br /> <br /> This is just another Excercise in the pride of the children who never really grew up.
