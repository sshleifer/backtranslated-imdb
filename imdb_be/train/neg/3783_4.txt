It was not a meaningless experience animated film ever, but it certainly can not be admired as well as he's trying to be good. The combination of DreamWorks Animation and Computer Graphics, is the story of the Mustang, later called Spirit (Matt Damon, providing a first-person narrative), and his journey through the Old West through the border. Basically, he is born free from all other horses in the beautiful countryside, then he stole to use as a saddle, he manages to lose anyone who is trying to ride it. However, when he escapes from his cage, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), then the two of them form friendships, oh, and he obviously has a thing for female horse Little Creek. In the end, a few great escape, being chased by Colonel (James Cromwell) and his people, and make the final big leap across the gorge, Little Creek allows Spirit to go, and it also produces a female horse, and they run home to the countryside and other horses. Also starring Chopper Burnett as Sgt. Adams, Jeff Lebo, Murphy / Railroad Foreman, John Ruba as a soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin, Joe. I expected to see the horses say in this film, but it is more dam things all over the place, and the song of Bryan Adams is not the most interesting, but it's not scary movie. He was nominated for an Oscar for best animated film, and was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song for Bryan Adams' "Here I Am". Good!
