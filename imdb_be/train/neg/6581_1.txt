I rented a "new best friend" who wanted to film such enjoyable for teenagers thrillers such as "Gossip" and "curve". Instead, «New Best Friend» much more like a «The In Crowd», in which there are no thrills, and the action is incredibly false. «New Best Friend» is boring, and the event during the same movie. Skip this movie ... this is a waste of time.
