Well, I hate Hollywood, but like a movie, so I have to watch these films in theaters Cruddy. And I was hoping that Vanilla Sky will be fine. I was hoping that they will either keep the original «Open Your Eyes» the same way, or they do it in their own way. Well, it happened to be a little of both, and it sucks. <br /> <br /> He started well. I love Radiohead. I would like to have more of this. But by the end we listen to Good Vibrations By The Beach Boys. This wide range of sucking therebetween. They had one or two good songs at the club and maybe a couple of others, but why oh why do they have to roar GV during menopause. It was more annoying than misleading or obscene. Especially if it has nothing to do with the plot. At the very least, put some meaning behind the lyrics. A child = primary. Whatever. <br /> <br /> He also did a bang up job with the club scene. That was cool. Otherwise, the film was one big ball of arrogance. As if the audience would get the film. Those who would have received it read subtitles, while others will not. Its that simple. Motives got all screwed up. I did not understand the motivations Diaz (if they have not done the night before the chicken soup?) And some others. And I hate Kurt Russell. Hold on to the board. Tom Cruise may not work (especially in these types of films [ie strabismus]). And lift. I get it. In any case, they were trying to improvements of the original with a bad American rock soundtrack and bad angles and good film printing and glossy treatment, and would have helped if Crowe Sun harmed. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Major disappointment.
