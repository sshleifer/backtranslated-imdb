It really had to be a star, but there were so many clich√©s, predictable turns, seen it all before slasher flick parallels that I actually give him an extra star for the fact that made me laugh ... but it never it was the director I'm going. <br /> <br /> I do not often write comments about movies, they have to be sensational, or in this case are, in fact, bad. <br /> <br /> To be honest, when I saw Fahey in it I knew it would be a poor man, he has a unique flair, choosing the worst movies. <br /> <br /> as a farce, all this made me see everything through, perhaps, for a cheerful voice MR T (not relay Mr T, but you'll know what I mean, if you bother to look at it) when you look at it, make sure that you do not pay to see it, it might have worked, they really put a comedy designed it, but I'm sure you'll find a strange laugh here and there in the farce of it all. ..
