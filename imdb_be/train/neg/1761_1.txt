Firstly, I understand that the rating of "1" are supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst. This movie gets by me because, as one reviewer suggests that this is not a bad thing in self aware, more-top sort of way that may allow him to have some comic or religious significance. He just misses his mark on every account. ** Contains spoilers ** Possible Dialogue completely disingenuous. Continuity is so deliberate it hurts. Daniel simply stops talking about his lost love, and with him the last word flamenco dancers begin. Dummy-shocked by the fact that her name was (see? I can not even remember the name of your character, not to mention the name of the forgotten actress), when her husband (Baldwin) first tells her that her boyfriend is a bad guy. Car and motorcycle chase did everything right. Vegetable stroller fly. Cars crashing into each other. Motorcycles down the stairs. People almost hit, but surprisingly, no one. Oh, that's right ... except for one man who had been stabbed several times, obviously, stumbling along the roadside with knife wounds, and the approaching car, apparently did not notice him there. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> It is becoming more and more typical to me that films like this can be done. There is so much pressure in the industry to make money, you'd think that someone in Hollywood would think of doing good films worth seeing. Now there's a novel idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: do not watch this movie. Do not rent a DVD. Nha watch on cable. There are many other things that you could do that will leave you feeling more satisfied.
