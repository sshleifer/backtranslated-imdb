Ugh! Another one of those "fooled coverÂ» DVD. I was expecting some kind of action for at least bears, cats, and those on the front cover. I got nothing! Bad movie!. <br /> <br /> I forced myself to watch it all the way through, thinking that in the end something happens ... no luck. <br /> <br /> Now the reason I gave it 2 because of the scenery; otherwise, this sucks. <br /> <br /> The child was terrible, talking to myself (although I guess they could not just start the movie with a stupid music and no dialogue at all), making him a lame karate position to a tree stump, threatening raccoon, munching on worms, and (dumbass) feet porcupine. And it will not pull those needles that easily ... either they stick out like fishhooks. At least, he fought with the bear (weakly) a couple of times. <br /> <br /> As with the retrospective thing? This made a bad movie worse. I would like to see the survival of cinema, and not some dramatic Bs childhood, suffers through a divorce. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? Well, maybe they should bear a child to eat or something. At least, it would be more interesting. <br /> <br /> People do not waste your time on this.
