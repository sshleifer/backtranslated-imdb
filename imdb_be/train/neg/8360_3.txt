What do you like in this movie ??? <br /> <br /> It's in color! <br /> <br /> He has some impressive underwater photography! <br /> <br /> It has a rhythmic music in the background, which works well at times! <br /> <br /> So 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes the music accelerates! Especially if a shark or villains are going to move! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it slows down! How to convey to the audience is about to be time for compassion! <br /> <br /> As one bites the dust! As if in a "spaghetti western" This is very similar to! <br /> <br /> This is not something that the Italians can not produce quality performances! Was a series of television films with titles such as "Octopus" numbered from 1 to 7, screened on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s conflicts mafia-type! And they were great! But, unfortunately, you will not find here !!! <br /> <br /> I assumed that it was made around 1960! Unfortunately, it was 20 years outdated, as evidenced by the funeral scene near the end! <br /> <br /> Then there was the razor-sharp shark bite emergency, which does repeatedly appearing in the blue waters of the red dust! <br /> <br /> Among all this, or in the bar-room brawl or to monitor the latest marine side of the bloody wear on inexorably hungry shark, assistant hero looks at me through his glasses a little concerned, as if he too missed his tireless role among the many there is no evidence of a plot or character development of someone! <br /> <br /> At the very least, the hero shows fleeting concern late for his ex-wife! <br /> <br /> But, of course, even if the music is not in a position to awaken consciousness, we have the ominous sound villains voice as if pushing us that another dark deed is going to come out! <br /> <br /> And towards the end, someone has thought of a twist! Just when we thought it was absolutely predictable! But watch out, the people, because you can find another turn! When you look closely! For more or less, it will warm your heart! <br /> <br /> Follow the advice of the hero, and have a few beers on the way! This will make your browsing "Night shark" more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Then you're ready for something like "007" of the film, in order to facilitate their way back to reality when it's over !!!
