You have to admire Brad Sykes, even if you do not particularly want someone who churns budget horror after horror budget less trapped receptions. But it continues to do so all the same. Even half-hearted praise than his films surrounds Camp Blood is given reluctantly, and I'm guilty of this as anyone. Delirium usually manage to throw something interesting in the mixture neat idea, kooky character you want, but without the means to take it further than a basic level, it relies on the audience to cut him slack and appreciate him for what he that it can be. Joe Haggerty gives an energetic and very fun job as Ebenezer Jackson and his loan to Sykes, he may feel that the eccentric phase will work within the film. Coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe somewhere.
