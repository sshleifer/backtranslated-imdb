If you have not yet realized that this happens in this film in the first five minutes, then give it a few more minutes. Lilia widow. It has been left on the shelf too long, and she wants to get out. She has a teenage daughter, which only emphasizes that it is not getting any younger. During check on her daughter, she discovers a world she had never dared to ... Cabaret, where she could belly dance in a poor sequined clothes while men throw money at it. The film is very misogamist. This image of men is negligible. Which is quite strange as Lily leans wiggle around them, and not for money, but just for the hell of it. If she could wake them it makes her feel like a woman again. She does not want to join them, but she enjoys the attention. Other dancers are all mostly aging women who look like men in the resistance and to implement them at the center of attention is short-lived. Do not short enough, I say. She does find romance, however briefly, with you guessed it .... No surprises here we did not see the arrival. Although the ending is good, you know that this could not end otherwise. Maybe this film is not just targeting of my demographic processes 30 men
