Well, firstly, the Sigal voice dubbed over the coin 50% of the film ... Why? Because, apparently they had to rewrite the script and the story of how they were shooting, and they need to change their dialogue continuity of history, as they have several versions. From the beginning, you just scratch your head, because the overlay is not only distracting, but they have no meaning. <br /> <br /> However, this story is sucked and makes no sense. When I got to the end, I was just scratching my head to cause the film was so pointless and ending not even make sense. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. This film made me stop watching Seagal movies directly to video, because they only get worse and worse.
