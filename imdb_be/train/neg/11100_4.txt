I loved the original story, had very high hopes for the film (especially since Barker raved about it in the interview) finally saw it and what can I say? It was a mess! The guide is everywhere, the action was brutal, showy visuals and choreography was just a flat, empty and completely unnecessary (as with ordinary methods of music video, how fast forward slowly, may be stupid? It was a style, yes, but it is not necessary in this film, and reduce the cost of vibe in some stupid MTV Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo clip). While some of the killings pretty cool and violent, some are just ridiculous ridiculous (the first murder on the Japanese girl was hilarious and the death of Ted Raimi was just stupid funny). He just rushes everywhere with zero stress and uncertainty, completely departing from the original story, and then come back to it in the final, which at that time just feels dirty to wear it even more. No explanation was given at all, I mean, I knew what was happening, as soon as I read this story, but for people who have not this even more confusing, sometimes even I do not know where he is, and that he tries to DO- it occurred on a tangent mad all the time. <br /> <br /> God, I really wanted to love this film as I'm a big fan of the work of Barker and loved the story, as it has a huge potential cracking of the film, hell, I even enjoyed some of Kitamura films like fun noisy games, but this film just Raziel amateurism and stupidity from start to finish, I do not care about anyone or anything, it was delivered and greatly cut down the actual source, transforming it into something completely different. Of course it was a bloody and Vinnie Jones played beautiful badass, but everything else was everywhere, more than a disappointment. Gutted
