This film could have been much better to rewrite the script. Not that I expect a lot of credibility in the movie, but you would think that even the homeless and urban residents Jack Mason to the question of why a group of experienced hunters would like to hire him as a hunting guide. And when the hunting grounds, poor Ice-T plays a role, as if he actually will lead these people through the forest, he had never seen before. <br /> <br /> And as Jack Mason find Thomas Burns is back in Seattle? <br /> <br /> I believe that this movie was based on a short story by Richard Connell in «The Most Dangerous Game». A few years ago I showed the film to a class of students of 9th class after they read the story. I reissued the film, cutting out all the meaningless scenes and all profanity. It ended up being 43 minutes long.
