The person will be expected that a film made with approx. Budget 300000000 U $ D should at least entertain you for the time you spend in the cinema watching hatched. "The Matrix Reloaded," shows that this assumption is incorrect. <br /> <br /> «Matrix» developed better, despite the obvious holes in relation to the history of logic. At least, no one could explain to me why beat the bot (who is also an agent) in the simulation (aka Martix) will harm the computer program responsible, in any case ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Wachowski brothers made excactly this "agent-bashing" the main thing in "The Matrix Reloaded": it beat «Em Up O-Rama. This action scenes can be enough to work (or even fun) to 5 seconds. trailer, but continued for a few minutes, appears to be tampered with, choreographer bad and repeated again and again, this is nothing more than sad. Although see the promised spectecular tricks is nothing more than a low-quality prose Chas had seen (or should not), for example,. Van Damme "cinema". Unlike post-production (etherything 5 times faster, the camera floats around a lot and freezes on some scenes, and this is repeated at least 5 min) does not help here, all this has nothing to do with the very meaning of a "martial arts." In addition to these "battles", all the actors refuse to do what they get paid for :. Acting <br /> <br /> What is it other than the fight scenes? Few people other than Hollywood's routine. It's about as multicultural bunch of hippies who sucked in "Waterworld" recycled as a citizen "Zion" (Mann, the last city in the world), and on the order of Morpheus they start dancing, because it is a good opportunity to show much, just covered boobs and butts. About as popular clichée frogs aki speak French with this «JE NE SAIS Quoi» dumb accent that is wasting his fortune because of the "link damur" is easily served. Following this (unwanted and funny) is a fight between Neo and sinister followers "frog", as is the case in both Erroy Flynn enterieur, fortunately, showing a lot of weapons mideaval for decoration. For Neo poses with hellebarde, simply add 2 stairs and a lot of statues (so blown up, thrown on the evil guys and the like), and you'll get 5 more meaningless, boring minutes. this stuff. <br /> <br /> What is left to wait? Neutral merchandising hell. And "revolution" taking place or not - of course, without me.
