I'll be honest- so I rented this movie because I am a big fan of Kyle Chandler (primarily from the early editions). Since he usually plays the good guy, I would like to see him in a different role (out of curiosity). The story itself also attracted me; wanna-be killer (Tony aka Mr. Greco Chandler) has to kill a man in a random order before it is trusted for life, rather, Death- witness who will testify against someone in the 'family' and ". Films was nothing like I expected. He was sick, I hated the end (if you saw it, you know why), and there were so many unnecessary details. Basically- it was dirty, and little sense. Yes, it was a crowd of cinema, and guns do go BOOM. But there is more to the movie than that. This film acted as if he did not have time to go into detail- just deal with it and understand it. Actions really made for IT- James Belushi was quite amusing as «The Rose». Sheryl Lee made angel, it seems as plausible as it could get. She surprised me the most. And Kyle Chandler was so convincing as a beginner and worried "family." If only the script did justice to the actors.
