It was, so far, the worst film I've seen in my life, and I've seen some really bad movies. I saw this movie at the local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror film. Little did I know that the cover will be the best part of the film. Where to start? Filming had been scattered, and sad. In one place, there is a one-minute scene is not one conversation, just driving to the ranch to normal sunny day. Nothing happened, they just rode in silence. The entire film is boring, to irritating, unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of. If you rent this movie, watching it with some friends, and it can make a good comedy. Otherwise, if you see the movie to start.
