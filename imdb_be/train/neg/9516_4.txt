Frank Sinatra plays a former soldier-goodnik and frustrated writer, hard living and hard drinking, who returns to his native hometown of average and reunites with his estranged brother (Arthur Kennedy), the city is now a great shot from a disinterested wife and headstrong daughter. Frank is linked with the gambler Dean Martin, Shirley MacLaine flooze uneducated, and has some run-ins with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman. More simplistic drama verging on the soap opera, with the role of McClane, which in turn too "picturesque" and awkwardness sentimental (her drunk belting on "After you've gone", but the highlight of the film, and skillfully handled). Director Vincente Minnelli watching it in a straight forward fashion, but in a remarkably gloomy spirits and most of the big scenes are flat or dense. The picture looks incredibly beautiful widescreen, with good attention to detail and composition, but the story and the characters are stuck in the garbage. ** from ****
