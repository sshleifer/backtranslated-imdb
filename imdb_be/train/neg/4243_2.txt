The funniest scene of the film, probably when our rescuers get their medals and plaques and whatnot. Thus, the basic idea is that the police exceed those gangsters flew like a million to one, but they are powerless, because the villains arms just a little more. I believe that the police ammunition only sort of bounces off. They decided to shoot this film in a documentary style with a fake interview and everything seriously, what's wrong with these guys? They say they were armed with rolled-up newspaper. Okay, I admit that it's probably still dangerous to be on the firing line, even if the situation is so much to your advantage, but do not go crazy. And why the hell did it take 44 minutes to solve all the problems in one way or another? I would say that for a very long time, if you were surrounded and you are allowed to shoot. They are like ten feet. Look, they did not get anything at all. Then they go out and buy guns Bigger themselves to increase their heroism. And then, yes, there you have it, one of the policemen actually hits someone. The bullet probably distracted lamppost or something. I had a good laugh, I think.
