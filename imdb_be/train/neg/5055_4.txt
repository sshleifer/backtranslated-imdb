Two years ago, I loved Sundance directorial debut-Haiku Tunnel Josh Kornbluta in. So I look forward to my brother (and frequent collaborator) Jacob, best villain in the world. It is a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a lower-class neighborhood in New York. The film is not without sharp points. But sometimes, like Kornbluth it is too difficult to state the obvious: Life can be very difficult for some people. And life is not fair. <br /> <br /> A more subtle, and more importantly, we understand that, despite all of these abhorrent several cultural foundations and anti-social behavior, they can generate these characters do not have a lack of kindness and humanity. We can bounce in their language, and their living conditions, but we can not dismiss his intention. Indeed, their struggle to keep the family in such distress have a certain nobility that most of us can only appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in the area, and his compassion for people is manifested in everything. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, the world's best thief suffers from many painful shortcomings (including the title). Characters are not very plausible. Drawing up unevenly. A story-line is barely distinguishable. And for many, the most worrying is that Kornbluth employs two young black boys, imitating the gangsta rap scene. To each his own: But while I do not question the potential reality of this phenomenon, it pains me to see 5-year-olds mf'ing and say that sex with women queue. It is unnecessary shock value and had a bit of borrowed interest.
