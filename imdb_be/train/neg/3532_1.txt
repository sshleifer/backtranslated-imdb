Its as if you have a common theme suspects and FightClub, take away all of their style and class, and mix them together with lots of artsy new wave of "I'm an intellectual because my film has to be difficult to understand," the film producer garbage, puree a few extra styles for good measure, chipped the end, you have a gun. <br /> <br /> Yes, I think about it a little bit after seeing and yes, it did kind of make sense, but it does not prevent its collector. <br /> <br /> waste of money. Waste of time. <br /> <br /> And then as the worst film I've ever seen, with not even a bad movie novelty value, to buy him a little bit.
