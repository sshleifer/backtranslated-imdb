Hello, I'm from Denmark, and one day I was with a movie night with friends. One brought the film with him "Russian terminator", and it was very scary. After watching less than half a minute, we decided to fast forward, stopping only at some ridiculous "highlights", or should I say "dark places" in the film. I was actually mainly discovered with surprise that this film was released here in my home country of Denmark ... that was the biggest mistake this country has ever made.
