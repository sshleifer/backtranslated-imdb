After what I thought was a masterful performance of roles in Man with snow River, why Kirk Douglas replaced Brian Dennehy in the future? It just was not the same without spurs and Harrison, both drawn Douglas. Maybe he found out how poor the story was - Jim returns after a long absence to find Jessica pursued by another man. He could not expect any girl to wait long, with no contact with him, and did not find competitors. For the Disney film, this contains profanity, and highly unnecessary part when Jim and Jessica shaken without being married - very LAME. Quite an insult to the viewer's intelligence, according to members of my family. I'll stick with the first one, and try to forget that I had ever seen a sequel!
