I recently saw a documentary "The Revolution will not be televised," also known as "Chavez: Inside the coup." At first I thought he showed a real event from the inside look at Venezuela coup d'etat in April 2002, that bothered me though was the fact that the narrative tone and the accompanying music was ambiguous, and that at no point was expressed any criticism of Hugo Chavez. It is peculiar, because when the documentary gives an unbiased account of what happened, had to be some of that, too. In the end, Chavez, of course, not a saint. Fortunately, as the documentary several years, much more information can be found online in our time, and it was not hard to find, for example, "an urgent investigation into the Chavez coup on 5 European TV corporations who financed the film, which is an obvious lie of Venezuela ". It lists many mistakes and intentional or unintentional falsification in the documentary. (Just use the name as a search string in Google, you'll find it). Another interesting document was a video presentation of the registration of numerous errors in the results of the documentary, "X-ray of lies." It seems to me to be a good counterweight "Chavez: Inside the coup" It is available on video.google. I highly recommend you after watching "Chavez: Inside the coup" to look at "X-ray lies", and then form an opinion. My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brien was (consciously or not) in terms of Chavez propaganda.
