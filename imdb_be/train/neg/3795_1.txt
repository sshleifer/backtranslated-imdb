I really wanted to love this show. I really, honestly did. <br /> <br /> For the first time a gay audience get its own version of «The Bachelor». With the help of his mandatory "hag" Andrew, James, handsome, wealthy thirty-something has a chance of love with 15 suitors (or "Odnoklassniki", as they are called in the show). The only problem is that half of them are direct and James knows it. If James chooses the gay one, they get a trip to New Zealand, and if he chooses to direct one straight guy gets $ 25,000. How can it not be fun? Take me by the hand, allowing a walk: <br /> <br /> The most glaring problem with the show of a bachelor. James your typical young and successful gay man with a kind smile and body, the one that you're likely to give two looking away at a local bar to graze on green pastures. Why they decided to throw James, as a leading man for me. God knows that there are so many other more warm and cheerful homosexuals out there dying to be on TV. <br /> <br /> In addition to his rather average appearance, James is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk. Even as a such, it is this arrogant, smug condescension an aura about him. However, when James got up against a blank, white wall it blend right into it. I really can not think of any interesting or characteristic thing James said during the show. It is so boring and forgettable. In fact, one of his comrades told him flat out that he did not feel the connection. I thought it was the best part of the show. In addition, James said with a painfully annoying modulations. The sound of feminine or masculine sound, but not **** ING SEGUE tonne in mid-sentence ... so painful to sit through. I hated it so much during the show, I thought, "Please select the straight guy and humiliate himself and his unfortunate looking Hag» <br /> <br /> Then we suitors. Excellent fresh bunch of people who do not seem to care about, anyway, what's going on. No less sad, they seem indistinguishable from one guy to another, except, "Hey, that guy has a bright moments, or that one of curly hair" Again, amazingly inept solution casting seems the purpose of the show. While it may be beaten to gain the role of the actors, it would be much more interesting than watching these amorphous drones. However, in all its banality, they still manage to outshine James (which is not all that hard to do in any case), that is a little. You know you have a problem, when some of the suitors, actually warmer and more interesting than a leading man. And the fact that the young men seem to have more fun around each other than with the leading man? . Very sad <br /> <br /> Also, I just thought Id point that is mentioned in the message boards, which I felt was really so: straight men are hotter than gay guys. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I'm not saying all gay guys are ugly and boring, as well as the question of whether I found some of them very nice. It's just that as a whole they were just BLAH compared with men you see on shows like A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila or Bachelorette. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many times I hit fast forward during this show. I can take the lead character, as interesting as a cardboard box, I accept the worldly, indifferent fiance, but please, for the love of God amuses me just a little bit. No such luck. HN <br /> <br /> If you're expecting drama, intrigue, sexuality, or the excitement, you will be disappointed heavy. The biggest "drama" is derived from the fact that one of the suitors may still have one in New York (as scandalous!). As tickled as it may be, I guarantee you that this is the only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on the show. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a twist, but if you have some similarity Gaidar in you, you will easily distinguish who is who (was not hard at all, I was only once ,.) This show adds so many of their chips on the twist that he was not able to put anywhere else. <br /> <br /> We get to watch as James & Co drawn such interesting activities such as learning how to tap Western, for gifts, visiting the zoo, and gay karaoke. Yawn. Of course, you have the occasional topless dancing, but who cares when everything is boring anyway. This is one of the main problems associated with the show: No one seems to be enjoying themselves - they're just going through the motion, trying hard to strongly seems to have a good time. And you really can not blame them, as the events all the wild prose and the lame. <br /> <br /> Finally, the physical aspect is not there. There's no embrace, sun caressing, kissing is not (!), No affection of any kind. It's just, "Well, that was a sad day, Im going to return to my ugly, sticky want-to-be Sydney Operahouse housing (quick peck on the lips) KDY." This show is so **** ING prim is ridiculous. I can understand them not wanting to play on the perceived indiscretionary nature of homosexual men, but come on ****. People who watch reality shows are going to need more than restrained hugs and kisses Curt. This show refuses to compromise. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if this is long winded, but I felt it was the questions that need to be addressed. I paid him for the first Bravo putting up a show of this kind, but strikingly incompetent manner in which this show was incredible processed. Summing has three points: It is sad + sad + = sad to go and do something else. You'll have more fun waiting in the doctor's office for an appointment, at least, they have an interesting magazines there.
