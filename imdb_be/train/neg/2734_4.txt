But, let's face it ... he got some nostalgic sigh from me. <br /> <br /> The show just so consistently high that is allowed to have a few hiccups. I get the new season, and only the power through them, I have a 2-days to live. I like the idea of ​​wrapping it, but it was a lot more at the end of the season the episode, which would explain the following: <br /> <br /> Dr.Cox should not be bald a couple of episodes, the only explanation I can think of, they changed the rotation of episodes or had to re-shoot the beginning. <br /> <br /> and my friends, why the hell cox bald. <br /> <br /> In any case, the show is awesome ... bring on the 7th season.
