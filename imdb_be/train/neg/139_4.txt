This movie was rented another. Her choice is usually good. I have read a bit of the first and waiting for a good movie. Despite the fact that <br /> <br /> was a horror movie. I prefer not to. But the horror does not come to mind while watching the movie. It was sad, <br /> <br /> not a very interesting film. The appearance of Denise Richards <br /> <br /> again pleasing to the eye. But that's all. We (four of us) <br /> <br /> we're a little disappointed. But do not hesitate to see this film and <br /> <br /> judge yourself.
