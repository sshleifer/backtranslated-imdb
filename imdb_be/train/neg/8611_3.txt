If Rodney Dangerfield is on a roll, he's funny. In My 5 Wives, he was not on the roll. The timing of one-liners are excluded, but they are the best to go to the movies. Five women, who play the wife does not add up into one actress in between. The plot is very weak. Even the premise is quite weak; There are some jokes about that have more than one wife, but the situation has nothing to do with anything in the movie. Much of the film can play the same way, even if the character Rodney had only one wife, so that the room is more like an old fantasy than a key part of the comedy. Another old man's fantasy: we have to recognize that the nature of Rodney is sporty skiers <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller, it seems, calling in his role simply make buddy affection, and the remaining part of the name. actors should just be desperate for work. <br /> <br /> odd bowing to political correctness, later in the film does not do anything for the film. For those who like their films politically correct, non-PC humor there is in the first place, and imaginary excuses for it still does not get the point. For those who hate to see a movie in the cave of political correctness, PC add-ons just annoying retreat. <br /> <br /> It should be soft R-rated movie I ever saw. There are some colorful jokes, and sex scenes would have made a shocking television 40 years ago, but that's about it. Maybe it was a topless man (just kidding). <br /> <br /> DVD contains interviews, where the actors seem to find the depth and importance in this film and in their role. I wondered if they were serious or joking. They seem to be serious, but I kept thinking, "They must be kidding!" There's also a kind of refusal to assume that, because the film never actually names Mormons or Church of Latter-day Saints, that somehow it's not about them . Nothing that the film has a polygamous religion in Utah, and makes reference to Brigham Young. <br /> <br /> In short, a 5 Wives was a disappointment. I was hoping for Rodney on a roll, but the best thing I can say about the film, Rodney looks pretty good for a guy who was pushing 80 at the time.
