I must admit that I saw some gems in his time, but this one is up there with the worst of them. Plot bothering to follow. Sex and violence thrown in disorient and distract from the really bad to put together a film. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the cast will look at the final product and wish to gather dust on a shelf not be broken for one or two generations. Unfortunately, in my case, I have a DVD. He will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time.
