There are so many incorrect statements in this so-called "documentary", which I found myself screaming at the television. <br /> <br /> Bart Sibrel may be able to produce cries watching a DVD, but it is, unfortunately, not enough to search the science behind its claims. <br /> <br /> It is based on the inaccurate, not to mention the whole story, or an old favorite, "the government always lies with us" innuendo, and people who believe what they say and they do not check for accuracy or detail behind the claims. <br /> <br /> Moreover, its "exclusive" or "unreleased" footage freely available over the Internet from various sites. <br /> <br /> Further reading about the circumstances relating to the making of this production shows that he used a false pretense to get an interview, and use creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinion. <br /> <br /> All of the statements made by Mr. Sibrel about "inaccuracies", "Error" or "denunciations" in the Apollo program was a cop LY refuted. <br /> <br /> I understand that more than 40 minutes of my life back?
