This low budget Roger Corman horror / creature flick. Dinocroc created when prehistoric gene manipulation running amok. Engineering crocodiles first killing one of his own, gets a taste of man and becomes rapidly growing fear after escaping. None of the characters do not have any depth, but they are not the focus. We get a few glimpses of huge bipedal dinosaur descendants and some of the best "kill" scene in a small budget film. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene from the zany character tries to use the three legs of the dog for a bait and himself becomes a crocodile food. Nothing left on the dock, but the ankle of the upper leg. In the absence of a real stand out roles: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Vaice and Charles Napier. Most pathetic is Matt Borleni and back professional hunter crocodile Mandylor. What impressed me most enticing Joanna flour as respectfully feared, Dr. P. Dinocroc is redemptive as a crock pickles.
