«The Rainmaker», released in 1956 - some of the best actors of his time. Katharine Hepburn, Lloyd Bridges, Burt Lancaster and be fundamental players. Not even they can keep it entirely acted melodrama. First of all, Hepburn terribly miscast as a shy girl - despite her brilliance as an actress, even she could pull it off. It is too strong to be reliable as much of a simpleton, and was too old for the role. Lancaster over the acts to the extreme, and Earl Holliman is too exaggerated and off more Jethro Clampett. Bridges and always reliable Wendell Corey, it seems, only to rise above the cast a bit - but even they can only do so much. It seems that in the 1950s was a time when Katharine Hepburn wanted to spread my wings a bit, as an actress, and it was good. She just made a bad choice here. Fortunately for their fans (me being among them), it does not make them too much. Despite the A-list actors and good production values, it does not work.
