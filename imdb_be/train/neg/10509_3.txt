Boot from the sky, a gang of horny naked female angels (with large plastic fangs) settled in effigy forest, where they feed on any poor souls who have to wander in. It's not long before a group of friends on a road trip fall victim to bloodthirsty babes ?? Independent low-budget horror film made in Britain, Forest damned takes an interesting premise and washes away down the pan with some of the worst actions, effects and direction that I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> director Johannes Roberts shows some occasional flair for the camera ?? scene in the dilapidated house quite tense and there are some elaborately processed drums "moments - but for the most part of the film is technically amateurish Throw in some truly awful performances from horror icon Tom Savini and Sean Hutson, and you have a real bad movie on. your hands. <br /> <br /> Some fun can be obtained from the pure shoddiness film, and there are loads of female nudity for the guys to enjoy, but most of them will find it sickening to sit.
