Twin brothers separated at birth (due to the death of their parents) to reunite twenty-five years later to avenge their parents and return them a million dollars tunnel. Double strike is a two-hour long and generally does not add any real approach to the story Corsican brothers and Jean-Claude Van Damme during adequate as an evil twin brother just embarrassing as good twin brother. In addition, the action sequences are not so interesting, at this time, and Jean-Claude relies on more shots, then on his martial arts. In addition, the supporting cast is wasted, and for two hours the film is just boring. <br /> <br /> * 4 (Bad)
