Overweight nice guy falls for luscious blonde; she loves him too, but not for the reasons you might think. Have not seen a black comedy from writer Pat Proft features very good performances in Alaska, Joe and Donna Dixon, but it has no lasting effects. It's just a throwaway trash efforts helmets by Norman Bates, Anthony Perkins. Even at the level of B-comedies some practical «Eating Raoul» is the best choice. There's definitely a fun-set here; Unfortunately, the picture does not escape in the second act. It is interesting to try, but a misfire. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
