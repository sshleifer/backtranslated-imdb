I should have known I was in trouble with Casper Van Diem as the protagonist. Words can not describe, they do not do justice, how terrible this movie was. But, please, let me try to describe it: Terrible action awful dialogue, banal situation, and through it all, you get the feeling that you are stuffed beliefs and propeganda by Trinity Broadcasting Network. His feeble attempt at trying to show Hollywood that the movie can be exciting and have a profound religious message attached to it. They failed miserably. It was clearly the worst film I've seen in a long time.
