All I can say after watching Snitch'd is please stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear, you do not understand what you're doing movies. If you insist on the creation of gangster films I urge you to do the research. It's funny to watch movies with gangsters ridiculous that sounds even more absurd when they speak. <br /> <br /> I laughed in part, if Mr. Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and continues to beat their examples in Kung Fu style. This film was tough as after-school special. Who was the idea of ​​having to wear a hat to say where a particular gangbanger was from?. I suspect that the real gangsters do not wear hats arguing that there is a gang. That would be foolish, considering new laws that add to the length of the prison term, when the gang man. <br /> <br /> Snitch'd gangbanger is the worst movie ever made.
