Men in Black 2 was a real disappointment for me. While the actors have done a very good job, especially Smith, there simply is no cure for a bad script once in production. The film really was a "sequel" form sensations, playing with partial events of the first film. The story was, in a word ... is bad at best. It was not thought out well, and seemed to be very choppy and incoherent at times. <br /> <br /> In the first film, the MIB organization was a kind of "elite" strength of feeling. You've had a few special agents, and it was "underground" kind of feel to it. In the sequel, MIB organization has JROTC Summer Camp vibe. <br /> <br /> The film was not scared or anything .. it's just not enough "coolness" (for lack of a better phrase) from the first movie. Much of the old humor processed from first to second, and really adds to the originality IIB Universe. <br /> <br /> complete analogy is Episode 1 in the first 3 movies. It was a decent? Yes. It is worth bearing this name? Not really.
