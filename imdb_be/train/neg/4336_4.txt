I watched this movie and original Carlitos way back to the back. The difference between these two disgusting. Now I know what people will say that the prequel was made on a small budget, but who never had anything to do with a bad script. Now maybe it's just me, but I always thought that the prequel was made to go to establish another film starring the key characters and possibly filling a bit of life that we do not know. Rise to power a film that has the name of Carlito. There must be at least a few characters from the original film, the ending does not make sense in relation to the original. At the end of the movie, he goes with his sweet heart, but how the hell do we get him out of jail in the next film? And his woman is not even the same woman, he says, as his only love in the original. I would say that the film is mildly entertaining in itself, with a few decent bits, but it pales when held up to his older brother. I not sleep at night waiting to see it, to see the original one more time, if you really need a hit.
