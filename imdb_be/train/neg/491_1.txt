As already mentioned, this film criminally inaccurate in its portrayal of the artist's life, and I for one was very annoyed and offended ... it turning it rape in a tragic love story, in the sense that her rapist was responsible for the "awakening her talent" of his total disregard for its work, by the way turned her into a sex object, and you get the idea. In addition, I believe that the concern is that people who are not familiar with Zhentileskami will see this movie and go with a native impression of her.
