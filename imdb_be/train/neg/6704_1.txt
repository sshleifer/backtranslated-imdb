it's just awful "comedy" - is actually a bad film. NO funny elements. NO jokes that funny. I do not know how some people can qualify for this sad little film can be "smart" or "quality". It can be when it is the only film that people have seen how you can make this requirement brothers. but I have seen thousands of the best movies, namely: Leonard Part Six (now that's funny)! I do not know, like brothers even considered the right to be listed in the database of movies database. Internet: its a home video than the actual movie <br /> <br /> jokes aside, just skip this movie. the root canal is more pleasant that this pad riveted not funny material.
