This is a movie that makes you say 2 things ... 1) I can do much better than this (acting, writing and direction) 2) it is so bad, I have to leave a review and warn the other ... <br /> < br /> it looks as though it was shot with my flip video. I also believe, my friend, who told me to see this has a vendetta against me. I have noticed that there are some positive messages for this home video; They should be left to the crew members or people with something to do with this film. 3 One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I hope the writers and director to leave the business. even talented enough to make advertising !!!!!
