If you want to watch a movie, which surprisingly shot, strangely enough light, strange stories of these men (and one woman) who enjoy beating the crap out of each other, if you want to enjoy the story goes nowhere these two guys, one boxer and one gay, then you should watch this movie. <br /> <br /> After watching this film, I almost felt like a bruised and cut, as director (film) to beat the hell out of me. <br /> <br /> This movie where one is not intended to follow the plot or for more action, this is a movie to watch in horror and amazement. A lot like watching a plane crash or a train wreck. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie, a good movie, "B" movie, or even a mediocre film, this film is not so. <br /> <br /> a warning to all who watch this movie, please do not eat beforehand. You might want to throw up before the end of the film.
