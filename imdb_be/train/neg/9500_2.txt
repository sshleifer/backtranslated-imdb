This movie is really bad. Actions clearly awful, except Michael Ironside. I do not understand this story. Richard Creek is the only survivor after a fight between the two MC-gangs. He is coming to town, and suddenly he choosened fight against bad people who want to Indo-land. On the cover, he said that he was an Indian himself, which also returned his hometown, I have not heard that in a movie, if it was not clear. <br /> <br /> Richard Creek was one hell of a bad actor. Hard and ugly. He said that his line, as it is too. And we will not talk about Sean Young, she hasn Â»were any of my favorite actors, but in this movie she plays Indian woman, falls in love with a bolt (GRIECO). It's terrible. <br /> <br /> When I removed it, I chose between this and Tricks with Amanda Pays. I chose this one from Michael Ironside was in a cast. Maybe I should have Subterfuge. <br /> <br /> If you do not see this, if you do not think Richard Creek looks tough on a motorcycle with glasses. <br /> <br /> I quickly uptade the cast list, because I have it at home. I wrote it after I saw the movie.
