This is similar to what the title of this thread says. Only, I got the impression from this film is that the Marlee Matlin character was always angry, so cynical and so touching. the first date of her character with the character of William Hurt, where they danced, were silent. In general, I was trying to finish watching the movie four times, and four times I fell asleep. I would continue to watch this film with one purpose ... to beat my problem with insomnia, because all do it, it put me to sleep. Sweet dream.
