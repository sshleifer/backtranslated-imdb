I can not believe I spent five hours of my life on this stuff. The previous day, five offer by this author was very enjoyable, and I'm really looking forward to it. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Sulfur Jones was the main culprit, as it is or muttering or gabbled her lines, but most of the rest of the cast from her example. Exceptions were Bernard Hill and Ann Reed, old stagers whose diction was exemplary. There are manufacturers do not listen to the production before they go on the air to make sure that the dialogue can be heard? In the end, I guess I lost track of what is going on, and since the original story line seemed to metamorphose into a standard it-and-us thing between Muslims and the rest, I soon lost interest. The ending was full of anti-climax. Complete dud.
