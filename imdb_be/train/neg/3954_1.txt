ALL MOVIE is a retrospective of the first film Boogeyman and, for unknown reasons, the frames of the other Ulli Lommel / Suzanna Love Brainwaves film. It is framed with some more modern (since the beginning of the 90s anyway) footage is sad, bad acting and cheap shot. Moreover, the film is almost entirely Flashbacks, they repeat the same memories throughout the film. Thus, you see recycled footage over and over again, as if you have not seen it already. As if the originals were not bad enough. I've never seen the film so laid .... Someone milking the last dollar out of these films. Total rip-off. And talk about addition ... why I have to write 10 lines about this garbage? If I can tell you that it is garbage in 2 lines, which should be enough.
