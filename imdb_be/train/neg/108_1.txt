Pros: for Nothing <br /> <br /> Cons: All <br /> <br /> So Plot :. Female reporter working on a journey, who tells her stories about the death of people who were killed by zombies <br /> <br /> Review: Never in my life I came across a movie, like a bad zombie chronicles. Filmed on a budget that looks something like 20 bucks, TZC absolutely awful horror film, which is based on the lame, forgetable actors who could not act to save his life and blood that is more complete than scary. How to get even made a film like this? Simply put, avoid TZC as a sexually transmitted disease <br /> <br /> My last 2 cents :. Funny enough, this film a movie company called Brain Damage Films was made. They should really have been damaged brains to come up with craptacular movie like this <br /> <br /> My rating :. 1 of 10 (if it were up to me, this film will get a negative rating bajillion)
