The poor will rollover in his grave if he could have it is horiible German TV adaptaion his classic play. It is obvious that very little money was spent on it. Stage riser, fashion shows and some randomly spaced bars takes place in a set. The film was ineptly dubbed into English, with English voice actors sometimes muttering his lines. All production was incredibly dark and lonely for him. And just where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway? MST3K gave this sad production to treatment is fairly deserved. <br /> <br /> To be or not to be? I want this film has never been in the first place.
