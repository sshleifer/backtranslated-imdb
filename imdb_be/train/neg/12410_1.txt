This film was seriously awful. The action was the worst! It was worse than a student film. Super cheesy, and I think that the worst actor was an old woman. At first I thought, well, it's an old movie. Then I remembered that this is not an excuse! I have seen old movies is the best way to act and such. <br /> <br /> The music was terrible. It was really changing. Editing was poor (most of the dialogue was out of sync.) <br /> <br /> In general, this film does not deserve even 1 I only watched because I was so sad, and the film is unlikely to entertain me. It was ridiculous. left pinky finger of my late grandmother could do better movie than that.
