The plot includes 7EVENTY 5IVE college kid who played a cruel game phone that unexpectedly (for them, if not horror fans) get them in over their heads. The story of 7EVENTY 5IVE, on the other hand, is that the horror film, which was a little cherished unfortunately outweigh really bad writing. <br /> <br /> What could be fun, if a bit silly, old-fashioned slasher tale derailed early from their erroneous belief filmmakers that the audience will enjoy watching a bunch of loud, whiny rich kids whine at each other on for most of the running time of the film. Except for the police detective played by Rutger Hauer, (a minor role, which is basically just add the power of movie stars), each symbol on the screen of another breed of young A-hole. <br /> <br /> A man and woman, black and white, straight and gay, the entire ensemble of small and piercing college kids have the main part of the narrative of the film. Worse, as the tale has to do with the party game gone awry, most of the time the scene is completely filled with these little ***** to DC. Because of this, there are a few breaks for the viewer, who has to put up with angry snipers with finely drawn characters. Although at least some of these people, presumably friends, always all the characters interact in a very hostile, long before the real conflict actually occurred. This leads to the worst possible outcome in a slasher :. The public is designed to take care of leads, not only cheers on an anonymous assassin, but wants him to come to start grabbing at blank mischief much earlier <brie /> <br /> real shame this poor characterization is what otherwise 7EVENTY 5IVE actually have some potential. Visually, this is normal. First-time director Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor knows how to build a mood of anxiety. They also were able to deliver some competent when rare moments of classic 80s style parched. Surprisingly, the production cast is also quite a state. This is not what the actors are not able to express a realistic human emotions; it's just that the script (co-written with brand new Vashon Nutt and director of the hooks that have lived much better camera than with a keyboard) lacks such moments. <br /> <br /> 7EVENTY 5IVE can hardly be recommended, as its familiar premise and a few thrills may not outweigh the bad taste of the remaining stories, which are contained in a flock of nasty characters. In cool whodunnit, a real mystery why someone has to take care of a group of young folk who can not even manage to love each other.
