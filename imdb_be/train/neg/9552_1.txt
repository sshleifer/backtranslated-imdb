Simply plain old stupid. <br /> <br /> I mean really stupid, not good as foolish killer tomatoes or Ed Wood movie, it's probably the stupidest movie I've ever seen. To give the film the golden Turkey is an insult to the turkeys. To call this film is offensive even dumb stupid people. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of American cinema and the arts we can better to really start world war 3 and 4, at the same time and let the cockroaches run the show after. <br /> <br /> Now I have to drink, to wash this insult my only Braincell off .... <br /> <br /> This is a really good movie, if you commit suicide.
