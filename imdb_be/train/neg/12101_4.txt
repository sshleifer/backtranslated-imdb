I saw it, I agree with him 100%, but I did not care about his delivery. He just came out like an asshole in a bad edit, fetched juvenile smear campaign. Edit cuts galore, etc ... The camera will focus on it, and you'll see 2 or 3 edited cuts only for a minute or two of dialogue. Add in the constant boom microphone in the camera frame, which is not a film, no. <br /> <br /> This film strikes a theme with so many angles, so many interesting stories that the film is just so easy to do on a collection of religious fanatics, as the collection is delayed on the child. It is so easy it's just wrong. I mean, how hard it is to make these people look like a nut bags? That they contradict themselves, you just let them read a poem or two longer. I love it when he pulled back forth between people of the same religion, and showed them completely contradicts himself. <br /> <br /> I just think that he could do something a little more creative. Part of a neurologist to talk about brain never concretized. It might be interesting to show the brain scans of people during religious seizures compared to the drug, or sex, or ???? He could play more on women of all rejoicing on the Passion play, which is more like a snuff scene in the new Rob Zombie movie. More could go down in history, John Smith, the founder of the Mormon, which had quite a colorful past. Immerse yourself in the science VS religion. One of them is very methodical, very strict process to improve the credibility of the theory. It relies on the solid bottom up, a new layer on top of a layer proved. The huge burden of proof is required every step of the path. The other starts from the top and down to the indisputable requirements. This is because what is good ?? That's what I said. <br /> <br /> Everything is done correctly ?? I'd say turn it into an HBO original series ?? I hit another religion every week. <br /> <br /> This sensational on the other. I must have been blind. Good ole ... no wonder G.W.Bush, that he was not elected. He had a religious majority. And well ... now that the blind leading the blind. <br /> <br /> Bill Moyer .. Well .. what can I expect from a man who gives to the Sutra in Newport Beach?
