I love Bhai MBBS Mann, but «Lagge Raho ...» SUX does eq. I have never seen such a sad movie in my entire life. And these high ratings really surprised me, what happened wool taste of Indian cinema audience ?? <br /> <br /> ** BE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> An educated girl needs advice from Bhai, people discuss their personal Island. The handset comes in the person with a part of the world in the P ??? I agree that the films have to be fictional, but these things are really indigestible. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10. (2 stars for 15 minutes starting well)
