This film makes you accurately assess the invention fast button on the remote control. This exquisite longing in beautiful photos. This time, Hamilton is relatively easy on the soft focus shots. However, what I found hard to take for the film was the fact that, although Andrew Jester was about 19 when he was shot girls are portrayed much younger than they actually are. This whole Lolita thing especially have an elderly man attached leaves me very uneasy. The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic region, to make her look even younger than she is. Come on, good sex last time between adults. Another thing that I was surprised that neither Bear nor Sch√ºte have a nude scene in the film, well, not the actual one, at least.
