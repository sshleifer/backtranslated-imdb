Customers who have rated this film is so high simply have not seen a lot of good films to compare it with. Are they brainwashed all ?? I have rarely felt so disappointed with the film, and some that should be associated with ridiculous hype surrounding this film. <br /> <br /> From the first BU's just chase movie. We choose it at the end of a chase and go straight to another. And another. And another. And another. Do you see a pattern there? There's virtually no time "wasted" on the plot, character development, or the boring old reality. <br /> <br /> If you do not see the other two films Bourne, you are very lost. If you have - you just want to, you were lost. - somewhere far from the cinema <br /> <br /> indifferent style Paul Greengrass worked exceptionally well on United 93, which was desperate mood overload happens, but Bourne and his endless trouble it just has the effect of removing the audience from the nature of the participation. It works. He jumps. It strikes. He swells. He clears his high-rise buildings. Poison chatter. First of all - it survives. It survives as the plastic man survives, which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls more and more lethargic and lacking in any tension. So he drives off a building? So what? He will survive. He. <br /> <br /> There's a girl who was involved in the love, because the interest Bourne died in the pre-incarnation, but it's just decoration. I've seen more depth of character and spirited dialogue in episodes of Captain Scarlet. <br /> <br /> The Bourne own journey of self-discovery literal dull and formless, and tells us nothing we do not know from the first film. He was transformed into a killing machine. Big deal. He finds his true identity. So what? It has no emotional resonance, when it comes. <br /> <br /> «rotation» ending wired and weak. Oh dear, the more I think about this movie the more I hate him! I've cut his lead to 4 at the time of writing this comment! I'd rather be now, until the end of the slide continues. <br /> <br /> I love a good action movie, and I love a good thriller. Bourne Ultimatum is neither. It's loud, tedious series of flashy edits, silly sound effects and cartoon violence. <br /> <br /> The idea is that it points the way "to the franchise Bond shit. Casino Royale blows it out of the water.
