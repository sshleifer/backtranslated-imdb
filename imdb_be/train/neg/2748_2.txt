this film only gets the second star, because I work in the city center, and loved to see him destroyed. effects were fairly well- I heard it was the most expensive Korean film ever made. being the most expensive and quite disgusting do is a massive waste of money. I take it, so I will not complain too much about what I paid, but it was a couple of hours, I'll never go back. plot holes abound. terrible acts across the board. I do not recommend to abandon the time to watch this movie, life is too short. If your friends want to look at it, run away. I can not stress enough how bad this film was. <br /> <br /> where the hell is the second dragon come from? why he was not before? they have rocket launchers on dinosaurs just 500 years ago?
