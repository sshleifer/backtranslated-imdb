I do not know where to start. Tara Reid has to be stopped before it goes in another film. Stephen Dorff looks like he's got the motivation of his character with Val Kilmer in the «Top Gun». Slater sleepwalks through this dreck. Direction, editing, sound (do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of a firefight?), Costumes (vests with muscles on them), and hey, there is no discernible portion of either. It surprises me that no one attached to the project is not stopped, and said, "Hey, guys, it just does not make sense, let's start." Hopefully career Slater can rebound from this disaster. <br /> <br /> Hands down the worst movie I have ever seen.
