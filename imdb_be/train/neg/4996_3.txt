I really enjoyed the first half hour of the film, but, wow, it is to be trite, or should I say, "just stupid." This is just another example of the legacy of humor. Perhaps it was funny, in 1940, but not now .... not even close. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell always fun to watch. I especially liked it as soon as he began shifting his boyish looks and high voice musicals of Busby Berkeley, where he is a mature and it sounds too. <br /> <br /> He was handsome, like "Jimmy MacDonald," but the rest of the cast was just playing stupid characters, in the worst case be the boss (Raymond Walburn) with Maxford House Coffee Company, which has done nothing but cry constantly . It was hard to hear and was a great damage to the film.
