I just give it three, because he did what my friends and I had hoped it would do: entertain. <br /> <br /> I was not stupid enough to take it off thinking it would be a zombie movie there with the likes of Romero and Fulci, but what I shot it was a laugh. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie for entertainment or a movie, so you shaking your head in confusion, go for it. This is perfect for fans of Junior «Mystery Science Theater», but the only drawback is that it's so bad, it makes fun of itself. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it's a shame to associate it with any other Hollywood title that we can know, because when a film of sludge as it is, it has its own genre.
