This is not a bad film ... but it's your girlfriend's style makes you look. History is not bad .... it just makes one and a half hours, it seems so long. It's hard for me to trash this film, because I really like the idea of ​​it, but it was only a long and thin on the history ... too bad. The main character never really seems to have changed all that much from start to finish. I mean something goes through the "life changing", and it can only break a smile. I really thought that Mack was really good. Its amazing quirkiness kept the film from being a complete disaster. Maybe I just do not "get" this film. If anyone can explain to me, I would like to be informed.
