I still read a negative review of this film professional. I believe that I had missed something. Start intriguing, the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other fictional stories. This is the best part. After three go their separate ways, the film is divided into three streams. This is when boredom sets in. Of course, the thread with Felliniesque grandmothers who make doll with chewed bread first open their eyes curiosity. Unfortunately, the director beat this to death, even the injection of wild storyline that leads nowhere in particular. Result: The two-hour plot thin lethargy. If you suffer from insomnia, to see him in bed, and you'll have a good night's sleep.
