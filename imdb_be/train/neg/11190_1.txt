First of all, I must say that I have worked on blockbuster and saw a lot of movies to the point it tough for me to find something I had not seen. With this in mind, I want everyone to know that this film was the worst film ever made, it's made me miss Gigli, daughter of my boss, and any other piece of junk you've ever seen. BeLyt should be in your mind, I only found one person who loved her, and they could not even tell me what the movie was about. If you can decipher this film and be able to tell me what it was about, you must either be a writer or a fortune-teller, because there is any other way in which man could understand that shit. <br /> <br /> FOR LOVE GD away!
