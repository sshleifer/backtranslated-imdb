At first glance, the plot of the slogan, I figured it might be a decent movie. Could I ever not so? The beginning of the film makes it look like a bunch of freaks got together and decided to make a low budget film. During the first 10 minutes you will not notice a cheesy action, terrible sound and the god-awful special effects, but then it gets worse. Only about 20 minutes into it, I asked myself: "What is the story again," I could only ask this question, if I had not been destroyed laughed from pure lameness of this film. The main actor has one plant for emotion, and he sticks to it throughout the film, despite the fact that he had to go through love and hate, and everything in between. Flashback scene almost made me vomit, because it made me relive one extra minute of footage from earlier in the film. Now we were in the middle of the film where they are clearly trying to rip Morpheus from "The Matrix", although he does a terrible job. Talking about the actor's "Star Wars" and Biscuits phrase almost unbearable. Currently, at the end of the movie that you do not understand, it's the end of the film, because you really think the story finally develops. The "Morpheus" is dying, the only good thing about the film. He utters a few words and credits roll. What is it? No plot, bad acting, cheesy all this can not be worse. Please, if you value human decency, Do not watch this movie!
