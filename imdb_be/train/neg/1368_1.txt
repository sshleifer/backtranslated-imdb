One is the highest rating, I would give this film, given the zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Urine yew, pointless mess of a movie with a lot of wasted B-list actors who have done a better job, written and directed by a guy with the mentality of a twelve year old, who grins and giggles silly puns and feed and fart jokes, for example, Gene Stapelton in (Ding -Bat by everyone in the family) the nature, the character of Mary Henner reporting that it was "swinging in both directions" sexy was a cheap attempt at humor indicative overall lameness film ... you want good, cheeky humor? Rent Animal House, American Pie (only the first part), Old School or Office Space.
