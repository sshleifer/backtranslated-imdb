"Diary sex addict" pathetic attempt to serious drama about sexual obsession. Perhaps the film marketing scam, this film is a stylish shoot with a good cast and a bit more going for it. As a result, "The Diary of ..." would have us believe that our sex addict character has a dull wife in the world, babies stables on the side, who have nothing better than to give up her panties for him at his whim, and there is no work despite the fact restaurateur. At best, this film could be a good drama. At worst, cheap erotica. "Diary ..." is not like anywhere in between. This is for the dumpster. (D-)
