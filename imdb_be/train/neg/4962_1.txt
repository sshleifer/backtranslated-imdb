99.999% pure crap. And the second + 0.001% was a brief moment when I thought that blonde chick is going to undress. No. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was legendarily bad. Action sucked, and there was no sex (from blonde chick dressed modestly mentioned above, unfortunately, the entire film). CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I've ever seen on film, and anachronisms are numerous and outrageous. The acting was mediocre even Ben Cross and Syrtis, the only "name" in this movie. And Syrtis looked very, very bad. <br /> <br /> I've seen high school plays a more skillful production. This kind of film that MST has flourished. Leaders must roll in the Sci-Fi to enable this steaming pile on the air.
