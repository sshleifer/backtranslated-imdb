This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was going to get up and go to the tape 4, but I'm stuck. Now I consider myself Masochist! Afghanistan? Come on, guys! Who is the idiot who forgot to hide the billboards in Sanskrit? I thought that the lead actor (George Calil) was particularly inappropriate. Besides the bad acting and more careful of camera shake, I thought, using 9/11 as the reason to do Â«Larson frantic blows, the whole screen near you" disgraceful and disrespectful to the victims of 9/11. Using a phone call from his wife Larson, Sarah, supposedly from one of the terrorists carried out the aircraft on that day was terrible. Camera shake does not make me feel sick that cold heart stuntman did.
