Well ....... unlike other comments previously written, I have to say that the only good thing about this film is that one guy in this looked a bit like Jason Donavon who reminded me of my youth. I have no idea how he won any awards, and although I'm sure a lot of effort it took to create it was fruitless, as the end result, which is one of the cries of the early 90 foreign soap operas. The plot was nonexistent, film was hopeless, and the effect was at the same level on the output level. This, unfortunately, for a long time and the sub-plots were incredibly unreal .... for example .... if your best friend slept with ex-boyfriend of 6 years after only 2 weeks after you have broken up would not all still best friends. It's all fantasy. That's all! Oh yeah, and the terrible 90-home / soft core Indy mind was staggering!
