Despite the presence of some of the interesting (and bold) sequence, NBTN just never gets going. There exploding boat, hat pin the murder, mass suicides, pathologists with body parts and all kinds of classic scenes mystery / horror, but they are interspersed with long periods of pure exposition. Everything in the film looks bored. It's a shame, because many of the sequences will be considered bold at the time it was filmed. <br /> <br /> Add to that "too rightÂ» Brit characters, and you feel like you're drifting in Sherlock Holmes movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the cinema is very common. There are many opportunities for beautiful shots in the countryside, or complex shots someone pulls in a large fire, but the thing is, prosaic and dull. <br /> <br /> Definitely only for Lee and Cushing fans.
