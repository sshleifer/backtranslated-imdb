Not even the most ardent fan of puppets, perhaps as in the film, (I is one of them) are simply puppets do not give any material to work with. It's really a shame, too, because it's the only feature film made puppet of Coeur, and this one force them painfully unfunny when he could have great potential. Terrible musical numbers do not help either. Short they did with the same name, has more laughter.
