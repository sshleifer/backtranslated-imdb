This film is just an excuse for a writer to make a film with 2 failed scenario. <br /> <br /> his characters are just a collection of characters from the clich√© tragic or comical attributes total that such a dialogue only neurotic Woody Allen could write. woman likes it because it is looking in the mirror, so that they will enjoy this film, probably, <br /> <br /> This movie did not use me, however, as there was not a single car chase, and the film did not have any fighting. There were also no drug lords or the Bangers gang. Not to mention the lack of snakes. This film did not have any snakes. Not my cup of tea and maybe not your broadcast to think about what I said, before you find yourself watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you do not like a male person has a weight problem questions, enjoy sex and urban and ally McBeal then it makes sense for you.
