Brainless film about good form, but brainless couples who have decided to live their dream and take people on diving trips. The pair almost immediately make the wrong choice of customers and confuse some people, trying to recover items that we see falling on the ocean floor during the opening sequence of credits. Large looking straight to video film could have been much better if he was not so interested in the first place look good. Representations are correct and the story is actually not a bad thing, or would be the director and producers entirely redirected plot in making sure that we see many slim people in bathing suits (or the fact that I believe that the cause of the "non-ranking" nickname a few fleeting bare breasts ). The film never generate any voltage or rises above the level you forget television movie. If you get an awkward position to see it, you will not break your eyes, as eye candy is nice but we really need to stop manufacturers and make movies, what are the reasons to have a paid holiday.
