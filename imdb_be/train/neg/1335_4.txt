This film was strange !! (Not quite as good as a masterpiece Longshot Leif Garrett), but still strange !! I thought Ashley looked Freakin 'huge compared to Mary-Kate in the film. I wonder why. Who woulda thought that they could vyklyuchtel places like that and almost get away with it. Dad was kind of a jerk, though my mother was a little too friendly with Helmit Head. I put 4. Anyone who loves this film shoudl check the Longshot.
