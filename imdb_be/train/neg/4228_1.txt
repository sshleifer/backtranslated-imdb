I can not believe how bad this piece of garbage! I want my $ 3.99 back! Words defy description of this poorly made piece of shit! Duplication in any way or any form coincided with the mouths of the actors. The film looks like it was filmed with a video camera vintage 1970s. I shot the best films with my camera cell phone. Gore funny because stupid incredible story. Act is what you would expect if you call all your friends over in the afternoon on Saturday and proceeded to completely severed, and then tried to put the game in your garage. Do not get me wrong ... I did not expect that O'Neill and I love zombie movies, but the production values ​​are so low in this film to make it unwatchable. Avoid!
