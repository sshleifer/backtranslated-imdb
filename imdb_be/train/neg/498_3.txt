I saw this film when I was much younger, and I thought it was interesting. I saw it again last week, and you can guess the outcome. Some funny parts in it, and very little for too long. Start is the only thing that is funny, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> If you want a complete b-movie, it's a good choice, but do not expect too much from foreigners size of dwarf
