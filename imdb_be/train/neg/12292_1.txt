We brought this film as a joke for a friend, and could have been our worst joke to play. The film is almost watchable, and the effect is terrible. Poor child actor ever used and Hasslehoff giving poor-quality work. The plot is shameful and at points we were so sad, we were wondering what the hell was going on. He aspires to be a terrible place, but this is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Just awful
