Being a fan of slasher, I usually osyadu to keep track of each slash film that passes over my retina that sometimes do more harm than good my brain, and I will speak. While channel surfing at night, Sleepaway Camp II was crossed with me. Of course, I wanted to check it out, as I have heard of a franchise Sleepaway Camp, but never actually seen any of them (shame, I know). I note that since I have not seen the original, my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously because, perhaps, what I think is wrong with it is quite deliberate design their own franchise. <br /> <br /> Now, I believe that the franchise sleeping camp itself, the joke on himself. Heck, even the name comes off as a deliberate joke. Sleep camp? It's good fun. I can appreciate the movie for those who simply want to collect something for the pure value of the horrors of the camp, but it's about as far as I can go. To act in this film made the original cast of Friday 13 to watch as thespians that make the implementation of Macbeth. Campy requires bad act, but come on. Pamela Springsteen as evil is tone-with-reality killer did a better job kills my interest than it kills the whole cast. As for the comedy goes, there were a few times when I chuckled, but it was few and far apart. <br /> <br /> In the end, the NCC II rather boring, and I really want to wake the camp. Death is so obviously staged and fake, that you can scarcely appreciate them. If you are looking for a slasher comedy with a good camp, I recommend Club Dread. If your channel surfing takes you through this, check and see what else is on.
