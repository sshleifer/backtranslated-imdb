I really do not know where to start. Acting in this movie was pretty scary, I can not remember seeing so many "actors" in the same film, which had been unable to act. Not only the action was bad, the characters were incredibly stupid as well. <br /> <br /> Then there is action. I believe that even children know that when someone gets shot, there's blood involved. But if someone gets shot in Snitch'd ten (!!) times, there is no blood at all. Well, I guess that's just me. <br /> <br /> To make a long story short (because, believe me, I can go for hours about this film), it is, without doubt, the worst film I've ever seen . This film should be number 1 in the bottom 100 without a doubt.
