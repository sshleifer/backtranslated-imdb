I must admit that I liked the first half of the sleepers. He looked good, the effect was even better, the story of his childhood, the pain and vengeance was interesting and moving. Gorgeous Hollywood movie. But ... No one talked about it until now (at least in the last 20 comments) when he came into the courtroom scenes and Brat Pitt's character followed his plan to save his two friends, who are rightly accused of murder, I I felt cheated. This film insulted my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Warning spoilers !! <br /> <br /> Why would anyone take them a false alibi, certified by a priest? If these two guys were with him, why should not they talk about it during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were a judge or member of the jury, do you believe? It is reasonable to give the motif of the killer get away? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but, in the end, the story is very weak, and it angers me. This film has a lot of potential. 4/10
