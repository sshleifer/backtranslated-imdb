There were only two things that kept me interested in this film: I was expecting Owen Wilson to die, and Catherine Zeta-Jones <br /> <br /> It was basically a one woman show .. Catherine Zeta-Jones was only there to provide eye candy. Liam Neeson was completely wasted in this film. Like Jones, he did not have any role. The film was all Lili Taylor (Ransom, ready-made garments). She was the only one which had any real part in this shoddy script, David Self. Well, it was his first one, and he shall redeem himself Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> I do not know that the problem is directed by Jan de Bont was. He did a great job with speed and Twister. he really fell at work here. Maybe he's still recovering from a disaster Speed ​​2: Cruise Control. He should thank his lucky stars for The Wild Wild West, as this would be the worst picture of one thousand nine hundred ninety-nine <br /> <br /> Avoid any price.
