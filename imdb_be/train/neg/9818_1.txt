This film raises a number of pressing questions in my mind. Firstly, as has Jennifer Tilly managed to keep a film acting career over the years, based on this ridiculous squeaky voice and a very limited range of facial expressions she hires Hammy? Secondly ... what on earth were the people responsible for the creation of this offensive and deeply repellent film thinking? And third ... given that there were people perverted enough to decide to do dreck like this, should not there be someone in the system - studios, distributors, or somewhere - quite sane to prevent it at the actually get completed and released, you really have to look very, very long way to be another film as deeply contrary to how it is ... and not even billed as a horror film - which, since it can be considered as belonging to kakoy- a legitimate film genre, it certainly is. The film rolls from beginning to end the madness, violence and ill-treatment in a patient, and has little or no saving at all functions. I actually do not favor censorship (which I do not believe) ... but I really can not see how someone could easily make something positive of watching a movie like this.
