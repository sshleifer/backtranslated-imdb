That's the only question I was left with. Why is this movie suck so much when he was such a great cast? Why is writing so badly, he left the audience completely unrelated to the characters? Why it does not make any sense at all? Why studio take very good premise and "Hollywood" the hell out of him when all this had to be good, reasonable speaking stories? Why? I will never understand why the movies that start with a nice twist in the pile of shit by the time they are released. I hope that for the sake of Freeman Spacey, who is an Oscar winner, it will never be released on the big screens in the United States. <br /> <br /> As someone that has a bachelor's degree in journalism, the whole story is just completely ridiculous. I just ... I think that the script had potential, but the execution turned it into a cliche and terrible in this. Just. No.
