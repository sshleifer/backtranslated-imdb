After watching for about half of this film, I noticed something special ... I found myself constantly switch through TV channels to see what else is on the -. Not really a good movie features <br /> <br /> This film is counted as being in a number of genres, and I must say that it is basically not possible misserably in each of them. 80% through the movie, I shifted to look old repetition instead. The result - the whole movie felt as if those that do not know him exactly what to do and end up in the brew without a great taste.
