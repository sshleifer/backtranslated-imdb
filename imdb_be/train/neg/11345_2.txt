I mean the word "pedestrian". It seems that the producers of the film have forgotten to have something interesting to happen. Faith Domergue can do better than that. It has to be a mysterious, vengeful goddess Cobra torn love for Marshall Thompson (have an idea, eh?). Instead, it is the usual b-be housewife of fifty, and the only flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think that they took it all early in the morning, before the faith was her coffee. As for the other actors, they are all so seriously "all-American" what a funny result. This is the land more productively covered Lewton in «The Cat People». I think "The Cult of the Cobra" should really be called "The Cult of the contractual obligation." Why else would so many talented people, otherwise sleepwalking their way, although clumsy, predictable, derivative failures like this?
