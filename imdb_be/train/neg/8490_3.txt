It was a nice try something, but it is too pretentious and boring to go higher, this low budget entanglement. The use of virtual sets almost works, but in some places it fails miserably. They make good use of a small budget, I think. I just want to make history, and most of the action is better. There are a lot of parts where you see that they wanted to, and it would of been nice if they actually got these marks, but they do not. Mixing and incredible story. Bad DVD translation too. It does not take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting. This I had to turn off. It was too boring. I can do slow films. But just to make them attractive in some respects. Visually, history-wise, acting, etc. It is not enough in all departments, so there is never summed up with an exciting experience. Maybe the next attempt will be better filmmaker.
