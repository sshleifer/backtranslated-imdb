I have no words. This film was very difficult to observe, and in retrospect, I really wish I did not. Although I did not try to sit through it to the end credits, I must admit that I could not last more than an hour, so my opinion may be unfair. However, this film requires a very impressive third final in the history of film-making in order to give an overview, which is nothing but vicious. <br /> <br /> Please do not refer to any part of this film,
