There is a bit of sad to see someone who is so good to do something to try and do something completely different ... and ultimately mediocre. I thought about Jordan played baseball, but the same goes for Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This film is well acted and directed, but the script is a bitch. Martin did a great job adapting the classic story into a comedy in «Roxanne», but it is an effort to bring modern Victorian drama scene smacks right into the wall implausibility. If you want to see the old story was updated with a certain style, it is better to lease, "Great Expectations."
