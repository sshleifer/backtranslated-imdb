I knew I was going to see a low-budget film, but I was expecting a lot more from Alex Cox film. The actions of the two leading men were terrible, especially the white guy. The girl should win an Oscar in comparison with these two. This film was completed, I think it would be inside jokes for the film industry people and some other jokes that I actually understood and made me laugh out loud, which is rare. Without these laugh out loud moments, I would give this film 2/10. What happened with Alex Cox, who made all the classic 80s <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> There were a few issues that I had after the film was completed. Why Mexican guy to go to the house of the other guy in the beginning? His daughter says he got 100 people fired from your last job? Why did she beat her own material, if she was angry at him? I guess I was supposed to go to the Q & A after the film, but I do not want to get up at 10 o'clock in the morning.
