I never liked the movie Mayr, tho I appreciate how he pushed the envelope in Hollywood at the time. Of course the suit Ms. Welch has become a cult, although I have to wonder if a lot of people who recognize the image actually seen the movie and know that it was all - <br /> <br /> I rewatched Mayr on FMC couple of years ago and did not think that he is the best age in years. There's a segment of it in the comics sexploitation film history of cartoons, where he gave proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then a flagrant production. However, IMHO, the film is too bitter to be charming, too stupid to be included, and so busy trying to shock, that he can not communicate, engage, entertain, or ---
