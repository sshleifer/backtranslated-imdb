It scared the hell out of me when I was a teenager. Now, I find it more fun than scary, but with some pretty disturbing moments and with some raunchy quality to it that I like. And, if you think about it, the story is quite disgusting actually ... but treated with some taste. If there is a problem with this film is that there are huge gaps where there is nothing interesting or interesting. In addition, the end goes on forever, making the culmination of a potentially tense seems silly after a while with Barbara Bach yelling and screaming. 'Monster', after it is exposed, not scared or temporary. Several monotonous look of the film also works against it, making it appear as a TV movie more than something done for theaters. But this is an example of films that are rare in our time, so I encourage horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic ...
