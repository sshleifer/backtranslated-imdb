I would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of waste unwatchable! There are movies that bad, but the worst kind are those unwatchable but suggest that, like them, because they have to be good for you! Sexual sequences, so shocking in the day, can not even call a rabbit. The so-called controversial policy of strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism. Bashfully arts film in the worst sense of the word. Photographing in the harsh grainy black-and-white. Some scenes from the focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call it art? <br /> <br />
