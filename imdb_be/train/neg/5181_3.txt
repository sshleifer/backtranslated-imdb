This is the first film I watched Horrorfest and after Im almost think that I have not seen any of the others. I was told that it for "thinking mans horror movie" and I must say that, when it had to make me think I shutter to think that the spray / Gore films in the collection will be. Do not get me wrong, not even blood in this film worth sitting through. <br /> <br /> The plot is very washed out too much art for art. The effects of camera and music most of the time ridiculous and banal characters, to say the least. Several characters and scenes seem to be useless in the end, when they begin to uncover some hooks "Hamilton". I knew who Lenny was about half an hour, when I saw the film. I was so confused and visually under whelmed by Lenny show that I felt completely ripped off. I expected what I got, but they could go much further, because all the gore falls completely flat. With movies there, like "Hostel" and "Saw", you need to come a little better for a film that "is considered too graphic or disturbing for a wide audience."
