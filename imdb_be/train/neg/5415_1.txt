Deal was a memorable movie that will bring on celluloid great director, Indra Kumar. The film follows a beta, Ishq, Raja and Masti all of which were excellent. <br /> <br /> But every successful director gives some scary movies Alongwith some hits too. Pyare Mohan is one of those films. <br /> <br /> While comedies speak beautifully, but then they can not laugh at the viewer. Comparing overlooking comedy films made today is nonsense. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see the film and laugh, please do not look at it. As pathetic comedy will make you cry alone. <br /> <br /> In short, the film should miss.
