I would like to say that curiosity got the better of me. If only I saw the trailer, I'd be able to tell you the whole story of the film; I could have saved myself the most senseless one hour and forty minutes of my life, and about twenty dollars. This film was a disaster waiting to happen, and it is a shame for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film shows bright ignorance of reality. For example, this child control car racing remote control goes throughout the county, and even part of the house. It's even covered by clothing. Is it not rational to believe that the remote can no longer transmit a signal in these circumstances? Hollywood obviously did not think so. The general logic of any electronics concept dictates the opposite; I doubt that a race car can even come out to the street, not to mention the house across the street. Another feature is the lack of unreal intelligence criminals possess. Why in all these films, these criminals rocket men, until they collide with the eight-year-old? The child is meant to be the smartest person in the movie, and not professional terrorists? Please, there is more reality in the Matrix. In addition, the leader puts his real gun and "accidentally" raises a plastic gun; apparently, he could not tell the difference. Even with gloves on, one should be able to do it. Just because they look just does not mean anything; there are other senses, the vision. Traps are unrealistic as well; if one of them actually worked, the criminals would have been dead. But Hollywood is going for us "laugh" in the "funny" results traps. I did not laugh; I sighed and rolled my eyes <br /> <br /> But, I recommend this film to anyone who thinks they have seen really bad movie. movie they saw, would seem, Citizen Kane compared to this. Otherwise, skip this for the sake of your pride. Home Alone 3 also raises the question. We all know, Alex D. Linz star in the film, but he wrote it, eh?
