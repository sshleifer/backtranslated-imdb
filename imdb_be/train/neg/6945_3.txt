Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) has a child killed and his wife angrily attacked the invasion of the house. Dr. Geller (Christopher Plummer) tries to help him through the post-traumatic stress. Then Archer finds himself faced with a man (Til Schweiger), bound and gagged on a chair. He said that the man who killed her child and attacked his wife, and he can do whatever he likes it. And there is a large assortment of tools out there to help him ... <br /> <br /> The film is interesting in the first (and shows a real restraint on blood and blood), but gets sillier per minute and has some very unlikely plot twists . It all ends in a final twist, which was so old and stupid, I was shocked someone is actually thinking about using it more. As such talented actors as Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer were involved in crap like that for me. It gets three stars for the action, but a silly story and really incredible twists make it a chore to sit through.
