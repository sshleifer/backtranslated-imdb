I think it's great empathy, the ability to Jack that makes it a powerful performer that he is, but empathy comes at a price, like all things, when he is surrounded by mediocrity he instinctively lowers the standard and become one with it. He is a joke, as a mafia hit-man (because the part does not suit him one bit, it being so extroverted) and just graze avoids a fool of yourself in this.Kathleen Turner was much tooooo long career as a high and whitish, because her acting ability is limited by the fact that she does with her eyes when she opened them wide, she persuaded sooooo damn sexy and Anjelica Huston is the absolute same (provided wondering) around, as well as Robert loggia . <br /> <br /> The film project is lame (and this is the only mention of the rags they call the script) from a gangster movie, with a cast that was probably only interested to get to the after-party faster (they are, of course gathered party elite gathers in it). What did they shoot him in 1 day? -Cause, that would be the only explanation.
