The writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story, but many of the shortcomings in the performance of the story took so much from the film to make it almost unwatchable. Key elements such as character development were silenced, at best. Discrepancies also raised their ugly heads. Massive house in the middle of the Irish countryside? Characters simply "show" in the garden during a stormy night (in a very convenient time, I might add)? In general, it was not "bad." I rated it 4, based mainly on the history and talent Alison Elliott.
