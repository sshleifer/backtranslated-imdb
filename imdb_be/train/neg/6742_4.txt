For romantic comedies, I often judge the quality of a film based on the nebula of my eyes until the end of the experience. Unfortunately for Â«The Wedding Date," I can appreciate only film with 4 out of 10 possible tears. <br /> <br /> My apologies to the fans Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I have not seen a lot of chemistry between their two characters. A prerequisite is the reverse of the film "Pretty Woman" with Dermot plays the role of Nicky, the high costs of the male escort hired by Debra nature of the K, to accompany her to England for the wedding of his sister. Romance presumably develops between patron and client. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And there was not enough romantic sparks flying in the relationship Nick and Kat. <br /> <br /> In a supporting role, Amy Adams was outstanding, as the sister of Kate. Whenever Amy came on the screen, it served as a spark plug and the energy of the film catalyst. Perhaps if Hey, Adams was cast in the role of Kat, the film might have had a greater dynamism. But, as it turned out, instead, to achieve a napkin, I was looking for Visine in an attempt to at least pretend that this film had some real feelings and romance.
