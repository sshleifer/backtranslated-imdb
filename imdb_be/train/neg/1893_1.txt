This film was very stupid when things started to happen. I could not care less about any of the characters; Susan Walters was so annoying, and lead actor (forgot his name) and got on my nerves. I can not remember exactly how it ended, and so on, but in general the idea of ​​foreigners owning human bodies and everything just seemed silly in the movie that is not quite bear. My father told me that this is stupid nd film ... I have to listen to him.
