The first half of this version was the best I have seen (and I think I've seen all versions of Jane Eyre ever did). Childhood development and the nature of Jane was exceptional. Then, it was as if someone said, "Oh, this is too long," and cracked the rest of the story to shreds. The main stage, when included at all, in silence, combined and put out of action in such a way that they completely change the story line. There was so little transition or even the development stage, it would be difficult for those who are not familiar with the story, even to follow. The big disappointment is that began openly so much hope, and then the end of the dotted it.
