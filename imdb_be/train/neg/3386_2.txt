Yes, I was lucky enough to see the long-running original production of the musical Michael Bennett. It was an amazing experience, and I paid to see the movie when it hit theaters in 1985 it's terrible. Almost all fail. Firstly, Attenborough (a fine actor, a good director with the right stuff) is a sorry choices - almost as bad as when John Huston was hired to cripple Ani. The camera is always in the wrong place - they chop up the songs and casting !!! They are terrible - the power play these dancers - the hungry, talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they can do, and when they got the chance - you could not take your eyes off them. But this cast only gets dancing, doing a "good" job of singing, but none of them will not cause one bit. In fact, look at throwing IMDb - none of them really did not go to do anything much. (Okay, okay, he married Janet Jones Gretzky - Sheesh). So this movie Trainwreck Sun catches per second magic, despair, passion for the musical. The general strike with! (Even if they try to drown out the music - great music is still rising at times, and reminds people how big score was).
