I think it's possible that I've seen worse movies, but it's a real bitch! the plot is not remarkable, but it was not the worst. Sun Directing no where close to what one would expect from ANDY Qing. it is capable of a good job, but do not pull the film together. <br /> <br /> Angie Harmon plays the female lead as a reporter dogging which is behind the assassination of the President actually butchered role. There was no chemistry with Gooding, her demeanor was flat and made of wood, and a 5-inch stiletto she wore throughout the film were absurd. Harmon is an outlet for its place firmly in the bottom of the list "B". <br /> <br /> and Cuba Gooding thinking ??? He has to his credit a number of outstanding performances, but it was far below what we've come to expect from him. <br /> <br /> Poor James forests and Burt Reynolds. poor poor poor poor poor.
