my friend bought it (very cheap) and decided to give it to me as a birthday present. I thought I would never see, because I knew it was a joke, and the cover of DVD types miserable, but then my friends and I got very sad, and watched it. from start to finish! I know a great achievement, but it is truly a masterpiece. it is difficult to describe. You should see it, it's a real lesson that people can, if they believe that they are creative and smart, and really are not. "Action" is a co-terrain vehicle (you can see the "leading lady" laugh in some cases, it is by far the worst). "History" is silly and really be summed up everything in this movie sucks. please pay special attention to the "sheriff". adult man, and this is absolutely no justification to participate in this. it is very bad as well. all that he had some funny moments. check it out haha
