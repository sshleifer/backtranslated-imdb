This film is a challenge for the film. I can not believe that he was even listed as a comedy - not funny. Not only is the brutal scenario, but the casting people should be shot. Gail O'Grady only a great actress, but other than that ... 99% of the rest of the cast ... Ouch. Almost all the others ... wow this is difficult even ... wow. That's the number one rule of comedy "I Do not try to be FUNNYÂ». There are a lot of very talented actors in Canada who can do comedy and drama - none of them were not used in the film. Canadian nepotism and casting director helped perpetuate poor shooting in Canada. I understand that technically the film "United States", but look at the director, actors, location, etc. I just saw it on Bravo - they should be ashamed that they had bought the rights to show the film. Again, there are a lot of good movies out there that can not get airtime and they show that shit.
