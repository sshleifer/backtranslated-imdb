It has been almost 30 years, and I still hate everyone involved in this film. It remains the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Before seeing it, I never much minded River, one way or another. After watching this film, I had an allergic reaction, when I happened to see it on TV <br /> <br /> I was dragged to this. - illogically - to peer pressure. However, leaving the theater, those friends have vowed never to cancel the selection of the film. Almost thirty years later, we still carry psychological scars from this film. <br /> <br /> Before his death, one of my regrets is the time I wasted in the hope that this film could be better. He never did. <br /> <br /> If you ever given a choice, would you prefer to put your eyes to the seat, although this film. <br /> <br /> I am a registered IMDb comments only in the hope that maybe I can prevent others from watching this movie. If I can save just one person watching this, then my existence on this earth will be justified.
