The intention of the director Warren Beatty to turn the famous Chester Gould comic strip cartoon in live-action (with Beatty himself cast in the lead as the square-jawed detective) were sweet overtures innocent nostalgia - a very unusual and intriguing that come from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the picture is needed ham, fun for a while, but in the end the tires. Dick Tracy is trying to bring down the gangster Big Boy Caprice, why loving Tessa Trueheart but stumbled evil Breathless Mahoney. For the first half hour or so, the Oscar-winning directing and set design for excellent absorption, but as the plot creaks on predictable (without a real thorn in writing), things start to solidify. Al Pacino was a surprise Supporting Oscar nomination as the bad boy of the Caprice, and Madonna (which is mostly used as a decorative support) gets to sing Sondheim in "Sooner or later, (I always get a My Man)Â», who copped the award for best original song. A lot of heart, thanks to Beattie - who was dedicated to his vision - but the picture is too cool and calculated. It lacks warmth. * 1/2 ****
