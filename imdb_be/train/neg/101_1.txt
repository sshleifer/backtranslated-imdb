Amateur, wholly budget films can be surprisingly good ... it is, however, not one of them. <br /> <br /> Oh, even Brad Sykes crime. Disgusting acts for Emmy Smith, which shows some promise, with the exception of. Camera "direction" in need of serious revision. And there is no more "to keep the camera and launch the" trick or; it just does not work. Special Effects prose, there is a problem when the effect can be identified in real-time. If you're going to tear the ear, please, let's not see a real actor's ear under the blood. Decorations are soft and sad (same as Mr. Sykes other enterprise), and the music is a cross between a cheap motel porn and really bad guitar metal (see comment scenery). <br /> <br /> I have already said, the lack of any real plot or character development? Apparently, there was no screenwriter. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is funding this guy ... please stop. I have seen some of his other "home video" (which I do not plug), and they are just as bad. Typically, the "director" will grow and learn from their previous efforts ... Not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur filmmaker, but anyone can be a hack. <br /> <br /> Of course, not even a popcorn movie ... of course, chewing popcorn kernels will be less painful than those efforts. <, Br /> <br /> Award: the worst ever military push-ups in the film.
