I remember when I was a kid, when I was away at camp, and we Campout under the stars. There is always someone there, that would be a good story to say that participation in the forest surrounding us, and they will always creep me. Well, if I have found Wendy in the library, I checked it out in the hope of being one of those movies that had a supernatural being persecuted man in the forest as well as the stories told in the camp. Well, it was awful, I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is really bad. The story begins when a family of three people leading to their cabin, which looks like an ordinary country house, and nothing like a cabin in the woods, and they run into a deer. Well, it seems the local cattle was actually hunt these deer is quite upset and the city of our nation. The film spends too much time following the family daily activities, rather than to get to the point of the film. It was not until about the last 15 minutes, we actually have some action with the participation of "Wendigo". My suggestion is that you stay very far from this film. This will leave you the desire of your half hour ago.
