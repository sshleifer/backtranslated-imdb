As already mentioned, this film is a load of pretentious nonsense to thoughtless or masochists. <br /> <br /> We all know, after watching the needle and acid house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But in contrast to the needles and acid house without a good dose of humor and gritty realism of films, as it does not work. And more importantly, the film is not without a decent script to work, and there is nothing new or inspiring food for thought about the script for this film. <br /> <br /> the fact that this film won a BAFTA some concerts, how bad the British film industry at the moment. I thought that the Aussie film industry was pretty bad at the moment, but, unfortunately, the British industry even worse. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad, I would not even bother to rent it out weekly. <, Br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and give this film the rounds.
