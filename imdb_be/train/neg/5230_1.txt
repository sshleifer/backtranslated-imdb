He certainly did not profiled no major media that say about him and his creations "glory." <br /> <br /> BENFER have some minor skills in limited animation, but he has to get away from her boyfriend sneak and learn to write some actual fun stuff, before it is taken seriously as a real artist. At this point, however, he's just a kid with a camera, and it shows.
