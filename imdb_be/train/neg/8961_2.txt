This film was another waste of time ... Why oh why I continue to lease shit like this? ... Can someone please tell me ... * sigh * Oh well. to return to the movie at hand: Cube Zero is probably worth it if you really enjoyed the first film (like me), and just want to check that this is the last (I hope) the film scraped together just to save some poor actors and screenwriters used, of course, this is the movie for you. But if you are looking for a good film with good acting and a fantastic story ... * evil grin *, then this movie is for you! :-D .... OK, I'm lying ... In the best case, this movie sucks, well, I have to to recognize that some of the elements that it was cool .. well .. coolish ... and I'm pretty much just laughed, Prolly on the wrong things, but nevertheless I was surprised. :-) But in all of those few things that only make the "KI" category are not enough to make this movie worth it at all .. With the exception of "Manos - The hand of fate," one of the ten best movies ever!
