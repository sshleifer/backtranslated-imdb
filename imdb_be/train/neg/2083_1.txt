At what point does it make a good movie is bad? If the film comes from "watchable" in "where that ^ _ + @ #! * Switch OFF »? Thank God for DVD-ROM drive, like this one, which can be borrowed from the library - for free! In the same way, thank God, the switch is "fast-forward" on a DVD-player. I feel sorry for those people who have been deceived by the box office. <br /> <br /> At some point (I forget exactly when because now everything is just spot), our "hero", Luke Wilson begins to work through traffic; I think he was looking for a taxi. It was at that moment when I refused, knowing that I could not care if he found his trip or hit by a garbage truck. <br /> <br /> The last time the film was interesting was when Luke Wilson rises from the basket, hair dryer in her hand, and the first encounters "heroine" Uma Thurman. The scene ended with the criminal purses ragged helpless fire run far, far away on the outgoing Luke and Mind. It was the last time when the film was funny, and when was this scene? Ten minutes later, in the flick? <br /> <br /> Every time the film was trying to be "funny", he could not. Every time the film went "excitement", it plays out, moving in the opposite direction. If the music may have helped to squeeze the life out of this stupid, the audio track is still empty and quiet <br /> <br /> sex scenes were not necessary and were in favor of lame. damage to the sets and props unnecessary and childish. If mind is transformed into a crazy ex-girlfriend, I felt like I was watching "40 Year Old Virgin Meets Pulp Fiction"; that's when I realized that was due not to turn back, because I do not like «The 40 Year Old Virgin» and "Pulp Fiction." <br /> <br /> sidekick Luke Wilson, Wilson Rhine (also seen in the tedious "The Last Mimzy") adds nothing except humiliation in this terrible movie. Rain Wilson, King TV Boredom, should stay with this as a terrible environment . Hey, Rein Wilson Leave a full-length motion pictures alone whenever an opponent Uma, Anna Faris, left on the screen, I expected Jason or Freddy or a fear flowlines monster to jump out from behind the scenery;! as soon as you see Anna Faris in the "scary movie", which is not all that you will ever, regardless of the tag on film, no matter Wednesday. The character played by Wanda Sykes was just terrible and was so out of place in this film.
