I'm afraid that I do not agree with the majority. I found the last bit Spike Lee's sad! Despite the fact that he is trying something different, that is, not just to document the rise and fall of a serial killer, I do not think it worked too well <br /> <br /> There really is too much going on. - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Mira Sorvino) Dionna relations (in, (Adrien Brody) image of Ritchie's life, and then the local types of mafia history is good, but in the end that's all you have -. 2 or 3 floors with such provocative. killer could Mr. Lee Sun put more in the direction of the film?> <br /> <br /> There are some good points, though. All the scenes with the "Son of Sam" killer David Berkowitz look very good (color saturation, etc. . ...) and the action is pretty good everywhere. <br /> <br /> In general, I felt that the stories would work well on their own or without the killing. It just was not remaining strong in the end. <br /> <br />
