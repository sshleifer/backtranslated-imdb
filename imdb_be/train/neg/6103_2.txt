Frankly, I'm surprised by the positive vote that got this film. The movie just drags his 81 minutes of life, and the public must suffer all the way through. In fact, there are some positive moments in this film; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. She gives some pretty pathetic dialogue, and it handles it very well. Scott Valentine (man Merrideth in family relations), on the other hand, it's pretty rough hours. I believe that the highlight of his work is to witness a guy on the beach wearing a tiger with the image chummies .... give me a break. In addition, Valentine gives us the pathetic image of boorish and suffering vampire who misses a day (to see much more convincing performance of affected vampire to see Dennis Duff Â«Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4"). The film moves so slowly, and only a positively punctuated, and to be honest, the dance scenes in Charlie Spradling. This film can honestly be recommended only for playing Charlie Spradling fans (which I, and I still had a tough time watching it!).
