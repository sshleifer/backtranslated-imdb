Well where do I start? I think it is very offensive to the original Annie Eileen Quimnn. I love the movie Annie, and I expected it to be a brilliant film, but I was so disappointed! acting badly, the original Annie came out a few years before I was born, I am now 25, and Annie is still one of my favorite movies, so I was very happy to see Annie 2. The action in the film was terrible, there were some of the characters in the original? very bad writer, director and acting. This is not a movie, I'd like to see again, and any lover Annie, I recommend that you do not watch this movie, because it will only leave you very disappointed. Young girls are singing is not bad, but still does not compare to original
