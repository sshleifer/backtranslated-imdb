Terrible acts, Bad storyline, cheesy make-up, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. I have never seen a worse film in my life, for 5 minutes, I decided to fast-forward to see if anything happens, swim ... This is not the case. (Except for the good breast shot) The film must have been shot in some furniture warehouse, as well as the composition was used for at least 90% of the sets. You can even see the same red chair in several different "places" If you're going to make a film, at least rent an office building and an apartment, and not some kind of structure that will echo the dialogue of all your acting .. (Note to producers), remove the small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than the entire composition, and both are very versatile and a little more plausible) If you spend money to rent this nation, I hope you got it from the back guarantee ... you will demand their money back. .. I just I spent $ 2.99 to rent it today and I feel ripped off.
