"Smile like you" pathetic comedy that does not really make any sense. I do not mean that the story was complicated, but the whole story is based on one thing: a desperate and unsuccessful attempts to expensive for a couple to conceive a child. Users who tried it is difficult to be forgotten the adoption option, to which this film is not polite. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly plays Jennifer Robertson, a complete contradiction to anything offered by the women's liberation movement, does not show almost no sense of independence. It's pretty boring character as dreamy housewife absolutey nothing on her head but have children. How dumb 50 romantic comedy, Greg Kinnear her husband, who also provides does not show any individuality, independence, and to us, no interest. <br /> <br /> They are the two most boring and often irritate the characters, and they are unlikely to make the theme of comedy, which should present itself with many setbacks that must occur because of a couple doing everything possible to get pregnant. In addition, they are in fact nothing other than to go to the clinic Fertility and put a lot of money to do what they could do in their own solitude (for that amount in addition to in vitro fertilization) to do. The plot is unlikely to admit any failures, because well, the couple does not do anything to create some kind of a strange situation. They just go to this clinic. So what? <br /> <br /> plot designed to test the validity of a pair, needs moral element of history, as the pair makes the conception of children plan together. Jennifer works in a new age store with his friend (played by Joan Cusack), and they are in the business of developing aphrodesiacs. Christopher McDonald plays a buyer interested in and Jennifer is a promising negotiator pretty price for it and the product of another. The plot is unlikely to offer much to keep you interested (although Joan Cusack pretty funny scene in the restaraunt). <br /> <br /> Deni (Kinear) is an architect who finds a chance to make some extra money to cover the hospital bill, taking on the job in Seattle, where his boss is stupid seductress (and other bad helpless female character), who is trying to influence the Deni (as dumb as it is), to deal with it once things convenient rocky with him and his wife (for reasons I do not care to pay). Jill Hennessy is good in that role, but her character is too predictable and too stereotyped as a much-needed element to create conflict for Denis. Stupid and once again, it is hardly interesting. <br /> <br /> very common film very sad, and it is unlikely funny (save restaraunt scene and airline flight). The plot does not offer anything that is really exciting. Even if the story was all about two people who are trying to become pregnant, the authors might have found a few funny failures to develop from this. Second, the main characters very sad. They are full silouhettes stupid comedies from the 1950s years of happily married husband and stupid. Thus, even without an incident, those present in the plot, the characters themselves do not offer anything interesting, let alone funny. <br /> <br /> Joan Cusack was in the lead, and someone else had to take part in Kinnear. Cusak would have made even a lousy story provocatively funny (as it sometimes does in her co-star role). This is definitely one to pass up.
