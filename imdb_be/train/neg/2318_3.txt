Kid found as an infant in the garbage and raised in the martial arts academy has a knack for immersing the basket. With the help of the man who found him, he gets to college and promoted to the championship, as he searches for his real parents. Infinitely better in terms of action-comedy a real mess in general. This seems to be committed to the hipper version of basketball Shaolin Soccer, but comedy scatter shot, his attention wanders a Chihuahua with ADD to quadruple espresso. I kept asking, "What do I look." I watched it from beginning to end, and I still do not know what happened, dammit. Its a shame as there are some great scenes, some funny jokes and the occasional moment of time, but nothing, not one of them ever comes along, I'd pass.
