* May contain a kind of spoiler? * The mere mention of Crispin Glover to send some geek panties in a bunch. His appearance in milestone Back to the Future George McFly sealed it in the American conscience for all. Most recently, he was trying to get back into the subconscious hard Bartleby and Willard. <br /> <br /> This time, however, Crispin made a 76-minute, cheap Dada film. Sometimes he reminded me of geniuses, while in general it is almost insulted me, but not because of its content. Content? What is it? It is a film where one half of the film, all the actors have Down syndrome, giving it a Freakshow feel to it. The second half of the film includes Crispin Glover, Parfrey, and the guy with cerebral palsy. All this was the feeling that John Waters tried to do from Desperate Living, and at the same time feel more successful and fail. <br /> <br /> half with actors Down syndrome also has a lot of a lot of dead snails. We are talking about a guy who has a snail, and ends up killing one. It is also a bunch of other people to torture, and horse. He falls in love with 2 girls, one of whom he has sex with the cemetery. It also has a falling out with a friend who teases him. <br /> <br /> In a surprising floor interior set, Crispin Glover is director of the show. He is something like a mind control this guy, and cerebral palsy guy something like sexuality. Well, he at least gets masturbated in outdoor scenes. There are other "shocking" image made with a sense of humor as Nazi Swaztikas crossed with Shirley Temple, and minstrels in black face say they are Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> In the outside world, the executioner is still dealing with his love to kill snail and beat others. They hit him with stones, and the like. Later, they beat minstrel after putting him on trial. <br /> <br /> Back to the interior, Crispin Glover is still the master of his set, and trying to control everything, but fails miserably. <br /> <br /> What is it? It has less sense than Dr. Caligari, and has more than a passing style stolen from him. Claustrophobia mental space feels very similar to how the non-wall sets of Dr. Caligari felt claustrophobic. They also had some dialogue, which was nonsense. And all this was envelop absurdist image for humor. <br /> <br /> The problem is, about 20 minutes into the movie ... maybe a little more ... What is it? exhaustively. Over the next 56 minutes, we continue to work on one and the same sets of images, only introducing new devices in the form of absurdist puppet. The film seems to be little more than a film that tries to push the envelope in the offensive and taboo images. He is trying to mock and confuse the audience. But the problem is that it only has enough different images for the 40 minute film. <br /> <br /> Even worse, cinematography, set design, and everything else was very very cheap and almost unplanned. It felt like, 'OK, this is the way we can do it and get it out of the way. "He did not feel interesting, and it was pretty boring .... Dr. Caligari, on the other hand, was a strange cinematography and framing. The difference between these two rather strange <br /> <br /> rating :. C
