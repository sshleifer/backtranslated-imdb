There's nothing worse than renting a movie and the Asian American experience to get to the movies instead. <br /> <br /> This is just my opinion, but a good thriller depends on creating cute, smart characters. How likability is concerned that the main actors in the Say Yes is a quaint married couple. Well done. Unfortunately, they are stupid beyond belief. We calculate the way they mistreat terrorized by a stalker. <br /> <br /> 1. After hitchhiking threatens to kill you, do not forget to tell him that the hotel you stay, if you miss it. <br /> <br /> 2. Beat the hell out of a stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses, thereby allowing him to charges of assault. <br /> <br /> 3. Do not bother telling the police about a stalker and just assume (for no apparently good reason) that the police had hired him. <br /> <br /> 4. Trying to hide, let your lady out of sight as much as possible, to ensure that the stalker kidnaps her. <br /> <br /> 5. After receiving help from someone to find the stalker after the abduction of your wife, be sure to release them as soon as possible, so that you can meet with them one on one. No point in being unfair, is not it? <br /> <br /> At the present time, I never expected that anyone will be insured to make a few mistakes in these stressful conditions, but the characters say yes so tight and do so many incredible error, it is effectively impossible for a the viewer to take care of their safety, because they are victims of their own activities. It kills enjoyability film. <br /> <br /> In case you're wondering, the writers did not stop with the near signs. Since they themselves, of course, close to the writing of this crapfest, they decided to make the situation so absurd unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the window. <br /> <br /> 1. Stalker kills police inside a police station ?? while the main character is sleeping no more than ten feet away. <br /> <br /> 2. Stalker does not participate in a variety of suspicious activities in broad daylight, and about a ton of people, but no one, except his wife, seems to notice his strange behavior. <br /> <br /> 3. Stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being. <br /> <br /> 4. In the "uncertainty" of the scene had no idea at all. In fact, some scenes were direct looting of American films. <br /> <br /> The only positive is near the end of decapitation, which was pretty brutal scene, as it was done at his wife. It's too bad the filmmakers followed him outrageously stupid ending, which comes out of left field. <br /> <br /> In fact, Koreans are behind the production of Say Yes should be ashamed of themselves. And even better, they just have to move to California and get to work with people who make films with a similar disregard for the quality and intelligence.
