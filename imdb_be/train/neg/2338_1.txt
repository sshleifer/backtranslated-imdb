How is it possible that not a single journalist or critic reminded us about the similarities to what others better Flemish Â«Congo Express (1986)" movie? There are also some characters in Congo Express together without having to actually related to each other: Jean (de Congolees), a carpenter, two taxi drivers, street singer, Roger Guy and Lucien Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luke Gubbels was not. This should not be a reason to pardon the shortcomings in the script (if there is a script) since anyway the wind blows. Joke (just one!) At a party on the ice in the refrigerator is taken out of this great Flemish film "De Witte (1934)," where De Witte put too much salt on the potatoes. Some accidents happen in the movies, but do not come after no explanation. Meanwhile bartender delivers us here a film which is more like an experiment to see on television than film for theaters. Another missed opportunity for Flemish cinema.
