This film fails miserably at every level. I have an idea, let everyone involved in this film, and send them into the hot zone in the Middle East. Maybe if we're lucky, they would be shot and killed, and we should not ever in our time is wasted again. Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about the cinematic pile of shit in my life? My God, I can not think of anything I have ever seen, it was that bad. I prefer to look Ishtar 25 times in a row than to sit through 10 minutes of this sad excuse for a movie. If I ever happen to meet all those who took part in this film, I spit in the face, and then beat them senseless. It has two cents.
