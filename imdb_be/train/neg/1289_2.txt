It was a new low among Alltime westerns. Drafting excruciatingly bad characters is impossible to emphasize and either disgusting or bland, violence is appalling and technically not very convincing answer. And Tobey Maguire shows us the reverse side of his talent, sleepwalking through his part with those which express the eyes and that his raspy voice that betrays only here mannerisms. "Ride with the Devil" is one will never be surpassed my worst experiences of five films ever, a Western in a negative respect.
