I saw this DVD to my friends house and thought it was a Turkish fighter with some Hollywood-not very big names in it. Interested enough to decide to give it a shot later .. It was difficult to have an experience, believe me. Then, after finally seeing the titles I taught: "We are Turks really suck at the Hollywood style of filmmaking .. It is an insult to the robbery | hostage film genre .. "but then wait! I checked out some names, and no, they were not Turkish names and no, it was not the Turkish film; on the contrary, it was literally shot in America with American director and team! It made me think again - both on the ground, you can convince names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong WFFL or even take part in such a project? money possible .. It held me think more .. How can you raise such a sum of money to offer them and the alleged international cast? Then all my meditation paid off, and I came to find the cheapest answer.By hiring equipment and crew that you can find. And if you still have difficulty adjustin its budget, then: in writing and direct the film, which you are trying to make, or vice versa I do not have no information about something. So the bottom line is this is not a bad movie, like all so eager to present as .. It makes you think, -in my case even meditate- and there are a lot of movies outthere that does not even what influences .. It is one of at least It makes you think; It makes you wonder .. it leaves you with a grain of salt .. and then it makes you wonder again ..
