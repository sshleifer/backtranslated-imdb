This is a remake of the 1962 Orginal film'o book has some very good parts to recommend it and some excellent performances by some great actors - but Scorsese chooses to end for most of the formulaic plot twists and embarrassingly outplayed Shakespeare's death, that was me looking at his watch . <br /> <br /> DeNiro fine actor, dedicated to giving his all in the work that he does, but he needs a direction to focus his talent and it is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> cameo Gregory Peck is OK, but no more, until Robert Mitchum is not always fun to watch, even in a few lines like this. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte turns in a better performance than the Lorentz oil, but not in the same form as "Weeds." Joe Don Baker has some great lines while Juliette Lewis once again proves that sometimes talent skips a generation. <br /> <br /> Some good points? Loans start (!) First rear view Cody doing dips in the prison scene where Cody attacked with baseball bats, Sam Bowden decent into a full panic, outwardly calm but nervous prescence Cody. <br /> <br /> The worst? "Cleaner - BUT NOT REALLY !!!" part. Clinging to bare hands to the bottom of the car a hundred miles at high speed. (? Are there any bumps in the US), "He's dead - but not really !!!" Part and the aforementioned chaotic ending. <br /> <br /> I can see the original again, but I still do not be tempted to follow the alteration in the four years since its viewing.
