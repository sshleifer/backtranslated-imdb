Photos that are usually glorifying the hero makes sense. As an example, Bonnie and Clyde made famous dynamic bank robber, and you actually felt sympathy for them, in spite of their crimes. Why? They were two people who were in the Depression, when people are desperately trying to survive. <br /> <br /> This film has absolutely no substance. Viggo Mortensen's character rather acts as a national hero. Why? It speeds along the Idaho highway on the way to the hospital, where she struck his wife. No one bothers to understand why he is trying to escape all. Even worse, if the implementation is evident that he is not a red-neck terrorist, no one wants the government to help him, as they try to keep their rear ends. <br /> <br /> Jason Priestley co-stars as a radio entertainer, which is based on a story in support of our hero. <br /> <br /> ending is absolutely incredible.
