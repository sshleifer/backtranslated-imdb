I would not bring a child under the age of 8 to view this content. With puppies dangling from buildings meanders through the dangerous machine and listen to scary laugh Cruella, to name a few events have entirely too much uncertainty for a small child. <br /> <br /> live action gives a more sinister feel than a cartoon version, and there are many anxious moments, including a guy who seems to be a transvestite, a lot of tense moments that will worry and can scare small children. <br /> <br /> I do not know what people think of Disney, but no story, no action has been its usual level. Puppies are cute, but this film is spotty at best.
