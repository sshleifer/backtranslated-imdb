It turned out to be another failed attempt ridiculous sci-fi channel. I do not know who wrote the script and interpret a poem, but I'm sure it was a kind of 17-year-old, who thought it would be strange to have a crossbow in the film context. AAAAAAAH! when I saw that part, I lost all hope. Then ... they went heorot in what looks like a ship that Christopher Columbus sailed in! when they reach the Heorot, (which must be the Scandinavian mead hall) science-fiction group of idiots decided to heorot look like a great stone castle. when I saw that part .. I wanted to scream. I really wanted this movie to be good, but science fiction has to make a good movie, so I do not know why I got my hopes up. Oh..and Grendel and his mother as silly. (This comment on the topic of "Grendel") If one of the sci-fi channel reads this..here some good advice. NOT EVERY FILM YOU DO TO BE ABOUT THE BIG MONSTER, WHAT CAN rip people in half, THATS NOT WHAT science fiction Oh! AND, the STOP low-grade casting actors like Stephen Baldwin BE IN YOUR FILMS! ITS does not help a movie, but it makes it worse !!!
