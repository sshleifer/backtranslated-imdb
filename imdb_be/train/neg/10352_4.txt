I only recently learned that Madeleine L'Engle novel was transformed into a television film and Disney ordered a DVD. The book was my favorite when I was a kid, and I read it several times. <br /> <br /> In spite of some of the child actors did not look like the characters, as described in the novel, Merry family is well cast, with a nice (if too beautiful) Meg in the middle and Charles Wallace, who convincingly as a child prodigy, he becomes irritable. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is sufficient perspective, does a good job in establishing the relationship between the main characters, and when setting the scene. Unfortunately, as soon as the non-human characters and adaptation begins to unravel after the children leave the ground the whole thing falls apart. Alfre Woodward too youthful appearance and too royally as the eccentric Mrs. Whatsit (think Miriam Margolis, Joan Plowright, or instead of) and Kate Nelligan face mask as a plastic surgeon, as vague, it should be visited Faye Dunaway in recent years. For some reason, they do it to Mrs. that look like Glinda in The Wizard of Oz when she was reminding benign Wicked Witch of the West. <br /> <br /> In the end, allowing it down most strongly is the terrible special effects and art direction. I understand that this is a television film, but CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years ago. Centaur embodiment MRS Whatsits' is a disaster as Chewbacca as to suit Aunt Beast, which is novel, velvety, elegant instead of being awkward Big Foot, as a thing indicated here. I could go on and on, almost every artistic choice distress, probably because it was not a big enough budget to do it justice, but also because the design work lacks imagination and common sense. <br /> <br /> it really would need a sense of wonder Spielberg led to his earlier film. What a shame that the current popular children's literary adaptation is not fantasy series no one thought adaptation folds during and this for the big screen, giving it the scope it deserves.
