I enjoyed the comments of the first reviewer's much more than I did the movie, when I saw him for the second term of the theater in the early 80s. I was struck then carefully to create costumes modeled so closely on Tenniel drawings. But for me, the cast was largely wasted, their identity muted masks, while the direction I think is unusual static and photographing muddy. Rating sketched at that time was zero, which means "not worth sitting through one more time." <br /> <br /> However, I would jump at the chance to have a second opinion.
