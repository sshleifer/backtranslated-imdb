A letter and a newspaper company offered (as they often do) is much more sinister and violent piece than have to drive screens. Claude Brooke actually Americanization Claudio Brook, who has worked in films for many years. This one is difficult to find more; I would like to see him again, to compare it with other international horrors of the day, but did not remember particularly hit way back when. Most likely, it was chopped up version that made it to the United States and video theaters. But, oh, that one letter ... more jewel of my collection later horror.
