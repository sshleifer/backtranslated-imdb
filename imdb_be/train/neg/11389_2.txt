If you like movies that wander with a small plot exposition seasoned curly sex, this film is for you. On the positive side the lead actor / actress (newcomer transsexual) really has an interesting screen presence, but not enough to add to the more than mildly interesting film - if that. In fact, this film is about 3 outcasts (Transexual prostitute, male Hustler, and Russian gay immigrant) who somehow developed a bond. Why is not clear. We are expected to accept these failures lie at the heart of the main honest people who have the ability to love, as they push their bodies on the street. Right !! And Anna Nicole Smith was really in love with her that some ninety sugar daddy! The director shows the sand, unpleasant aspects of life at that time as he wants us to believe underneath all those seriously injured people are really quite normal to the extent that they have a partner, which helps them in life. Pretty fancy, but, unfortunately, it is portrayed here as a real view of life on the wild side. In general, no plot, no truth, no real reason not to spend much time here. Of course, if you just do not like to revel in a break !!!
