I knew nothing about this film before I looked, but I heard that it was something to do with quantum physics, so I was concerned. What I do not know what it's actually not a story, but a bunch of New-Age blowhards, who love the sound of his own voice, talking about how little they know about the underlying quantum mechanics. I say that more is classified as documentary than a comedy or a drama. <br /> <br /> Marlee Matlin is in the movie in order to give this new century Symposium * some * sort of storyline. Its part of the film to feel badly tacked and is designed to reflect the thoughts said, so we will not die of boredom. Matlin has a real job as a photographer, unlike a hippie New Age, falling on her couch. Gets listen to unnamed people ramble on about what quantum physics is "mean" to them. One bright spot in this film was a speaker from India (I guess), but I think he pointed to the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> It looks like Barbara Eden really afford to go, and it goes on and on about how quantum science has something to do with his insane beliefs of New Age. It seems that with Quark DS9 was discharged for cash, and it also makes a brief appearance in the film. There are many sophisticated CGI we have to be impressed; cells in the body are shown dancing jelly form, because the filmmakers apparently saw Flubber one too many times. <br /> <br /> People in the film say that the Arawak people of San Salvador Pinto thought Columbus ship was invisible because the locals have never seen a clipper ships before, as if the people today have any possible way the path of knowledge . Of course, they get out of all this information and simply say "Columbus ships were invisible to the Indians in America." The film takes a lot of arrogant jumps. Thomas Young double slit experiment done about 1805 and found that the light may seem like a particle of time, and the wave of time. Of course, you never know * it from watching this stupid film because the only reference to it, that "the atoms can be a particle and a wave." And it would mean that people can walk through walls, walk on water, and never not age, if they just make a wish !! Then I'm sure Marlee Matlin may cease to be deaf when it just * is believed hard enough. I sarcasm, but this film is full of false hopes and beliefs that people defend them actually have no place. <br /> <br /> This New Age cranks who grabbed the quantum theory, as if he confirms everything they think about meditation, zero-point energy, crystal healing, etc. If these snake oil salesmen actually believed the crap they were selling, they could not simply * desire * of their salary into existence instead of visiting this joke movie? He gets listen to another unnamed man, without authority, that we know, talking on his couch in front of a fireplace (or the TV) on how he creates his own life. Every time he was on screen, I wanted someone to break and throw a pie in his face. These people take WAY too seriously. Some other balding guy in a suit says that nobody really * does not touch anything, because there is a magnetic force that hinders it at the quantum level. Unless someone came on the screen and continued to punch him in the stomach, shouting "I'm not touching you! I'm not touching you! "Moral relativism in the film argues that there is actually" no such thing as good or bad. "Thus, it is obvious that it is normal that Hitler gassed millions of Jews to the death? Another person says, "There is no such thing as love." It's just a chemical, and that we really do not like people, we are just depending on the chemical break we have when we are around them. I suspect that this guy does this film, as community service for being addicted to heroin for many years. <br /> <br /> We are witnessing a truly miserable sequence where two young people walk around the wedding reception, seeing everything as RoboCop. They estimate a woman cow, dog or fox, and sexual position jumps to collapse. Marlee Matlin gets drunk at a wedding, she is supposed to take a picture and the next day decided to love yourself and take a bath, because it is a beautiful and unique snowflake. <br /> <br /> I loved when the film said that people often find evidence of their preconceived notions. Perhaps, in this review, I only see what I want to see, but I really wanted these people to pies to the face, and it never was. <br /> <br /> If you've never heard of the ideas presented in the film before, you can find them interesting, but there are better sources for all the ideas here. If you want to watch a good movie, which tells about the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, I go see The Man Who Was not There. If you want to read a good book on quantum field theory, hyperspace read by Michio Kaku. If you want to see a film about the different philosophy and imaginative visual waking cm (although it may feel dull, self-esteem, and pretentious at times). In general, you should go and read the quantum psychology or Prometheus Rising by Robert Anton Wilson, instead of wasting your time on this film. <br /> <br /> I usually have a very hard time giving movies a score between 1 and 10, but this one has been very easy for me. 1/10 stars <br /> <br /> name of the movie is true. People in this film do not know the # $ *! Hands down, the worst movie I have ever seen.
