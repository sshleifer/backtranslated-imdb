It's just bad. Sometimes remakes, even if they deviate from the original, good in themselves. They can bring a different perspective and achieve a certain interpretation that makes them unique and pleasant. It was so bad designed and carried out, as it may be. It was not good, even standing on its own. Mortensen is a first-rate actor, but some of his choice of roles and projects is poor. The original "Vanishing Point" was so exciting, psychological adventure; it is not at all an adventure, and not enjoyable or entertaining at all. This was done because of the approach to decision-numbers film, filling in the plot indicates that someone in Hollywood thinks will please what they see as today's film-going audience. Basically, they see us as a bunch of idiots. It is a shame that somebody put this as a feature film, and even try to remake the cult is sloppy. Manipulative narrative devices, "do-it clearly so that they-nya-miss-point" aspects, funny dialogue, stereotyped characters, recreational area ... <br /> <br /> It is plain bad ....
