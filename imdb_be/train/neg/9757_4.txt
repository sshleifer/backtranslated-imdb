Not the biggest film to be remembered by Paul Naschy. <br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst swordsman I've ever seen. Zorro is a shame! His only salvation came as the competition was just as bad. <br /> <br /> The film is described as an adventure and horror. Forget the horror - not there. A lot of nudity, no blood, no monsters; a Robin Hood adventure against the evil Baron (Naschy) Paul, who wants to be king. <br /> <br /> The main feature film seen GRACIELA Nilsson, who only made four films for two years and disappeared in our boring loss. Where has it gone?
