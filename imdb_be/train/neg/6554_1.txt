I would not give it a rating of the film, it is not worthy. I watched it because I Pfieffer fan. I love her, and I will watch anything she's done. Even in this rags, she did not disappoint. Every scene with her in it, held the audience watching ... waiting ... something will happen, but never did anything. It had some good storylines, but they abruptly ended as soon as it started. Some of the other characters had the potential but nothing became of it. <br /> <br /> Pfieffer was 29 when she made this film, and its most prominent. Wardrobe and the set was surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> I can see basically nothing, and rarely come across in the movie, I can not find something to like about it, but it was hopeless. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The worst thing that it was all a big rock at the end of the hanger. He had a final scene that wake you up and say, wow, this film is finally a place, the captions. Good grief. <br /> <br /> I agree with the review that said the 0.99 would have bought 3 cans of food for cats and watch my cat eats would be more exciting. Well said. In fact, this comment was more interesting than the film, because it sums up so well. I also wasted .99 cents on this dud.dud.dud.
