I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler, and one day I was looking at the selection of Cast & Crew on one of his DVD, and saw «Going Overboard» and decided to go out and take it. So I went with a few friends of mine, and rented it. We put it up and we were shocked to see Adam Sandler, who did not hit puberty yet, it looks as if he was 12 when the film was released. I could not even watch 30 minutes of this crap, I did not laugh, chuckle, or even grins in this film, in fact, the only time I smiled when I saw how ugly this film was. I could not believe how much he was trying to make the audience laugh in this film ... and it did not work once. Although from seeing horrible horrible camera angles and heard a disgusting script, I realized why I had never heard about this film because ... it sucks more than anything ever sucked before. This film, in my opinion, was the worst movie ever made .... EVER!
