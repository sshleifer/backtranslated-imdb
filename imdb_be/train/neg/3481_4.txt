May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I say this, but someone has sense enough to read it, can probably understand each section, turn right from the start. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie that I liked. I do not hate him in the way of some of the films that insult your intelligence, but it was all too predictable to it are drawn up to the required happy ending. There were funny bits along the way, to be sure, but few of them are original. At least, he did not go to the gutter. <br /> <br /> Christina Applegate looks fresh, and Ben Affleck works hard. Their scenes together really just soothing. All other cardboard cutout, including, surprisingly, James Gandolfini, which should be done so as a favor to someone. <br /> <br /> In general, it is harmless, but not inspiring, 90 minutes.
