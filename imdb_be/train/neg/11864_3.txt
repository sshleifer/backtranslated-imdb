characters at a depth of less than a rip off. you see all of the characters in other movies, I promise. the script tries to be sharp and unpleasant, but fails miserably. he throws in some hangover meets sentimental comedy, but the joke out of left field, completely forced and disreguarded almost completely after they are broken. hot chick is old and has no individuality, STE only a few in the early thirties blonde chick with some wise ass nya-linen, worn jokes that are less sweet. attraction between Mollie (hot chick) and Kirk (dumb love interest) just reported. attracting not where to find it completely platonic relationship, as long as they are not going clumsy and predictable place belt- incident kiss. AFER is they are full of relations and it's just incredibly lame. the focus of this film is not a relationship, but an unsuccessful attempt to make obscene super-bad movie of Esquire with a semi attractive plot. I could compare it with a hangover, in its coercive nature. I will not go into it. I could keep going, but it's just pointless. just do not pay to see this movie.
