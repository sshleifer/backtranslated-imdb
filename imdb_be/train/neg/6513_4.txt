I would like to have 20 root canal than go through that movie again. Prince Irritating, Myles Berkowitz, spent almost two hours of my life with this part of a cynical pseudo-coolness. The only funny in all this mess is disgusting from the camera patter Mr. Samaha in about tits and ass. Berkowitz takes great concept and grinds it to dust. It jumps and badly done, in an apparent attempt to make it seem sharp or funny. It is neither. I rarely feel that the film was an empty waste of film (or tape), but this one has a right to this distinction. If the date to see this film suggests, run.
