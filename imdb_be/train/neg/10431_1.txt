I loved the first season. Quality went down a bit in the second season, which, however, had a high average (Pegasus!). The third season was quite new and original, and was fine. The fourth season started to go downhill quickly, because they have not even begun to give us any explanation if we now really starting to need them. What the hell was a Cylon plan? Why were there two Cylon faction? Which was the point of Angel-Kara leads fleet devastated Earth-1? Who last made the last five Cylons are, and how they survive, or they were reincarnations? Questions, answers everywhere is nowhere. <br /> <br /> And then comes to an end. Earth-2 (our land) in the past. Well, well. But destroying the fleet? Refusal of technology and the rejection of any city life, as well as the distribution of several thousand people a paper thin layer on the entire planet? It is not only anti-science, this anti-reason and anti-life. And the philosophy of the show, it seems that humanity is forever trapped in the cycle of nature is derived from Romanticism to the decadent capitalist society to invent destructive ai that destroys everything. This is without a vision, without hope of a grand future of mankind, and it is contrary to good science fiction. And do not even get me started on the angels! Religious chatter of the worst kind! The final disappointment !! <br /> <br /> In general, "all of this has happened before, and will repeat" thing to be associated with a previous incarnation of the series, not just on Earth as we know it. Creating a new show once, in accordance with the old to the final stroke of genius. Frakkin shame. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10.
