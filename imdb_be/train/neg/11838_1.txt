If your idea of ​​fun watching graphic footage of people car collision (you can see a woman passing by the front wheel rotates as the vehicle passes over it before it goes under the rear wheel - and they show it twice in case you missed it for the first time), it is documented for you. Admitedly I have not seen more of this very disturbing piece of voyeurism, but it was enough for me. Maybe everything else better. <br /> <br /> I wonder how long it will take for the television networks to start running slush films. Perhaps, game shows, based on self-injury can be good. <br /> <br /> I already know that there are angry people in the world, and that terrible things happen. I do not need to see the evidence on television under the guise of entertainment.
