Name Nick Stahl, a young actor and attractive cover VHS forced me to buy and watch this movie expecting to see a good slash teen movie. What crap! Full stamps script, dialogues and speeches terrible, terrible, very bad, terrible, terrible ?? Summing up, a waste of time. There's no horror, black humor, but very sad story, a shameful plot points. The film begins with six characters, in fact three pairs, with a group of friends, but in fact very nasty people who seem to be enemies, playing funny pointless game called "Taboo", and each of them to write so not to some questions taboo. That is, it is: no prior development of the characters, the viewer does not know who they are, their motivations and attitudes. Then, there are the dots for one year, the same group coming together in new years eve party, insulting each other in a very dirty way. But the plot twists and so funny, unpredictable, and incredibly mediocre, which does not deserve any extra line in my review. Only one piece of advice: do not waste time and money on this garbage, you will definitely regret. . My voice is one (terrible) <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Taboo ?? Jogando Com on assassino" ( "Taboo ?? game with a killer")
