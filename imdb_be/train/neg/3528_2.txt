There are so many comments on this film, but I found them confusing. This cutting angle, excessive use scenario where a normal person becomes a partner in crime someone of the opposite sex, without any reason. Boy meets girl. Girl holding the boy up at gunpoint for something funny. Boy intrigued. <br /> <br /> You know the drill: antagonist is a wild, free spirit, not a sociopath ... Throw in a few words of wisdom from Alice Drummond and you have a recipe for love. Sheedy "she crazy, or does it just need a hug? The role of the breakfast club just smells as the lead character. And all that remains is really horrible turkey of a film.
