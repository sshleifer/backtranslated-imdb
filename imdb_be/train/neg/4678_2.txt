This movie had some andrenaline jumps, but it's an old story, which simply can not happen. Navy protocols can never break that much, that the crew is much smaller XO could go so far away from the captain. I'll take Dr. Streynzhlav any day, when I want to see this story. Sidenote - The US Navy did not support this film.
