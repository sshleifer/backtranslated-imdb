Ruthlessly and painfully unfunny banal attempt to transplant the character of Sheriff Bart on Mel Brooks Blazing Saddles in its own weekly sitcom, it really is as bad as some people say it! <br /> <br /> laugh track only serve to remind the viewer that is not funny at all this supposed comedy is meant to be a joke and just how desperately he laughs really! <br /> <br /> However, it is more interesting to see the Louis Gossett Jr. is trying its best to impersonate Cleavon Little. His awkwardness comes through in every scene. He was much funnier in the HBO movie El Diablo, than it was here in this slab of cheese! <br /> <br /> In fact the best and the funniest thing about Black Bart is the name of your horse!
