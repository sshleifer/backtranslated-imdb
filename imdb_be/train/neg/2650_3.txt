As I sat subjected to this mediocre television, I wondered why? Why Diane Keaton agrees with this garbage? The film uses nonsensical, contrived storylines to deliver waste in the homes of thousands. The film takes a political program to a new level. The film does not make sense, and everything was lost creditworthiness of the excessive use of stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Keaton tried to make this movie worth it, but in the end it must remember the age old saying that you can not polish dung. I hope that you do not spend your New Year's Day watching another senseless made for TV movie. Now I know why the network began airing the series on Sunday night, to deliver us from the garbage!
