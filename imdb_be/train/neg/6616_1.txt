I must tell you straight forward, I, of course, not an authority on Bollywood and saw only a few. However, if you've never seen, do not start with that! I was very fond of the ones I have not seen this one before, but I just could not stand it. I also have to tell you up front that I could not finish this film - is that annoying. So why is it so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. There is a character called "Rambam" in the film. He is even more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks - I would never would have believed possible. He # @ ^! Irritating # !! He spoke in a falsetto, and I think it should have been comical. Instead, he just gets on my nerves, and I wanted to die ... slowly! His voice, his manner and his trouble - he just does not seem to shut up and dominated in every scene he was in - and he must die! <br /> <br /> 2. characters have remarkable ability to dodge AK-47 bullets with ease. I'm not kidding - there was a scene where several unarmed guys took a small army of guys with these guns !! And, again and again, they avoided with one bullet and beat the thug !!! This made the action Stallone in "Rambo IIÂ» appear daily !! <br /> <br /> 3. The film was so gosh-darn loud, in your face and intense - it almost made my brain blood !! It was as if the film was made by people under the influence of methamphetamine !! Crazy camera angles, intense music and action, action, action ... this film is clearly designed for those who can not take the film with the plot and wants to almost 100% of the actions. <br /> <br /> 4. The two main characters and their actions and motivations made zero sense ... no one else! <br /> <br /> It is possible, if you are the most ardent fan of Bollywood action and you can stand this film, but as for me, I can understand why this is the infamous Bottom 100 list in IMDB. Wow ... this film is bad and much bad !!
