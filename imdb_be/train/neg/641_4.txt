In my knowledge, Largo Winch was known Belgium comics (not read), tells of the adventures of playboy, a kind of James Bond without the espionage life! So if I had to choose a film for 5 years kid, I picked it up, because the child was already a big fan of James Bond! <br /> <br /> But, immediately after the opening credits, I of was seriously doubt if American films offer an amazing start, here, no action and rough sex scene ?? Then the story becomes very complex financial movements ?? I thought I had lost the baby. <br /> <br /> But, strangely enough, he was caught Largo, and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> It was a great explanation of Tomer Sisley? Largo complicated relationship with his father? History of multiple windows, in which friends are bad guys, the bad guys are friends? Exotic accommodations Hong Kong, Yougoslavia? <br /> <br /> Dunno, but he really cares about Largo ( "Will he stand up?) and we enjoyed our moment.
