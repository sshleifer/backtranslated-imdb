However, the main idea of ​​the story is much stronger than one would expect, and a respectable effort at drawing racial issues in the era of the Second World War army. Known plaster fell from Clay Thurman, Richard Pryor and Billy Dee Williams underloaded faring better. Stephen Boyd, however, stops a little less fluffy mustache twirling overindulgent stars for their turn. <br /> <br /> It is obvious low budget leads to inconsistency in the cost of production. Place large, the effects and actions are weak.

But this is a respectable failure, rather than a bad joke. This can be redone as a very good film, and, as it stands, it is an interesting job.
