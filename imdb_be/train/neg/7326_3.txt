This film has an interesting plot, but the acting is very poor and bad scenario. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma faced by the main character is intriguing, but due to poor writing and casting a potentially winning premises stolen. 2 of 4 other people in the theater left after about 45 minutes, and the other 2 were laughing like a bad movie. I stuck it to the end, but I must admit that I was playing blackjack on your cell phone to make the last 30 minutes of moderate.
