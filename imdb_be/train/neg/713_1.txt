May I, please, first of all say that I feel so strongly about this movie that I had signed up to IMDb specifically to consider it. And my review? This is easily the worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Synopsis of the film sounded interesting- Nazis, occult, time travel, etc., but the plot of the movie failed to properly combine all of these elements together. Remember the episode of South Park that featured writer manatees Family Guy, using the "idea balls"? Perhaps these manatees also write Unholy? Him as the author wanted to include all of these different ideas, but had no idea how to tie them all together, and then, to make things make even less sense, did not include Donnie Darko, squire topic travel time remaining, spoiling history. <br /> <br /> I can tell you from the outset that this is a bad film. The special effects were too low budget for something better than a straight to DVD. Actions were not great, but it's fair I've seen worse. Praise the fascist pattern, they were terrible, but the evil Nazi executioner guy was just comical. <br /> <br /> I'm not a vendetta against the movie or something, but to be honest, I was not even in the horror genre. But this film can not be described as a thriller or a drama. If this story has been well told, it would be a good movie. But it was more hyped. Waaaaay over hyped.
