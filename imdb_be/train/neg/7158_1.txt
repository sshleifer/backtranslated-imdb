These are some of the worst acts I have ever seen. I love Nadia Almereyda, but it's just an absolute dreck. Except for a few moments of interesting movies and music, this film is just nonstop bad acting and a dumb stuff. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but no one in it is not remotely good. The plot is a joke, but do not ha ha look. I do not even know if you can forgive the film is bad. Erase the last hour and a half of my life. How to do the director Nadia and another girl another planet?
