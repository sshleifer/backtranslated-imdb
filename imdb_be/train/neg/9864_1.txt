As a gamer, I can not say that I love this movie. Fact is, I hate it down right. I tried to watch it as open as possible, but when it comes down to it, it feels pretty insulting to my social group. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, there are several reasons why. <br /> <br /> 1. Symbols appear unnatural. I have met a lot of players, all the different spheres of life. I know of no one who acts like any of the characters in the film. It's like the film makers have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all in 5 people. Most players are pretty social people, some pretty active life. <br /> <br /> 2. Style does not work. Mockumentary style is ill-suited to the subject matter of the film. Real documentary about gamers will actually work better. While it looks good (IE purely together), it is not very good. <br /> <br /> 3. The dialogue feels forced, unnatural. In addition, it seems to lack any real world context. Gamers swear, I admit it, but we do not have Tourette's syndrome. <br /> <br /> 4. Humor is absent. Although self-deprecating humor is the basis of my group and several other groups that I've encountered, it is less self-abasement, and more like toilet humor. In addition, the majority of gamer humor is full of in-jokes and anecdotes, not toilet humor. Most players will balk at all who made such jokes avoided. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is basically: accuracy. I do not mean the rules, but instead the speaker. Invariably, this film will be compared to even lower budget movies gamers and gamers: Dorkness Rising, both of which represent the player, as real people playing the real game. The difference lies in the fact Gamers: The film is a situation in which you want to beat the players meaningless against the gamers, where you can say something like: "Yes, I know a guy like that ... Yes, it is, of course, Gary. "
