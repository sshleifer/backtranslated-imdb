This one serves as a satire on the move era of women's rights. Of course, this does not mean, Coach (movie) is a wonderful experience to behold. It works in the same spirit as FASTBREAK (which was better, but still tame), and mainly standard fluff. What I mean by this film be uninteresting easy to recognize. Anyone who is from time to normal operation by training lunatics pile earn your way to a sudden laugh victory. It's the same feeling you can get after viewing. Nice try casting of the opposite sex for a man duties, but I expected better things.
