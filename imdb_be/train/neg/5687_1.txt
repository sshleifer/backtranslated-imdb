Although not as bad as his adaptation of the game-to-film, this piece of crud is not much better. <br /> <br /> Ball seems to have a pathological inability to accept that he is not making good movies. One of these days it will run out of money and stop the application of the world with its bombs. <br /> <br /> The acting was subpar, the dialogue sounded like they read Teleprompters and Ball SPECIAL little "touches" were seen during all this. <br /> <br /> As with all films Uwe Boll, is one simply does not exist. <br /> <br /> plain and simple. <br /> <br /> just like Uwe Boll himself should not exist. > _>
