This film has a gorgeous brunette named Daniel Patty. It has excellent green eyes, and in the first few scenes, and the last scene. She's the only thing about this film, which is not repulsive. She can not have a future as an actress, as this kind of a movie is a kind of an offensive disaster that kills careers. <br /> <br /> film itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it. This is not a good horror film, or a good fake journalistic report or remotely good. There's no skill is obvious in its production. It's like a bad student film. The horrific story elements do not make you sick, it's the fact that it is so badly done that makes you sick. I would give this movie ZERO stars if I could.
