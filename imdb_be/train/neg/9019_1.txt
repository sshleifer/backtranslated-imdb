Otherwise, why would he do this to me? <br /> <br /> It's not that I expect, Dean Cain, to make a hit movie. Or even decent films. I saw Lois and Clark, I know just how ... "good" Dean Cain. <br /> <br /> Obviously, it's going to be cheesey Flick, Flick cheesey and each has its own special way to make you scratch your head. I will not refer to these spoilers, you can not really mess up this film is not greater than it already is. <br /> <br /> To start with ... why is it a fake helicopter? I mean ... why? <br /> <br /> How is it that a scientist from Chicago, and another scientist from Los Angeles, and none may be larger in Eastern Europe, as they tried? As hard it was to get either an American actor, or just change the lame state of a sheet film gives us say, these people are not American? <br /> <br /> Why is there a case 2, when the film gives us a cork line? We get a helipad-day, and then tin-day later. And then it all, who cares about the timing. To be honest, who cared for her, even if they are mentioned, but I believe this is beside the point. <br /> <br /> There is a movie really is best if you can view it through a few screens Split? The answer is no. <br /> <br /> This dragon sure can go down that hall..over..and over ... and again .... and again ... <br /> <br /> Who on earth responsible for one of the worst endings in film history? It was right with Scooby Doo. Oh, dead dragon now ... say, you want to get dinner? Of course, but not on some Chinese place .... with the Dragon in the name !! AH HA HA HA !! HA HA HA !! HAHA HA! I used to Superman! AHA HA HA! HA HA! <br /> <br /> Blackout <br /> <br /> Oh, my God, it made me cringe, it was so stupid. <br /> <br /> But never fear..even although the entire building exploded ... and no one was left alive..for some reason, there is a second intact, unmanned laboratories survived very well, so that they can make cont. Hurray for all of us. <br /> <br />
