I was a huge Lynn fan Peterson since her breakthrough role in 1988 blockbuster "High North", and even though I loved her in any other film «Slow» (2004), where she plays a "Frances", this is far and away its the strongest role. <br /> <br /> Lin, as I'm sure you all know (or should) play a crucial role "driver". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, other than the odd performance Lin, I am afraid that this film is not really a lot to be <br /> <br /> Well, wait for it. - there was one thing - a wonderful editing work to remove the profanity for viewers Memorable lines like: "You son with a gun!", "You are the son, and the witch!", "Shoot!" And "Oh, Forget You! " <br /> <br /> Good Bye. <br /> <br /> P.S:. Does anyone know where I can get another poster Lyn Peterson?
