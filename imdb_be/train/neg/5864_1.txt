I am quite sure that it was the worst movie ever made. If you can not make a 13-year old boy laughing at a silly sense of humor, you have to give up comedy forever. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers chose differently. The film is full of predictable gags (some of them are racists) and very unfunny joke. Especially memorable scene where the doctor tells the protagonist that the rabbit died, and he take (as I write this, I can not believe that it was actually a movie scene). A man goes to a dead rabbit on the table and the doctors trying to give him mouth to mouth. ROTFLMAO! NO! Flavor, which can tell you how bad things are in the film, "I knew I had to be on top." Ha-ha-ha-ha-ah fie ........
