"Do not bother to watch the film" would be the best advice, if you like Marilyn Monroe in his other roles. It was a huge disappointment, considering the large cast, not just Marilyn. <br /> <br /> history was not just nothing, of course, nothing of the kind described in the VHS box, of course. There just was not any tension, very little excitement and too many sad places, most of them trying to show why "Nelly" (Monroe) was so messed up. It was not a good role Monroe, although I did not need to see this character, to know that she can act. «Some Like It Hot» was good enough proof for me. But this role is simply not suited to it, and it is not surprising, it is not one of its more popular films. <br /> <br /> It is also too bad the film was a waste of talents as actors Widmark, Anne Bancroft, Elisha Cook Jr., Jeanne Cagney, Donna Cocoran and others. <br /> <br /> Summary: This is not fun and entertainment of the name of the game.
