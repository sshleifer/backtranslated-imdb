I saw this movie called «Tied Up». In general, I enjoyed the movies Dolph, so give this one a try. It's not worth it. I have read some of the previous comments about the box tempting viewers. Do not be fooled. This is a bad movie at best. The action does not exist. The plot, what little there is one, very predictable. places the film seems to be chopped together. This one simply stinks to place up. Not even worth the cheap price of rent by night. As a bit of a fan Dolph, I was waiting to see him in action. By the end of the movie, you will still wait. It is best to avoid this movie, and spend time watching almost anything else.
