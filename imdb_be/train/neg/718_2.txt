The main reason why people still care about "Carlton-Browne Of The Ministry of Foreign Affairs," is that it has a second Peter Sellers role beak. But watch this movie to see Peter Sellers is a mistake. <br /> <br /> Sellers plays Amphibulos, vaguely reptilian premier dirt poor island nation Gaillardia, a former British colony, is now hosting many Russian digger in the midst of the Cold War. Amphibulos wants to play as the United Kingdom and Soviet interests against each other for easy money, "all very friendly and all of our card under the table." . Terry-Thomas is the title character, a lazy British diplomat tries Gaillardia show that the UK has not forgotten them, seems to be the other way around <br /> <br /> The positive review here says: "The reason why this movie is considered to be an average value, so that is understated comedy ". I would say that the reason for the "Carlton-Browne» is considered to be below average, because comedy is not there. <br /> <br /> After a decent opening, which establishes only two strong points of the film, a sympathetic half-witted Terry-Thomas and full-on impishly by John Addison, things quickly slow down to a series of slow burns and misunderstanding lame jokes. Low view of Carlton-Browne of his boss and uncertainty Gaillardia (which no one can find on the map) milked to death. By the time we actually get to the island (after a series of jokes hindered airsick), expectations are quite low. <br /> <br /> They are still too high, though. The island, which seems to exist either in Latin America or the Mediterranean, so miserable his honor guard faints at the airport, and the review stand collapses in the middle of the parade. The army seems to be still horse-drawn, allowing another lame ear cap thick accent speaker: "In the war, the Army uses a lot of horses." <br /> <br /> Sellers never quite in focus, even if we "again on the island its character. The plot is taken instead Ian Bunn as the king Loris, who inherits the throne Gaillardia after the murder of his father. Bannen sad and plays a role as direct as it is written. As a rule, this will make it a likely target for scene-stealing using vendors, but a trap for greasy accent and greasy mustache, Sellers only a threat to those of us who remember him much happier in the other two films made that year, "the mouse that roared "and" I'm all right, Jack ". <br /> <br /> it is surprising that this film, like" Jack ", was the production of the brothers Roy Boulting Boulting with here, serving as co-director with Jeffrey Dell . Usually Boulting films combine wicked social satire with comedy permissiveness, but there is only the Pamirs in shots in any direction. Amphibulos works his garbled English vibe for the whole of its value ( "This man, as you say, a bull in a Chinese ship"), while the Carlton-Browne, usually ragged on him chief of significantly more than he seems to deserve. <br /> <br /> weakest and lingering element of the film is a romance with a young Loris Ilyena. one point for it played a great Luciana Palazzi, a dock for what they apparently cousins ​​never solved. <br /> <br /> The film closes with a convincing set revolution, whose decision is not a surprise as no surprise, and the last bit of action Carlton Brown, who seemed to nail the lid on his coffin literally. Apparently, he lives to see another day, but the film of the same name is strictly DOA.
