Gloria Victor and Dolores Reade in space suits girls. <br /> <br /> I love the 50 Sci Fi, I even love the cheesy 50s Sci Fi, but this film is very, very bad. And not in some kind of way of MST3K. <br /> <br /> Almost unwatchable as a couple profane do your best "hip cat" impression Abott and Costello. <br /> <br /> Chessecake can usually save the cheese SCI fi, for example, Â«Cat Women on the Moon", but it can not in this case. This movie requires the release button and fast. <br /> <br /> However, I could see Gloria and Dolores walk around the spacecraft for about an hour or so.
