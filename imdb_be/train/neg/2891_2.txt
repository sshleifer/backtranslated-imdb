I begin to write this review during the break, as I watch the film. This is the first time I tried it, but I'm having trouble getting through it without occasional breaks. This is not because it is intense, but because it is bad. <br /> <br /> it's almost painfully difficult and incredibly, especially when reliable unnatural dying brother Ryan (Colm Feore) on the screen as a tragic and bitchy, self-indulgent and self -pitying. It would be much better movie if they had just left the character of the story. <br /> <br /> It does not add anything other than sugary, sentimental, very annoying melodrama. Maybe someone decided that if they could not do Ryan believable they just make it unpleasant. The problem is: who cares, when the spoiled, whining, obnoxious jerk dies? Not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that this character is for him is that he is dying, and I'm sorry, but that's just not enough. Dying does not make anyone special. We all die, sooner or later. He did not give anyone the right to expect sympathy, acting like a jerk. <br /> <br /> The other two characters, and the actors playing them (David Cubitt Theo and Chandra West as Sarah), a lot more interesting, and their history, without self-pity breaks Ryan would do a much better film . But it is not over and it is time again to hit PLAY. Maybe something big going on until the end .... <br /> <br /> not. Sorry. It leased the turkey back tonight!
