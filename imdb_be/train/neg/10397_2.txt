Just not the quality I expected from Morris (love Brass Eye and Blue Jam). It is pretty much not a bad student film. As for me, in all of this is to win a BAFTA WHY ??? Maurice ridicules "fixed mediocrity" (Ayn Rand) in a large part of his work (Nathan Barley), and yet this part of pee down the back of the talented and tell us your rain! <br /> <br /> I just hope that he chose the topic, I would like to do (humanity terrorism - Four Lions), he's not going to cock that up, losing the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of the ruling ignorance and views on these emotional and strongly twisted phenomena.
