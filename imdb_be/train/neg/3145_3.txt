I do not know how they are related, but I'm almost certain that he had lost and Delirious remake of the film (or the story that it is based on). Very similar story, and even some of the scenes and sets look very, very similar. Lost and Delirious is actually much better than the movie, so to see that one instead. <br /> <br /> This one is moving very slowly, but being at the end of the 60s French film that can be expected from the style. This was reported in retrospect, from the point of view of one of the girls are reviewing school. Editing a flashback to the current frame is a bit confusing at first, especially with audio out of overlays (ie, hearing the memories, seeing the real thing, and vice versa). In addition, the "girls" a little old to think that they are in boarding school. Finally, not much character development to get even you are attached to a movie.
