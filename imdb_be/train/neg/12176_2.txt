Original Sun trancer any means a great movie. He had a huge plot holes and very little in the way of internal logic. Nevertheless, it was interesting, it is better to do than most low-budget B-movies, and can be surprisingly witty. Unfortunately, trancer II are neither one of them. <br /> <br /> transerova II suffers from many of the same problems as most sequels flop. The plot is thin enough to see through, and the sheet is tasteless. It seems that the people behind this film felt like something familiar faces behind the first film will be enough, and do not bother with anything else. Not even veteran actors B-Class as Tim Thomerson and Jeffrey Combs could continue the film of dirt <br /> <br /> A brief overview of the story :. Jack Deth (Thomerson) is a police officer from the future, which was sent in 1985 to rescue the ancestral members of his government. Trancer II takes place six years after the events of the first trancer. Jack Deth is married to Lena (Helen Hunt), a woman he met in the first film, and both live with Hap Ashby Deth man was sent into the past to protect. He found that Whistler's brother (the bad guy from the first film) has traveled back in time to build an army trancer, people have turned into mindless killing zombies to kill Ashby. Jack complicates the task is the fact that his first wife, who died long before Jack went back in time, and was sent back to stop his brother Whistler, and now Jack finds a job with it. <br /> <br /> I have two real problems with this film. One of them is the method of creating trancer in this movie is radically different from the methods used in the first film. What makes it annoying is that, in a poor example of Soviet revisionism, they act as it has always been equipment. <br /> <br /> Another thing that annoys me is that the love triangle between Deth, Lena, and Alice Stilwell (first wife of Jack) is given very little time on the screen. It bothered me, especially because it was much more interesting than the actual plot of the movie. He felt that it was just something that was thrown to fill the space in the film. Alice's character, in particular, seems to be very indifferent to the fact that she was reunited with her husband only to find that he had married again, making it either very small or very badly written. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can think of to see this movie, if you are interested in viewing the entire series trancer (currently only six films). Otherwise, even if you're a fan of the original trancer, stay away from it for a cool.
