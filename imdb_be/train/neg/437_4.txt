(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> I am very interested to see this film, after he heard that he was a clever and witty. I had to stop halfway due to unbearable I felt <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film would be acceptable :. It shows a method of relationship between a man and a woman develops through all the problems and difficulties that the two people who live in a big city can experience. What made me dislike the entire film two things. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film was so mundane that it looked as if describing the problems that the couple must decide on the day -to-day basis, it has become the most common and boring. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the general untidiness of production, with dialogues that were barely understood. <br /> <br /> It is very bad.
