After watching the preview, I feel that this film will be a good improvement compared with this fast and furious series. Thus, I expected it to byt_nast lack of storyline, but at least this time he will not be loaded with a bunch of powerless citizenship with fart banks. Unfortunately, I was wrong. . If you could only imagine the Fast & Furious movie with the worst storyline, than by all means, this film is for you <br /> <br /> This is the absolute worst film I've ever seen (I have to be good - no, I would not take a baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said). Not only that, the storyline does not exist, but the action was crap too. I believe that the director thought that they could just throw a bunch of women and exotic cars, and then call it a movie. For example, there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the NOS button and Lamborghini takes off into the air and flies over the SLR McLaren, to win. And after a bit, where Eddie Griffin got in a fight with one of his "girls" (Imus comment will work in this case) asks the girl to stop and get out of the aircraft and, of course, they do in the middle of the desert. After this remarkable scene, I can not anymore. Thus, I only got to see half of the ugliness. This is the first movie that I ever went to. After that I had to stop for some drinks to kill all my damaged brain cells. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option. You better be a local car show and a stop at a strip on the way home. I will keep all of the audience in their prayers.
