I understand the desire to make a film that is sharp and others. I understand that the previous reviewer noted, this is Miss mean the movie. The bottom line is, as soon as the movie ended my first comment was: "This is what happens when the rich princess wants to be a movie star and has no talent" ..... it is using the money the Pope to make a film she wrote, directs, and pay for ..... obviously close to the cinema to realize there was no character development and no directions, such as the beginning, middle and end ..... spy part was good and nervous, but that was point? I have seen women go into the house to find some pictures, the caretaker screw exit side on a very cold night (not likely) to check noise and is working on her guard lover .... the film ends ..... some one enlighten my clueless ARSS ?? I really want to know what was going on .... it was the director's vision ..... why there is no development of a dead lover? Why is there no background on guard? That point night vision? What is the meaning of lipstick on the machine? Why dead guard? Why tell us escaped from the mental / patient radar? What's with the box? Oh, and the lamp that the present, to show the house, whether it is someone "? Territorial? Why? Why caretaker feels that this is his house? This aspect has never pursued ...... as for William Defoe ... I made this film because he was in it and known sharp characters ..... write back and tell me what I need to ..I know .. I just mother in Central America who like the movie .... Chris ....
