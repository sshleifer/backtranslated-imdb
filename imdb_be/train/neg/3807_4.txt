Do not get me wrong, I'm a big fan of many of the films of Woody obviously his late 70s masterpieces (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and most of his late '80s / early' 90s dramas (Hannah, crime and Misdemeaners, Husbands and Wives), in fact I even liked some of his recent efforts (Melinda, everything else, Small Time Crooks), but it was horrible, I though it could not be worse than in recent years, Match Point, but how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> It was a lazy plot - mostly hybrids Match Point, Manhattan Murder Mystery and small time Crooks, with all the jokes taken out - Woody seems to be on the way as well, swallowing most of his lines and deliver " cheerful "" catchphrases I mean that with all due respect ... "over and over again until all the languor it becomes much to bare. <br /> <br /> I know that most of the actors are lining up to work with him, but they should at least read the script first - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman is so much better than this - and indeed Woody We should take a role in the future of the camera if it has any meaning about 20 miles behind him. <br /> <br /> This would not be so tragic if we did not have so many great films Woody compare it. - but it is obvious that his best days are behind him, and judging by these efforts, Woody has to call it a day before it becomes industry joke <br /> <br /> Embarrassingly bad
