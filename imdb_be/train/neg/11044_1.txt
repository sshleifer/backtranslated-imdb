Referred to in Australia as a "hydrosphere", it is incredibly bad movie so bad that you are hypnotized and must watch it to the end, just to see if it could be worse ... and it does! The storyline is so predictable that seems written by a high school class of stage sets are helpless, but slightly better than the miniatures, and wooden acting. <br /> <br /> Baby "Mappaet" seems to have been stolen from the props cabinets with «Total Recall». There does not seem to be the only, the original idea of ​​the film. <br /> <br /> I found this film to be so bad that I laughed most of the way until the end. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell should hang his head in shame. He obviously needs money!
