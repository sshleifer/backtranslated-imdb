"Blood Sacred, Blood curse" is a third-party game Gabriel Knight series of adventure games of fraudulent writer / paranormal detective Gabriel Knight. Gabriel and his companion, Grace, asked Prince James of Albany, to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by so-called "night visitors." When the son of Prince James stolen, Gabriel morning visitor spending of Rennes-le-Chateau, where he begins bonding secrets related to the Grail. <br /> <br /> Despite the marketing, this game is not about vampires, vampires have a symbolic appearance in the game, but the team never in the spotlight, as did the bait hounfor in "Sins of the Fathers" or werewolves «The Beast Within». Gabriel and Grace did not make any attempts to uncover the true nature of vampires, or explore the knowledge about vampires. Although vampires killed three people during a game, their victims are chosen randomly and have nothing to do with the main plot. <br /> <br /> Most of the charm of the first two installments of Gabriel Knight was in a relationship that Gabrielle formed with villains. Through these relationships, the player can not help but sympathize with the villain, and thus, the villain has been transformed into a man and less than a monster. However, in "Blood Sacred», only Gabriel's interaction with the villain in one, cheese interview that does not do anything to cause the villain player. <br /> <br /> role pretty useless Gabriel and Grace in this mystery game. Gabriel spend their time tracking the identity of the members of the treasury hunters tour group stayed at his hotel, but what it reveals is nothing more than a red herring. Grace spends her time researching the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, but it is unnecessary to study the presence of puzzling ally who knew the answer to this mystery for centuries. <br /> <br /> This action confused ally and its polar opposite --- --- vampire leader is intolerance. Ally leaves hints about the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau in broad daylight, and expects that the Grace (rather than the other treasure hunters with a tour group) to find them. However, he could have revealed the secret of Grace in full on the 1st day, instead of putting the kidnapped child is at risk for a further 48 hours. And in the end, he simply says Grace secrets in its entirety in any case. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the leader of the vampire would not be able to achieve the goals of centuries of intrigue, because he prefers to refrain from actions in two days after the kidnapping. The only reason given his decision to postpone the action is that he wants to savor his victory. <br /> <br /> The game would have been much better if it focused solely on the Holy Grail. Abduction and vampires have been omitted, replaced by a race against the Vatican, to uncover the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau. Since Gabriel is depicted more than once, as a reluctant Catholic, the conflict would have many opportunities for character development. <br /> <br /> In general, the game was disappointing installment in the series, despite the improved interface and the return of Tim Curry as the voice of Gabriel Knight.
