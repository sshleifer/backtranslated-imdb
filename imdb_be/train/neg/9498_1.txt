When I look at the new cars, I expect to be given boats. When I'm drinking fountain Coke, I should expect that the drink contains a circle. When I watch a film that exaggerates itself with the name of an outstanding scientist, I expect that this is, in a sense, that is related to that person or their work. It could be people who are discussing the diary of my Grannys. The material covered is only relevant in that they vaguely tirade science. I slept for the first time when I tried to watch it, and the second time I stopped watching it. <br /> <br /> I love science & documentaries. I would like to watch them on the latest blockbuster. However, this is not of anything worth your time ?? Avoid at all costs.
