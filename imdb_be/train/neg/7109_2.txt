Now I understand. The name refers to the following immediate reaction of each member of the audience after 68 minutes of mental torture. Trying too hard to be scary, not having a good dialogue even any fear of this thing really makes Screaming Skull looks more like a sad snoring. Albeit, house and property set in black and white really set a darker tone for the film, but that's about it. The only scary thing about this flop that people actually made money on it! Remember grave guarantee in the beginning? This may be the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen on the screen. The sad thing is that the audience probably hoped director Alex Nichol was forcibly placed in the coffin nailed shut, and buried alive for his lame efforts. Jenna contained in this unfortunate terrible situation has never really attracted sympathy you feel for the woman, whose alarm blamed on ghosts, cranial vessel. In addition, her husband, John, comes off as condescending wannabe smooth talker, but it does not work, and he ends up proving how tough he is slapping a helpless cripple around! Oh, Mickey ?? days before you could get a court order against the estate officers like him. This guy approach is not very good, or maybe too much glue airplanes. Nevertheless, in spite of his strange person, Mickey is probably the only good thing going for this film providing slight feeling of fun and I can not get enough of the guy, saying, "It was Mary!" And dig in pots in the greenhouse .
