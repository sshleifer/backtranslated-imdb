Wow ... what can I say ... Firstly IMDb says it's the end of the 60s ... which means Carlito is very close to go to jail, he went to 75, and said that he for 5 years. They used a bunch of no actors, and a story that does not even make sense. They bring back only one actor, Guzman, and HES plays a completely different guy. Why it ended up with him and this puertorikanskomom chicken? Wheres Gale? He said that he was in love with her before. Wheres Kleinfeld? He said that he knew him forever ... You would think that he would be in it. And if it makes sense, where Rocco and black dude in the first? All this was just silly ... It is an insult Pacino and the first film.
