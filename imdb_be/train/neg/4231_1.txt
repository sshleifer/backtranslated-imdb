I was forced to watch this movie all the way through, as I found it in the bin deal and bought it for my own, but I was close many times to turn it off and just writing off the money I paid for it. If you are a fan of gore and sadism that movie OK. If there is one thing that the creators of this film know that the creative use of fake blood and body parts for the sickening effect. If that does not excite you, then stay away. <br /> <br /> This film is based on a home video camera, a primary school props and scary actors. It is dubbed with German, but even with that in mind, the sound is terrible. This film is about the quality of the budget as the budget gets, except the aforementioned special effects, with the exception of. If they spent a bit more money on real actors and a script instead of blood and guts, the film could be a bit more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The story of the three men that the land on the island live the army of tin masks sadists. They are captured, and the rest of the film is about trying to escape. I call it history in the broadest sense, as this is really a series of scenes of torture and the fight strung dialogue meaningless obscenities filled. <br /> <br /> There's nothing at all sacrificial this movie if you like baked nonsense. Consider yourself warned.
