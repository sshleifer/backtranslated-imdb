I thought I read somewhere that it was the last production of monogram, and that is true or not does not matter, because if it is not, then it should have been. It is deadly boring starring John Carradine with some gray in his hair to make himself look like a senior scientist who experimented with the help of his young student (Robert Shayne) bringing the dead back to life. Every time their subjects come alive, they seem to have a whitish face like marble, they are lying tied to the lab bench (big deal). Carradine can not restore his faithful dog back to life after he died, and the dog gets an unusual ability to walk through walls in haunted fashion (wooooooooohhhh). That's all she wrote. <br /> <br /> For the ultra-cheap Monogram defective, this thing at least is actually using a fancy schmancy laboratory setting than usual stand. The funniest joke in the film is that the "senior" Dr. Carradine constantly refers to him as "young" as the assistant Shayne «m'boy», when in fact, Carradine was actually 40, and Shane was 45 when they We did it!
