I slipped on the list of Richard Burton's films, when I came into this title, I remember vividly the moment when I first saw it on cable in 1982, I remember a dialogue with Tatum O'Neal, who was just amazingly bad. I remember the character of Richard Burton looks so hopelessly lost, and then, remembering how his motives are not translated to me. In short, I remember the "Circle of Two," because it was so phenomenally awful. <br /> <br /> This movie came at a time when America is experiencing a period of fascination rather alarming unhealthy or chamfered corners on teenage sexuality. Recall, "Blue Lagoon" (and other annoying Brooke Shields), «Lipstick», «Little Darlings", "the Beau Pere" and other movies, which only seemed to live on teens having sex, especially with adults. As a teenager, at this time, I found that the obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the '70s and' 80s, made in the subconscious disturbing environment in which to figure it all out, so to speak. <br /> <br /> "Two circle" not execrably act or gift lascivious like "Blue lagoon". In fact, it addresses the issue of love between young and old in a bold, if not wholly failed, by the way. But honestly, this is one of those movies will not * ever * see if you have not seen it on the first run, because it was really so awful. Nobody would like to see this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again.
