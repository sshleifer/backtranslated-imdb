Whether it is "worse" Star Trek TOS episode? Maybe, at least, he gets my vote as the bottom 5. I mean, this episode has absolutely no freaking sense. Seeing that makes you go crazy? Give me a break. This episode also has a different feel to it, amplified music, almost forced to increase the feeling of tightness, to the fact that it sucks. Give me some Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, higher beings, as the Triskelion-th or anything, but Medusin these are very sad by aliens to make an episode around. Mack gets to utter his famous phrase, "He's dead, Jim." Spock wears goggles when transporting Ambassador far, but Kirk does not. They go through this uncontrolled "barrier" is now the third time that I can remember, boring. At least a third season in the following episodes will be "ghost Gun" and "Day of the Dove" and the others to follow, which makes Trek decent show to watch in syndication, where he would choose someone like me, as avid fans. Personal observations, Trek liked to use purple color, it kind of pinkish-purple, like when they are in the corridor department, ladder, which is usually gray now purple. We have never had a purple bridge, but it is interesting to see, I saw a few episodes, it was done by a filter, and it works very well, but in this episode, in the courts of the corridor is quite inaccurate.
