Thus, the first "Oh," was a classic. Pretty good werewolf film, which I admit has started slowly, but gaining momentum on the way to have a good enough finish, the TV presenter has become a cute werewolf only to be shot by the camera. So that made for an entertaining horror movie, to be sure ... well, forget all that, as the film has nothing to do with this film. Yes, of course, they're kind of doing it, that anchor woman of the same, and that her brother or something wants to find out what and why things went down as they are, but they go on a cozy little retreat from the first film in Transylvania or somewhere here, where they have to fight the evil werewolves magician or something. I often wonder what makes this film in the world, Christopher Lee, but I've read stuff here, where he says that he has never been a werewolf movie before, but still read the script before you take on the role. Maybe you could get in "An American Werewolf in London" Hell, that could be possible. It was established in London in the end. Heck, werewolves do not seem to understand much in this film for a rather strange and lengthy sex scenes, except. In fact, the death of the most memorable in this film for me was when one gal started to speak loudly and the ear of one man began to bleed.
