This is one of the worst movies I've seen lately. If a person says that he wants, he was a superpower, to be able to orally pleasure myself I pretty much consider the film to be in the realm of children's 14-year-old male fantasies. Bed room scene was on top, and reduce an intimate moment in a farce similar biological functions associated gas in public places. From the first scene of each other was a discussion about how little sex where they are, how long it's been since they got some when their next sexual intercourse is, and who he should be. In addition, dialogue and action were very poor and very forced, not felt, and they filled their lack of content with sloppy sex scenes. This could be really funny, because the concept is really interesting, but poorly executed here. Please do not even think about taking anyone under 16, you should go and see.
