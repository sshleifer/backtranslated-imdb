Man, even Plan 9 from Outer Space is better than the movie. This film does not have enough land for half an hour, but they were able to extend it for an eternity for over an hour. Jet Li and Measles Yueno pretty good, especially to the exaggerated fight, but things such as The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is much better than this sorry thing that would be better left unmade.
