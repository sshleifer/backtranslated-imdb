Roberto Colombo has two jobs full time. He is known worldwide as the ubiquitous television journalist. Less well known, but no less Effortful are his exploits as a full-time philanderer. <br /> <br /> I saw `Vivre pour VivreÂ» dubbed in English under the title "Live for Life". Some life! Robert seems to always have at least three women in his life: a mistress on its way out, one on her way to and cheated on his wife at home. It helps that Robert is a glib con artist. Among his most useful lies 'I'll call you tomorrow' and` my work took longer than planned. He spends a lot of time and money on planes, trains and hotel rooms for him ties sequences. You wonder if this guy caught with his pants down. <br /> <br /> Some may find his life interesting, but I thought it would be tedious. His companions, including his wife, Catherine, all attractive and desirable woman. But his life is so troubled, and it is so deceptive, you wonder if he enjoys it all. <br /> <br /> Adding to bore large frames that do not further the plot. There are extended areas that do not have dialogue or French-only dialogue. We see documentaries of war, torture and training of troops mixed with live action. If the return flight of Robert from Africa, we will wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport. <br /> <br /> Annie Girardot is an outstanding performer in the film. Hers was the most interesting character, and she played it to perfection. It was also nice to see Candice Bergen in the beginning of his career. I can not find fault with the performance Yves Montand that was basically immoral homeless. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed some of the new techniques in Claude Lelouch. In the hotel room scene, the camera pans across the room, as Robert and his girlfriend argue. We catch sight of them for a short time of each pass through the room. In another scene, mounted on sleeper trains, Robert lying on the top bunk, and his wife is on the ground. Robert gives his wife some important but depressing news, but we hear only part of it because of the roar of the train. I felt that his wife was also not able to absorb every word because of the shocking nature of the news. I also liked the scene exciting safari in Africa. Cinematography these scenes and those in Amsterdam was excellent. <br /> <br /> I reviewed this film in the framework of the Library of Congress. I called the project fifty: 50 Notable Films Forgotten for 50 years. As far as I can tell, this film, like the other forty-nine I identified, was not in the video, TV shows, or distributed in the United States since its initial release. In my opinion, he deserves to be available again. <br /> <br />
