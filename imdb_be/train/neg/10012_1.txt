This film should be in line for the most boring film in recent years. Harrison did not even wood can save the film from sinking to the bottom. <br /> <br /> The killing in the film should be a point of interest in this film, but it's not, nothing of any interest. The cast is not bad, but the script is just awful, I just sat bewildered in this film, thinking, how on earth can anyone find this movie entertainment <br /> <br /> The creators of this film were very clever, they We made a boring film, but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses in their actors. People will go to blockbuster and is likely to see this movie and I think Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe it should be good, and to make this film. (Boy, they during the terrible time) <br /> <br /> If you like to fly off the handle and remove the film, some people actually liked this movie, but I love to watch movies with meaning
