This film about male escort involved in the investigation into the murder, which took place in the circle of powerful men's wives. <br /> <br /> I thought, "walker" will be exciting and interesting, but I was so wrong. Walking painful and painfully slow that even after 40 minutes of the film does not happen much. Seriously, the first hour can be condensed into ten minutes. Here's how slow it is. <br /> <br /> The fact that it lacks any thrills or scenes exacerbates depression. It's almost shocking that even the argument scene is so simple and devoid of emotion. Maybe it's because of the stiff upper lip of higher social class? <br /> <br /> It's sad that «Walker» becomes a sad mess, despite such a strong cast. Blame it on a bad story and worse walking.
