The second half of the revolutionary biography of Steven Soderbergh's Che Guevara engaged in his last company to export the revolution in Bolivia. In order to keep it holy face of Che Soderbergh convenient jumping frog of mass executions he presided after the revolution in Cuba and the stupidity of his Congo adventure ( "This is a story of failure," he writes in the preface to his Congo Journal), in order to fully focus on Che attempts to ' combine support to rebel against the government of Bolivia. It would be a disaster and the final act of Guevara. <br /> <br /> What hurts the first chapter takes the example here Soderbergh slows the film to crawl explore blissful contemplative countenance Guevara once again play as James Dean in the eastern part of Eden Bernicio del Toro. The problem is that Guevara has little to have succeeded in gaining new converts, and he soon discovers that his fellow hunger striker to be absorbed into the heart of darkness of the Bolivian jungle. In contrast to the Werner Herzog in the beautiful, Soderbergh Aguirre is unable to use the metaphorical possibilities of the jungle, to reinforce guerrillas despair. He seems to be more concerned about keeping Che halo over his head, than learning setting in a dead panic Enders. There is one Herzogian when Che sits astride a stubborn horse kicking and screaming to get him to move, but the overall direction Soderbergh's own stage remains flat, sloppy and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> In both films Soderbergh shows that it is clearly a fan of Che and because of this, his focus is short-sighted and narrow. He spends too much time building a monument to Che and too little in the development of its relations with key players in his saga, especially Fidel Castro. And what is worse, it does so with a slow and indifferent approach that never ignited. It would seem that he was immersed in enough Eisenstein and Vertov, to understand that radical changes have shown much better with sweeping style.
