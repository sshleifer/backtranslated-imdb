Darkly comic serendipity of cosmetics saleswoman, with odd connections with Elvis Presley, which flows into the Sea of ​​Elvis impersonators, speaking at conventions in Nevada ... and accidentally kills one of them on a small fault of her own. Kim Basinger, still life, attractive actress of considerable merit, likes to choose movies for dodgy games, but this horrible scenario (Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) does not have an iota of good mood.

I hope she and Elvis are well paid. star is not from ****
