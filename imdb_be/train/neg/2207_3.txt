Hammerhead is a combination of scientists and between wild-killers shark movie genres. In just casting type, Jeffrey Combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a human / shark hammerhead being. Bizarrely, this creature is actually his son, he turned into a monster to prevent his death from cancer. Or something. <br /> <br /> minded group invited to the private island of the scientist. They end up being used as bait sharks or shark mat. For some unknown reason, the IT leader has been brought together in this team. Who knows why? Fortunately, he is smart, when more overweight, Ramboesque hero. I have been working on what he has learned how to handle a gun as part of his day job, working in support of the 1st line. A good day for the man supposedly includes fixing someone's network connection with a subsequent call submachine gun pulled villain. Or perhaps a call to fix someone's computer should be scheduled between the physical collisions with ground-based people-shark hybrids? In any case, it is strange and saves the day. He even get a girl. <br /> <br /> The shark-man is a bit weak, but the creation of good, I believe that, based on the overall effects in this movie. And the film moves on at a decent pace. This is a complete deception, of course, but if you buy a movie called Hammerhead, and expect that this will be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a person become a killer of ground fish, then in fact you have no one to blame but yourself. As it is, there is a weapon, blood, girls, and perhaps even an exploding helicopter. This is rubbish, but not as bad as some might say.
