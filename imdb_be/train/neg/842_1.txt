This is not the fault of Michael Madsen, it is unlikely it. This movie was horrible. If you want to laugh and be bored, go ahead and watch this movie. Words can not describe how idiotic it is. Unfortunately, Michael. Cinematography was dark. All the other actors are not known. When viewing, it feels like a soft porn, but no nudity or heated scenes. This film had sexual overtones, since we are talking about the underground S & M killer. The acting was bad, except for the parts of Michael Madsen. It seemed that he wanted to laugh. I hope he got well paid for this lousy movie. This is something that I might not be proud of. It is not even B-video cable, it is more similar to the F and it should never be given ever.
