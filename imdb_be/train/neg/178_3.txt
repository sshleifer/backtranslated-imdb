This film was made for television, so taking into account, I will not tear at it so much as to a feature film. subpar scenario, but it can not be a little humorous spot, whether it be or no means. It operates mainly over-the-top, but it's true for many low-budget films. <br /> <br /> In the aspect of the film that I really hate, though, is that 90-95% of them are shot on film, but in random places, there will be 5-10 seconds when footage shot on video. You can tell because there is less contrast, less bright color, and frames are clearly 30 frames per second instead of 24 frames per second film. I'm not sure if it is possible, these scenes were to be shot later, and while they did not have money to shoot on film (I think that is why, in any case), but it confuses and really makes the film look shoddier than it was supposed to look like. <br /> <br /> In any case, I've definitely seen worse movies, but I do not want to say that I liked this movie, and I can not recommend anything to see.
