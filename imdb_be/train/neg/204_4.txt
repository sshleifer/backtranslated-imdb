Perfect Murder thwarted when his wife (played by Mary Ellen Trainor, such as the wife of director Robert Zemeckis, who directed this episode), who kills her husband with a poker, has the misfortune to receive a visitor, it's going to go insane escaped outside..an body madman dressed in a Santa Claus suit (Game vile disgusting Larry Drake). She retorts for their lives, trying to find a way to hide the corpse of her husband. She decides to use an ax, once the fall she Sant killer who misses several chances to cut off the woman's head to the killer shot for the murder of her husband. Santa killer locks her in the closet, and pursues the daughter of a woman as she tries desperately trying to free himself, to save the child. <br /> <br /> This episode of Tales from the Crypt simply recycles tired material with the old "kill Santa" theme while adding that it is often used (add nausea) woman-killing-her-husband-to-a were male-She's-was-scam-routine. This is essentially Traynor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body, it kills at the same time maintaining a safe distance from the maniac. There's nothing new or refreshing in this area, which largely takes place through movement. Not one of the highlights of the show.
