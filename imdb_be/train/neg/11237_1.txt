I went to see this movie with low expectations, but in the hope of being fascinated by seeing my hometown on the film. Unfortunately, that's all I got. History covers familiar territory (high school reunion), but the plot is convoluted and the supernatural element adds little to this worn subject. Although the quality of the acting was good overall content of the movie it was terrible. Sexism film was flagrant - woman, apparently unfulfilled if they are not married, procreating, or both (although it was couched as a post-feminist choice). Even worse was racism - pitched Jewish mother, a black man, who still lives in the home-- and gratuitous brutality (excruciating class freak). We should be ashamed if these characters are believed to represent the residents of the city of Kalamazoo, and the authors have brought angry with such broad and rigid patterns on the screen.
