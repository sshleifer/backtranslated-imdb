I watched "Envy" Two days ago, on DVD, at a friends house. The premise of the film is very promising, Jack Black and Ben Stiller in the comedy with a lot of potential, but it does not deliver. I watched it with five friends, and no one laughed the whole movie. Jokes (which are few and far between), not funny in any way ... storyline shit, and they never answer the question ... WHERE OR SH * T GO? Of course, the answer to which no one cares. This film does not have any value comedy, as well as several other members said that the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching Christopher Walken as the J-man. None of the characters are not developed, the portions are so thin that it is almost transparent - and this song throughout the film to be funny ??
