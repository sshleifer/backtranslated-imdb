This movie makes me think that other that I have seen with Combs had an accident. The site had more holes than I think I've ever seen in a movie claims to be something more than a "B" movie. The action was so funny that even the memory of past victories mannered combs was enough to save it. Given the scenario, I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for such things as continuity and original ideas. I am totally disappointed that I paid the price for this garbage Blockbuster. The fact that it was made for television was something that would help me avoid the crime and openly that the film is poor should be required to warn you. Avoid this film no matter what.
