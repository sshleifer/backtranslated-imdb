This film relates the type alleged is not the establishment (the aesthetic and sexual), which, apparently, can not withstand basic romantic needs. Although some excellent players take part, including Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant, and Cynthia Nixon, they are based on a child's script, which is based almost entirely on the reasonable dialogue; which is not. Nixon's role has the best lines, but it is often home in on them too quickly, this is a temporary error, which should be difficult to director. Grotesque climax uses all available clich√©s spent or not, and worthy finishes this monotony attempt comedy.
