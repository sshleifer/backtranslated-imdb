I can not believe that someone like this movie. I saw a lot of low-budget indie films, but this one is absolutely sucks. Low budget does not mean that the film should be wisely. Horror does not mean that the film should be wisely. There was nothing wrong with this movie at all. It was just a blood-fest and particularly disturbing in this. The action was, on average, given that they were unheard of actors, but the story was deplorable, the dialogue was miserable. The film tries to come off as "art," or something. This is not one of those really great indie films that cost only a few thousand dollars to do, but very well done. It was nothing more than an excuse for some very sick people to put their vicious obsessive on film. Other reviews here have also said that the soundtrack sucked ... it's because most of them were written by one and the same person, and some of the songs were written by one of the authors of the film. There were no redeeming qualities in this film at all. A complete waste of my time and money.
