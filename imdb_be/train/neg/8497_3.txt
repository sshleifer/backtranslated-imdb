My name should be enough. <br /> <br /> It baffles me that the culture is so rich in literary skill (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) will be a large number of such nonsense as «Nouvelle Vague» cinematic movement. Until the 20th century, France had a long tradition of artistic awareness and rational philosophy. But the minute you hand them a movie camera, they begin to act like WOOOHOOO LOOK WEIRD AS CAN BE! The plot? TOPIC? Ugh! LET'S FILM entertainment PARK RIDE circling & ROUND! At least it's not as bad as Godard (who has an unhealthy fascination with people's heads spin. Oh-la-la, Kehl artistic.). No, Truffaut supports the degree of visual clarity. But it is also a security camera on a quickie-mart. Two indistinguishable <br /> <br /> Haha, just as an aside, that all that you dweeby film school nerds :. Probably the veins popping out of the neck right now. But do not leave without reading the last sentence of my review. <br /> <br /> In any case, if you like French literature, you will hate it. People who like this film will probably never read, except delirium of Jack Kerouac, or perhaps "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" book. Or, maybe they read poetry to the door of the songs, and they think that this is deeply touching. Whatever EPA sailing boats. I find it ironic that the film introduces some (weak) allusions to Balzac, one of the most beautiful and the most significant writers who ever lived. Nice try, truffles. But you're nowhere near a football field. <br /> <br /> In order to avoid this film as AIDS-infected syringe. <br /> <br /> If you're the type of person who loves to think, then stick with Jean Cocteau (Orpheus), Robert Bresson (Pickpocket) and Japanese master Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (Qaeda) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO onna). <br /> <br /> If you are an idiot, enjoy Truffaut, Godard and Andy Worhol. And for Pete push that back a vein in the neck. You look like a cabbage.
