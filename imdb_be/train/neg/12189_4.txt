I am surprised that this film is rated so high, though, if I go with a characteristic scale of the class is 71 c- or d so perhaps that's all right, but this movie was just a typical thriller, except sickening slow and unrealistic. Not that the typical thriller is realistic, but it seemed to be trying, and yet a woman who had not knocked the charges because she did not want to be cross-examined in court, even if it would put the person who broke it hand beat the shit out of her and raped her away to live there, but also protects the lawyer whom she had feelings and his family are not just random people she did not even know. There were similar problems with the film, which would have been nice if there was some moral to take away from the film, but in a few moral questions as well was to attempt to kill / beat Kadi, before he did anything illegal had presented a bit of a one-sided since Kadi eventually be just crazy bastard bent on revenge so sure the lawyer was justified in defending his family, because in anticipation of Kadi actually rape his daughter, so that he could do something about it legally would be a little absurd. So now I just waisted more life to this silly movie so please do not see it so, at least, your life will not be the state and thus has a 2 1/2 hour or so meant something.
