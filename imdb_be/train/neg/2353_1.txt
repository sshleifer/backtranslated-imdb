Madhur has given us a powerful film Chandni Bar in the past. His next film Page 3 was one of the worst films of all time. This, perhaps, explains some of the high class people in India. After viewing the scene, where a person makes another person for sexual reasons in the movies. I felt like spitting and rip DVD. Coincidence I did. The reason why was the film contains scenes of child pornography and sexual abuse. I literally tore and was shocked to see the film, which shows the naked child. Very disturbing things, there was no need to show the child's completely naked. One of the richest guys love to abduct the poor children and sell them to foreign nationals, the British men in this film. I'm shocked to find out that this film was a hit in some parts of India, otherwise super flop in the UK, USA and Australia. I'm from the UK, and this kind of thing makes me sick, not one has been released in the UK.
