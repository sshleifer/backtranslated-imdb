This film was a disaster from start to finish. Interspersed with performances by the "next generation of beautiful losers" are interviews with Bono and The Edge, as well as the performers themselves. This leaves little time for a clip of Leonard Cohen, which towers over all the others in the film with his commander even gentle presence, wisdom and humor. The rest are too busy trying to canonize him as a saint Leonard, or something of the Old Testament prophet. Many of the performances forget over-interpretations (especially Rufus and Martha Wainwright), or under the fresh achievements. Only Beth Orton and Anthony got within reach of their own versions of Leonardo, using a bit of restraint. Annoying little pseudo-avant-garde gestures penetrate into film as the focus of superimpositions red balls on many of the concert and interview rounds, blurred shaky camera work, the use of digital delay on some of the comments of Leonard Cohen (making it difficult to hear spoken) and spooky, pretentious low rumble under a lot of interview segments (attempt to add meaningful?). For the real thing, to see the lyrics of Life documentary Air Force in 1988.
