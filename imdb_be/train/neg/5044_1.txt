I can not wait to see this movie after reading a positive review in The New York Times. In addition, I also Shanghainese so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject. However, after watching, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> the pace of the film has been painfully slow and monotonous. Director was delayed for some scenes are too long. There was no passion or chemistry between the lovers. It was hardly a dialogue. The dialogue was very necessary to compensate for the lack of action. At the end of the movie, you do not feel any compassion for the characters. This film is not lacking in everything. The script was weak acting was poor, and there was no editing. The director tried to imitate some of film noir style, but failed miserably. A good film, in which one grabs your attention and keeps it well in prison without your sense of time gone by. This movie felt like it would never end. Do not waste your money on this film.
