Now I had the best of intentions, watching it. I like some of the work by Tony Scott, and my friend told me that it was a great movie, although I've heard otherwise from other people. But it was simply hopeless. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, Tony Scott was trying too hard. All this was too much. Let me elaborate. <br /> <br /> Miss Knightley was the replays, and not in a good way. People who work so well, was Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Walken, but their screen time is simply not able to save the film. <br /> <br /> There were a few scenes that jumped in its originality, but for some reason it seemed that they were written by someone other than the main writer. Certain melody has been used about 4 times that an error actually starts after the second time. I firmly believe, is not using the same melody a few times. <br /> <br /> In addition, the editing is really facing the same as the cutting speed is high enough. Oh, and repeated repeating certain lines Keira just sounded cheesy, having heard it on the second, third, fourth, and so on. <br /> <br /> In general, my opinion is that if you want to see an action movie, which is a high rate, and "a few" funny, and you do not care about everything I mentioned above, you could would it, <br /> <br /> (On a side note: I'm not a fan of Keira Knightley).
