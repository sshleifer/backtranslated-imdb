«Tapeheads», patchwork, occasionally funny parody video music business might be the perfect comedic short, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are easy in the midst of absurd chaos participation. They play two semi-savvy guards in Los Angeles, who start their own company, the video Aces, making funny videos for groups, parties and one dying star. It's too bad the filmmakers had to invent a dull side plot to the site of work time (fraud involving curves politicians and his minions, who do not, but to take on the primary force of the film, sending up a musical culture from the late '80s). Still, Cusack and Robbins create multiple originals here: nerdy, but free, street smart without hipsters or noisy, these guys are on the same wavelength nutty, and they never put each other down. They are the real thing in the friendly comedies. * 1/2 ****
