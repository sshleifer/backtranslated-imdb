I read all the comments on this film. I'm a big fan of <br /> <br /> The Dalai Lama. So I read the book on which it was based <br /> <br /> film. The film is ugly and humiliating truth fictionalization. I do not criticize him <br /> <br /> changes in small parts or events for dramatic purposes; it <br /> <br /> not a documentary. But the scenario changes the exposure reaction, <br /> <br /> realnosteya, as well as changes in each main character. This significantly changes <br /> <br /> real relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. <br /> <br /> From the ridiculous competition for Tibetan woman (which degrades <br /> <br /> culture of Tibet) in a music box gift h√§rra, in a Harrar's <br /> <br /> changes in the heart , everything about this film lies - except <br /> <br /> for amazing photos. I understand that the shots <br /> <br /> Potala (palace) were smuggled out of Tibet. However, <br /> <br /> change the real story about the relationship between two people, <br /> <br /> One of them is very important to this world, in order to build <br /> <br /> boring movie star
