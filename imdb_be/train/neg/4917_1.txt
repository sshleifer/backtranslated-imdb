Spoiler **** **** <br /> <br /> Absolutely without a doubt one of the funniest comedies ever produced for the screen. Absolutely impossible to take it all seriously. It would take a novel to list all the main comedy routines in it. In the glory days of the program, Carol Burnett and companies that often do takeoffs on movies, strung it in a way that was hard to imagine. Carol played Jenna, who suddenly fell ill with a slight cough syrup and immediately came up with the music, and they all looked around wondering where he is and where. Harvey Korman played Oliver flowing locks and almost looks liked Ryan O'Neal. The only thing funnier than this bit, it's a real movie. <br /> <br /> What death scene at the end. Jenny really looks like it is well-dying ... dying for her make-up artists to come and give it a little color. And, of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage anyone to get in bed with them in the last moments of the patient. End of Ryan O'Neal scene sitting on a bench in the snow, contemplating his future in the movie business is a classic. He had a lot to worry about. He will never recover from this.
