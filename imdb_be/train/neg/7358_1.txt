This film takes a lifetime style average age of divorced victim who finally fights back the genre to new depths of cartoonish absurdity. <br /> <br /> There is 40-something ex-wife homebody successful lawyer protagonist (the daughter in college) is starting a new life after divorce, women's college friend helped in the discovery of a new clothing store as a native extension of the franchise deal. She even started friendship with its attractive, a little younger, perhaps, landscape architect / gardener (who is black). But horror of horrors middle-aged women, the second 20-something woman, she accepted as a tenant, to the room that starts to "take over" her life. <br /> <br /> With this new threat to the younger woman really gently flirting with the gardener, and to offer him a glass of wine, that * choking * really belonged to dilute !! She runs a utility bill, not excluding the thermostat !! and copied the toilet! and leaves the old food has gone bad in the refrigerator! And part of it hangs (African) works of art in the living room !! And so on. Well, it can kill a cat as well. Yes, well, to what extent does these things is bad enough .. but he was more than a little ridiculous, the more that it turns into the nature of reality is that any small part of this will lead this particular woman with a prim mind (so why did she rent a room - and horror of horrors, much younger woman) <br /> <br /> this is presumably more bombastic (of course), a young woman has a mania seizing control. And our brave 40-we must learn to fight against this evil (and sexy hot looking, of course) 20-something. But there is this problem. At any time, 20 starts, can get into trouble, she uses her power - and just flirting or having sex with some guy, and runs away from the consequences. (Well, actually something that looks good ability 20 Somethings. It's just not * do * used quite like that method). <br /> <br /> The room moved along the device 20 is to cheat with diluted formalizing their rent rooms deal with the written lease made it. Of course, 40 is not aware of these things, and the 20-something had help. Rentals actually gives young women an equal right to the house during the term of the lease, utilities, added at a fixed price. Although the eviction of production soon is not accepted, the 20-something soon received a temporary restraining order against an elderly woman, allegedly because she threatened to 20-something. You know, a judge sympathetic to all woe-is-me sexy sweet young things. Finally, the "heroic" battle in the 40-something back to the house, then begins. Woopie !! <br /> <br /> The only realistic and insightful thing about this film is easily horrificly TRO (or protection orders) is designed for women to get into no more than her unnecessarily, so to speak - though they usually only it is easy to men. They are sometimes just as unreasonable and just as motivated to take control of the house, as here. In fact, a friend who had moved to their boyfriend can often get them evicted from their own homes or apartments on the basis of no evidence at all, and the only allegation of threats, and sometimes not even hear him. Even if there is a rumor that it is usually impossible to refute the assertion threats (to prove a negative), if the burden of proof on the accused in fact, not the prosecutor. (This is one of the few areas of American law, where this is true - and it is a signal of feminist outrage outwit, and the refusal of any organized group to resist the rink.) Of course, this is likely to be the subject of any non-Lifetime movie in this life. <br /> <br /> The absurd basic premise of this movie is based on the explanation that 20-that is, the psychotic, and it does not take drugs. Even in this case, it does not make any sense. It is not after a successful lawyer ex-husband, although she and Conan its assistance (in ex-wife's fury) in her quest. She then HOUSE (technically, to run diluted with him over the lease term). This is the second youngest woman after all that's left after the divorce, after the situation with the other 20 had stolen her husband !! (Ex-husband seems to be lonely and mostly cautious after his blunder - it does not matter, he still lost !!!) <br /> <br /> The main character is looking quite well for his age. But her appearance, attitude and attention so little exposed, unsightly and quite without imagination or life force, it is impossible to take care of her. Well, the main group Lifetime supporters still, I believe that, based on the average score of a small number of appraisers gave him. (I continued to watch it just because it was so very bad and cartoonish, it was a call to the camp. I could not resist seeing how far they take it.) <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** (if that is possible with this movement). <br /> <br /> Well, that's the key. The film ends with a 20-something to get bail from prison, promising to "listen" to her 20-something male colleague, and sometimes lover, and "do whatever he says" and "let it take care of it" (he means to get her to continue taking her medicine) - and then tricking him and return to the house. There, she climbs the stairs with a knife, demonicly pursues her nemesis 40 something who takes a bath by candlelight, secure in the thought that the younger woman out of her life. In the same struggle - and 40 something mom to win - by sticking to the 20-something with a hypodermic needle full of anti-psychotic medicine, she found. Then she begins to stroke her mother, as well as two women are bonding, female solidarity moment !!! How cute.
