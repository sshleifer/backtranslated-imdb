This movie was definitely not one of Mary-Kate and Ashley's best films. I really did not like it, and I was kind of disappointed in this film. For some reason, it seemed like it was a movie that they have gathered very quickly. In some areas, it has become so boring that I had to fast forward. He did not have any mistakes or any interesting details like their other movies.
