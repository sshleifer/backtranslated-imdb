This film is really only the interpretation of Bill Maher on religion. There are some funny moments and some interesting points, but did not go into this waiting impartial discussion of religion. This is what I believe the worst kind of documentary - Everything is made in advance and in editing, to provide you with the director opinion, instead of you to make your own decision <br /> <br /> editing. - It is very chopped up, between the spliced ​​with clips from pop culture and the media, to reinforce the point. Interlocutor barely has a chance to finish his sentence before he is interrupted editing. The only people given a fair opportunity to speak their mind are those who say that Bill Maher wants to tell them. Once someone face Maher gospel, they are edited <br /> <br /> INTERVIEW -. They are meant to represent the absolute MOST extremist religions. From TV evangelists eventually Jewish stereotype to TRUCK STOP Chapel (Seriously. Lorry STOP Chapel). He chose the worst money grabbers, heavy extremists and those who do not have the budget to say, to pick up on. And if he really gets a good person to interview, he edited the hell out of them <br /> <br /> stereotypes. - All religions are portrayed as stereotypes. Especially hard hit are Muslims. During the Muslim segment, he hardly gives anyone the opportunity to speak before interrupting them either himself or through editing in part with the suicide bombers. All Muslims are portrayed as gun-toting extremists through editing, and none of the people interviewed are not edited enough <br /> <br /> Ending -. Message in the end, it's incredibly heavy-handed, and while this is an interesting idea, it does not include the fair for a lot of people who are not religious extremists. Bill Maher explains itself while playing clips of destruction in the foreground. It literally makes it clear that religion is stupid and dangerous, and that he will destroy the world. He also claims that all those involved in religion is stupid. <br /> <br /> With the film fractures, it has some good points, and humor, while very unfair, really funny. But, you know, went in, and this is a very one-sided view, the opinion of Bill Maher, in religion. He did not open. He tells you what he thinks <br /> <br /> 4/10. - Some good points, but with a very heavy-handed irresponsible documentary style.
