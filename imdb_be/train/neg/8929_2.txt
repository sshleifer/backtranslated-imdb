This hodgepodge of borrowed from the novel by Gore Vidal (in fact, one of the greatest American writers) does MAGIC Christian and Valley of the dolls look like Fellini's art work. Raquel Welch, with an incredible body (and in fact it is not very high) in the title role (for Kansas City BOMBER unless it was pretty good) plays Rex Reed (bad film reviewer, and not a criticism) alter-ego, only to be surrounded by a transvestite (great chicken) Mae West, John Huston horny, young and "naive" Farrah Fawcett (pre Lee Majors, what a shame), and other various creep azoids qualify for substitution is too May things has nothing going in addition between the splice clips of old movies (ie Widmark in a kiss Ku's death, Lena Horne) ... just so that they can continue to bleed the life out of everyone. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10. A better performance = ?. It's so bad, it's worth a look!
