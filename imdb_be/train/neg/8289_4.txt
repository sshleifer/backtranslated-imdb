I'm sorry, but this is a bad movie is fun. Football hooligans traveling house thinking? Costumes? Shades? Alan concepts clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he did it, how far from the truth as you can get. <br /> <br /> Casting was brutal ... Gary Oldman as a football hooligan? He does not look scared, scared to act, or even come across as someone who wanted to be football. And for the Yeti? What the hell? Suits, shades and sits on Travelodge children tease each other with "its about time you got your diaper on." Please. <br /> <br /> And a band of Bigfoot in spraying MIA underwear? <br /> <br /> I do not understand how you can even take this movie seriously!. <br /> <br /> 4/10. Its probably the most inaccurate picture hooliganism crisis late eighties I've ever seen.
