Hi folks <br /> <br /> Forget about the movie. John C. should be ashamed that it serves as an executive producer in the credits. Bon Jovi has never been and will never be an actor and FX are a joke. <br /> <br /> The first vampires were good ... and it was just vampires. This thing is simply bears the same name. <br /> <br /> Just a waste of time to think ... <br /> <br /> Jake Scorpio
