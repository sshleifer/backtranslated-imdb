The basic premise of this film is a political caricature. I suppose, for those who know nothing about the realities of war it is probably "good health," a film about gender equality. Indeed, a recent commentator, said: "This allows women to know that they can do whatever they want to do." What nonsense! No one, man or woman can not do whatever they want to do, and unfortunately Demi Moore "pumping" on SEAL Hell Week at the beginning of the 27-week program BUD / S for a few sessions at a local gym and only her desire SEAL be just is not going to make it so. There is approximately 80% dropout rate that is probably the roughest military training program - those who voluntarily quit, can not compete on a physical level, are often subjected to physical injury during training or can not cope with the psychological harassment. I never got beyond superficial contrived, claimed by this film. In the real world, the Day will not last the first 24 hours in this harsh and sustained physical training. Wishing alone will not do it. Skip this film as wishful thinking, and it is better to spend time reading «The Warrior Elite» Dick Couch (Corona, New York, 2001), for a better description as to what is really going on in this training. Call Day! <br /> <br />
