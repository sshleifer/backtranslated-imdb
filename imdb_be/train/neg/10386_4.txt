It might be interesting ?? Japan set the ghosts of a multistory building in terms of the established American family again ?? but it provides a flat due to overly simplified treatment and the unsuitability as an actor and director. <br /> <br /> The film suffers from the same problems, I often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of the native fare, ie the fact that the spirits show themselves evil no real other reason than they expect ,! In addition, it does not deliver much in the department discourages ?? a giant crab attacks just stupid ?? and, as a rule, ghosts inhabit the specific nature and cause him or her to act in a completely uncharacteristic way, for example, Susan George seduction diplomat / one-off, Doug McClure family and Edward Albert force feeding his daughter a bowl of soup! <br /> <br /> One day, the old monk is home to warn of the dangers of Albert, if they are there ?? in the end, he urged to expel from the premises. However, history inevitably repeats the tragedy of the duly constituted only the result of the tense situation ?? which leads to violent even unintentionally funny climax, in which Albert and McClure, possessed by spirits of its Japanese predecessors, to participate in an impromptu karate duel to the death! In the end, it comes out a harmless time-waster ?? tolerant only 88 minutes, but, in any case, essential viewing.
