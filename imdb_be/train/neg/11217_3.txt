Thus, the wife and I just finished it, despite several threats from both of us, to turn it off. For the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie, it was only a very slight disturbance. The action was brutal, to the point where we actually laughed a few times during some of the worst scenes (Church Lady, for example). Dead sister used paranormal means to contact her living double, though, and do not send useful information that it focuses on how to scare the hell out of her, instead of which was very similar to The Ring. Instead, get the police involved - which I'm sure they would have found it a gag DNA all over them - it is, instead of plotting a terrible plan to "get" people who cover the accidental death of her sister. I call it a terrible plan, because in the end, she allows him to kill her and the film then darkens. Bad dialogue, bad action, bad ending.
