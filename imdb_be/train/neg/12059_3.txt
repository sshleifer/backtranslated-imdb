In the '80s were not very kind to the one-time main star Charles Bronson. Since 1982 "Death Wish II» and ending with this really disgusting movie from '89, writers Bronson seemed to be trying to start with each other in a progressive rudeness. «D.W. II »left a little imagination in the image of rape and suicide of the daughter Bronson hero (rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in gruesome detail). "10 to Midnight" was a kind of disgusting movie that made you want to take a bath after. Nothing about this sacrifice. Other films, like "The Evil that men do," and the rest of the films "Death Wish" during this period straddle the line between high camp and high sick of them sincerely cruelty and revenge. I'm not sure if the producers (usually Pancho Connery) received a blow from the show tired looking senior citizen Bronson age destructive punk young enough to be his grandchildren, or that, but shoddy workmanship (and scary scenarios) with their films usually destroy what that there is little they can generate energy <br /> <br /> «Kinjite». - the last of these films - it's pretty well done, but it really takes the cake in cinematic misery. In this film Bronson: sodomizes perverse Yang; forces the pimp has his Rolex watch; allows male prisoners raped other prisoners; It makes it incredibly xenophobic statements, among other things, which I have fortunately forgotten. Also shown is the gang rape of a young Japanese girl (luckily, it was off-screen, although well-meant). <br /> <br /> What are people thinking when they made this movie? That Bronson was thinking when he decided to destroy his career with these terrible movies? For those who are interested in his best films, check out most of the films he made in the 60s and 70s as "The Mechanic," "Death Wish", "From South Sesame 3", "Once in the West "" Red sun "," The Great Escape "," The Magnificent seven "," The rider on the rain ", etc., etc. ....
