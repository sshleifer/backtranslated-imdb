As a fan of "Jane Eyre" I was thrilled when this movie came out. "Finally," I thought, "someone will make this book into a movie after the story is actually written by the author." Wrong !!! If the casting director was going to quit, "Jane", which was simple, it was definitely a success. But, of course, he could find someone who could also act. Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester? Where was the terrible suspense of the novel, when the laughter floated into the night, seemingly out of nowhere? Where brilliance child who courted and danced like her mother? Finally, why the story has changed at the end? I wonder whether in fact read the book writers. what a disappointment
