Incredible. It has to get any more stupid than that? Not a chance. The stupidity of this film would be a shame even Ed Wood, De Palma and Woo. If the first part in the series was a mediocre dialogue and the second one was bad dialogue, this one has a feeble-minded dialogue. Strange. But this time the story has been reduced to the level of dialogue, too. Despite the actions and dialogue, I liked the first two films, but "Cube Zero" certainly kill the franchise. Absolutely idiotic story so obviously stems from the pen of left winger. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I wonder if such leftists even themselves understand how anti-democracy and dictatorship are. In this film, they are clearly aimed at the United States ?? democracy. Why they do not target Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe, etc. in the anti-war films? Of course, most of these places is unlikely to produce a cube like this anytime soon, but that's beside the point. It is obvious that the authors of garbage like this really admire these kinds of regimes, whether they are aware of it or not. I would even go so far as to say that the one who is attacking us unshakable foreign policy all the time, has an anti-democratic belief in its core <br /> <br /> Back to the film :. In addition, so far-fetched that it is not even funny anymore, the film is replete with obvious illogicality. For example, for some reason, the two men who control the cube made it for a while and not paying attention to the pain and sadism that the project entails, however, the first one than the others suddenly turn against the system! Anyone who has any idea at all about human nature will see right through this idiocy. Or how about the fact that the half-witted character, the evil one-eyed bureaucrat who says, as if he is in a bad comedy Mel Brooks. In fact, as soon as this creature is the movie loses all seriousness and thus any chance to be exciting: it is indeed a comedy.
