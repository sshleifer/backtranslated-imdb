Hard to believe that in 1997, David Duchovny was at the height of his fame, with the X-Files, one of the best sci-fi TV series, at the height of glory. Nine years later, he was almost forgotten, and his tentatives make it to the big screen with a bang failed. I can not even explain why, it is just an actor, but probably his moment of glory threw him in eternal roles, which takes a lot of talent to break out. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Angelina Jolie was much less known, and she was really lucky to have a film like "Playing God" is not brought his career to a standstill. Luckily for her, «The Bone Collector» and "Girl, Interrupted" waiting around the corner, and if Lara Croft came, her career was launched. <br /> <br /> There is not much to be said about this film. It is the only big screen movie, Andy Wilson, and there must be a reason. All banal and most of what is happening on the screen, the expected in this story of ex-doctor who saves the life of victims of shooting in a bar only to find yourself running mob. Voice-overs are particularly bad, with moralistic text, which kills any shade cinematic experience of the movie. You probably will not find a movie, but in the DVD rental stores, or on TV. Try to look for something better.
