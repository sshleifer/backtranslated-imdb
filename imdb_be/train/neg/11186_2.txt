I wanted to see this movie, but a bizarre funny scene after the other made me close it. Character does not seem to respond to anything. Consider this: Heath Ledger is the night (through a cemetery, I believe) when it is subjected to an attack of spirits, which he drives away. Passing this test, he calmly goes and meets with a friend who has seen it all. Asked what will happen, he said softly, "was attacked by demons, nothing serious." As if it were only a little more exciting than later. <br /> <br /> I closed it when they go to ask something- demon or something, I stopped cautious ion Ques. The answer can only be rented to someone with the energy of their death, and booty look that seems to be a vague irritation as the man hung and hung, and they ask him thrashing, dying body issue. <br /> <br /> 0 with **** stars.
