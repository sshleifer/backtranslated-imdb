I saw it sneak in two days before the official opening, and I must say I was very disappointed. And I have to put most of these problems on the solution cast Claire Danes in the title role. Depending on what you think about the Danes, it was either badly miscast, or so far over her head, that it must be a favorite of early 2007 Razzie for Worst Actress. I think we should have been sympathetic to her. Instead, it is completely unsympathetic. Another "great" actresses do the job OK, but, of course, is not displayed on the screen. Of all the "big" actresses in this film, I would say that the one who did the best job was Natasha Richardson. Strip if the figure is only near the end. <br /> <br /> A terrible scenario as well. He comes off more of their reading lines than actually be "in character."
