I just happened to stumble on this channel surfing movie. my first reaction was: "Oh god not again." it is so fashionable to play retard these days it has become pretentious and frankly despicable. For some reason, though, I stayed and watched it till the end. maybe it was my faith in the actors, hoping that they would give me something to cheer about. <br /> <br /> And, of course, Ken and Helena can act. In addition, the film progresses into something better towards the end, and really makes the point. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter also surprised me with his character. Jane has an average side, which she uses to keep your distance and pushes unfortunately. Then she has a soft side, which is just looking for love. The only thing that surprised me even more was the nature of Bran ... it was a triumph of acting, the film itself is nothing unique. <br /> <br /> see if you are an existing student ... if you are looking for pure entertainment, you can skip this. Penn is serious! Oh my, that was a bit harsh this feature a couple of jokes ... not for the refugees, though.
