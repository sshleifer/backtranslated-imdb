I had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is a supporter of the first. This movie sucked straight down! It lacks the magic of the first. You could actually understand every word, he said the mouse, the animation is dirty, the palace many very different from the first film, there are new characters that have never been mentioned previously and were terrible, fortunately, the prince was not very lines that kept him from the sound stupid. Basically its like The Lion King 1 1/2, except for its different stories, all told mice. That's why I give it 2 out of 10, because the songs are not sung characters were most enjoyable.
