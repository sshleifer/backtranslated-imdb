This pretentious and lame attempt hipness. Devil's script and dialogue, and action really uncomfortable. Actually worse film I have ever seen (in the theater). Nothing in my opinion does not save the film from being a complete disaster. I saw him when he came to the cinema in Brighton. People came out and there were more people talking outside the toilet than in the audience! At the end were boos and jeers from the crowd remained poor, it was pretty boring as relatives of one of the main actors were present and looked very embarrassed. However, the film is so bad that I could not really feel that nice to them. Everyone has to start somewhere, and their son, began his acting career with this truly horrible attempt «Tarantinism, made in the UK." 5 years have passed bye, but sometimes I still shudder at the memory of that sad night in the movies! This is a film with no redeeming features whatsoever! I gave him a 1 to 0 was not available. They have to invent «shameometer» for all involved in this miserable mess of the film. I know that some of them went to the best, the positive thing is that none of them could have sunk even lower than that.
