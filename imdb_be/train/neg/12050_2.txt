I had read some positive reviews about this film, and was really surprised at how awful it was. Positioned as a cross between a history of AIDS, and a kind of "Ghost" / story "Blithe Spirit", this film does not always make it to the mind what it wants to be. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark is gay couple, who have an "open" relationship - Simon can be anonymous (albeit safe) sex on the side, when he wants. Marc HIV + and he and Simon, it seems no longer to have a sex life. When Mark dies, Simon - Make it a habit to turn off their emotions after discarded years ago, his father - is trying to erase the memory and just get with being a bachelor. Not that his behavior before his death, Mark was very different. But Mark returns to the shadowy form of films and his various visits, the preparation of Simon, to open up and admit their true feelings. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Simon a selfish SOB, it is impossible to feel any sympathy for them most of the film. By that time, it has to be more responsive, it's too late to take care of. Mark, on the other hand, follows in the footsteps of Demi Moore with "Ghost" weeping profusely throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There is a strange switch in tone after Mark returned. Suddenly we get some lame attempt at humor, a la the TV show "Bewitched." But it will not last long. After the emotional health of Simon on the map, all of this is becoming more and more sentimental, with amateur attempts to leap at your heartstrings. Final with angel boy muscles gilded directing tearfully Mark into the sky, and after punishing, Mount Simon wave goodbye is simply stunning, mainly because it is not intentionally funny.
