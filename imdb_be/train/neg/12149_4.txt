Located in Providence, Rhode Island, Mass Feeding trying to be a satirical look at the media's role in the government. At best, it can be applied to how the US is trying to control the media during the war in Iraq, but in the end the feeling of depression. There is never really the tension in the story and the acting is never very good. Worse, the direction of the film's brutal, to focus more on the odd angles that do not transmit anything but "Is not it a strange way to hold the camera." Special effects are very bad ... at one point in the video explosion green screened over the city, and it's funny in best. <br /> <br /> The film has a few bright spots ... namely advertisements for the post-zombie services (including maintenance and reclamation party bus). But this is too little to make the film worthwhile. <br /> <br /> For the best zombie movie, try to hide and creep. It has the same weak manufacturing cost, but there is much more wit, humor and a talent for it.
