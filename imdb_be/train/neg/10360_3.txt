I got all excited when I saw the advertisement of the film, because I recently read the book and liked it. The film, however, did not meet my expectations. After reading this book I recently prepared a big let-down, as often happens when stories are translated into a movie. The characters do not seem to fit very well with the book. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into character. There was no real connection with the audience about what is happening. Dialogue does not adequately explain what is happening. It just seemed slapped together and rushed through. In general, I was very disappointed with the film. I believe that if you have not read the book, it may be good in itself. At least, it can encourage you to read the book, you will probably enjoy it more. <br /> <br />
