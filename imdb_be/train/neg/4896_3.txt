I'll start with what I liked. <br /> <br /> I really liked the songs, all of them were great, the costumes, the music, the lyrics (by the time the translation was good :)), the choreography, everything. <br /> <br /> I loved the crab stage and the cooking stage. <br /> <br /> but that's about it. <br /> <br /> I get it, art cinema, blablabla, but too much, too much. Too much silence (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours later, hearing steps and moaning from time to time, actually ...), too much grief (not the film should never be boring, no matter how deep it is must have been!), too much porn as a scene (I get it really, I understand that they were filming a porn movie, but really, really, really, it's too much), I really think, that the movie should be for viewing and this is not exactly watchable in any way. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for songs.
