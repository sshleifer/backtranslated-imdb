If you have seen much less films, it can be great for you. If you have seen a lot of movies, this is a joke. Actions real heroes are portrayed very poorly. Not to mention, there are songs, there are a lot of flashbacks, and most importantly, the fight scenes stupidily met. New characters, a good direction, would have done better, but as it contains all the Bollywood hero / heroine, you can predict what happens next. You do not lose heart, when something happens, they protray emotion awful, mainly because I've seen this actor 1,000 other Hindi films. This is suppose to be a realistic film, but it can not show. There are times you wonder, you have thousands of military vehical, filled with soldiers moving and the Pakistanis bombing them, and none of them bombs does not surprise them. Pakis is really bad sight or director made them look stupid? There were only a few characters acting it was very good, but, as for the plot, the action, it is badly directed. This film could be short, when they learned the songs, memories, stick to the point.
