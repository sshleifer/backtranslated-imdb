With this film only works 61 minutes and did all that well on TV, I decided to jump zombie uprising in DVD, to pass the time. Even with the implementation of the era, with whom he was walking, I was very disappointed. It began with a surprisingly buoyant quality opening score (what - no brooding artists?), And then opens the sequence rather slow moving. Heck, I realized a movie about zombies - even with 1930 - will have some chill to it (White Zombie, with Bela Lugosi, of course), but it was not. Zero. It was not even very carefully dramatically (in a few minutes, with burning eyes, superimposed on the film to show hypnosis anyone except). As with the equally blunt king zombie, this film can be an interesting curiosity for their own, but nothing more.
