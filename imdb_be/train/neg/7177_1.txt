Given the fact that I loved the original "Caligula", even with all its shortcomings, I must say that it is a remake of the trailer was disappointing. <br /> <br /> Listening Jovovich says this lazy American accent "Mmm cuhligyooluh ...» make me sick. Set Roman does not look at all like a Hollywood mansion ... in the back yard of a rich actor, and Roman costumes look like cheap crap you buy in a suburban store suit. <br /> <br /> This is the "magic» Adriana Asti looks like a fifty-year-old woman Hispanic completely frightened out of my head as if not knowing that it is a movie trailer. <br /> <br /> actions should be one of the worst I have ever seen, with the majority of the lines I hear be random actors who shout «CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!» so loud and obnoxious annoying as they can. <br /> <br /> random sex scenes are also filled with a good 40 or 50% of the trailer, as well as scenes with famous actors / actresses, Gerard Butler (which decorates the shade screen for all three and a half seconds) does nothing but looking uncomfortable or to walk all over the top of them a minimum of lines, simply dragging it down to the absurdity of their delivery. <br /> <br /> Courtney Love is a part of it looking like her usual dull crack whore, I leaned against the door, muttering about the moon or something. You can not say, because it is either drunk or high or just babbling idiot. <br /> <br /> Karen Black is just annoying ... chance to laugh and cry, so that annoys you. <br /> <br /> Helen Mirren ... it was in the original, and its return to "Caligula" is composed of ... «CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!» I particularly " love "(and love, I mean hate) line Annie in" Caligula ... j00 * NO poppies me something unintelligible * .... * something that sounds like j00nalo * »It is also incredibly arrogant to say Caligula four-year reign was more than the birth and death of Jesus. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this has to be the worst, most operational one condescendingly arrogant piece of shit, labeled as "art" I have ever seen. Even if Gore Vidal Caligula hated the original, he was not supposed to show up or not give his name again for this shit pile, no matter how much they paid for it (if it was not billions of trillions of yen). Worst trailer ever.
