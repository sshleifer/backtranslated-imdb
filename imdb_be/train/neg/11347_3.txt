The Cult of the Cobra is now available on DVD in native printing, making full justice regardless of the merit he has, like a movie. Unfortunately, that's not saying much. <br /> <br /> It has a competent cast of second-rank, which justify themselves, as might be expected in such circumstances. This effectively directed solely on sound stages and a constant set to full-scale studio. It looks good, but significantly more graphics and poor 80 minutes, he is still very much the pads. <br /> <br /> For example, a double cobra attack on the first of the GI was certainly one attack too much. <br /> <br /> thing about Julia elections marry Pete, not Tom never comes to anything. Especially immediately falls in love with Lisa, and she never has any reason to be jealous of Julie (or she). <br /> <br /> Julia "female intuition" are entered as if he is going to lead to an important development of the plot, but it is not. In addition, the study pitot a cobra cult and a suspicion that for a short time falls on Tom serve no other purpose than to fill screen time. <br /> <br /> This is only the symptoms of the underlying problem. The film is constructed like a mystery, but it is not. Once the curse pronounced we know exactly where the story is moving, so that the characters were painstakingly disclosure of what we already know. <br /> <br /> The ending is particularly inaccurate. Julia threatens purely coincidental. Lisa has no reason to want to kill her - it just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. When Tom finds himself in the nick of time to save her, she even did not know if she was threatened at all. Then he just gets rid of the cobra in the way of any of the previous victims could do. <br /> <br /> This is such an insignificant little crumb of history, I wondered how on earth he was pitched the studio head. Then it occurred to me. Someone said: "These films were very successful Lewton for RKO, so why not make one like this" <br /> <br /> The Cult of the Cobra is clearly modeled on Cat People:? A mysterious, troubled, the form changes a woman falls in love the hero appears, frigid, killing people, suspicious woman friend of the hero dies at the end but "modeled on" does not mean "worse." -. a large margin is a copy, but does not understand what it is up <. br /> <br /> it's obviously trying to hold suggestive style Lewton, but this approach does not follow through in the story. Lisa did not Irene. She meant to be a strange and mysterious, but there is no mystery about it. We get an idea about it after the first attack in Asia immediately recognized her when she is in New York. There's no doubt about its purpose. It is not any ambiguity if not actually turns it into a snake. <br /> <br /> on the other hand, during the night it sneaks we get not one, but two attempts to "bus". No rip, because the director does not understand what makes the "bus" job and, in any case, they happen a stalker, not the person being sued. <br /> <br /> These weak echoes of Cat People give cult Cobra whatever slight differences may be, but they only pay attention to the yawning gap between the original and the imitation. <br /> <br /> Plagiarism may be the sincerest form of flattery, but I doubt that Lewton and Tourneur were particularly pleased if this cool little time left passer.
