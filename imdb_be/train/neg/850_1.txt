It must be the stupidest movie I've ever seen (spoilers ahead!) First of all, the plot silly. A small child is strange, and they move to a hotel, because his father is the guardian of this. We believe that the child has a gift, "The Shining." This gift will never ever have anything to do with anything, except that the child seems to be cool. Then, the film becomes more dull and uninteresting until the person finally goes mad. He goes on a rampage to kill the child and his wife, because ... well, it feels like it. Otherwise, why would he do it? Suddenly we see a naked woman in a bath. Man kisses her and realizes that he kisses a dead corpse that is totally disgusting. As a black man enters the hotel and hit with an ax. Then the child and the woman to take the car and leave the black man's father, who died within a few minutes of hypothermia. Most of the films are not a waste of time, but it falls squarely into this category. Music rubbish, banal characters (with the exception of Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot is twisted and corresponds to the description of vomiting, the ending is very predictable, the plot slowly, it is difficult i sad. This film is very overrated. AVOID this movie at all costs. I am surprised that he has received such a high rating on IMDb.
