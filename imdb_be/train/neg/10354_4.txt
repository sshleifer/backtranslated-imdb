I was browsing Netflix and stumbled on this film. Having pleasant memories about the book as a child, I decided to check it out. This is a film that you should really pass on. <br /> <br /> It's just not worth seeing. This is a very sad and uninteresting. I feel that it would even be that way for young children. It has no magic, that the book contains. This film did not get, but you just find yourself not caring about ten minutes into it. <br /> <br /> There are things that just come off as weird. Witch character is not very good. The family appears as this is not a big deal that these strange things are happening. I know that this is a film of children as an older audience, we do not have to look too deeply into things, but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had any experience of creating a movie before. <br /> <br /> DVD, which I had started to pass in the last minutes of the film, and instead of trying to fix it, I just turned it off and sent it back to Netflix. I do not really care how it ended. Skip the movie and read a book instead.
