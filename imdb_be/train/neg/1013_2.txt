If you watched the movie, you know why I said, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus." Hehehe !!! Every time they said, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus ..." I laughed thinking, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why I rent this movie?" I can not believe how Oscar winners emerged as Freeman and Spacey are in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Dreaful action! I think that someone like Joshua Jackson could have done much better! This job is ideal for Joshua Jackson, and believe me, I'm not a big fun of him ... but I do prefer the actor, not the android called Timberlake. And his girlfriend was shallow, hollow and annoying as hell. I was happy when they were both rushed out into the street. <br /> <br /> The story was in order, and I think Dylan McDermott did very well its role of bad guy. The film was interesting, but I think that Timberlake has destroyed it all. It would be much nicer without it. <br /> <br /> By the way, the music was fine, but then every time the music was turned into a film MTV video outbreaks, low motion, and the like, it is ridiculous for this movie cop, I thought. Maybe they wanted to make a video clip for MTV Timberlake.
