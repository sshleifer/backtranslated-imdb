so ... it's really sexist, and class, and I thought that it might not be in the initial stage of the film, as well as when Stella tells Steven that she really wanted to change yourself and start talking on the right path, and he says, it does not change. Well, he certainly changed his tune, and it seems that other reviewers have followed suit. that in the beginning, it seems, the love story is really about social and placing women as sacrificial mother. the end of the film does not make her a hero, it does everything it's sad. and it's sad that people think that this makes her a hero. perhaps this is a comment about the film that people should take. positive reception reflects the persistent patriarchal trends in the public consciousness. Ugh.
