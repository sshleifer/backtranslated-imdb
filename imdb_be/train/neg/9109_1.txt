The first Hard, the original is my favorite movie of all time. It was an absolute masterpiece. So how on earth they could make a sequel so blatantly bad. Sarah Michelle Gellar was committed in the first film. In this, Amy Adams sucks. It's terrible. And they could not find a baby bird, which actually looked like Sarah Michelle Gellar? At the very least, the same hair color !!! I mean come on. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but it is absolutely terrible when compared to Philip. Sebastian in the first film, crafty, deceitful, and much more evil than Sebastian prequel. And what about the story line. It basically goes like this ... <br /> <br /> 1 Sebastian has a bad reputation in his first school, so says the film, although he does not mention anything about him and his life, love, and how he was one of the girls 2 Sebastian moved to New York, and just suddenly decides that he's going to turn around. He "falls in love" with Danielle (may I remind you that in the original, Sarah Michelle Giller says quote "you broke up with the first person you ever loved, because I said so as to-he was in love with a prequel ??? ). and he is beautiful and charming, and all the "good man", as he turns down the floor from nestling his dad does. <br /> <br /> 3-one makes a complete 180, and finishes in the top three at the end of the movie, and then seduces Cherry. <br /> <br /> I mean, it's awful. and I loved the first so much. I did not even see yet a third. I hope that his god is better than the prequel.
