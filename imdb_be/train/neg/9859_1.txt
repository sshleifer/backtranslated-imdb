This film is just lame. A total waste of time and money. Jokes predictable, the characters are so clich√© and how he speaks of RPG players, it's not funny, as well. The problem is that the authors do not seem to know how the RPG-games and, most importantly, how to make jokes about this game. Of course, there are a bunch of losers who play RPG, like freaking morons and general lost. But for me it's not the most fun way to make a joke about this game. History makes no sense. Who cares about how long the game is played? The biggest problem in this film is that the authors and the actors do not even try to find out what RPG is going to make a joke about it. I felt ashamed, watching this lame movie.
