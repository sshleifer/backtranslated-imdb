I have read several books about Bonnie and Clyde, and it is certainly more accurate than version Beatty / Dunaway, that his suits and locale echo actual photographs taken from the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow, and the seizure of his wife Blanche. This looks like the actress looks exactly as the photos taken that day, Blanche grieving over the dying husband. However, this film is still Hollywood and our antihero remains quite up to the end, even after being shot full of holes (in Bonn, lives badly burned in a car crash a year before their famous ambush, and does not look like a cheerful cheerleader during her death ). The script is tedious, and the effect of the poor, especially lead. Very disappointing. Stick with Beatty and Dunaway. There may not be a "true story", but it's a great movie.
