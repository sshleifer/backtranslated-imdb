This film has a background very difficult to swallow, even by the standards of the genre. We asked to accept not only that the recording is played back can cause a corpse to life, but that the record contains hidden messages aimed directly at a child, if the singer did not have nothing to do with the boy when he was alive, and of course no way of knowing who holds the record will eventually. In any case, the film is fun for a while, but in the end, stupidity and meaninglessness reigns. If they really tried to create a new icon Freddy such horror, they were far: villain here has no personality, no motivation, and there is no diversity. (* 1/2)
