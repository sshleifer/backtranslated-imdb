I was in China this film. I choose a screen name Sheeba Alahani, because I modeled while in Italy and could not pronounce my real name is correct, so I choose Sheba, then added Alahani, because he looked like a Alohalani. <br /> <br /> I've never acted before (and it shows), but it was so much fun to shoot. They gave me "acting lessons" every morning (which, apparently, were not helpful). They called my voice (thank goodness). <br /> <br /> David and Peter had a blast on the set, full of good humor and jokes. This movie was never meant to be taken seriously, it was a tax write off in accordance with the internal information. <br /> <br /> I have given 1 because I have a sense of humor, and 10 for the pleasure I have "action" in it.
