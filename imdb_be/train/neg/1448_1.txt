Having grown up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from what used to be Jill, I can tell you that this film is nauseating. Most Texans do not live as the film shows. The plot is weak and fake accents funny, and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all Texans are drinking beer, honky tonkin, cattle. The awful fake accents Texas that kills it for me. However, there are some Texas twang for most Texans accents, but these people are overdoing it. You can not force someone from New Jersey and Ohio, to make Texas accents. It just does not work. John Travolta has to stick to the disco dancing or 50s. Debra Winger was more convincing as Wonder Girl, what she was like a Texan.
