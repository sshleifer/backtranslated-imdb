First of all there Guzharatsky theater, that is Bollywood. Both have their strengths and fan following. Director Vipul Shah must look elsewhere, not guzharatsky theater, making the production of Bollywood. At first he did Aankhen (adapted from guzharatskoy games) - which was a unique story, but could not keep the film in Hindi. Now he adapted other guzharatskuyu game and named it Station - a race against time. In general, the others' emotions. Development of the plot is not for Hindi films. For example, a role-playing game between father and son is better to leave guzharatsky theater - do not bring it into the film in Hindi. Even comedy is best left for track guzharatskoy stage. All performances are not an average - nothing to shout about - prohibiting Shefali Chhaya Shah, which is fantastic.
