Poor Robert Englund takes another flop and by Tobe Hooper, who usually does a pretty good horror movie, but it is not very bad at it. Englund plays the well known Marque De Sade, who in the 17th century was enprisoned for his obsession with pain and pleasure that the pain and watch others also hurt. History is so confusing to the flip-flop from one century to another, and I was confused as to what is going on and what was the purpose of this film. All I saw was a young lady who became captured amazing lesbians who DESIDES to keep it in himself and the young lady was fascinated by these Arabian with a lot of money, and learns that he is to have her killed and then Englund steps of one century to the other claiming to be a descendant of de Sade and tries to kill her because she reminded him of Madame Momoselle (spelled that wrong), or someone was in the picture above de Sades wall. The film was terrible, I was surprised to Hooper hireing Englund in this film and special effects were so fake and funny, especially the part about the eyes. Englund tries to make a comeback from his once got to move, "A Nightmare on Elm St.Â» with the help of these and pull out needles to extinguish the people's eyes. Awful, just awful.
