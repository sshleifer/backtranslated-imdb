Eight nominations Academy? It is beyond belief. I can only think that it was a very bad year - even by the standards of Hollywood. From Houston as a director, and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as the lead, I probably would have swallowed the bait and watched it anyway, but Oscar nominations really sold it to me, and I feel cheated as a result clearly. <br /> <br /> So this is a black comedy that? Can anyone tell me where the humor in the family honor Priogo? This, of course, tasteless (shooting in the head of the police's wife is, but the other supposedly comic interlude in this is a farce about the mafia life), but except for the jokes about "your favorite Mexican cigars" (which I imagine is an old joke Americans who were officially forbidden to buy something Cuban for the last 50 years), I could not find anything humorous in nature - and I try. There are many Mafia cliche, but cliches is not humor in my book. <br /> <br /> Is this the kind of romantic comedy? Never. The characters and their relationships are so incredibly shallow and that they are on a par with Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli. <br /> <br /> Is it wise to come up with a parody of the mafia? Not in a million years. The plot is simply absurd aimlessly, not comically absurd, and it is usually just have a very bad feeling (and cheap) Mafia movie. It feels more like a homage than a parody. <br /> <br /> With a one-dimensional characters, and little in the way of humor, written for them, leaving the actors to do dodgy accents and grimaces. Well, not quite; even when the person to pull that master of expression comic face, Jack Nicholson (repleat with puffed upper lip ... now what it means to be a parody of Brando padded jaw in The Godfather? ... Oh! Who cares? ... all I know, this is not funny). <br /> <br /> Throw in some slow, plodding direction (the film pulls at 2:00), some hopelessly Daft and clichéd dialogue, such as; "Do you remember Camora? Well, we're a lot more, we will track you down, wherever you go, "and clichéd mannerisms, and you'll be reaching for the button, fast forward, before you can say« capiche? ». Prizzi's Honor is far from Houston's "masterpiece" and quite a very bad last work. This is definitely one work in the canon of the great director, who must be given concrete overcoat and threw it into the Hudson River.
