"White Noise" had the potential to be one of the most talked about films as "The Exorcist" I think. Seeing as EVP supposedly true it really had an easy passage to be afraid of a true fact. Not many movies come to really inspire fear in people's minds. As I said, this film could, but did not. The film itself is degraded low-class PG-13 horror movie. Nothing compared to «The Ring» or «The Sixth Sense» by any means. Someone really should just take responsibility in horror film industry and just make a film that not only makes us think, but it makes us jump and shout, the whole horror film should do. I honestly sick of Horror Genre PG-13, because it becomes a genre of its own. We need the old days ago, bloodthirsty and days, Freddy Krueger, Jason, Mike Myers days. Few movies can pull off to think about it because the mentality to be no big deal. So why try to pull it out? A few good jumps in the amount of film to anything except one of the silliest endings in film history, which does not have permissions to all ... do not waste your money on this film.
