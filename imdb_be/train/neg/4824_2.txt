I wanted to like this movie, but many elements are spoiled for me. Using the lens around and gusty editing does not give me the feeling of being in the world of meth heads, but it makes me think I was watching MTV for a few short moments. The movie never seemed to go anywhere, and the action was really a perfect example of the current. I like films that give us a glimpse into the seedy underworld, but this film could not decide whether it was a bad horror movie, or even worse, a serious comment on the horrors of addiction.
