I was skeptical when I first saw the Calvin Klein-esque commercials, but I thought I'd give it a chance. So I watched it, and all I can say BLEH. This movie was so bad. It is rare that I hate that a lot of movies. Watching this film reminded me of the funniest scenes in the Altman "Player" when writers spread their strange ideas manufacturers. I would like to know what MTV producer decided that a half-hour long music video adaptation of Bronte (but this time the name of Heathcliff is hit and he is a rock star, and Hindley name is Hendrix), it is a good idea. <, Br /> <br /> Even that might not have been so bad if they had not received any other aspect of the film so horribly wrong as well. Direction should be "you're lonely, sulking for me." I laughed at all "serious" scenes and was sad the rest. The camera work was uneven and repeatedly reminded me that I was watching a bad movie tries to be edgy. My theory is that the sound guy got bored and went down to the beach for a few beers with his boom - all I could hear was a scene in half wave. In other scenes, I want all that I could hear. And speaking of sound, what they did with the Sisters of Mercy song «More» totally unforgivable, then again, it's inexcusable that they did Bronte. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, there was one entertainment scene - especially at a time when Johnny Whitworth licked his face Katherine Heigl - and if you can tell me that this scene had to do with the rest of the story more power for you.
