I was not expecting much from this movie, but boy-oh-boy, I did not expect that the film will be a bad thing. Chris Rock Sun shows a good deed here, you can not get the feeling that his car√°cter is real, I think the film would have been a little better if it's a drama or a romantic scene would be less a part of the film and more / better humor I was involved. The film, like the filmmakers had a hangover does it. The "creation" they do not show any smiles. This is a very bad film! I gave him a three, he gave me ten for a few smiles, but I never laugh!
