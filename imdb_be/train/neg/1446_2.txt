The film is an extended story of the classic novel, which is absolutely not able to capture the spirit of the original adventures. Pretty creepy American Patrick Swayze cast as a British hero Allan Quatermain despite evidence of his nationality. <br /> <br /> The film continues through to the «Hollywood-ISE» stories, changing as the story and characters to fit more comfortably in the accepted form. The film manages to be predictable throughout, even to those who are not familiar with the history and suffer from some very bad and very disappointing action battle sequences. <br /> <br /> In general, a terrible addition to the already very poor collection of films based on the legend of King Solomon's Mines and Allan Quatermain.
