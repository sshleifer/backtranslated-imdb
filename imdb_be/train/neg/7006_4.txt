Mark Hamill should feel embarrassed with powerful Corvette Summer! At this time, it uses a new kind of "power" to regain possession of their dream car, a bright red Â«Vette. It looks like another sour adolescence pour the first half and makes a U-turn heading in the wrong direction. Drafting and sending the job badly done, with a few scenes is not difficult to accept. You expect it to happen anyway, and you will also sniff the smell of the late 70s hodgepodge. Only the former rookie, Annie Potts would be easy to steal the show and save this poor film with crawling REPO! Its impractical, but a great person holds an interest in what is good, and this is the best chance to see her in a swimsuit. Annie Hooray! Sorry, Mark! I believe that the group was not with you in this time.
