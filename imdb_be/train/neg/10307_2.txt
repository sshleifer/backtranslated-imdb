"Mathematics" aspect, this is just a ploy to try to fix this TV show, in addition to millions of other police shows. The only redeeming aspect of the show, Rob Morrow, although his career should be (wrongly) is decreasing after Northern Exposure, when he signed up for this schlock. <br /> <br /> lame-ness "math" aspect of the show is encapsulated in one episode of the main roles of Lou Diamond Phillips (which only confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned.) in order to catch a fugitive , the "mathematician" uses some theory of "bubbles". Thus, it gives a long explanation that, when we have seen the suspect in areas A, B and C, we can use the "bubble theory" to figure out where he might be. He does it all on the board, or, perhaps, with a stick in the mud (I can not remember). <br /> <br /> In any case, if you look at the finished product, he basically took all three points, and chose a point right in the middle and said, "Well, mathematically, that's where we are likely to find a fugitive. "At this point, one other character shows" On this point, too, is a cabin where a guy used to live. "It is mathematics? It does not even connect-The-f ** K ** G spot !!! This show reminds me of the math I used to work in the banking sector, which had a mathematical analysis, he could do would be to "support" indicates that each has already agreed to or through less complex analysis or common sense. <, Br /> <br /> It just goes to show - if you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can not wait until they adhere Numb3rs commands on Osama ... They will use the count, called an airstrike in the middle of the mountain, and struck Osamu and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields ... because hey. .. it's all about numbers. <br /> <br /> the whole ridiculous TV show.
