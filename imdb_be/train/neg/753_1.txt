Wow ... <br /> <br /> I picked it up at the local Wal-Mart after reading on the Internet that he was released early. I then on the Internet for some time, and just had to buy film. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> I think the thing that really struck me was editing, or lack thereof. Again and again, the characters (usually the narrator, and whoever he a) shows the walk ... and walk ... and go. I'm not an editor, but I know that you can cut between someone leaving point A, to indicate their arrival at point B. There's no need to show almost all the way! Wow ... <br /> <br /> I actually end up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this. They do not seem to have been given no direction as to what to do in other scenes than look scared or happy look, depending on what action should be added at a later date. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why was it decided to make almost all effects using CG is beyond me. Even ILM still uses miniatures time. One of the most distracting use of green screen in this film is a constant rush with (according to titles) the same group of people representing the citizens of different towns and cities, including London. Sometimes these people come and go, not paying attention to both the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera. In one scene in London, there seems to be at least two men over six feet to walk only brother of the narrator (played by Anthony Piana star mustache without distracting). Not as Gettysburg, I have not seen such a fake piece of facial hair. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why did Timothy Hines said this film as he did it for me. This turkey, plain and simple. On the positive side (at least for me), she gave some of the present-with laughter loud bit of fun that I've seen in quite a while.
