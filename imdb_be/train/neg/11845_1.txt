... this is the only way to describe this film about things that should be unmistakable: sex scandal, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst grins his way through her role as a silent film star Marion Davies as she thinks she is in "Legally Blonde." The guy who plays overacts Hurst to the point where you want to reach into the screen and slap him. Izzard is pretty good, except for the fact that he plays Charlie Chaplin, and about 125 pounds too heavy for the part? Hard to believe that this hamfisted, uneven Crash was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, but then again, he did not make a watchable film in that? 30 years? Sometimes, just do not go back there.
