Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a famous actor. Almost any movie that he was at it's best for him. Now old George had absolutely nothing to do with this film ... but he once said something that describes the said film to TV <br /> <br /> I do not remember his words, but he basically said that the Big Burn It can save a bad game, but the Great duty can not save Bad writing. Never is a small observation was more true than in the "all new adventures of Laurel & Hardy: For Love or Mummy". <br /> <br /> casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gaylard Sartain (Hardy) not only look the details, but they do very good job in simulating real deal (and all affectation). This film should stand as a lasting testament to their talents. However, this film falls flat on its face when it comes to (you guessed it) WRITING. <br /> <br /> In addition to the opening of a dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (which was very "character") and a short gag involving a taxi, this film is an absolute sick sit <br /> <br /> The problem number 1: .. Too much time and effort went into the story <br /> <br /> I do not know why mummy wants to steal quite a British lady. What I want to see the status and Oli (or at least their stand-ins). Too much screen time was devoted to the explanation of the plot or in a not-so-funny supporting characters, who told the story revolves around. <br /> <br /> However, even if this film was all a joke, that still leaves us with ... <br /> <br /> ... Problem number 2: Most of the jokes that I would call "dilute" a farce. <br /> <br /> What do I mean by "dilute»? <br /> <br /> in a farce, a character is injured in an exaggerated way for comedic effect (ala Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ..., or as Laurel and Hardy?). <br /> <br /> In the "watered-down" farce (as I define it), the character gains a little hurt or inconvenienced, and the filmmakers play that . comedic effect <br /> <br /> Perhaps an illustration will help: <br /> <b r /> The Looney Tunes, Daffy Duck Elmer Fudd gets shot. Its price falls, and he puts it back. This is a classic farce. <br /> <br /> In this "gem", Olli accidentally bumped into some people. they turn around and tell him to be careful, and to continue its merry way. this is not a farce. It's not even funny. It's just ... boring ... and this film is full of this kind of a joke. It's as if they are the bread of this film and oil. Writers and directors just take these sad moments and act like they have to be funny. Of course, the example I just gave is the most extreme case, but I can only cut it so much slack <br /> <br /> In short :. The film simply does not work because the script can not benefit from the Pinchot-x and Sartain's ability to implement Stan and Oli. Instead, the script title in the area of ​​exposure and lame jokes. Watching this film is mainly watching two wonderful imitators, which did not give the real material to work with. <br /> <br /> I do not a good movie, but incredibly sleeping aid. <br /> <br /> I say give this one a miss and follow the real deal (just as long as you stay away from "Atoll K» and «Be Big").
