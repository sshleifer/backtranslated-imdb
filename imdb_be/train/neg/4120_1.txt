Absolutely awful movie. Ameteurish and it's not funny. The main character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil's very annoying. Changes E.T and Star Wars is simply nonsense. <br /> <br /> The actor Yilmaz Goksal only good think about this movie. He must master their English and to move to Hollywood. Hollywood can not find an actor with his character. Besides Goksal this movie trash. <br /> <br /> Director Goni muzhdu is a comic writer and the film its worst written work on that date. <br /> <br /> Music Cem Karaca is another plus of this waste of money. Actor Summer Tilmak also have a presence. The actor, who plays the three sons has no talent what so ever.
