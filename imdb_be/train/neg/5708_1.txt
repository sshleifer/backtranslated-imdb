People, I will tear this movie apart. It's just not realistic. Plot SOOOOOOO predictable. You can expect everything that happens convientantly course, they find the treasure and become filthy rich, and to cheat the villain. We've seen it a million times. The authors of the film have to think that much of the film takes place the public is stupid. They must be right, because most people really liked this movie. I mean the solution of the puzzle in a matter of seconds. Secret treasure room hidden under the Manhattan subway? You would think that with all the work that went on in the New York subway The room would have been detected earlier. and all that was built during the Civil War? PLEASE AND a love story between Ben and Abigail ?? how cute, and I thought that the novel Cussler novels was weak. They just fall in love like this, within 2 seconds, I'd be more concerned about saving my own ass then get some of them. features a girl and a blunt piece of paper. 1/10 debris
