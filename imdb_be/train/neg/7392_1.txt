I look around in the video store is still in shock as Steven Seagal with his track Bad militants may still have 3 films on the shelves less than Year.Attack force is not less than the promised third entry for the first time in our Sci Fi Genre constantly expanding Seagal.Visions bad movies amusement flashed in front of my trusting eyes.Sadly is not the case one bit, no entertainment and the movie as bad as they come. <br /> <br /> Segal recovered slightly with poor but pleasant Shadow Man last time we saw Attack him.However force must be his absolute worst film ever! Sun argue, because of the murder of, Ticker, or even Black Dawn folks.This is the bottom of a septic tank here. <br /> <br /> Anyone who says it is the return of Steven Seagal to form should be forced to write a 100-page essay on the word taste. <br /> <br /> Seagal another agent / I supreme badass again named Lawson wants to avenge the murder of his team, which leads him to a malicious conspiracy to spread really bad medicine to unsuspecting dealer public.Not mention Sun local. <br /> <br /> All the production from directing to acting is poor.Was this film shot in the dark? It should be the most poorly lit movie so scary Howling 2. effects and very badly done <br /> <br /> The producers also decided to forget that the fans hate most :. throw in a backup after a backup and badly dubbed Stephen Seagal.Who, it seems to show little enthusiasm here.Can I blame him? <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that it was said that the attack was not Force Steven signed on (originally Harvester) and, of course, should be better than the attack force.The post -Production falsification NOT It is making it more consistent and did Seagal look worse.I feel bad for Directer Michael Keusch and writer Hal pin Joe, how are they going to be judged forever hasty production of repeated escapes. <br /> <br /> So now This leaves Segal in an impossible situation to come up with something to make up for this mess.But after seeing how badly Attack Force have been possible, we want him to do another movie?
