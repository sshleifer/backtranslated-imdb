What can I say? I am a secret supporter of the "top" of the action and horror films. Especially when it comes with a lot of humor and plenty of hints, but I'm not a fan of snakes on a plane <br /> <br /> There are three potential attracted to this film :. ?? Situation comedy; ?? horror; and ?? Novelty hundred snakes which are in one plane. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film is not written as a horror comedy or insincere, and there is only 1 or 2 points in the film where you'll smile to yourself. If you want to get a sense of the movie, the trailer really is a film of horrors. <br /> <br /> Secondly, if you wait for the movie, full of action and strikes, you will not be disappointed, it does not stand out above other films, but he always keeps his attention. <br /> <br /> In the third place, although the novelty of Snakes on a Plane entirely erased, but you'll leave the cinema thinking "what was all the fuss is about.Â» <br /> <br /> I know that this film has a high rating, but it does not add. A) Many of the reviews, which was written before the film was released, and B) Distribution of consumer ratings is much less variation than the usual 77% of people who appreciate the film 10/10, only 7% of people giving it 9/10 - Why is there such a huge gap?
