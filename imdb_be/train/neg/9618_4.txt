I have to say that although this film was formulaic throughout the plot stolen from movies like Friday, 13 / I Know What You Did Last Summer, this film is not so bad. In fact, it was not as bad as most of the horror films Hollywood has produced lately. These killings, although sometimes a little too were shaped in most cases just the original. The cast was mediocre, which you would expect from a low-budget features, but much better than what is much more Artisan / Lions Gate studio offered. My only real complaint is that it was not related to the budget of the film, which was small, was far-fetched "twist" ending. I'm sorry, but that's what this film is put in a poor category for me. The ending is just stupid and fastened. Before that I was a bit boring, but it really is like. 4/10
