Minion of ... well, Mignon. The servant of Satan, and whose goal is to get the key that opens the door, where his master was captured. He's some kind of demon who owns the man, and when the body dies, the other will have. Anyone who happens to be possessed will go to some sort of berserker rage. Dolph Lundgren plays of Lukas, a member of the secret order of the Templars, which is tasked to keep the key to the Mignon. The film begins thousands of years ago in the Middle East, where a number of knight templar escape from minions. Then flash forward to 1999, where key wind somewhere under the ground in New York. Archaeologist intended to study / dig the place where was found the key. Itself of course, the favorite after the key, and the film becomes long winded chase scene between the EP and Lucas and archaeologists. <br /> <br /> In the film, it is just that, a low-budget B-movie film, film does not have enough energy, and just trods together. You will follow the chase, but you'll never feel involved in the story, which arbitrarily takes ideas from the previous films (especially the Terminator movies). The fight scenes with minions troublesome, is that you never get a sense of how good or bad as the demon warrior. This "skill" becomes one man army when fighting detachment of the Temple, but it sucks when it comes to one-on-one. And it should be around for a long time. All this testifies to the fact that any sense of logic simply dumped down the drain for convenience. The whole idea of ​​the secret Order of the Knights Templar, the door to hell, and the key is not very well explained. We just recognize that they simply exist. The film seems to have been made with a sense there is not a lot of potential in the story, but only enough to make a few dollars. Dolph Lundgren sure looked like he wanted it to be somewhere else <br /> <br /> The sentence :. 2 out of 5 stars.
