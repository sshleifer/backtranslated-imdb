Maybe I've seen too many crime flick, or maybe I did not take the right drugs. <br /> <br /> It was the clich√©-ridden land scarce, plot-nonsense, just stupid movie I have seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> As for the direction, it seems, it took less time to show it than it did to put it together. <br /> <br /> in fact it looks to make it straight to video before it is completed. <br /> <br /> it is a bad rip off with the "M" in the classic Fritz Lang film starring Peter Lorre. You would be so much better to rent that instead.
