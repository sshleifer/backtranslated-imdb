SPOILERS FOR: <br /> <br /> Gettaway mainly thriller. And what actions have to !! Shootouts, car chases, Garbage, and more. It stars Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as. <br /> <br /> MC Coy in this remake, and I have not seen the original, but really do not care for it at all, though Bassenger and Baldwin has good screen chemistry. But the film did not do it for me. <br /> <br /> Gettaway became very tiresome very quickly. The plot is overshadowed by a fight / chase after the other, as well as violence continues to accumulate, Bassenger Baldwin and maintain their great looks, no matter what danger they might. In fact, by the end of the movie, they almost look better than in the beginning. I do not think Bassenger eye makeup moves once in the whole picture. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst film I've ever seen, of course not, but it's not very good, and if one is not an action film purists, I can not see very much like this film, because it just not much here. Gettaway not something very original and goes in all directions from unnecessarily hard for pretty boring. It really could have been better, I think. <br /> <br /> Bassenger and Baldwin give the OK performance, but they do not have much in common, except get chased and run for your life. Sometimes less is more, seeing the same thing over and over again becomes stale. Nya enjoy it a lot.
