While most of the film is very amateurish, Kosher slaughter scene is played, but not true. Kosher law says that the animal must be conscious when the blade touches his skin. Kosher slaughter scene indeed, as anyone knows who has seen, or seen the movie shows Peta kosher slaughter in which the animals throats are cut, and cut the esophagus, while he was still alive in the mind, and obviously suffering. We must remember that history is written by the winners. There is one even allowed to even think that, perhaps, the Nazis were right ?? <br /> <br /> Is not nothing to say that the Nazis banned this vicious religious slaughter, Jews still practice it even today?
