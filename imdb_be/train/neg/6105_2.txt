If you're the kind of person who can get hit with a very bad movie, I highly recommend this. If you do not stay away. This movie looks amazingly cheap, and sometimes you may find yourself wondering if this is not just a prank someone pulls you. The most positive comment I can make about this is that the people in charge, seemed to understand that this is a super-low-budget nonsense, so that there is at least a sense of satisfaction here. <br /> <br /> But it's as amateur as it gets. Their idea of ​​a giant death Gribova guys just covered with beige colored leaves that looks like a trash can cover their head. This obviously did not want to be taken seriously (to put it mildly), but even with this reservation, you find yourself shaking your head in the awesome cheesiness of it all. Or laugh often, as I do.
