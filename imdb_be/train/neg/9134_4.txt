I tried to love this program; I really did. I even bought a pilot film, first on VHS and later on DVD. However, I could not get into the story, because its two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and the "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) just seemed to love with himself, on the one hand. I admit there was some reasonable dialogue in the show, which was a key element in the success of a television program, and I appreciate the party in this dialogue. <br /> <br /> In fact, it was almost like the old screwball comedy films 30s and 40s with a man than women. You've argued, the prosecution, the cries and screams. A lot of people seem to like something squabbles, but I hate it, so I never got on the bandwagon moonlighting. <br /> <br /> Only Alice Beasley, as the hapless assistant "Agnes" was interesting. It's too bad that she was so little air time. Shepherd was good in my eyes, and I believe a woman would say the same for Willis, but too many disputes between them, finally turned me off.
