This film was good, but it is, of course, defeats the claim that homosexuals are "born that way," especially if the woman can get out of an unhappy marriage and simply fall into the arms of another woman. It almost seems that gender preferences Kate turned on and off like a switch that makes this film seems a little simplistic. <br /> <br /> In addition, as is often the case with movies that try to push the agenda, it was unfortunate that the characters in the film, which had questions or dissatisfaction with the gay life were marked as "fanatics". And there was no happy medium. It was a friends and family, Kate embraced her fully, or they completely avoid it. This is not characteristic of the interaction between gay and non-gay friends and relatives. This is usually a mix of emotions and values ​​that come into play. You can love people and treat them with respect, and not necessarily condoning the choice they make. Unfortunately, the film did not show any of these types of interactions. For the film, trying to portray the tolerance and acceptance, he hit me very intolerant movie! Then in the end, apparently, Kate solves all these years, she wants to be with Mac and all hunky Dora - that's what it's really all gay? Come on!
