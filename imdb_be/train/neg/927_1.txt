I mean really, how could Charles Band head full moon let the general stench ball, as DEMONICUS out. I mean, that should never have been given the green light to begin with. History repeats itself, the characters are weak, at best, there is no real story Tyranus another, he's a bad guy. Then the writer or director comes your way to a bad end. Correct bad end, Demonicus rises. Last survivor escapes deadly cave, the picture comes to life chimeras, cheaply I might add, and drives it. Then she goes home ala curve. The statue, which was destroyed centuries ago appears again for no reason just to collapse on top of her. I mean, that makes no sense. What the hell, Charles thought allowing the pile to feel sick to be with four different film companies, they were that desperate for a movie. They could have asked me, I have a better idea then DEMONICUS. Thanksgiving Turkey.
