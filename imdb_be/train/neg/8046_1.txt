No? I do not think so! Well, in that case, all you have to do is to stay far, far away from the «Do You Wanna Know The Secret", as it is simply pointless post unspecified "Scream" slasher with absolutely no saving value whatsoever. The plot is very funny; intolerably stupid characters, gore factor is negligible, and all this is just boring! How can you get from the name already, this film is mainly inspired by the "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer", as the events take place in a similar environment and motivations killer equally stupid. Why would someone want to steal ideas from trash as «IKWYDLS» is a complete mystery to me, anyway. At least, the film may depend on valuable rack Jennifer Love Hewitt, while women are in this junk except brainless also very unattractive. A year later, after still not disclosed the murder of his friend, Beth Morgan, her new lover adultery and four other naive students go to Florida to spend your vacation during spring break in an unusual house on the beach. The killer did not move during the whole year, but now it is a detachment to Florida and starts to carve them while leaving the cover posts as a kind of business card. You really should not be a horror expert to quickly figure out what kind of person is hidden behind a mask and unspeakably funny writers attempt to put you on the wrong path downright uncomfortable. Because the story is so thin, most of the film is purely ridiculous packing, including auxiliary areas in relation to the incapacitated Floridian police and the "mysterious" the FBI inspector, who seems to have a personal score to settle. inexplicable murder of the screen will take exception (not you hate when that happens?) There's even a gratuitous T & A to enjoy, and you better not get me started on the quality of the dialogue. Flour through shit like this just makes you realize what a wonderful spirit of the 80's slashers gone forever.
