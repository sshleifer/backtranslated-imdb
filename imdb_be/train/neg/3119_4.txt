Robin Williams gave an excellent job in The Night Listener, as did the other actors. Nevertheless, the film seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends that need to be considered "a must see." I think the problem is because there is not a sufficiently close link is established between the caller and the Noon Gabriel (I had to write it down so because the IMDb wants Auto correct correct spelling to "no one") character. The film runs a little more than 1:30, for the first 15 minutes or so it seems, the South begins his quest for Pete Logande, calling the boy. <br /> <br /> This occurs after he speaks to subscribers mysterious about 3 or 4 times. These conversations are not too in-depth consist essentially of, as you ... I'm in the hospital ... why you're the guy to go ... etc In the book, the child becomes almost shrinkage Noon and Vice Versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of the boy when he learns that a child disappears, and thinks he might be a hoax. <br /> <br /> South in the film becomes obsessed with finding Logande, but the audience is left to wonder why? Because in reality is not strong enough, communication is established between the south and the cause, why? Who cares if the subscriber does not exist? <br /> <br /> I know that there is a difference between the book and the movie, but these calls and that relationships are crucial to the establishment of the screen, because it provides the basis for the rest of the film. Since it is not, the film falls apart. <br /> <br /> That's weird, because other work Maupin, in the city offers. When this was done in a mini-series, it worked fine.
