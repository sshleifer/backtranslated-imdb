Someone might say something like Â«Baby Geniuses" with a giant robot babies, or "Dumbo" with its psychedelic drug addled nightmare sequence to win the award for the most disturbing movie ever made for children. You could say that, too, but you're wrong. And now, behold, I bring you, Santa Claus, the most helpless messed up family film since ... well, ever. <br /> <br /> With the opening scenes depicting children from different parts of the world, who sing their theme songs tasteless (seriously, this segment has a length of about 20 Freakin 'minutes and has nothing to do with the plot!) with thrilling conclusion in which Merlin jumps from Outta nowhere and saves the day (do not pay attention to him, he is from Barcelona), is a childhood trauma at its finest. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many different therapists I visit, I just ... can not ... get ... the ... reindeer ... laughing ... with ... a. .. my head! <br /> <br /> To avoid this hallucinogenic piece of trash like you would avoid sex starved whales during the mating season. However, if a fiery gay demons with a serious case of the flu replay something for you, I think you should give it a try. But in fact, this movie is not worth your time and mental health.
