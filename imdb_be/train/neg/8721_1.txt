I'm sorry, but that's just pathetic. The little girl had offspring, they were not enjoyable characters and story sucks. In addition, it was not even an alligator as the film would have us believe. If you check out any comprehensive guide to the reptiles you'll find that it really is a crocodile, not an alligator. Obviously, they did not hire a real expert of the animal or they will know that there is a crocodile. It is a sad excuse for a movie. Especially the ending. I almost fell asleep with it.
