costumes, dialogue, historical accuracy terrible. For example, - Stacey Dash and hanging scene. The loop was fine (as I could tell), but this type of loop broke man's neck. Ms. Dasha left hanging at the end of the rope without any negative effects as long as the rope was not removed. This type does not kill, it killed at the end of their fall. <br /> <br /> And right before going to rob a bank (in flashback), they paused outside the group hugs - one bandanna hiding his face - it would be obvious to people on the street <br /> < br /> bad editing. - a battery pack under the jacket, and it is obvious that the clip "long ride" shows them along the top, and then turns the film <br /> <br /> I did like the fact that they kept the stage with a horse, taking shit. - it seemed symbolic. The entire film was shit.
