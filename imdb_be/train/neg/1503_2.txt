it's incredible! Fidani (he was also the spirit) was one of the cheapest director around the world. The film stole the original name of Leon "Duck you sucker!" But to tell the sad story of Pinkerton agent against the killer "Testa di Ferro" (unlikely Gordon Mitchell, stuntman). All the bad and the crazy in this pelicula filmed in expensive scenery Lazio. The history of bad and mad at the same time. Fidani failed and ingenuos simultaneously. The story was some crazy illogical things (as the discussion in the house of the sheriff and demential appearance of Butch Cassidy!?!?!?!?!? Yes, in fact, Butch Cassidy, who is portrayed as an idiot). Terribles Nuit Americaine, absurd comportaments, illogical plot, bad acting and appearance fugace one of the most renowned TV presenter in the history of Italian television, Renzo Arbore. Ah, of course: Klaus Kinski. So, the great and terrible, but I'm sure he was only in it for the money up for the game with the iron horses) 2 of 10, but ... Do not miss it !!!!!
