Scary movie with Ramones bit scattered. Your worse than the average for the 1970s / 80th comedy format cool kids taking over the school with some bizarre plan. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who enjoys the Ramones and the school bent on fighting against their oppressive administration. Forget the movie and watch a bit of the Wild Zero starring Guitar Wolf, if you want an entertaining B movie. Terrible acts literacy terrible, terrible story, with the approval seal of the Ramones, with probably need money quickly, so they said yes to this film. It is logical that I can think of, because this movie blows.
