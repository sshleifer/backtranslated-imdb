I'll say one thing about this film: there is a lull. You can not get tired of watching it. The problem is that it is too hard. There is too much action and need calm! That is the risk you take in today's action movies. You want it to be interesting, but not exaggerated. It's a way overblown. <br /> <br /> While acting in, and there are a few "names" in the i Gary Busey Roy Scheider, it still has the look of the film «B». The best part of this is Scheider dialogue :. Only the "A" part of the film «B» <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is strictly Rambo mentality, but had a few scenes standout. One in particular was a very innovative scene involving landmines. It was unforgettable. Not enough other scenes had to do it a long time keeper.
