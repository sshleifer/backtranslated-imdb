Seeing all of the negative reviews of this film, I realized that this could be another comic masterpiece, which was not quite supposed to be. I watched the first two fight scenes, listening to ordinary dialogue made terribly Lungren, and all the other actors cast in the eastern, and I found the movie so badly that it was interesting. Then Brandon Lee is part of the history and severity begin to fly, the story falls apart, the writers begin to drink and film wear is welcome, as it turns into the worst action movie EVER. <br /> <br /> Lungren beats its previous efforts in «The Punisher» and others, as well as all the films Van Damme, Seagal movies, Rocky without Stallone movies, for that clear honor. This film is the absolute worst action (check face Tia Carrera, when it is anywhere from Dolph, it's worth a laugh), with the worst dialogue ever (Brandon Lee comment about small Dolph is the worst line ever in the film) and the worst outfit in the film (Dolph in the full Japanese attire). Painting "Tango and Cash" with the worst effect, answer "Commando" meets "Friday the 13th" (because of the nudity and senseless Lungren performance is very Jason Voorhees type), an hour and fifteen minutes of the movie joke. <Br / > <br /> good (how about Sun awful) performances go on a bad guy (who still looks constipation through its execution) and Carrera (someone says that its 5 lines without breaking a laugh). Brandon Lee only there to be a sidekick Lungren, and do really terrible job in that. <br /> <br /> terrible, terrible film. Be careful and avoid it. If you see it, though, ask yourself why underwater arrows twice as clear as most are not underwater pictures. Speaking of underwater shots, check lame water fight with the worst fight scene-ending ever. This film has all the versions of a bad scene the struggle for those with short attention spans and fill in between the flashes of nudity. <br /> <br /> Poor poor film !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
