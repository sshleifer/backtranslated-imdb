I wonder what the people who gave it 10 saw him, I did not. This film has a very difficult time, following and / or stay on site. If someone tells you that it's a comedy, do not be fooled, this is about 98% per cent of the odd drama and comedy 2%. All the actors turn in a great performance that can not be denied, however, it seems that it is really lost something somewhere. I do not know when the original script was good and it had to be edited down or what. It was a potential, and instead it was really a failure. I would really like an hour and a half, I've invested in this film back, but the video rental place does not return in time. Save your money and see something else.
