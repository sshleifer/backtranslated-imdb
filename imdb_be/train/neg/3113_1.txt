This film is a mess. I am surprised that even a theatrical release. Without Robin Williams, he would have gone straight to video. It is poorly written. It is poorly directed. It's worse offense is that he took an interesting topic, and reduced it to a ridiculous and boring thriller that has no thrills and no suspense and no internal or emotional logic.Especially after the first half hour of the film Wings of a series of funny set pieces so on on top of that audience, I saw it was laughing at him. Save your money. The trailer is completely misleading - it is not disturbing and there are no thrills - in fact, really the worst crime of the film is that it's just boring.
