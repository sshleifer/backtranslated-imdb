Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of fantasy. However, this film is not for me. Many flimsy arguments are trying to support the claim that film that the dragons may have ever existed. The film mentions a connection to a variety of stories from different countries, but not in a position to examine them more carefully, that would give the film some credibility. The film uses a (good!) CGI, we were told to tell a story of a young dragon fantasy life. This is combined with the popular TV show-CSI-style flash-forward, to make it look like something scientific, it is certainly not the case. In many cases, the arguments / flimsy keys. In some cases, the keys used to show the dragons may have existed, or fly, or spit fire just invalid. To see it just makes me get cramps in my fingers. Even fiction film needs to be some degree of reality in it, but this one just does not have it. Result: it is pretentious fantasy CSI documentary film is not worth watching.
