I do not see it. it was one of the stupidest movie I've ever seen. it is difficult to be Mormons sometimes when there are movies like it out there. What a sad view of the Mormon life. I can tell you, if you've seen this film, it's not all as it is generally in a single unit. if it were, I do not think I would make it through. it's too bad that most of the films made by a group of Mormon geeks who have nothing better to do. the action was so bad that my wife and I only made it to the end. I guess you could say that it had all the hallmarks of B movie. It has a C movies? anyway ... I just thought that this movie sucked and was full of cheese. I want some Mormons begin to make some quality films.
