Really sad that this is supposedly the highest budget «Halestorm Entertainment» had to work. All involved should be fined for littering, as they are all wasted celluloid good for nothing more than filling the garbage. Not only write the brutal and terrible joke, but the camera work and the quality of an amateur film at best. The soundtrack sounds like it was created by some guy laptop. The worst thing is that I actually sat through it all. I think that just because I could not believe that I actually pay to buy a ticket and that the theater I saw it actually decided to show the "film".
