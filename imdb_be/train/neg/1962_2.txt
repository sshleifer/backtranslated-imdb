The only scary thing about this movie is the thought that the one who made it can make a sequel. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end of the "Tooth Fairy" was just downright scary. Seemingly bad acting children's film, which is confused with the "Wizard of Oz" witch melting and happy kids graduating in combination with some of the bad effects of dried blood and swearing. <br /> <br /> Half of the actors, it seems quite unnecessary to be comfortable there, except that the killed in some way. Sister, two brothers, Cherise aura reader and Mrs MacDonald have no meaning in the film entirely - they can integrate them into the main story for some interesting side stories, but apparently could not be bothered. People are watching the movie know the characters there some bloody scenes of death, but come on, at least, TRY and have a small area for them. History as a whole is weak with erratic behavior of the characters that makes you want to eat all of the witch. <br /> <br /> Add the weak plot and poor acting together (children especially wood), and the film ends in complete failure. MST3K If only he could have had a go at it ...
