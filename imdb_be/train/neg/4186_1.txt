My comment had nothing to do with the political sentiments found in the film. In fact, they are quite comparable to mine. What drives me is the fact that from the point of view of the movie, it's stupid and devoid of any semblance of plot, motive or dialogue. Maybe someone should tell Neil that substituting the lyrics, which are not able to inspire someone outside the shrinking audience is not the same as creating characters who are motivated to talk because of the events created by a writer or director. Stupid story remains the same in spite of the religious heritage of Neil Young. Most children's scene is where the devil to dance their way to the bar slips tonic for the unsuspecting hero, which then finds its way onto the dance floor in the mouth the word Young song of the heroine, who does not know that it happened. Somehow these two dream up schemes, where they will go to the West Coast in search of ????? Sorry Neil, a shelf with music and leave a film of Stephen Stills.
