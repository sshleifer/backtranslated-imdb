Do you believe in God or not. Do you believe in Jesus or not. Do you believe that He is the Son of God, or not. The choice is yours. <br /> <br /> Director Denys Arcand has really done everything he could to bring back Jesus to a mere historical figure, a social worker, the son of two people, and not the Son of God the Holy Spirit and Mary, who again opened the heavens for us. Encourage more explosions happening in the world of evolution, rather than to see the beauty of creation. The film reflects what some theologian "modern findings" on the actor who plays Jesus in the Passion Play, which is happy to include them in your game. <br /> <br /> In the illustrated priest who goes into the sanctuary, where the Passion Play is performed in Montreal has a sexual relationship with one of the female players in the Passion Play, rather than to show our love to God through celibacy. Most often disgusted director of the Church is clearly visible. <br /> <br /> The director tried to make a parallel between the life of Jesus and the life of Passion Play actor. This is a great attempt, but depicting the Resurrection with organ transplantation in the Passion Play actor in other organs is, as the director thinks about Jesus. <br /> <br /> My opinion does not matter, the view of God, but I do not want to stand in the shoes of director and actors, when Jesus stood before the throne.
