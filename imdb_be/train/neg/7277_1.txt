"National Lampoon is in the movie" the worst movie ever made, surpassing even the brainless "Plan 9 from Outer Space." At least, this movie was simply incompetent; Lampoon film, on the other hand, as an inept and mean. Once the films used to respect the intelligence of its audience. This one, however, has a stinking, rotten carcass to our faces. - and then trying to rub our noses in it <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good part of the movie are nude scenes; and I agree that mistakes Hansel and Dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh, and the flesh is very nice. But the filmmakers do not seem to understand that even T & A requires a good story to surround him. There's nothing of that here. <br /> <br /> stubborn filmmakers save the worst for last. The third of the three segments ugly trio. In this vignette, Robby Benson plays an eager-beaver young police officer in the service of his first day at work. It works in tandem with a tired, cynical Oldtimer Widmark plays. For a moment, we have given hope that this film will end triumph. Of course, we think, stick boy attitude muddies the cynic and change it for the better. <br /> <br /> The desperate hope! Instead, a cynic wins the day - and the spark in this boy is doused forever. "National Lampoon goes to the movies" and head straight into the toilet, I ask us to follow him in the sewers. Nominally, it's a comedy. But where is the humor?
