I saw the movie as a child, when he was released in the theater, and it was so bad that he was the makings of a family joke. If the rating was zero, this film will get it. Dinosaurs were terrible. The plot was ridiculous. Actions really has no right to be called to act. The only reason I even remember the name of the movie so well, because my family is still talking about how bad it really was.
