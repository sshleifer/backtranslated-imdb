Unusual, independent, Theater, Christian Slater - all these teasers, which made me look to spend an hour or so "opening" the gem of the film. Boy, was I disappointed. Julian It never gets above itself. The film is relentlessly self-consciousness. I have found that are not able to suspend disbelief for a moment. The obviously overdone, theatrical set, exaggerated, obviously, theatrical acting, it is exaggerated, obviously theatrical guides - well, you get the idea. <br /> <br /> allegory should not be delivered sledge hammer style. And it's hard to feel much of anything for Julian Po, because we never know about it. Funny girlfriend annoying inhabitants, stupid priest, the self-willed children - why would anyone, especially someone with a life long ambition to reach the sea (the nature of Slater), decided to stay in such a gloomy place?
