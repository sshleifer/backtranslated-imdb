My first acquaintance with Templarios not good. I was thrilled to find this name among the proposals from Anchor Bay video that brought us other cult classics such as "Spider BabyÂ». The print quality is excellent, but it alone can not hide the fact that the film is deadly boring. There is an exciting opening sequence, in which the inhabitants of the most severe revenge on the Knights Templar (and set it all in motion), but everything else in the movie is slow, difficult and, ultimately, unfulfilling. Adding insult to injury: the film has been dubbed, subtitled entirely, as promised on the video jacket.
