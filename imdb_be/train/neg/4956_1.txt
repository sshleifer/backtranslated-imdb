If this cartoon first broadcast, I was under the impression that it would be at least half of the descent path, boy I was wrong. I have to admit, watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin with George Clooney many years ago. I watched a few episodes, and two of them Batman just get his ass left and right of the Penguin, who fought as Jet Li and beat the crap out of Batman, and I watched another episode where Batman got his example pushed Joker again, which, apparently he used the Jackie Chan moves while flipping through the air like a ninja. So, if there were the Joker or Penguin ever match for Batman? and even worse, when they were Joker and Penguin Kung Fu colleague Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It is really inconvenient, difficult and sad as the image of the Batman is portrayed in the show. Animation is horrible and terrible dialogue. As an advocate of Batman, since my childhood, I can honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at any cost, because it does not project the true image of Batman. This cartoon is more like a wannabe kung fu Flick, and if you really want to see the classic cartoon Batman I highly recommend Batman animated series, but this cartoon is no more than a piece of S --- T! Get Batman: The Series gives life and not waste my time with that cartoon.
