It is unlikely that anyone other than those who love silent films will appreciate any lyrical camera-work and busy (but scratchy) background bill that accompanies the 1933 release. Although the sound has come into use in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell a story about a woman who married the unfortunate, who throws her husband a young man after a romantic interlude in the woods. <br /> <br /> most clearly photographed the scene of a jealous husband, giving the young man a ride for a ride to the city, based on driving normally until he realizes that the man his wife's lover. In a fit of jealousy, he travels at high speed in the direction of the railway crossing, but changes his mind at the last moment, losing his temper. This is probably the most tension filled scenes in the otherwise decidedly clumsy and obviously contrived plot. <br /> <br /> Hedy Lamarr is given a close-up view of the treatment handed out to Marlene Dietrich its discoverer, but its beauty has not yet been clarified by beauticians as they were when she was taken to Hollywood. Her work consists mainly of looking sad and sullen, and mourns the loss of her marriage with only short flashes a smile when she finds her true love (Aribert MOG), a handsome young stallion, who is looking for his clothes after bathing nude. <, Br /> <br /> swimming scene is very short, secretly photographed, and not worth all the heat it seems to be generated. Love scenes decisions in the future, also artfully photographed originally lyrical pictures evident throughout most of the film - so cleverly. More remains representation using symbolism - and this is the thing that has another announcing the film is a genus of lyrical masterpiece <br /> <br /> This is not so .. It's frustrating, primitive in their crude sound parts (including painstaking symphonic music in the background) and, of course, Miss Lamarr lucky that Louis B. Mayer saw the film and based on this, given her career in Hollywood. He must have seen something in my work that I did. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that it was conceived as a silent film with the camera does all the work. Dissonance "working" scene in the conclusion goes on for too long, and it is jarring intrusions that do not require any. It is not able to finish the film in the corresponding note.
