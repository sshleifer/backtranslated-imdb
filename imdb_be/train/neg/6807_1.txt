Spoilers? Maybe some of the details, but nothing too plot related. Not so, as it was important in this film. <br /> <br /> Air Rage roughly breaks mid-air infiltration premises ordered. Ice-T is a team of four "elite" commando who wear baggy black shirt, which we can only imagine must hide an invisible armor, their idiotic tactics (like the fact that the 3 classes used in the Star Wars game on the playground) bring them to absorb a barrage of shots. <br /> <br /> What amused me most about this film was the use of look-HAS-been actors. You will immediately recognize Cyril O'Reily as someone who once played in a movie that you really liked, though it's been so long that you probably will not be able to put him (it was flogging). Here Cyril played a decent knock-off character Bill Paxton. Most Hilarious is fattened for slaughter pig Gil Gerard, who is so thick that you will never recognize its Buck Rogers TV. Instead of prompting him gently heroic past of the character, by Gerard gives us impenetrable performance fat crust tough guy persona, which was clearly imagineered for John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a good look-hybrid performance as the type of Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas. During 10 years with New Jack City, the current Ice-T has deteriorated perfectly. It does not act as regurgitation lines that he could actually remember. <br /> <br /> One of the elements is played in this film is a CD-ROM of classified information. This is a carry-on baggage, and it appears to be entirely encrypted and incredibly, despite the security-savvy aura NSA Gerard character. Which is a joke. I strongly doubt that the information alleged to be on the CD will ever even all gather in a portable format. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that in the closed plane without silencers, shooting is not as loud as compressed air, and is neither man drops flinch, therefore, apparently no budget Foley. Weapons range selected quite funny. Use the flight attendant with the coffee pot on the most realistic portrayal of violence in the film. If it takes a user-gun mini-tyrant who must be one of the worst specimens gun ever, it's too stupid. This elite team will carry the MP-5s for this type of thing, or perhaps, SOCOMM .45, or even customized Hi- Powers when they were really old school, or perhaps something FN 5,7, when the new school .. . Lame-92FS on the standard release is completely unbelievable, having lost most of his coolness after a deadly weapon I. bad guys, supposedly experienced soldiers predictors of the types of assorted mixture of absurdity, as in the above mini-Uzi pistol and a Tec-9 with the notorious non food - functional barrel extender which is not a silencer. <br /> <br /> It was one touch of realism, on which I would like to fix other reviewer: stewardess and Ice-T was below the vessel up to 10,000 feet to "breathe the air" before they opened the door. And I also had the impression that the flight attendant was not able to get the door closed, she basically just gave up at this point. As for landing, there was no mention flaps to about 2 seconds before landing. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Only the Duke escapes danger Roscoe P. Coltrane in the «PASS» can shame the film footage to use. They obviously chose the incredible (and retired) SR-71, because they could not get a stock with the F-one hundred and seventeenth In addition, they were conserved as early as 2001, well let's forget for a moment that the SR-71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of B-2, and at close range ... Well, "not an expert, but I there are doubts as to whether it will be invisible to radar. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, repeated references to the «F-15s», where they were shown F -16s was ridiculous. Details of the 747 was pretty stupid. Neither the airline does not deliver, that several passengers on the 747 to start with, not to mention the fact that everything else was stupid about it. Note the use of open wiring. <br /> <br /> Wow. What a show. Catch it at the stars or something. Do not pay to rent it, but watch it for a laugh. In the competition for the worst movie ever, right up there with no rules, which at least had some novelty.
