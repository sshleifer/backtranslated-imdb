In fact, really bad. As the film is bad to get done? I kept waiting for some kind of saving in terms of the plot, interesting camera work, or at least some gratuitous nudity, but I got nothing. I just watched Cabin Fever, and I thought it was a train wreck (for nudity and pancakes, except for), but it looks like a genius compared to this dreck. Best script doctor in the world could not save this rotten bunch of smelly poo. <br /> <br /> The only thing going for this "film" is that it is over. <br /> <br /> I have a headache just thinking about this film and trying to write something. Ugh! I am glad that I only paid $ 5 for it, and it will soon end up on a landfill.
