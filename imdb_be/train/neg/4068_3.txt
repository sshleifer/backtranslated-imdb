With such a name, it is above and beyond my understanding how this film just does not appeal to me. Of course, there are a few decent moments and a bit untidy baked blood, but the way the film was made and the overall storyline just struck me as stupid and lazy to try rich tactics "shock" ... controversial story begins with a man rapes and kills a woman stranded the roadside. He and his brother complicity in prison as long as the brother breaks and arranges to meet her friend in the woods. He ends up forcing her into the house, where they screw, and then he shows her collection of abducted children in the cellar. Heavily drugged prisoners consist of his old friend, who raped her in «Grabby» neighbor and her sexually abrasive boss. He explains to her that he was going to kill them all. She completed kills him, and then turning her focus to the men's side (or pigs), which it tortures and kills himself ... In the majority of cases of violence and humiliation, has to do w t have genitals and destruction - all this is far from alarming and in fact soft. The best scene is a graphic masturbation brooms are some morbid person, rape ... Of course, 'I spit on your corpse, the IP ss on your grave! "Was conceived as an unofficial sequel to" I Spit on Your Grave "- based mainly name and link the main character gives - believing that her mother was Camille Keaton. I personally believe that the wildly blasphemous statement! This film is boring, amateur disorder that tends to strike, but failed miserably ...
