It's thrown together piece of feces is so many ridiculous scenarios that in the end it is a laugh riot is absolutely hilarious. Too bad, as a prerequisite perspective (as it often is in Duhllywood), but in the hands of a writer, he flows off into la-la land. <br /> <br /> Lowe is in prison serving a sentence for DUI, he killed his lover. We will see his nightmares just so that we know that he feels very bad about it. Then his cellmate hanged himself neighbor. Or is it? Lowe has some suspicions, but throws them quickly. His suspicion is so weak that the bad guys do not have anything to worry about. So why are they then set it to be killed? Ah, that's where this story could get interesting. That's where it falls from the rails, and once the rails, he decides that it can get away with insulting the audience's attention for the next hour of anesthesia. <br /> <br /> ************ **** SPOILERS ************************* *** <br /> <br /> I will not bore with an endless list of irrationality, it is worth, but consider this ending. Lowe was trapped in the bad guys on the train. They want to tape it has, because the tape will screw up their boss, and their. So the train went 3 officers, weapons shown, ready to save Lowe. The bad guys are killing policemen in front of half of the passengers and then continue to chase .... Lowe, to get the tape. GOOD DAY !!!! killing 3 police officers in public places will take you into a deep doodo, to hell with the tape. Nevertheless, they are to go through the shopping center shooting up the place, as if the public is not there as witnesses, and finally seize Lowe and bad guy still wants to tape !!!
