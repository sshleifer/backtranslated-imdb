I saw this film in my English class this afternoon and was amazed at how bad this version was. Do not get me wrong, George C. Scott was terrific, like Scrooge, but the rest of the cast is not so very bad. Sometimes I could not stop laughing at silly action and repeated the line: "Merry Christmas to all" Other times I almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the Charles Dickens short story about a rich guy who does not think that Christmas is not nothing but a nonsense. After 30 minutes, the rich guy is visiting the three ghosts, who are urging him to celebrate Christmas after all. <br /> <br /> I can not understand how this film, with the script, so bad, that should be written in five minutes, it may be well appreciated. Instead this piece of junk, I recommend to you, Bill Murray comedy Scrooged. That, at least, it was funny ...
