History The idea is excellent. Unfortunately, the implementation allows it down. <br /> <br /> The film lacks pace, on the one hand. This should be an exciting ride, but it is slow and more than a little sad. <br /> <br /> I think that the problem is mainly in the script and editing. There's not enough obstacles and reversals inflate the unknown, and there are scenes that do not really move the story forward is very effective. <br /> <br /> The producers should have seen it in the script, and insisted that major rewrites. Unfortunately, if the producer is also a writer and director, this is probably not going to happen <br /> <br /> Most of the action seems to be quite flat, and down to the director. - all the actors have been fully competent in other projects. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because with better writing, editing and direction, it could be a really good thriller.
