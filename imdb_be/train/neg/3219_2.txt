Someone called Howard Koch schlockmeister, but he did not write the screenplay for "Casablanca", is not it? Not he. Maybe there's more than one Koch sneaking around in Hollywood, and I'm not too fond of "Casablanca" in any case. Wait a minute - yes, there is another Howard Koch sneaking around Hollwyood. I am the one who wrote "Casablanca." Whatever. I'll put the same attention to this comment as «Howard W. Koch» put into this production, which is to say, just a little. <br /> <br /> Do you know what it sounds like? Someone read a note on the Cliff Shakespeare "King Lear" and decided, since no original thoughts were not on board the inbound Inspiration Express to update it and Hollywoodize it with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> There are differences. Lear decides to divide his vast estates between the three sisters, and before doing so, ask them how they like it. Two sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose to get the money from him. Third, a good girl, and refuses to go to the opera Lear. But in the game, Lyra remain alive to regret his decision to give these two Connivers his stash and to deprive an honest girl. He winds up crazy and naked in the storm on the moors, putting flowers in his hair, and hallucinations. Children can do this for you. (Take my child, for example. After all the effort I squandered on raising him, he showed no interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer? No.) In the end, everything in the game is dying. <br /> <br /> in the film seems to be a good sister morose and suicidal, but when she tries to exclude yourself, someone jumps and saves it so that the end, more or less satisfied. That's the difference between Hollywood and the real tragedy if you do not define Hollywood tragedy self-sufficient.
