Filmatography: Excellent, good camera angles (I do not remember seeing a movie in recent years, with a good close-up before). I could have avoided the terrible scenes with soft camera. NY depicted good.I like an inverted angle, in particular (another touch) <br /> <br /> Music :. Not impressed. The songs do not stay in your mind even after watching the film. Maybe I was expecting the same quality as «Anniyan». Disappointment. <br /> <br /> Starring: Kamal need to slowly move away from evil action sequences. His age and stomach really show. Furthermore, it should avoid close romantic sequences go ahead. It was very uncomfortable to see a mature / aged star is still trying to play as a 20+ character scenes. Love can be expressed at any age; as we get older, you can express your love is beautiful from a distance (not touching a woman too much. For example, love is manifested in Razhnikant «chandrmukhi»). <br /> <br /> Jyotika only appears in the movie namesake. I do not know why she took it. Well, it's not my problem, I think, <br /> <br /> Others are simply small presence <br /> <br /> Direction: .. I waited Gautham succeed (or measurement) to translate his other film " Kakka Kakka ". He disappointmented me. It took a long time to release the film because of various problems. He slips in a few scenes. Even abvious things got slipped from acclaimed director <br /> <br /> In general :. Just okay movie. Too many graphics. REALLY not for children (and adults, who are waiting for some sort of "entertainment"). <br /> <br /> Thx
