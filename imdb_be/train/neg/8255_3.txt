At least, this is not a complete sensless violence or fluff. It's also not very fully thought or smooth storyline. This story had some potential, but the director seems to have lost site green. History messy and leaves a strange <br /> <br /> napravleniyaha to no conclusion. I do not believe that the director has spent a lot of time around the golf country club, either. Some of the descriptions of the absurd. Not very attractive.
