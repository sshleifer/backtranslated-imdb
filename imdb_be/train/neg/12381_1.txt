This film is really disgusting. He plays on the urban paranoia 70's / 80's and puts it in the school context. I'm not saying that urban crime is not a problem for many people, whether entirely school / have not been problem areas, but this part of the infamous operation takes bun. Violence beyond all imaginable real, but in this case it is not the case, social issues, but the white, upper-middle-class student uses it to transform itself into a thief crime in the law of its high local schoiol. And he certainly knows how to play the system. It sounds that are familiar. Yes. This turd purely violent operation, indeed the opposite piece of work. This is an alarming brutality removed as a social commentary. This applies in the same category as trash like Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on and so forth. The only remarkable thing is that Michael J. Fox was so broke at the time, he had to do things like this.
