Mt sister and I'm a self-styled lovers of horror films. We have seen almost everything, especially zombie movies. Now we have seen a lot of good about zombies, and a lot of bad movies. It is much the worst film I've ever seen in my life. Moreover, it acts badly, but the special effects, graphics and ever "zombie" makeup was the worst I have seen. If you can even call it a make-up (black eye shadows around the eyes) It's proof that you should never judge a book by its cover. The reason for the cover to the film is the only sweet things. You do this film itself i not look mercy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so adamant about this movie I went so far as to put a note on the inside of the film, before I returned it in the film, saying, "This movie sucks, do not waste your time, go back nowÂ» hahahhaa I do not want someone else to spend a good movie night on this POS movie! I do not even know how he got the ratings, it did so must be in the negative
