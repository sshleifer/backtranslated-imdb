Not really my genre, it's a street fight action at once on the DVD is the one I just ran out of one put it at the time we had a few beers. I'm relatively open and fully supporter Eamonn Walker, so I got ready to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Blood and Bones story Isiah Bone, a former prisoner who becomes a street fighter, for unknown reasons, which ultimately that unfold as the film progresses. Blah-blah-blah. <br /> <br /> What a tedious film. I understand that films like this do not expect too much in the site, but they have to cram in such a silly, predictable and quite stupid story line? It may not be important, but Golly gum is annoying me. Better not to plot and clear action than the stencil covered Fleabag mongrel narrative. Loaded with absolutely unfounded and unachieving sentimental nonsense is cinematic equivalent thin skin stuffed turkey viscera rotten. I should probably mention at this point that this is, of course, the drawing point of the film: the fighting. Even by itself, the struggle is rather poor. Bone manages to take a well-established strictly artificial street fighter in single strikes (a large block or two is laughworthy filmmakers attempt to correct this mismatch); fighters who never seem to conclude that an attack on one stupid trick. Even this repetitive and stupid, broken arms and legs of the person with constant diligence that we get to see again and again. <br /> <br /> A mediocre film-by-numbers film that deserves its status directly to DVD without doing absolutely nothing new, and we have seen again and again. And do not even particularly good.
