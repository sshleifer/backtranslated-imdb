Ah, Fulci, down. This is the most notorious Italian <br /> <br /> famous "Zombie" and absolutely unwatchable "<br /> <br /> Mental" and «Manhattan Baby.» Well, add to it unwatchable <br /> <br / > list. <br /> <br /> The plot, as it relates to the Nekkid woman who wears gold <br /> <br /> mask and G-string. She wants to duplicate the power of young <br /> <br /> spike, which has many charming arrows and bow. They are magical <br /> <br /> because they glow. Arrow command boy with a guy in a bad wig, <br /> <br /> and they spend most of the movie to save each other from the sequences of action /> <br /> <br flat. In the end, Nekkid chicken defeated, but not <br /> <br /> before taking a mask and remind me why I broke up with <br /> <br /> My high school girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Fulci each shot bathed in an orange glow fills the screen <br /> <br /> smoke. Nothing like a steaming orange sequence of actions to make you <br /> <br /> Sunny Delight and craves a cigarette. Special Effects <br /> <br /> ridiculous. In one sequence, we ambiguously gay duo <br /> <br /> attacked by dozens of arrows, which evidently lay a scratch on <br /> <br /> the movie itself. Most of the effects of the budget should have been <br /> <br /> spent on Fulci-Licious gusset, which is composed entirely of beat <br /> <br /> wounds. Hey, we can all use a good beat wound once <br /> <br /> time, but if you get into the wound spurting unnecessary, it gets boring. <br /> <br /> I have everything to play with the brightness setting on the TV anyway <br /> <br /> just to see what the hell was going on. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of talk about the performance of omens and prophecies, so let me <br /> <br /> do a little glimpse into the future ... if you find this movie and watch it, <br /> <br /> you'll regret it. The scene on the video box (media) do not <br /> <br /> appears in the film in any context whatsoever. "Conquest" is a fraud <br /> <br /> performance. MST3K that could do with it! <br /> <br /> This is the ranking (R) for a strong physical violence, strong gore, women <br /> <br /> nudity, male nudity short and mild sexual content. <br /> <br />
