It's a bad season for Bollywood with all the big releases with massive hype around is a dud at the box office. London Dreams is no exception to this. Let's analyze this ... It's all about chasing your dreams and how far you are going to achieve this. Sounds impressive right? But, unfortunately, the film is not so. <br /> <br /> Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is a novice musician who wants to make it the largest ever. His dream is to perform at Wembley Stadium in front of 90,000 spectators joyful shouting his name. He joined the two brothers, Zoheb and Wasim (Aditya Roy debutants & Ranvijay) and received excellent (aspen). Together they form the «London Dreams» group of the dream. After impress the chief of the record company, they become overnight sensations. Arjun is secretly in love with Priya, he does not want to show off, until he reaches his goal. Arjun then brings his childhood friend Manjit Khosla aka Manu (Salman Khan), a flirty carefree guy who has no ambition in life is to join their group. Mann is training musician and a real talent, which after Arjun became the envy of superior skills manna, and his love affair with Priya. Arjun using Zoheb plans to poison Mannu. What happens next forms the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Coming to the technical aspects, we feel only a shadow Vipul Amritlal Sha, we took a great interest in London namaste. I felt that he simply imagined the scenario. To cut short, well-known operator. Scenario Suresh Nair dulls, even if it does have its moments. Determined in a predictable manner, the script bore you with the hard. The camera work was amazing to capture the beauty of London. This is the only interesting part of the song during playback. <br /> <br /> A few hummable song while others go through a noisy fare. Ajay was he who stole the show with his negative character. Salman is uniform, and it irritates you. Osin is forgotten, and I do not that it will make it big in Bollywood. Aditya Roy impressive and Ranvijay strictly in order. Brinda as a branch that is what we have seen in countless films. Ompuri continues with production. I do not want to fold down about the shortcomings, as it will be a very difficult task. <br /> <br /> And finally, let me put it simple and direct, London Dreams soulless film that you can better enjoy on DVD.
