We acquired this series on DVD all of the glowing reviews we saw here. I gave it three stars because it can be little doubt that sometimes the action, directing and writing brilliant. In fact, they are so brilliant that we have not seen the propaganda that were transferred so smoothly on the series. If one observes his own vision, one will see the whole litany of radical right wing beliefs being published Fox (faux) News Network. To avoid giving away any spoilers, I will refrain from showing all of the dozens of individual cases. A quick look on the sites found here on the IMDb reveals that all torture for gun control to the right of the network, to provide "Infomercials" and call them news justified with nice plot twists and hot speeches by some of the best actors in the world . We watched a lot of shows, and finally gave up in disgust when they justify torture with Attorney General Gonzales as a prime example of why all forms of torture should be used in the name of protecting us all. The series also manages to humiliate gay men and women in subtle ways, using them as a plot device, which show the evil people. In general, a full litany of radical religious right wing. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as evidence that America has lost its way in the first half of this century. As a student of history myself, I would describe this program in alliance with the production of propaganda Goebbels, Hitler and some of Hollywood's production of propaganda for the American audience during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to use this as a teaching tool to help students understand how subtle propaganda can be then by all means do it. Just make sure to buy a cheap used copy, so you can avoid the enrichment of the ultra right wing on Pho network produced a mockery.
