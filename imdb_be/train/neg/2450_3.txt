I looked version of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings when I was halfway through reading the two towers, and I thought it was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> At this time, the animated version of The Lord of the Rings was released on DvD, but I told myself that I finished reading the two towers and the Return of the King, before watching it (as I thought that it showed the entire trilogy) . <br /> <br /> so that when I did finish the trilogy I went and brought DvD, that was a stupid idea, because it was absolutely rubbish. <br /> <br /> I acturly boring 20 minutes in to it, which was really weird, because I love this book, and I shooked, that the manufacturer could this film, even the thought of fitting at least 1 and a half books in up to 2 hours 8 minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> none of the characters did not have any emotions when they talk, and they seemed to be reading his pages, even my favorite character that Gandalf does not give up, it is interesting at all. <br /> <br /> animation was only good in parts of the movie for the orcs, except (they looked awful) and Aragorn and Sam's face. <br /> <br /> I do not know how this film was released, because there was not even a proper ending, but perhaps it was good that the manufacturer has run out of money, because the film could not because of me better. <br /> <br /> I just hope that no one will judge the book this film. <br /> <br /> 3/10
