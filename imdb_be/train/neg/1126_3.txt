I rented it to think that it can be fun, and it might be an interesting story, except that it was said in such uninteresting form. It is difficult to follow, editing strange, awkward story, mumbling characters, all in all terribly boring waste of time. I just could not get into it and do not care what happened to the heroes - not even Ian Holm can save this film. If you need a cure for insomnia, I would skip it. 3/10, and it is to be generous.
