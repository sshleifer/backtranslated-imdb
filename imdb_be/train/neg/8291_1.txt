Stupid dentist discovers that his wife has been unfaithful. Thus, no new storylines here. However, the authors failed to create silly, disgusting film. If you love to watch children vomiting, or see a dentist, imagining that he pulls all the teeth of his wife in a bloody horror type, go see (or rent) a film. If not, then move on to something else (MY FAIR LADY, anyone?)
