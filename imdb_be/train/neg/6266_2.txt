It seems that anyone can make a movie now. It's like all you need is a camera, a group of people to be your cast and crew, script, and a bit of money and you have the Wall movie. The problem is that talent is not always part of the equation, and often these types of low-budget films are duds. Shelves video shops filled with these so-called films. They are not even guilty pleasure, they are just a waste of celluloid that are better forgotten. Troma Entertainment is known for creating a movie collection, but most of them have gold film movies. Nevertheless, some of the films they put that they had nothing to do with the creation and some, like "Nightmare WeekendÂ» do not deserve any form of release at all. <br /> <br /> Pros: the actors do their best with lousy material. Some unintentional hilarity. Stroke at a good rate (after 81 minutes e) <br /> <br /> Cons :. Terrible letters which includes rotten dialogue scene and countless openings. Poorly lit, especially night scenes and an ending that you can not do at all. It does not make a lick of sense. Strongly typed. Cheap and very dated effects. Complete lack of character development and you will not care about anyone. This should be a horror film, but it is not lacking in this area, and it is not at all scary. Nothing interesting or exciting happens. Loaded with unnecessary padding <br /> <br /> Final thoughts :. I never expected that this would somehow forgotten gem, but I never thought it would be so bad. I do not know when this is the worst movie ever made, but it is a definite contender. Troma should allow this film to rot instead of giving him liberation. . Do not make the same mistake I did and let your curiosity get the best of you <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
