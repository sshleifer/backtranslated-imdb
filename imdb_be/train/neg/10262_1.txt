Now, I clicked on it out of curiosity and had to keep watching - in the same way that you look at a car accident ... <br /> <br /> I appreciate the fact that this is a parody, but that should not stop me from criticism of the god-awful directing, action and dialogue. Seriously, it is rated as one of the poorest films that I've seen - it was more like an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper, and the poor on that ... <br /> <br /> Well - some critical remarks (1) when the doctor had his heart attack in front of a monster (we never see the monster to attack it, so we assume CBO heart attack), the army and then launch projectiles, rockets, bullets monsters - which was feet from the doctor - until the doctor touched or missiles, and is still alive (2) army attack about 100 yards away, and we see the flamethrower used - geez, fl I things have a range of no more than 30 meters! (3) when the monster is trying to take the professor, the soldiers run into the classroom and the fire in the ceiling; Monster drops the baby, and the soldiers did not try to shoot the monster ??? come on! (4) The monster looks like it's something out of Power Rangers! (5) there is one scene where five "good guys" (the priest, the girl, a doctor, a reporter and a child) all look shocked, and we get a response (on the lines of the hands in your mouth) one after the other - so naturally! (6) general simply runs off, over and over again (7) refuses to try to electricity and will not listen to (8) acting badly (9) I mentioned a rubber monster suit ???? (10) that the god-awful music, non-stop!
