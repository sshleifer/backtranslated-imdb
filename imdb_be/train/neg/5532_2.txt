Rise of the zombies are not the worst film I've ever seen, but it's pretty far down the list. If the expedition is sent to Cambodia to open a business to create a zombie after the First World War, one of the members decides to use their knowledge for their own evil ambitions. And he succeeds, at least at first. Love triangle complicated history of some of them. <br /> <br /> It was a really tedious movie with a terrible actor that made it hard to tell who was a zombie and which were not. Conversation was a little better, and the story was unbelievable (not a zombie part of it, but the details associated with the "novel"). And while I have not any student or professional cinematography, camera work does not seem to help a lot of film too. <br /> <br /> While I have seen a few films that are even worse, it is unlikely to please anybody. This is bad, but not so bad that something-is-good kind of way.
