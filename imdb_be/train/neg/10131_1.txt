Well, I can once and for all put an end to the question: "What is the worst film ever made ... ever" This Flying Fury, starring and co-author Steven Seagal. Of course, there are many great bad movies, but this one takes the cake is that it takes itself so seriously. <br /> <br /> This is a Romanian made a film that speaks of how far Romania has to go to catch a Bollywood. He also talks about how utterly devoid of intelligence and talent of Steven Seagal began. This film is so bad that you literally feel violated after viewing and need to sit down in a corner shower and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again. <br /> <br /> He was released only on video (I can not imagine why), and I suspect that the workers who were to make the DVD, had to wear protective clothing and have regular consultations.
