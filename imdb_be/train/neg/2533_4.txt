I agree with most, if not all, of the previous commentator Tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). Zatoichi series is an excellent study of the nature combined with great goals and excitement <br /> <br /> I saw Zatoichi 1-13,15,16. I think that 14 was not released on region 1 (US). Zatoichi Rogue disappointment. The storyline was complex, and it seemed a hodgepodge of many previous stories Datoiti. At some point, I was wondering if I had not seen the previous film remake of Zatoichi. <br /> <br /> This film was a disappointment, because he began to depend on the effects (rolling heads, limbs, severed the blood) and less on the noble character of Zatoichi. All previous films failed at the basis of the plot and action, and won many followers, without the effects. <br /> <br /> I just hope that the rest of Datoiti films are not following the same trend. This is the first film Zatoichi his studio. I highly recommend all the previous films Datoiti - and recommend them.
