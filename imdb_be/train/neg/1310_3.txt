The plot is a simple old man who lives on the main road in a wooded area one day a man witnesses that kills a child in the forest. Soft to dig the old man should attempt to try to convince the police that he saw was not a figment of his imagination. Nevertheless, there is a problem, every time the old man leads police to where the murder will happen not a corpse can not be found. Soft digging a miniature dialogue that reflects most of the scenes of the film, an old man living in the house. In the film, I found that I was scared twice, namely, when a child is killed suddenly appears in front of the old one. The rest of the film, I have to admit, do not engage me; I found the film's pace is too slow. Limited dialogue is not a problem. However, the development of the plot and its conclusions after watching the movie, too long. I feel more could be made of the relationship, ghostly encounters with the child and an old man. Alone in the woods at night are not sure in your own mind can lead to some terrible situations, children are always afraid, like ghosts, see the dark water.
