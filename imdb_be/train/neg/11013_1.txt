I'm in a bad movie, but it has nothing going for it. Despite the fact that the morons have already mentioned, this is not funny. I know comedy and underground films, but it's so boring that the Director / Writer should prohibit EVER send anything other than the local cable access EVER again! despise this film for the love of movies and comedy. I can never get over how unfunny and boring this work was. If you like this film you are an end as sober there's nothing here. ZERO! If you need to compare the underground movies, see «Kentucky Fried Movie» or early John Waters. The film begins with a definition of satire, and I challenge anyone to show me a satire. The rule for this comedy ... FUNNY If you can say or do anything, but if it's not funny, you do not satirical, you're not nervous, you're just pathetic and this movie's just not funny. ZERO!
