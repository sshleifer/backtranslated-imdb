You know, I went to see "The Hills Have Eyes 2" wants to please. I really enjoyed the original and the remake was pretty interesting. They obviously had more money to throw around than Wes Craven made on the special effects for the second time. Although I still prefer the original film, the remake has been done well, and it was a kind of schadenfreude for me. Bloody, intense and great special effects. In short, a large popcorn horror film for any fan. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to "The Hills Have Eyes 2". Man, where do I start? Area or lack of one, paper thin. We're not breaking new ground here.The military decided to monitor the area, and all these people turn up missing. So what do we do now? Let's send in the National Guard to investigate. In true Hollywood fashion, we have to make them blunt and worst men ever seen. Gee, I've never seen that room before. To make a long story short, you have to kill mutants moron soldier one at a time in a graphical fashion. Once again on the big Nicotero special effects, but killing no matter how graphic it becomes boring and predictable. Honestly, I thought that this film was made just to grab a quick buck. It was bloody, and graphics, but I found it to be predictable, boring and not scary at all. For me it would be nice if this film contained one original thought.Wes Craven and his son shared a letter of duties, and he has been linked with a number of my favorite horror movies, but, unfortunately, this is not one of them.
