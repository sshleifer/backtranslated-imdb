Director Skepis (Roxanne) directs this good intention, but concedes comedy about Albert Einstein (Matthau) is trying to catch his scientific niece (Ryan) up with an ordinary guy Tim Robbins to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950s . In order to get Ryan Robbins like Einstein trying to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. Cute idea, but the film offers a flat with banal situations and silly dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and a terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat, but are not able to save the film. It is a pity that so much talent went into the production of such a dull movie. I would not recommend to anyone if they are not big fans of Meg Ryan.
