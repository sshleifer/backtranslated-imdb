I love the low budget independent films and had high hopes for it. But this movie is static. Never mind the cost of production, which is very noble for your budget, but Shagan deadly. However, these people achieve a lot with a little, but the film does not work at the most fundamental level. It's sad. Editing ice and pacing kiosks. This was supposed to be 65 minutes. The best thing about Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde, who has not seen enough. It was the most dramatic potential. Instead we have to suffer erosion Baltimorean-British stutter through endless and tedious exposition. It feels like a step backwater played Stick video. <br /> <br /> The noble efforts of each to produce, but the history of this tired need a kick in the pants and funky new technology low-budget had to give it a fresh voice. Instead, it's just lame new tire.
