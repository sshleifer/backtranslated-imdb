Mary Lou is a whore, whose spirit seeks revenge on those who allowed her to come to her fiery deaths in 1957 <br /> <br /> Well, the film mostly takes place in 1986, the film falls into the trap of the 80 countries / stupid special effects, including some strange madman looking horse. <br /> <br /> Either way, the spirit of Mary Lou does bad things to people and trying to take over the body of one person. Whether it is or is not possible, you should look to find out. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is in many ways a sad and is based on a bunch of useless characters. It is not quite a sequel, the only thing in common with the first name of high school. He has an average. horror flick fall back, blood, misery is senseless, knocking against the Catholic Church. The main material, boring film. <br /> <br /> action decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10. You can spend your time doing something else.
