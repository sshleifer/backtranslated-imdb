"Wrinkle time" series of books is my favorite episode from his childhood. I have read and re-read them more times than I can count over the last 35+ years. Symbols, with all its advantages and disadvantages, close and dear to my heart. This adaptation contained very little miraculous, magical, spiritual history, which I love so much. To say that I was disappointed by this film will be a great understatement. <br /> <br /> If you have never read the book (s), I imagine you'll like the movie. Acting is passable, the special effects are well made for TV movie, and the story is interesting. . However, if you love books, avoid this film at all costs <br /> <br /> I found this statement on the Wikipedia page of the novel: "In an interview with Newsweek, L'Engle said about the film," I expected that it will be bad, and it ". <br /> <br /> I'm like another reviewer here, feels the need to read the book again, to dispel this film out of my mind.
