Really strange bunch of dad! <br /> <br /> predictable, low-speed, destroys the soul, the mind is stunning film that by cutting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems ... well, almost necessary. <br /> <br /> action completed is made for fine dialogue, every scene, at least twice as long as it should be, the intricate details of how this career is falling apart or that a career is growing just too boring and mundane words. Music would be good if you do not have to sit through a movie, but in fact, three good songs is not enough reward for the effort required to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> By watching this film, I prayed to God to narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me. <br /> <br /> Never, never, never.
