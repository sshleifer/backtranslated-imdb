Hectometre While enjoyable film to poke plot holes show the brutal act, a primitive (in the best case), special effects (all of which caused me to see this movie three times in the last six years), the piece is one of the worst I have ever seen. I never know who the main characters, all I know is that the killer is using a portable guillotine, as can be seen on the site of the murder of the dance floor. In general, I'm not very fond of the movie, because only the first 30 minutes of pleasant rest mishmash of confused dialogue and images which are not able to progress the story to its logical conclusion (which I can not remember, anyway).
