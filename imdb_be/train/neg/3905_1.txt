Forget the Plan 9, this is the ultimate bummer, costume drama, clumsily directed, screenplay, acting, etc. This film is based on Isabel Allende's not much better than a novel. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in the non-Spanish films), as well as other actors, including Winona is, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons to try to get over this terrible scenario. Many mistakes (as, for example, so that when it does snow in Christmas Chile?) And it is very hard, with tons of this evil called "magical realism", that stands out as the worst movie of all time. It totally sucks !!!
