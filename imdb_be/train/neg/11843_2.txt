Just because the event really happened does not mean that he will do a good ScreenPlay / film. The Cat's Meow, Peter Bogdanovich asserts that based on real events that took place on a cruise organized by William Randolph Hearst. The writer paid more attention to the creation of whimsical characters than taking the time to create a story for the amazing characters inhabit. Key moments in history seem implausible; For example, if Hearst accidentally shoots manufacturer, believing it to Chaplin. On the basis of a key element of the history, for someone to wear a hat in those corny, and unnatural. The history of trying to be a dark comedy, but the cat's meow misses an important part of this equation, a comedy. There is also a lack of empathy for all the characters. It does not matter who is shot, who was killed, who is guilty and who is innocent. There is not a strong character to cheer for. As a result, it is difficult to take care of conflicts and eventually the result is of secondary importance.
