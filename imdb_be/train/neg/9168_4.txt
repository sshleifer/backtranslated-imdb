Randolph Scott left the United States for the greener pastures of Canada British Columbia. He wants to start a cattle ranch there with partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. They panic rushed their small herd through the toll bridge, built by Victor Jory. Later Jory cattle rustling and Williams lost his left arm during the scandal. <br /> <br /> From 1945 until 1962, when he retired, Randolph Scott made a number of well-themed adult westerns, some of them are considered true classics. Unfortunately, Cariboo Trail will never be listed among his best westerns. <br /> <br /> This is more like material, Roy Rogers and Gene Autry could use. History downright silly at times. Williams, who was to travel to Scott, he wanted to go to the prospects for gold, as he was a big hit at the time. He does not blame the thief, he accuses Scott convince him to make the trip for the loss of his hands. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a scene in the film, when Scott, Lee Tung Foo and Gabby Hayes captured by Indians. They escape, because the mule Gabby taught to hit the team, and it starts off on the Indians allows our heroes to escape. I'm not sure that would be played at Rogers movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, the story is actually wants you to believe that Tyro prospector Randolph Scott accidentally runs into a gold strike after a few lessons from prospectors Gabby Hayes about how to find gold. <br /> <br /> It was a parting of the film Gabby Hayes. It would be better if he went out in a good western and in fact he made some of the best of them with Randolph Scott before. <br /> <br /> I'm going to talk about it, though none Caribbean sun did any signs in the movie, it is one of the few Canadian films locale from the past, which do not have any horse. <br /> <br /> But if I were you, if you're not a big fan of Randolph Scott and Gabby Hayes, take the next detour Off The Cariboo Trail.
