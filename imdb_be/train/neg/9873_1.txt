I watched it with my mum, and we were like ... <br /> <br /> What the hell? We did not get at all. I may have this wrong, but the chair has something to do with the death of the father of the woman. This movie was terrible! This is not a film for those who like a good suspense film. Bad suspense movie! * Shrugs * cane in the movie I never saw him again. And I'm a big fan of movies in his lifetime, too! They seem to have given up trying to make films lost books. It's driving me crazy !!! <br /> <br /> And Whit was butt ugly, and yet, she loves him more than Hugh, who was a little bit better looking. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/10
