This film was absolute torture. First of all, it has long been a whopping 4+ hours! However, Kargil war, may have been a few things that were captured and fought over, but each of these battles do not need specified. So maybe it's a documentary, not a commercial film, as advertised. Of course, it does not seem to like it, since it is sufficient background information was not provided, and there were some drawbacks. Combat sequences were so poorly executed. I was terribly disappointed by the person who gave well-made sequence in the edging. Every fight was the same as the previous ones. It was so predictable. (This may be a spoiler.) The whole army marching in the mountain, five or so soldiers curse-five thousand times each (they also use the same swear words each), one of the leading actors are shot, who cries on a stretcher, the actor says, "no, do not get the stretcher. It takes 6 people from the battalion, "and then the actor dies. It's exactly the same thing happens again and again and again. Oh, and the songs are so bad for so long. The cast of the film is too big for its own good. Despite such a long movie, it was not well developed, none of the characters. Actresses were the most insignificant role. All of them are dressed and portrayed the same. Two of them were crying synchronized. It was so funny. They moved their heads and hands at the same time, and then bit them dupatta together. <br /> <br /> The list just goes on and on. I know that I still forget something. In any case, I think I beat the movie enough that you get the picture.
