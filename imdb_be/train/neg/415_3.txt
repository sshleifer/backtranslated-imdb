Leave it to Paul, "sex on the brain," Verhoeven to come aimlessly sloppy and juvenile version of invisibility MAN stories. If he takes the Pokemon movie, I'm sure he would turn it into some kind of mass revelry varieties. I am not against sex, or even morally wrong (check out my other reviews) on the film, but honestly, it's obvious that the director has a one track view, and he could not see the interesting aspects of the unseen man of the storyline than curly consequences of this happening to to them, it's a shame, because it would be good if the film did not spend so much time with Kevin Bacon invisible grope a woman. <br /> <br /> In the game the actors cast does what he can with one remark cheese script, but I felt bad for some of them, including Devane, which is completely wasted here. <br /> <br /> But then, what could I expect from the director of actresses, who, incidentally, is much more interesting than it is unnatural and bad film.
