Just think, worth a total of $ 250,000 to make "Clerks." How the hell did they spend $ 45 million to make the famous music video? Virtually unknown cast, two or three sets, no special effects that I could see ... I know it should not be spent for this purpose competently, economically, tension filled the screenplay. Shoot, that the bar is set to cost the scroll. Anyway, I think Jerry Bruckheimer would not be caught dead nothing to produce less. I'm just surprised that he did not compromise anything. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's not a terrible film, which I believe. The female lead, seemed to have good chemistry and sound was in order. IMO It just seems a pity that it's pretty mediocre project could be done for $ 5 million, without any loss in production, and more than $ 6, $ 5 million indie films merits could be made as well.
