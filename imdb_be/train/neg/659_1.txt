This film is a good example of the extreme shortage of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people paid to do this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talents in show business. The idea that the audience paid to see this film (and, like an idiot, I made a film) are confused too. <br /> <br /> get the teacher (3 years before) kills family of a teenager, because he wants her. For no reason he kills his mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see a bad action and direction. A few years later, a teacher obsessed with breaking out of prison. SMM - usually poorly written form - no one in the city, he terrorized did not know until the last minute. Obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a Navy SEAL and can sneak around, sniffing and man with a knife super killer. Of course !!! Now get the teacher kills maid hotel for no reason, knives corridor for fun, and began to hunt for teen friends. Now is the perfect way to get a girl to like you. Obsessed teacher sneaks out of the hotel again --- it is nonsense, when a police officer would know his face - but he goes straight to them. Now he's killing of two police officers outside the house and a teenager somehow sneaks into her bedroom and killing her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> There is not one positive thing about this part of waste. If any other profession extinguish the work of such poor quality, they will be dismissed. However, these idiots are doing hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this garbage.
