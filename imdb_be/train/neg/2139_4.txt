I really wanted to like it, but in the end it is badly made movie too little laughter. <br /> <br /> The politician spot on, it's going to hurt the hell out of the Republicans, but that is what he intended to do, that in itself gives me a reason to laugh. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it looks like it was done in a real hurry (as in about a week). And it contains a silly story about a singer Bimbo, which seems to be completely off-topic. <br /> <br /> Turiqistan, obviously, Iraq or Afghanistan, or any other number of US states F ** ked with so 50s. Humor a little dark (dance amputees with prostheses made by a corporation Tamerlane), but it is a sign, especially corporations profit from the reconstruction ( "democracy lite»!) <br /> <br /> However, how much satire, criticizing the US it seems to be very hard and worked. I believe it works so much Bs counter propaganda, so that is hitting people over the head to make a point. Who knows. I prefer the Move, winking approach - a little finesse. But that's just me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could see him again, maybe I missed something. <br /> <br /> I hope that «W» more on the mark.
