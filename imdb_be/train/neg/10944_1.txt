Now, I've seen a lot of bad movies. I love bad films. Especially bad action movie. I saw (and enjoy) all the films of Jean-Claude Van Damme, including one where he is his own clone, both of those where he plays twins, and all three, where he cyborg. I actually belong to the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians. (Hey, if nothing else, he got a big ass, and you can almost always see it. With DVD, you can even pause and enlarge!) That's why you can trust me when I say that this film is so bad, does Plan 9 looks Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> All of Snake Eater bad. The plot is bad. The script is bad. Sets bad. Fights bad. Bad tricks. FX bad. Acting effectively, earth-time bendingly bad, very probably, showing the worst performance of every so-called actor in the cast, including Lorenz Lamas, and that's really saying something. And I bet everyone involved in this film is lousy in bed to boot. ESPECIALLY Lamas. <br /> <br /> It is possible to be unintentionally funny, so it's not a total loss. However, I recommend you see this movie only if you or a congenital idiot, or very, very impressed. I was able to sit through it myself, because I need to see something to distract me from rinsing the cat urine out of my clothes. <br /> <br /> It did not help, but it was better than nothing. One point for Ron occasional smoking as gay arsonist.
