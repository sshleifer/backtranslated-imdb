This is a normal film, but has no real depth or emotionally or in terms of storytelling. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real events, and this limits the number of operations, there is little, as there is no real suspense. <br /> <br /> Washington is believable in the lead, but he went to sleep through it, there is no way to bend any acting muscles for him or support roll. <br /> <br /> story just falls a little flat, even they had never heard the name of the character ending was obvious, but unlike other films about such injustices is one does not have any emotional impact, you do not really care for it and motivate those on the outside portions seem to be more academic than concerned about his well-being. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to bring some emotion, using the boy is a hero worships Carter, but it seems to be made. <br /> <br /> it is a normal film, but instantly forgettable,
