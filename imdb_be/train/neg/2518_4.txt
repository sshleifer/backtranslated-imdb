Think a darker version of one of the little show, such as the «Power Rangers», and you have this film in 1990, «Robot Jox». The film, where you will fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and the one who goes out of his victories countries. Robots are huge and look a little better than the version of the said show, mainly because they are less colorful because while the film is not good, it's not too bad to look at. There are, as I recall, two robots fight in this one, the one that ends badly and the final showdown. There is a conspiracy of the spiral of the way through, as a traitor revealed, but in the end the story there is nothing that will stick with you for any length of time after the picture is taken. The fights themselves like giant toys for trouble, but still more fun to watch. This film will also appear several other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and tournament. So it is worth checking out once, but probably no more.
