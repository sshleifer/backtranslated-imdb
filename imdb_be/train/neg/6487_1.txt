Well, so many thanks to Disney for destroying the fond memories that I used to have my former favorite film. I was about 5, when the original movie came out, and it was one of the first movies I remember seeing. Thus, now, when I'm 16, and feels quite masochistic, I decided to make this film. Thus, I was able to poison my memories of the original film with this excuse the basis for the film. This film takes everything that made the original an endearing and wrecks it, down to the smallest detail. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of his daughter, music, and go to show it all in the ocean ... BROADWAY STYLE! After completion of the musical numbers, for a few minutes, the sea witch Morgana is and threatens to kill the Melody, when Triton does not give up a trident. Thus, he gives it even without a fight. Eric stands there gaping, but Ariel is figuring out how to use the sword and save the melody. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric have decided that the melody should never go near the sea, while the sun caught Morgana. <br /> <br /> Well ... well, nothing to note is not really happening. Eric is a total wimp. He never fails to do anything. Ariel like doing something. Melody manages to screw things up. In addition, the animation new low point for Disney. Computer generated wind colliding with the background. Someday the only opportunity for character development to waste. Songs bite. <br /> <br /> Look, do not waste your time. I am sure that even small children will be sad out of their skulls with this, as there is nothing even remotely exciting ever happens. They do not want to sing the song. If you can grab a copy of it, throw it into the ocean and hope that no one will ever find. Ever.
