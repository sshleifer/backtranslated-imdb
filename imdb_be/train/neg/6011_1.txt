I was not expecting much from this movie, but a brother of that bitch. <br /> <br /> I found this gem in a giant box of terrible $ 5 DVD, in Walmart (somewhere else)? As cheap as this disc was, I feel ripped off. The special effects were high school to watch them work overshadowed by the fragile camera tripod and lighting schematic and action was a perfect example of a "Christian school". One can imagine the long and grueling "prayer meetings" from the production company after seeing the rushes back - the people who financed this thing must have been seriously antibiblical feelings for inept production company, crank this thing. Think about your grief as they saw their $ 914.86 investment in smoke <br /> <br /> Someone asked why Christian movies so bad. - possibly, Xian filmmakers should look for good movies and try to copy some of the things that make them so good. Believable stories and characters, less hysterical hand crumbled and fanaticism, oh, and a story that appeals to -everyone-, rather than a true believer. ie Nagorno-Stop, keep it for the church. Take Omen or prophesy series, for example. Excellent movies with weighty storylines, great cinematography and intense music. A lot of hysterical hand crumbled. A lot of ads. HN <br /> <br /> If this film was a laugh track, it would be much better.
