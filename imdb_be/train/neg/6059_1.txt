I must say, as a human lover who created Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing -., Probably his best films <br /> <br /> Then you get this POS. I can not think logically, he put any effort at all in this, as he did with Cigarette Burns. At least, his son made a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> You have to look at it from the point of view that it does not seem like a movie. It looked as if someone had sent him on one thing. I do not believe Carpenter put any effort into it at all. <br /> <br /> I just listened to his old school H2 / H3 / soundtrack fog and it was awesome, especially for the time. <, Br /> <br /> it uses a style that no one had, and it worked so well for his films.
