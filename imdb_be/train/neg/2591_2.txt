To begin, I would like to say that I am a fan of American Pie series. Even if "Naked Mile" and this is the worst case two, this one seems to be the collapse of the entire series. <br /> <br /> First of all, the best part of the film is that it was the American Pie film, which is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> However, there are tons of bad things to say about this film. First of all, the story has a very stale "arc" structure. Firstly, the introduction of characters, guarantee of beta home, and finally, the Greek Olympics. Each of which has exactly 25 minutes length. Besides the total staleness of the plot, there is virtually no character development, making a double bad bad plot eye. <br /> <br /> Also, I deeply disliked stereotypes in this film. That is, showing Jocks like a very cool, just think-about-sex guys, and obviously reflecting a freak as slaves. In addition, it shows women only as sexual objects and men as only willing to treat women as sex objects. <br /> <br /> Besides acting as poor. With the possible exception of Steve Tully. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, in general, a terrible movie, when viewed with a critical eye. When viewed from the teenage point of view, I think it's better, but this film is designed 18+ in most countries, so it should not really be seen by minors.
