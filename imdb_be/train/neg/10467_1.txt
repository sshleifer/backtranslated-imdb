If ever there was a challenge to make a bad movie that reflects how stupid humanity could be, it could take the prize. The plot centers around a Bible prophecy that lie hidden in the writings of messages that encourage a group of power seekers thugs to try to complete control of the world. Just how stupid Does this writer believes that people actually have? <br /> <br /> The acting was bad at best. Wang Ding wasted his talent makes this film. Work of Michael York was a fair match for the role, as it was the center of the film, and did a good job. <br /> <br /> This site was disgusting and very disturbing. None competition or immature minds should not see this movie. It is as well against the main plot evil may lose Path. <br /> <br /> There must be a lot of mental diseases are floating around cinematic circles, who are looking for ways to sell this type of waste. There must be something to censorship, to get a PG-13 rating, but it was still awful.
