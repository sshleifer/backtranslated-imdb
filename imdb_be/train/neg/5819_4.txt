This is the story about the Jewish dysfunctional family. His parents divorced and his mother is to the east of the house. Father Murray Abromowitz, moves with her children in California, and moves around Beverly Hills, so that his children can receive the best education possible. <br /> <br /> The speeches are really funny when Marisa Tomei, niece Murray comes live with the band. <br /> <br /> The movie deals with the various family adventures complicated drug scene rich neighbors. <br /> <br /> Jessica Walter Kostars as a woman who wants to move Murray with her, since she wants a companion. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno came through. They play brother and sister-Murray, respectively; they are also parents Tomei. In the presence of children, Rainer allows free Recalling Murray that he was paying the bill for all of them together. <br /> <br /> The film ends on a sour note as embarrassed the family moved out of their fantasy drips and take to driving around Beverly Hills in his car.
