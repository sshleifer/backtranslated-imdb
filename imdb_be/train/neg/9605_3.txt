This Italian film from the 70s even in a classroom with Dog Soldiers, raspy or even that awful American Werewolf in Paris, but ... it's fun to watch. I'm talking about viewing the title role, a stunning blonde, rampaged in her birthday suit. We talk about the schedule, full nudity ... it's obvious that she's a real blonde ... Humma Humma Humma !! The history of the horn, the SFX childish and acting (mostly) stinks. Only merit of this film all (and there are many) nudity and sex scenes. HBO tame by the standards, but it's still interesting to see if you find yourself without a date on Saturday night. Well ... Here SPOILER ... There's no werewolf (except for the opening scene of the heroine (??) 's ancestor. She just is that it is a werewolf ... in other words, the clinical Lycanthrope.
