I feel like I was a crook is on, do not fall on him. After reading the glowing reviews (the director was a reviewer of the film with the sky for many years, so it should be a lot of friends in the press ready to give him a favor by writing positive reviews) I expected a solid acting, atmosphere, suspense, strong characterization, intriguing plot development and poetic moments . Unfortunately, "Sixteen years of alcohol" do not deliver on the critic promises, for the most part, are sacrificing the quality instead of cheese low-budget special effects (as it was cliched web scene in there?), Unreal fight choreography and senseless mind staggering narrative clichés editing and perspectives. <br /> <br /> «Sixteen years Alcohol» begins interesting with some beautiful pictures of locations in Scotland, but right under the mountain here. Unfortunately, instead of having to spend some time on the atmosphere of the building, creating characters we can care about, or unexplained building - the director prefers to start driving you crazy self indulgent heavy hand chatter voiceover years. The lead characters are so callous and so much acting - the audience does not care what happens to them, desperate actors do desperate things ... like this movie!. To make things worse, "a tribute to" (typical director is trying to pay their contributions in the past masters) or completely cliché or inconclusive. The soundtrack is the only one that picked me up and held me in a movie, but even that failed to support the dramatic narrative connects the other time period. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the film has received more imperfect and to be completely honest annoying. I still watched the whole damn! <br /> <br /> I think I liked it rough attempt at realism in the film, but even that was destroyed when they are often cut between the strange and abstract, sometimes pointless scene. You do not need a huge budget to make a really moving film, so much has been said about how much money they had to make this film, half a million is not a little bit of money ... So there is no excuse! Sometimes I wonder what the actors ... or their agents thought! <br /> <br /> Give this turkey if you do not masochistic or meaningless anyway .... not mine <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
