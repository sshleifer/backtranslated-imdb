I borrowed this movie from the library thinks it may be fine. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> It's a bad film, I have to write something about it. Mira Sorvino is so bad in the film, is very painful to watch on stage with her. She is a beautiful girl, but in this film, it is not tempting at all, but I'll have to watch her clumsy attempt to seduce almost all the other major characters. It's so funny. <br /> <br /> And the film's dialogue is so pretentious, and the lack of comic fact that make it acceptable. <br /> <br /> In general, a failure.
