I watched Phat Beach, on cable for a while, and I kind of liked it. The fat man best character because he seems to be a good guy. The other characters are just different stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch these low budget movies that capture the period of time because they are almost like a documentary relations and skates in the year. Phat Beach too funny, because low-cost babes in this movie in a strictly home girl. Most low-budget films that have "local beauty" quality, and you can tell the babies in this film were local strippers and models lingerie for JC Penneys. Some are so many cellulite hanging from their bikinis, it was interesting to see how the "youth" stunned over what, in fact some really over-used, high mileage Skank. There were some cuties too. This is the charm of these low-budget bad paintings. You will see a lot of dogs, and some real cutie! I checked a few of them at IMDb, and seven years later, Phat Beach is their only loan. Too bad. It would be interesting if someone was able to do a "Where Are They Now" book at all cuties, which have appeared in the history of cinema, and were then never come back again. What happened ?? There are probably one or two young people in almost every film that seems to have a lot going for them, and a few years later, when you re-watch the movie on TV, you wonder, "what ever happened with X? "anyway, this film mostly hitting, but it does have some fun moments.
