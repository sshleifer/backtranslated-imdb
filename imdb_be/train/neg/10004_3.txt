"It turns out that many critics consider the idea of ​​Woody Allen drama unpleasant." And for good reason: they were unbearably pretentious imitation wood and Bergman. And let's not deceive ourselves: the critics were mainly supported Bergman claims Elena, whining Allen charges to the contrary, notwithstanding. What I do not get it: why Allen generally praised for its originality imitating Bergman, but also Brian DePalma was annoyed to "pluck" in his films, Hitchcock suspense / horror? According to Robin Wood, is an amazing form of cultural snobbery. I would agree with that.
