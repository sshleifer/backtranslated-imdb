I was expecting a very funny movie. Instead, I got a movie with a few funny jokes, and many that just do not work. I did not like the idea of ​​bringing in Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty descendants. This is confusing. It would be funny if they were just someone new, and Moriarty rise. Some of the things that were funny. Bert Kwak was very funny, as always. McCloud horse was ridiculous. McGarrett with Hawaii 5-0 was not even like McGarrett. Booth horse is obviously very good with accents. She Indiana, but played in the English and New Yorker pretty good. Unfortunately, it was not presented in the scenario. I was expecting more than a funny movie. Instead, I got pretty confused film with a bad script. Rather ironically, as Cleese and Booth were together on this. Maybe they were going to go away in 77.
