Given that this film was assembled in less than a year could explain its brevity (81 minutes - including titles, so about 76 minutes of actual movie). But the fact that she can not explain, is the lack of humor that the previous film had. <br /> <br /> The gags quickly and sometimes not even funny. The only real fun items fast draws on the basketball Nike spots, the picture James Woods character von Sydow in the exorcist, and bits and pieces are scattered throughout the film. Very unfunny was off Charlie's Angels, which, like the first scary movie The Matrix and tighten the scene, mostly recreated the scene with little humor injected into it. <br /> <br /> The youth of today may not be able to relate to the falsification of the fun of the classic supernatural films 70s horror, such as caster and perhaps poltergeist 80s, and others. et al. <br /> <br /> Hopes, Scary Movie 3, will take some time to put together, making a parody more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> One thing, though, the film shows more than in the past, one of the most promising young actress Anna Faris (which I will admit that it seemed very hot in the future). Just for her casting and acting ability, I give this film "3" to "10".
