Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered, as soon as she went to Italy, tired of Hollywood glamor treatment. First he suffered flour volcanic island of Stromboli, in an artistic failure, which would have killed the career of an actress less elastic. And now it's EUROPA 51, another tedious exercise in melancholy feelings. <br /> <br /> Also, do not make a lot of history for Alexandra Knox, another thankless role of her long-suffering husband, who tries to comfort her after the suicide death of their young son. At least one has better production performance and a more coherent script than Stromboli. <br /> <br /> Bergman is still attractive here, but the transition to a more proper form as a rich society woman. She would never be able to cope over the sudden loss of his son, despite the attempts of friendly male friend. "Sometimes I think I'm going crazy," she says to her husband. Significant statement in the film, which is completely without humor or graces, but it gives us a sense of where the story is. <br /> <br /> Bergman soon motivated to help the poor in post-war Rome, but being a social worker of the disadvantaged children did not improve her emotional health, and from there the story takes a turn for the worse. <br /> <br /> the overall effect of the film is that it is not interesting enough to the project for a big star like Bergman. The film loses pace halfway through the story of how Bergman is becoming more and more confused, and her husband suspects that she is his two-timing. The story goes downhill from there after she nurses street Walker through her incurable disease. Final plot thread my husband who needs to place it for observation in a psychiatric hospital. <br /> <br /> Ingrid suffers nobly through it all (through compensating the loss of her son), but it does not make sense. Not one of her best flicks, to say <br /> <br /> General Note :. If she wants to neorealism with a mental illness, it would be better to take a leading role in the PIT snake, when she was offered her director Anatole Litvak !! It would do more for his career than EUROPA 51. <br /> <br /> In summary: Another grim indiscretion Rossellini and Bergman.
