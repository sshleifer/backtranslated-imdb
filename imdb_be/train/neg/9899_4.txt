Necessarily funny film version of the literary classic "Moby Dick." Barrymore Captain Ahab, who falls in love with the pastor's daughter, Joan Bennett. His brother Derek is a contender for the tastes of Mrs. Bennett. When Mr. Barrymore loses her leg in an accident whaling, Bennett rejects him. He has to kill the whale and win Bennett ago ... <br /> <br /> There are a few scenes that can be excited by theater audiences in 1930; in particular, the scenes with Barrymore lose a leg. The film is not aged well, however; there are much better movies from time to time, as the 1920s Silents and 1930 radios. Two names of interest, John Barrymore and Joan Bennett is not at its best. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
