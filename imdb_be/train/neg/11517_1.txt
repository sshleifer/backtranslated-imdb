I really wanted to love this movie, because critics were unkind <br /> <br /> it (to put it mildly) ... but it was awful. Actually scary. Bad <br /> <br /> ACTED brainless script, cack handed direction ... Watching this film was <br /> <br /> like watching a car crash- you want to look away, but you continue to look <br /> < br /> because you want to see how he's going to get messy. Well, the car <br /> <br /> crash and no longer alive. On the positive side, cinematography <br /> <br /> was good, I wanted to go on vacation, if only to clear himself from the <br /> <br /> This wicked
