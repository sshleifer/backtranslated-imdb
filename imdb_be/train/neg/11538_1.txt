Truly awful film that left me feeling sullied by looking at forty minutes or so, I could stand. Not the fault of the actors, but the writer / director, producers, financiers, etc., must be very hard to talk. Maybe he thinks it's deep. This is not so. It is a rape and ultra-violence, in contrast, the central place in A Clockwork Orange, do not have anything to say about that or to add to the sum of human understanding. This is not the Straw Dogs, or to which I've seen it in comparison.
