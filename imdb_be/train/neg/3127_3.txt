Archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) stumbles by chance on the old, 40-foot mummy is well preserved underground in the Nevada desert. They are determined to keep it a secret and call in a Jewish interpreter to assist in clarifying the history of this. Mummy, as described at the beginning, the son of a fallen angel and one of the few giants that apparently existed in "those days". In order to save his son from the devastating flood, which was predicted to kill everything he mummifies his son, buried him with a few servants for centuries - is planning to wake him up a few years since. In our modern times, the fallen angels still walk the earth and mummy are raised, and the ritual is expected to take place. Much of the film is slow when dealing with a large number of biblical shit and a pair of nasty, punching the air battle. Mummy decent to look at, but do not specify enough. It had to be more to do with it, but it dragged on so many ... Ah. Do not disturb.
