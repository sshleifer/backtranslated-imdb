What can I say about this movie, but "does not see." I waited and waited and waited (or touch anything) to make it happen, and it just did not come. See amazing how two people walking in setting the record for most screen time filler in the same film. What are they doing? Are they solve the puzzle? They are going to the keys? Maybe it's just hard to say. At the end of the film, after a lot of radio decodes the (unintelligible on any monitor PET), and this guy is giving some lectures, the story finally showed up and tossed aside as soon as possible. Some foreigners want to come back to them utopia native world and so happy there that they want to blow up the ground (I guess they do not like to share the wealth). My guess is they have finished shooting and had seen their 35 minutes of work or art (rubbish!) And decided that they allowed the crew to edit turn it into a 88-minute feature film. Look at your own risk, it is not even funny, because it's so bad, it's just bad.
