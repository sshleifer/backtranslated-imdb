In the autobiographical awkward age tale "Romulus, my father," Eric Bana, with "Munich" fame plays a depleted German immigrant from best to raise his son Raimond (Kodi Smit-McPhee), in rural Australia in 1960. The main obstacle to family stability and happiness of his wife Christina (Franka Potente), which violates their wedding vows shamelessly shacking with other men. Despite her very unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to grant her a divorce, masochistically torturing themselves in the vain hope that it will one day come back to it. This, unfortunately, is kind and gentle Raymond, which should indicate all marital confusion - and this is his memoirs, which serves as the basis for the film (Raimond Gaita later grow to be the author). <br /> <br /> Even though I admire, "Romulus, My Father" because he is trying to do, I can not honestly say that I liked it, because while the film has some excellent performances and serious intention to go for it, they are simply not enough to counteract the harsh storyline and funeral marches that leave the audience how desperate and depressed, as people on the screen. Serious naturalistic drama is one thing, but it's constantly pessimistic wallow in adultery, madness and suicide a few (not to mention suicide attempts) something again.
