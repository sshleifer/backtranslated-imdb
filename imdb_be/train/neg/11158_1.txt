What a terrible, terrible movie. The worst collection of stencils I've seen in a long time. Not that I've seen a lot. I left the theater crying after about 40 minutes of searching for hard drink to calm their nerves. Meryl Streep was awesome as usual. How much pain and attempt to express one person can have? Aidan Quinn talents were - as often happens - it is in vain. And who said Gloria Estefan she could act? An attempt will polically correct this film still imposes racial stereotypes. (Brave inexperienced teacher to teach music alone underprivilegded violin children in a poor school district). The children were not even cute! Simply written to satisfy the monstrous scenario. Aaargh! Wes Craven really startled me at once. the real horror is the one!
