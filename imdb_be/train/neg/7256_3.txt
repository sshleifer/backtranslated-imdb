I bought this movie on Blu-ray, as it promises more visual effects and music. I was also a big fan of this film ... Baraka. The film is very stylized Baraka, wide viewing angles are very similar shooting with camera set to capture the passage of a long time in each frame. Even some of the scenes were identical (street with traffic). While Baraka told a great story, comparing the nature, man-made environment, spirituality, and peace horrors in an exciting fashion and beautiful music, this movie just jumped from shot to shot, with no history comprehensively, mediocre score, and then. ... poof, he finished! I thought that there must be some mistake! The history of the world? Half of the film is Egypt and landscape (looks like Arizona, but I did not check). Seriously folks, this is terrible, rent it out, if necessary, but do not buy it. The filmmakers should be ashamed of it.
