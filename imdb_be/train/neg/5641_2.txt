Predictability, told a thousand times the story with the usual drama between them, a pair of rather untidy sex scenes mixed with some character paranoia, 70-by-style violin music horror that funny then, I could not help but giggle yourself. <, Br /> <br /> I usually like Defoe, and it must be said that acting is not all that bad, "the story" develops common pace and keep you guessing from time to time. It's just that it's all too predictable, I felt that I was looking for the TV drama instead of a new film. Maybe the style directors wanted, but it must be said that the review I read here before I saw the film could have been written only someone involved in its production. <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much, and if I could cheat hours ago I would not have gone to see it in the movies. I would expect bunkers deals in your video store, I'm sure it will not take much time.
