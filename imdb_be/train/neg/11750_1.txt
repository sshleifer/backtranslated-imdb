the guy who wrote, directed and stared in this shocking piece of garbage should really consider changing guardian. Rob Stefaniuk Yes, I mean you! Seriously, who financed this crap? There are so many talented writers out there who has money could be better spent. I think the idea is great, but the acting, writing and directing is just awful! The jokes are not so funny, I understand that they have to take on Mickey. But do it with style, this film screams 1995 Saturday Night Live skits. Why, I say again, why give money to the studio hacks as Rob Stefaniuk - NEVER GIVE comic possibilities write DIRECT AND STAR IN YOUR MOVIE. SPIRIT!
