I went to see the movie "Troy" in the afternoon. Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> Contrary to popular belief, and history in general, the Greek men were not gay. EVER. It has been clearly established right at the beginning of the film and reinforced every five minutes or so after that. So it is safe for American dudes to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Helen of Troy was always immaculate hair and makeup. She looked great in all his short episodic scenes, which, despite numerous, were probably all filmed on the same day, one after the other, with the director saying, "Okay, now look pretty ... well ... well now look scared ... well ... now look depressed ... well ... now look interesting ... well ... now look beautiful again ... well ... "<br /> <br /> Most of the greek and Trojan men were British accents. Those with an American accent could not act. <br /> <br /> trojans looked just like the Greeks, but they to tend to stay on the right side of the screen. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt sun flashing camera. <br /> <br /> Helen of Troy was the largest line, "They're coming for me.Â» <br /> < br /> Trojan music sounded strange as contemporary Bulgarian music. <br /> <br /> thigh Brad Pitt go all the way. <br /> <br /> Achilles was a young male friend with whom he was very close, but this is normal. They were cousins. No matter what the story says. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole could tell the whole story, only with a look. <br /> <br /> Trojan gods, apparently all had Greek names, but their statues ever watched Egyptian or Peter O'Toole in drag. <br /> <br /> Greek men never touch each other, if they did not fight as well as the American men. <br /> <br /> all the thousands of extras in the movie was the same color of skin ... Light Egyptian, Max Factor. <br /> <br /> Troy was only three women. <br /> <br /> had a lot of blond Greek, which is good news for Brad Pitt, who would otherwise really stuck. <br /> <br /> Despite the coastal desert area, the Greeks had an uncanny ability to find an unlimited amount of wood for building fires, funeral pyres, trojans and the like. <, Br /> <br /> British actors look silly with Greek hairstyles. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt alters expression only when the sun shines directly into the eyes. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers fought constantly, but their outfits always look flawless. <br /> <br /> Greek soldiers wore underwear under skirts. <br /> <br /> It seems that Greek temples were always in the ruins, even back when they were new.
