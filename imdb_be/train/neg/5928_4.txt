I just do not get some of the larger rooms of this episode - that Miranda is so great, and there is something so ugly it would make you crazy. Someone made the remark here, that perhaps it is the frequency of light waves or something, but this is not the ugliness. Miranda just a moron. Episode slow, inconsistent and too Talky. I do not quite understand why Spike is an ambassador - why not just leave the damn Federation Medusans be? There's one part I like when Spike tells Spock through the loneliness of the human experience. In general, I love TOS and even his The Lamest I always tune in to the episode, though -. Um, I would not buy it for your copies at $ 3, except.
