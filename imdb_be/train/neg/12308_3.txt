Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd could not save this film from laying emu egg size. Based on the classic TV series Phil Silvers, he bombed because: A) It was updated in 1990, and B) The simple premise of the series was turned into a mistake, weak and silly script <br /> <br /. > The Original Series uses a small cast of talented actors to reflect cute character playing simple but fun pranks. In order to extend this space in the 1990s, the film was asking for trouble, and it shows. No one could pay me enough to sit through this bitch for a second time.
