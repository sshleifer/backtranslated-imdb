It was frustrating to see this DVD after so many years. For me, the main problem is the uneven script. <br /> <br /> While some of them are witty and clubs, quite a bit of him sad, unfunny and lifeless. Many of the gags just sit there, lacking spark and energy. <br /> <br /> With the actors, Mae West and Rachel Welch come good. Roger Herren shines in the role of Rusty (too bad that he did not do more films). But for my money, there's just too much John Huston, and poor Rex Reed almost given the chance. His character seems to be relegated to skim around on the sidelines, wondering what he is doing in this film. <br /> <br /> rank low user should give an idea of ​​how the public opinion of this part. The original Vidal provided a huge potential, which has been largely wasted. Not even the "classic" film clips did a lot. Overall, a pretty sub-par effort, and it is likely to get much better there over time.
