It was much worse than a low budget horror movie I've ever seen. I am open guy and I always love a good horror film. In fact, when I rent movies I specifically look for some good underrated horror movies. They are always good for a laugh, believe me I know, I've seen a lot. But this film was so terrible that we should not laugh. I considered eliminating it in the first five minutes ... I probably should have. There's nothing good about it in the first place, the crew suck3d A $$. Intro was stupid as well as the end. Acting and special effects were terrible. Please, I beg you, do not watch this movie, you will absolutely hate.
