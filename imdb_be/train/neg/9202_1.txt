I've got this film. Nya on their own, I do. I was really sad the next day, and the box has intrigued me. So I put it in an old VCR and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying "why God why?". The storyline is not so bad as a gamer, I could appreciate the bits of this. I think maybe when you're in super-geeky cheese romantic scenes you will enjoy this film. "I always thought of myself as a Vulcan, you know how Dr.Spock ... can not love" There are very few good things to say about this movie, really awful . But if you are in a very bad to make a movie this one is for you !!! The real story is much Do Avey, though;) <br /> <br /> If I had to sum up this film in one word it would be: <br /> <br /> LAME
