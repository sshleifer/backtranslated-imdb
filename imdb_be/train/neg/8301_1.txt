Really bad. Why would someone believes that it is a good film not to mention funny true secret. I like comedies as much as the next person, and I loved "A Christmas Story." The fact that it has the same director and was based on the memoirs of the same author has me completely puzzled why this film is a complete failure on every level. Grodin frustratingly error was assigned the role of father for beginners On the other hand it does not seem to have the same steps -. it just does not flow well Everything seems tired and had the joy of life that permeates the first film is completely absent here -.. you just you want the movie to end. I would not even Ryoko I blow the film for curiosity seekers who enjoy "A Christmas Carol." It's so bad. 1/10.
