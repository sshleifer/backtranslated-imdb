It was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Not only that, it has almost nothing to do with other films American Pie, the story obviously is flat and totally ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The girls are good, though, but to spend time watching cheap soft porn, it may be more than watching this film. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be very poorly made sex ads, made for an audience that is not older than 12 <br /> <br /> I never attended an American college, but I'm serious I doubt that someone who really could really laugh at any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Save your time to do something else.
