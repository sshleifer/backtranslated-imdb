Simply put, it is simplistic and one-dimensional film. Name, Rise to Evil should tell you that it will not try to be something or to do away with Hitler's character. Most likely, the first minutes of the film, where we see a child Hitler looks evil with evil music playing in the background, we have given an idea of ​​Hitler, who represents it as cartoon supervillian, seemingly ripped straight from the Saturday morning TV show. The film really wants to make his case that Hitler was evil, but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was evil? In the end, what makes it so one-dimensional evil character at the same time sad and confusing (one has to ask how inept, phsycotic character in the cold film ever convince people to follow him, or to be called a man of the time of year). This film had an excellent opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the worst attacks in the 20th century, and try to get into his mind. Instead, it basically just says, "Hey! Hitler was evil! Just I thought you might like to know ... "over and over again. The great irony is that the film still was attacked to represent too favorably of the character. Give me a break.
