This is the third Darkman was definitely better than the second, but still much worse than in the original film. What made this one better than D2 was the fact that The Bad Guy was changed and Durant was not brought back. In addition, there was actually some hints on character development, when it came to the family of the bad guy and very Darkman. It made my heart softened and I gave this film as much as 4/10, ie ** / *****.
