This may actually be the worst movie I have ever scene. would be incoherent compliment. Even the end does not make sense, but it was a huge relief that this is finally over. I watched it with a sort of fatalism charm, to see if he can continue to worsen, and he did. By the end of this mess I felt sorry for all of the characters have survived, and I was not feeling too charitable about the actors either.If you want to watch a train wreck, I recommend hanging out at the station. Even waiting on a deserted railway platform has this disorder. Perhaps I did not ventilated enough to fill their prescribed ten lines, so at the risk of redundancy, I'll say it one more time. This film is zero, and it would be less if I had a word an even lower rating. How about minus zero?
