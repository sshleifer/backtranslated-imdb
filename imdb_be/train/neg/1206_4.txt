This thought long lost Flick sometimes comes available on the Internet. So I bought me a copy. Well, of course, a terrible actor and childhood story line, but it does have its moments. I think that people look for this one knows the background to this. This was done by the owners of Grindhouse movies for very low budget. But he certainly did not spoil me for money on props, but makeup. Make-up for this kind of film is well done. Zombie watchable and whole blood. The only problem with this kind of film is the quality pelicule. It's not scary, Luckely sun sizzle to the sound, but sometimes it's too dark. Thus, you should look to see clearly gore. The funny they were trying to sell it, in fact not for the faint of heart. off-screen voice says early in the film, to follow the signs and the person who is with green flashes, that tells you there is blood on the road. Of course, this does not work, made me think of Cannibal Girls, was that annoying ringing when the red stuff began to flow. They had the original idea, Cannibal Girls was made a year earlier. Do not go for the storyline, go to zombies and noticed continuity error. If a girl and a guy making love at first she takes her bra, then they make love, and suddenly her underwear back ... to try to do it, or I get a little off-line, ... eat it, you ugly corpses
