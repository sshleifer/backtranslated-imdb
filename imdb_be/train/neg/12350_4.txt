Hmm ... where to start? As a serious actress Demi Moore got involved in this crap? "First Blood" can be evaluated as a bull *** t, but this type of stupidity simply Rambo with boobs point. Of course, if you are interested in crapstory (Demi Moore just want to prove that a woman can be a part of Navy Seals), which is the most stupid cliché one I can think of that you would say «GI Jane» is a great movie. Just the performance of Viggo Mortensen did this film tolerable, but hell, I can not think of Demi Moore to be Rambo (especially not for the last, futile, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott does not deserve the credit to make this film one that comes up for women with equal rights, it's just mindless propaganda of the American army and make it more attractive, they fell Moore in it. Terrible movie.
