Battlestar Gallactica was so great because he was tight writing, great look, great actors and interesting history ... And yes, there was hot men and women running around and out of uniform. <br /> <br /> Caprica was just lazy. Lazy Letters. storm smoking actors, to give them a "character." Open the sequence that destroys the feeling of being somewhere else (yes, it's Ford Focus, sitting in the background). Lots and lots of teenage angst. LOT spinning naked women (but in the background. What I am sure that will be cut for the series) and symbolic of some people in towels. None of the actors, except Polly Walker took my attention at all. For half an hour, I'm still wondering if it's finished. <br /> <br /> So what is it that is supposed to bring me back? Science fiction? It's awful light on it. Actors? In addition to the penalty of all Polly Walker, there is not much interesting, what is being done here. There are not even any "devil" in the cast, with the exception, perhaps, Esay, but for the younger set it is quite old, as he more than 25 <br /> <br /> I love BSG. I was skeptical when I heard about Caprica, and unfortunately, I think I'm right. I foresee a very short run for it, as a series, when they do not actually sharpen their pencils over at SciFi and get a job making it more than The OC on another planet.
