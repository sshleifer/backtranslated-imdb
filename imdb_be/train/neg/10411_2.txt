This is ridiculous. I saw a bunch of Fassbinder's films, and I found some very creative and interesting, while the other pushes and self-indulgent wall - like this movie. For me, it ranges from large to crap - not much in the middle. I know that he has a lot of fans among the "complex", but I can not help but think that a lot of its appeal purely hype. In my opinion (and I know I'm getting a lot of negative evaluations for this), he made too many movies, too fast and too self-indulgent. His happy or gender bending the film (like this one), are generally very poorly - done carelessly, sometimes quite boring (eg, Kerel and The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant), and sometimes just gross (like the movie). Failed to his announcement of the human gender confusion to be treated better than showing him get slapped around or watch the cows being slaughtered? Show some sensitivity to the subject and make your characters more human and sympathetic - then maybe I would take care of the films. <br /> <br /> I'm honestly at the point after watching this movie, I could not bother with more Fassbinder films - it is bad, it seems from the weighing good.
