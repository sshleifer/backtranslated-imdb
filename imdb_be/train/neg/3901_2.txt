Scenario nice.Though casting absolutely non-watchable.No style. costumes do not look at some of the high society of Highbury. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale, I can only say that Ms. Beckinsale speaks British English is better than Ms. Paltrow, although the action of Ms. Paltrow is the very nature of Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam, is undoubtedly the best Mr Knightley all versions, it is romantic and not very sharp looking and soulless, like Mr. Knightley in the TV. P.S.The the viewer can not see at all, Mr. Elton-Ms. Development of Smith's relationship as it was in motion version, so no one can see where all the fittings Emma Woo Elton-Smith (except the portrait).
