Statistics in this film have been well studied. There is no doubt! Al Gore, of course, is his job very well, and it is not surprising that this film received praise that he received. Al Gore, of course, quite an actor. He sounds concerned. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this film, there are political tidbits and links to his political career is sprinkled throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, a man of integrity, who not only talk the talk, but walks on foot as well. If Carter thought, we need to save energy, he ruled out the thermostat in the White House, and was warmed, wearing a sweater. <br /> <br /> Al Gore tells us that we need to save energy and to affirm that we are creating global warming while he was traveling in his private plane. How much energy is its use of the jet and how much pollution does cause his jet? How much energy is required to heat the pool Gore behind his mansion? It would be nice if we could save energy by using fewer devices and makes it a point to turn off everything that is not in use. But if we did, the power company will respond to the 50% energy reduction, calling it "a 50% loss of income" and recoup their losses by raising rates by 50%. So "just turning it off" is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> This film is a veiled appeal to allow the Big Goivernment take control of everything, in the name of saving the planet Earth, that is.
