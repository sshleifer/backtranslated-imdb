I liked it in 2004. Then he became very silly. This suggests that children are stupid. He insults the children. Cartoon Network used to be great. One of the shows I liked Hamtaro. It could be interesting and creative in its approach to programming for children. Shaw (Home Foster for imaginary friends), how to put 20 spoons of sugar in Sprite. It seems that today the television manufacturers are only interested in making money, and not to engage children view and make money! Recently, my children are set to show old (60) to find something interesting to watch. Maybe the lack of originality, for the television to watch his back and recycles children's programming from the days gone by.
