<br /> <br /> I recently viewed a crime in my movies, and I thought it was terrible, as I said in my subtitle, it was pretentious, corny, small and phenomenal ego. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a fan of the film, and all the things that the movie has to offer. If I want to watch a documentary film festival in Cannes, I'll watch A & E .... and they are likely to be much more objective about it. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it, period. <br /> <br />
