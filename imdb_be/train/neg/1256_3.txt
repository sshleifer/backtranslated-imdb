This film is another attempt of director Tim Burton to make a familiar name to bring his `vision 'on the screen. He did it with 'Batman' 'Sleepy Hollow "and now this. It's not a remake. The only thing that has to do with the original, it has a monkey who can speak (and Charlton Heston makes a cameo). Burton restored the whole story, pouring it for today's mass audience. <br /> <br /> The original Planet of the Apes was a product of his time. During the 1960s, America has struggled to redefine its civilization. It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking the social norms. This was the era of civil rights, where the group has long been considered less demanded to be treated as equals. In this context, Sweat was allegorical, reflecting a philosophical vanity that stands before the audience of the day. Sweat was extremely intelligent film that raised complex issues and elegantly held oppression of American society to control, making the white man to justify his intelligence to the form he considered below. The dialectic between Col. Taylor (Charlton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowell) and Dr. Cumin (Kim Hunter) was thoughtful and intelligent of paradox and thin and clear. <br /> <br /> version of Burton's as much a product of today since Pot was the sixties. It Apes for dummies. This superficial and thin, substituting politically correct platitudes for intellectual dialogue and focus more on form than substance. `Surprise 'ending is completely irrelevant and contributes nothing to the film except for the climax that sets the sequel. While the end of the original Pot elegantly linked together in one powerful scene, Barton finishing just mocks the audience, teasing, 'I know something you do not know, and you will have to continue to wait to find out ,. <br /> <br /> from a technical point of view, as is always the case with the film Burton, the film is excellent. Make-up is fantastic and operator Burton is outstanding (although I still do not like the dark look). However, thirty-three years advances in prosthetic make-up can not compensate for insulting idle scenario. <br /> <br /> The story was reduced to a monster movie. People group together for Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), to fight the terrible Apes, the help and the assistance of a few defectors (in particular, Helena Bonham Carter, Ari). Presentation templates and simplified with a lot of violence, ideal for today's fast-food mentality. <br /> <br /> ambiguous actions. Mark Wahlberg is a great actor, who just in this miscast role. Wahlberg plays perfectly into dark, gloomy characters are tormented, but strong. This part requires an inspiring character, the profile is not in the repertoire Wahlberg. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor, a hero so far under its capacity, that disconnect clown. She is desperately trying to do something with the unconvincing character, but its interpretation is a cross between a college demonstrator peace and love sick teenager. <br /> <br /> Then Tim Roth. It is a virtuoso performance, single-handedly saving the film from complete ruin. Roth diabolically hated as malicious General THADE. It creates one of the most heinous and dastardly bad guys, I remember in a while. In addition, the physical acting is very rich, which makes the human-chimpanzee that such a perfect blend that you can almost believe that this type exists. <br /> <br /> This film is a big disappointment. It's a decent game, by the time you check your brain at the door. I rated it 3/10. From a technical point of view it is much better than it might have 9/10. However, the story is an insult to the original franchise. This is just another attempt to Barton on flattery, using a familiar name to attract crowds to the cashier so many people could see that he was a genius. Of course, it is true, but it would be nice if he used this talent to produce great movies, instead of a simple inclined PAP formulated for mass consumption.
