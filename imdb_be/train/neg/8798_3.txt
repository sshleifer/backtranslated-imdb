I like the film, which has at least a vestige of history. This does not happen in this movie. This is a series of vignettes, which has no clutch. <br /> <br /> There is a person who collects scenes pineapple cans. A woman with a blond wig never takes off her sunglasses. The woman shoots at other people, at the beginning of the film, and we'll never know why. It completely disappears in about 30 minutes. There is another flirtatious woman who is infinitely pure person apartment. There are endless scene shortly food joints where the Mamas & Papas "California DreamingÂ» is a much overrated (I love this song). The dialogue is mainly associated with food (pineapple, salad chef and order drinks ??). I believe that most of the actors gained weight during this movie, because a lot of fast food consumed. <br /> <br /> There's no passion in this film, because there is no history. This is supposedly the novel - is not such a thing. I just wonder why I did not hit the fast-forward. I kept waiting for something significant to happen ?? he does not. Perhaps the only consolation in this film - the scenes are shifted so rapidly that it is to trick you into assuming that was going to be an eye-opener for all nonsense.
