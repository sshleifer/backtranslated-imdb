I mean, really ... or I suddenly lost his sense of humor, and it's just really bad movie. It's silly, funny and just not funny. <br /> <br /> Since I saw the preview, I knew that it would not be a great film, I just do not think it would be so bad. .. <br /> <br /> What happened to the good old days when you could find a reasonable funny line in any movie? When actors should not play a funny role in trying to be funny?. Now we find ourselves with films like this, Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie 4, where I could not find the funny side !! <br /> <br /> Just skip this piece of trash <br /> <br /> PS (I'm sorry for my english)
