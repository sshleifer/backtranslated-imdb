To be honest, my expectations were low bushes. I was expecting a little animated series with a lot of fun (but warm up and exaggerated) in the Bush joke. Apparently, I have lowered their expectations even more. <br /> <br /> The writing was quite harmless. In addition to Cheney, chicken FOOD jokes and some funny-small strokes, it was really boring and unfunny. <br /> <br /> The animation was as complicated as Flash-project of thirteen years old. It's a shame that they have used Macromedia product to do so, because he is capable of so much more. <br /> <br /> I do not like Bush, that a lot, and I like Bush joke as much as the next guy, but this is only half an hour with the President of the rocker somewhat painful nya-funny moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have done so much more of this is my Bush. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, skip «Lil» Bush »and to buy a copy of the short-lived comedy" It's my Bush ". You'll thank me.
