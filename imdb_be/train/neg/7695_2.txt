I was in such high hopes of seeing the adaptation of the classic story, as well as one night. Instead, I was disappointed in the film, which could not hold my attention from the very beginning, even though I tried to watch it twice !! <br /> <br /> It was a bonus that Caradine was in this film, but it does not make a lot of the actors lacked likability. For something a bit like Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras better act comic moments and the overall enjoyability. <br /> <br /> Thus, the son of the dragon has a lot of potential supporters there, but when looking for something to wow about in terms of martial arts and the storyline you do not get it. If you just want the kids to settle down on a Sunday afternoon, then maybe this is for you, along with 3 ninjas.
