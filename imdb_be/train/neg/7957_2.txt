Wow. In Minneapolis, we have a station that shows the «Big Bad Movie» Monday to Friday. nugget Today was a movie with Carrie Fisher, entitled "It Back» of really annoying woman who ends up being killed when gunmen broke into her home. Bea (Beatrice) comes back to haunt her husband. She wants him to seek revenge on his murderers, and means "she came back." And she will not let him rest until he does so. It annoys him endlessly ... and the audience, too! This film is really one of the worst films I have ever seen. Hey, I like bad movies, though (my favorite movie Xanadu). I really nodding his head throughout the film, I wonder who thought it would be a good idea for a movie. Bea just so annoying. The plot is silly; acting badly; story ... well, you get my drift. Anyway, if you want to see a really bad movie - a really bad movie, check this. You will not be disappointed. Heh.
