I'm going to spend so much time on this review, the authors made the scenario. This is easily the worst sequel ever made. <br /> <br /> They killed Navin Johnson. Not only is the performance of Mark Blankfilda in GOD-AWFUL, it was all !! returned to his homeland of physical comedy has been forced, flat and predictable. The script seemed to have been written Mongoloid monkeys using aliases Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbis. As manufacturers have managed to squeeze a lousy cinematic excrement for me. They even managed to make the veteran actor Ray Walston similar to the talent-less clown. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of themselves. <br /> <br /> I want 96 minutes of my life I spent watching this desecration of the memory of the brilliant comedy ago, so I can try and open to all participants of this cinematic atrocities.
