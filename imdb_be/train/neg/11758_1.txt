I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. Its so bad that it's actually very funny to crawl in a dignified manner. <br /> <br /> Gael absolutely awful, I mean, it just can not work, period. He should give up now, acting clearly not his thing .. His co-stars about the same size, I'm sure that my 5 year old cousin can do the job better than anything! Director should be ashamed that put his name on something so absurd .. Somehow I do not think that an Oscar on the cards for this guy. <br /> <br /> I never wrote a commentary on the IMDb, but this movie was so bad I had to do it. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to see this film, no 0/10, when there were 0
