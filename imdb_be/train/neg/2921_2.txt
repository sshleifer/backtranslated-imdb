The story concerns a genealogy researcher (Mel Harris), who hired her Estee Lauder-like cosmetic queen aunt. Her aunt (by marriage we have to assume) is trying to find her long-lost family in Europe. All they have to go on is a photo of a young girl standing on a richly musical box. The researcher goes to Europe and to conduct its search in places like Milan, Budapest, Vienna. The scenery is a real thing and actually filmed on location (as opposed to murder, she wrote, where Jessica has to visit far-flung locale and Lansbury never left Burbank). Anyway, she meets a young man who is also seeking to solve the mystery of their family and they are united to find evidence and threatened the bad guy. Dialogue, in particular, romantic dialogue, it's terrible. I watched it for the scenery, but the script was so bad that I stayed to see if it will get worse. He did. Acting also excluded. I can understand why Mel Harris's career never took off after thirty-with-something, but it is enough (it seems too old for her role, though). But supporting players directly from Playhouse community. I also lost count of how many times they say, "Budapest" with each other. Yes, it is pronounced Bood-and-phesht. We know, okay? I realized halfway into the film, it had to be one of those films, Harlequin and confident enough. Guess that says it all.
