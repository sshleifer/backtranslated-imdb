Unfortunately - this film just a cheap TV production. I've seen a lot of advertisements and wait Professionell film like "Stormriders" - what I was given was a low-budget film like "Zeno" or "Hercules" on television. No atmosphere, very sad, a worst Fight frame. Some good ideas - no more. I hope I get a chance to make a film like this and then I will show how to make a movie !!! <br /> <br /> My ASIAN-advice: «MUSA - Warrior», «Stormriders», «Lethal football», «BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my bad english!
