Summary provided by my cable TV Guide made it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is. "Slaughterhouse Rock», by far, the worst horror movie I've ever seen, the title previously held by «Urban Legends: Final Cut». Since its opening scene, I would say that it will be very bad, but I was so sad that I could not care less. This film contains a ridiculous act, especially the guy who was tormented in his dreams, incredible as to not trust worthy plot twists, and some of the crappiest music I heard, and I live in a time when the likes of Britney Spears and NSync dominate the air waves . The biggest problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock» is that it's not funny. It would seem that the film is gloomy and sad, and therefore is not terrible, as it would be to try to revive a bit of fun with a few jokes here and there, but no. We have a self-centered one tormented Guy is trying to be funny, but it came across as an annoying instead. (Spoiler) And please tell me who in this crazy world of madness and hatred are enough to visit the terrible prison in the middle of the night? Nobody! If you are going to make a horror movie, at least make it believable. This is one anything but.
