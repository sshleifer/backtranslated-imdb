To call the film a chromium ghost to take revenge because of a serious chromium and inanimate would be too ironic, but it is undoubtedly a combination of lackluster Gaslight (1939 and 1944) through the Devil (1954); while watchable by itself, it's so clich√© is riveted to provoke giggles instead of the expected chill. However, due to the horrible, in which the British film industry was in the late 1970s, even a mediocre script like this one has been able to attract a total of 10 star names - Cliff Robertson (as treacherous husband), Jean Simmons (in the title role), Jenny Agutter ( as an artist half-sister Robertson), Simon Ward (as the mysterious driver), Ron Moody (as the ill-fated doctor), Michael Zheyston (as a business partner Robertson), Judy Geeson (as Simmons best friend and wife Jayston c), Flora Robson (as a housekeeper ), David Tomlinson (as notary read Simmons' will), and, most surprisingly, perhaps, the D ZhEK Warner (as tombstone sculptor) - although most of them in fact have nothing to pieces, I'm sorry to say!
