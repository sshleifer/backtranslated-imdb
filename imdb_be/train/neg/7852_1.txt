I'm not a horror movie fan, but the nephews and nieces of my wife there. Thus, I saw the first film. It was disgusting, and tense, but not my taste. Still good though. For the same reasons, at this very moment, I continued being exposed. <br /> <br /> premise itself is beyond absurd. I can buy that natural disasters occur in the desert. I can buy that mutants exist. I can even buy that events can be so strange and surprising that the military may decide to take part. It is unlikely, yes, but I'm willing to suspend their belief. <br /> <br /> However, under no circumstances, I am prepared to believe that a military unit designed Recon this area will not be able to fend off the mutants. As a member of the United States Army, I can assure you that while fresh recruits may not hardened eyes and experience of combat soldiers, any such recruits will be integrated into a capable squad. <br /> <br /> detachment of armed soldiers were not about to be taken out several mutants with knives. It's just the way it works. traffic detachment, vastly superior firepower, and, of course, radio support, would not have provided nothing less than complete victory. I'm not saying that you would not have a loss, but as soon as the area has been verified as a hostile military training will have priority, no one will go away on their own, even to use the bathroom. <br /> <br /> And if it was discovered that the area was so teeming that the opposing team was not able to cope with the danger, they would radio for backup. And believe me, their radios will not be killed, if there is a chance that normal radio will not do, then the team will have a military issue satellite phone. Chances are, if they were not able to check in every hour, the search will be called. <br /> <br /> In order to take this film, you have to admit that our soldiers are incompetent fools, with the incompetent leaders and incompetent commanders. Although it may still be true that the most dangerous thing in the world, Lieutenant with a map and a compass, our military forces are filled with smart, well-trained, competent soldiers. Mutants with knives well below our capacity to deal with. <br /> <br /> With all the respect in the film based on the solid it is impossible to imagine that the film can not deliver. Instead, we must believe that our soldiers, sailors and airmen are unable to cope with even the most mediocre of threats. <br /> <br /> As a combat veteran, I find the film offensive.
