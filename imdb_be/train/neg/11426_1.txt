Heather Graham could not play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it. Who is the manufacturer of the film think they are? Absolute worst, the most unrealistic movie I've seen in as long as I can remember. This film is so bad that I had to sign up on IMDb and make sure that the rating of the "film" falls. <br /> <br /> OMG I'm Heather Graham, I just kissed a drunk chick, so while it is cut down, I really going to walk around the room for a few hours to ask himself furiously, "what have I done?!" .. Jesus heather, get over it and grow ... and I would like to send in the same mood of manufacturers idiots ... and while I'm at it, instead of the film being all about helpless about to enter the history, it might be more appropriate to focus the story on a character who is mentally unstable. .. as your so-called "lesbian" in nature ... in the end, I know the first time I had gay sex, when I left the next morning I jumped into the sky in the middle of the excitement in the streets ... to be honest * snip, grasp ... <br /> <br /> What a joke! and, please note, there is a lot a lot a lot more flaws and terrible aspect of this stupid lame flick, but I'm so tired to even think about it anymore. bottom line, if you're a smart person, you will hate this movie, and if you're not a smart man, you will love it ... it's that simple.
