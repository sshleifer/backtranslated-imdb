I paid one dollar for this DVD and at first I felt ripped off, but then I started thinking about it, and I should be grateful. I found the Holy Grail, this touchstone bad movie. If you think that the discovery of the dramatic footage on empty stadium successfully sizzle with awkward camera address Evel monologue, and then wait until the opening credits do not roll on the example of a driver. The script seems to be stuck together from clippings and ESL textbooks. But ..... I just can not believe how bad the George Hamilton. He seems to have absolutely nothing to do with anything, he says, only the inner monologue, I can find it, "Gosh, I bet they think I'm cute. Very cute! ". This enlightenment! Now I know how bad it can get.
