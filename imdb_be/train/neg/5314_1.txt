Music grinds on my nerves like nails on a chalkboard, acting zombielike so it was a shame to waste throwing without making the second film; casting everything in it, like a zombie to throw --- Sabrina-Teen Witch as the heroes of the film ... so completely awful that if «Stoners» still around it can be considered a cult --- but, oh so amateurishly, scripts, may also have been held around the actors read their lines as they slowly mix through the movie --- trivial, illogical sets modeled after Los Angeles offices, props directly from ToysRUs! There was a movie ever made it so entirely inappropriate ??? The logic flies in the wind in this plodding, pointless, purposeless, and with a "monster", so foolish and inconsistent, he can not catch the tortoise in the glacier --- LOWCUT, leggy --- and Amazon! He kept my attention all the way through; how terrible, constant circuit accident in the fog with the participation of several vehicles, holds one watch to the very end ... but, after an absurd rays firefight in prison on another planet, in pneumaticaly-disadvantage sexual and deranged hunter chases slow extraterrestrial fugitive - - in the world! Do not allow anyone to p ** s on your popcorn, you can really enjoy watching this. It's so bad!
