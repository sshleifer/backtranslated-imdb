Obviously it has done to show well-known 1950s stripper Misty Ayers 'actors' talents. Too bad she can not act. <br /> <br /> sad little story about a sweet innocent Down Sally (Ayers) being under the influence of drugs and forced into white slavery (prostitution). Then she meets a cute Tommy Cole, who instantly falls in love with her. He wants to help him escape, but he can? You do not really care <br /> <br /> There's no real skin here. - Ayers simply strips down slowly to the laundry (twice). The rest is just boring little story chockful bad actions brutal "comedy" (never thought that prostitution is ridiculous, but what do I know?) And awfully post-dubbed dialogue. I admit that was a twist in the end, I did not see coming, but it's not enough to sit through it. Ayers also attempts at action in hysterics! Real bomb. Avoid.
