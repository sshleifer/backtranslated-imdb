The premise of the film is that the son of Thomas Archer was killed and his wife was brutally - and he gets a chance for revenge when (after post-traumatic stress disorder treatment), it is contained in a room with a man tied to a chair and said that it is criminal. He was given a large table of tools with which to offer payment: drill, bats, nails, sledgehammers, torches, whatever you can think of that someone might want to use to physically harm another person <br /> <br /. > We are going to too many scenes of torture, before realizing that the man Archer torture is not the person who committed the crime. The two then set up an uneasy alliance; that put them in this situation and why. <br /> <br /> Well, when all is said and done, we really do not care ...
