Attempting to compare or to provide the "slops" as a "Hitchcockian" is a n-out attempt to mislead supporters Hitchcock spend $ 7 on this film ... Weak weak operating history of a weak script. <br /> <br /> I do not there's no real suspense, no thrills. Waiting for the weakness of this film for a big win or even win any ... You left the thought what the hell, that's all. <br /> <br /> And please, enough with the movement to make "alternative lifestyle» HIP and politically correct !! ... I can not recommend it to anyone ... I have already said how weak the acting? Williams did a better job as Peter Pan and «Mork». But those were far more innocent times ...........
