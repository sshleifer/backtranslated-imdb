I remember to watch a movie in the summer 78 with my parents and being quite there at the time. Of course, I was seven at the time. <br /> <br /> Just before the movie came out Jackson, my wife and I rented this film, since she had never seen it, and I felt nostalgic. <br /> <br /> baksheesh money ended around mid-way through the animation process for this film, and was forced to sharply cut corners on this product. After all, this film was made in the first phase with rotoscoping, animation method for people with a limited budget, it says something. Most of the film animation only in the loosest sense of the word. There are some scenes that are very obvious, the only people who stand in front of screen, with perhaps some animation effects imposed on them <br /> <br /> Because of budget constraints, the film -. Already compression "Brotherhood of the Rings" and part of "The Two Towers" - has been reduced even more what you get kind of like the rock version of movies Notes books <br /> <br /> It's not all bad though, the animation brings warmth to it.. what I found lacking in the Jackson films. Its nice to imagine what it would be like with a decent funding. <br /> <br /> the film is also notable for the fact that the sequel that never came. Several years later, half-half-hour long TV special aired, which was supposed to wrap things up. All I will say, pieces it was a musical.
