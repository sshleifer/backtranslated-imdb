This film contenders Â«Plan 9" as one of the film's blunt ever made. Always be concerned when the same person is: <br /> <br /> 1. Star 2. 3. Producer Director Writer 4. 5. 6. stuntman and editor. Unfortunately, Justin Kreynbrink made all 6 jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father were the Western "stunt." So maybe that was the problem. <br /> <br /> That's just one example of the film: the film the sheriff has to take evidence in another city for protection. Of course, the bad guys know and are waiting for them. But what happens? Good guys chase the ring together and booms, and gets into a tree beside them. When the camera shows us the bad guys they just sat on a log in the chat. What's wrong with this picture! <br /> <br /> I could go on. Perhaps this film was conceived as a comedy. If so, it's good he did not do anything.
