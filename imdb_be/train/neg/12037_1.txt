This series is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. Terrible acts dire consequences, threatening letters, you get my drift. Stories so far removed from the legend of Robin Hood is strange. It looks like they just wanted to use the name of Robin Hood, to attract an audience. It might also have been named the new adventures of Mr. Bland acting. <br /> <br /> Someone remarked before me, that if you have imagination, you want to show. This is a terrible approach to the series. A visual media, as it is to call your imagination, you should not get your imagination in what to do it well. That would be like an episode of The Simpsons where Homer they try to wash the brains of religious propaganda film, and he starts talking about who killed whom, or any other. "If the film is sad, I'm just making their own history." <br /> <br /> In conclusion: Absolute human waste.
