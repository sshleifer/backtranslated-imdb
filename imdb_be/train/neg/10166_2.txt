If he wanted, to be exact, he had to pick a few natives Friske and not a bunch of NY actors who know nothing about the Sucka Free (no Sucker Free). I lived in San Francisco all my life, and the people here do not speak, or act as the actors did. Everything was over-dramatized, and the only cat I've seen from the bay was JT Bigga Figga with his little cameo role as a reference. A lot of shock, that he was the only one in the movie, which is actually dressed as a cat here (that is, his warriors Jersey). I never saw anyone wearing any Giants or 9ers transmission; Instead, he installed them in some cheesy fictional SF or Oakland knitted products, which are not even sold here. HP does not have bowling, black and Asian gangsters do not wear head or bracelets with flowers in Africa or China's Olympic team, and not every Chinese bandits wearing jersey Yao Ming and try to sound black while shooting hoops. In addition, while there is now a significant yuppie community, which included the Mission, all that was shown was some white dude and the self-proclaimed "100% West Coast Boriqua.Â» This is not New York! Puerto Ricans are very few and far between, and Hispanics in the mission is very, very different from what has been shown here, which is, no doubt, from New York. In addition, HP is not only a black area in the city. Accurate image would show drama between HP installs in its own hood, as well as against the Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc. <br /> <br /> This film could have been much better if Lee did some more homework and had a story line to work.
