I just did not get this movie ... Was it a musical? no..but were choreographed song and dance in it ... <br /> <br /> Was not that serious drama .... do not the works was not good enough for that. <br /> <br /> Is Whoopi Goldberg quality seriously Actor..Definently not. <br /> <br /> I can barely stay awake through this disjointed film. Notes reports of apartheid and the "tribute" for the students who died during a student uprosing. But how fun it was very bad, and as the film documentary style that was worse. <br /> <br /> See for yourself, but in fairness I hated him
