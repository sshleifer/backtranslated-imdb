Three Stooges in a feature western musical comedy? Maybe, Â«Rockin 'in the Rockies" was to combine comedy Stooges short with Western music, in the matinee; if so, it was a nice way to break up Saturday afternoon. J. Kirby (as Rusty) is beautiful young character; and Mary Beth Hughes (as a blonde June) and Gladys Blake (as a brunette Betty) are beautiful women. Hoosier Hotshots is harmonious group; their songs are quite melodic; However, this is 1940, not 1950, so the film is not really "rock". There are a few laughs; but the brand of humor puppets more depressed than usual. Talking horse, too, is not enough. <br /> <br /> **** Rockin 'in the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
