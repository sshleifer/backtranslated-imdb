1998 Michael Keaton kiddie comedy of the same name has been roundly condemned for this, uh, low-quality special effects, but compared with what Cam Mad George prepared for the horror comedy they are positively stunning. The killer snowman seems to be made of Styrofoam and his hands look like oversized gloves. Which they probably were. Actor puts it on thick in this travesty of a dozen other (much worse) Film and Paul Keith as the town doctor especially memorable in a small but fun role.
