I really can not understand how anyone could give this disgusting film more than 1 star ... How can you, as such a slow film, where all animal abuse scene is real? I do not even want to imagine the excruciating pain of the innocent and defenseless creatures felt in those terrible moments ... Jesus ... What '' man 'will torment them so for no reason, or just for the money? I say to you that the director or mentally retarded, or he's just a monster, "" heart, "" stone. Or both. He really deserves to be hand cut and burn alive <br /> <br /> It contains various horrible barbaric scenes that can cause shock, especially for sensitive people and children :. This frog is skinned alive, fish sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water, beat a dog, a bird thrown into the water ... <br /> <br /> This film is more terrible; it has to be the worst and most backward movie ever made, along with others, is called «» Cannibal Holocaust «» or something like that. I'll never watch or buy any film directed by this soulless monster. . Nobody should spend their time watching it, especially when there are a lot of really great movies where all animal abuse scenes set <br /> <br /> Fortunately, only a few people liked it - which is natural, since it is the worst movie ever - so it was not successful. I hope that this will make the late director understands that such unjustifiable barbarous acts of extreme violence and violence to the real animals will never be praised, and that he will put all animal abuse scenes in his next film. I truly believe that everyone gets, but what they give! There will be a day when all the backward and violent, "" people, "" will feel the same pain that they've caused the other. <br /> <br /> It is, however, probably my only "" negative "" review. I usually do not comment on the film, if I do not like, but this time I just could not shut up. I had to tell the truth, because cruelty to animals must be stopped!
