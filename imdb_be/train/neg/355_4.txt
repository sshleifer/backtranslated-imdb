Just Cause is one of those movies that are on the ground makes you wonder why it was not so much planned, when he came out - nothing special, but enough to competently and with an excellent supporting performance by Ed Harris. Then you are in the last third, and things are starting to become more and more stupid, unless you got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead, which threatens fillet wife of Sean Connery (typical mannered and unconvincing Capshaw) and baby (very young Scarlett Johansson) in alligators Skinner huts. <br /> <br /> a film, which is probably best seen in the plane, and even then only once.
