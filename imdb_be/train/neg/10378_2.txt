While the premise behind the house, where Evil Dwells can be intriguing, the execution is quite harmless. I'm not even sure where to start, as I have so many problems with this film. I guess I'm just enumerate some of them: <br /> <br /> 1. Duties ?? If you see that Edward Albert, Doug McClure, George and Susan (and her teeth) are the stars of the movie, you know you are in trouble? Not that it matters much to me, but this is unlikely to A-List names. Susan George, may have been in a couple of films like, but I never thought she was the greatest actress I've ever seen. And in this film, her acting uncomfortable. As for the other two, the less said, the better. <br /> <br /> 2. Ghosts ?? Ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of ghosts in the Haunted Mansion ride.at Disney World. And they are just as scary. And why should they be so obvious? Subtlety is not typical house where evil dwells. <br /> <br /> 3. The plot ?? How predictable one film can be? The result of this film is painfully obvious as soon as you meet the three main characters. If you could not see where this film is headed about 15 minutes, you need to see more movies. <br /> <br /> 4. Convenient Priest ?? What are the chances that haunted house you buy only happens across the street from a group of Japanese monks? Not to mention the fact that one of them knows the story of your home and comes knocking on the door and asks if you need help removing the evil spirits. Absurd is the word that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> 5. Anything else ?? It is very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about. I believe that I will give him a point for the opening scene and in terms of the architecture of the house. This is a sure sign of the winners ?? noting architecture highlight any film does not say anything about this movie. <br /> <br /> I will stop. You should be able to get an idea of ​​what I have said. And I have not even mentioned the annoying little girl or Invasion crab or a host of other problems. Keep in mind that this terrible thing.
