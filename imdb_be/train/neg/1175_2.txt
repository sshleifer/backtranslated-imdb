Much has been made in the use of digital technology in the Romer "fill" in the background. Sometimes it works well, the scene where Grace and her maid witnessed from afar performance king is particularly striking. In other cases, it gives the film a strange look amateurish, like a home video. However, the main drawback is that the very artificiality of the staging creates an alienated effect in the viewer. We know that what we are seeing, it is not realistic, because we can get a feel for the characters? Frankly, I do not care about all that happened to the lady or the Duke. <br /> <br /> Other major failing, I unfortunately, this statement Lucy Russell in the title role. She's in almost every scene, and the success or failure of the film is based on its performance. OK, she speaks a foreign language, but it can not express real emotions. Her emoting in the scene where she tells her friend Madame de Mailer (excellent performance by newcomer Helena Dubiel) who sees his head on a pole caused some confusion laughter. Also, watch out for her hand, when she expresses emotions! <br /> <br /> In general, the film is very disappointing, especially given the positive reviews on this site.
