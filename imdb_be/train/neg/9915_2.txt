I just finished "dark room" aka "supervised" and I'm stunned. Stunned, not a movie, and some rave reviews, I was looking, that influenced my view. The story was so devastated by the plot-holes and most of the action so flat categorization as a comedy seems appropriate. Seriously, I found shaking his head and laughing in disbelief as I went through this movie. <br /> <br /> Justin leaves the life at home with pain medication be carried away by her mother to go live with his father, a policeman, despite warnings mom that dad is not good. If a young woman is found murdered, Justin becomes suspicious of the residents living in neighboring apartments. With the help of a pair of friends, he sets the hidden camera to keep an eye on these people. As the truth begins to unravel, Justin reveals an unexpected mystery. <br /> <br /> One positive point is that Felissa Rose Hot! I would generously hit extra star or two here it was cleaned down a bit, but no such luck. It would be a potential saving grace of the movie. Eric Conley played very skillfully Justin, I thought, and I would not be surprised at all to see him more in the future. <br /> <br /> In general premise of the film, but suffers from clichés, perhaps you might have worked it was not for the ridiculously hollow "performances" of key actors, especially Alexandra Eitel (Kayla) and David H. Rigg (Justin father). The horror! (Sorry for the pun). <br /> <br /> I have nothing against low-budget films. In fact, I believe, an independent film is our only hope for a decent film industry in the coming days. I will cut off low-budget movies quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects, lighting, even the music and overall image quality. I do not give benefits, however, the image and the script handles the action of Swiss cheese lover. There are a large number of well-made low-budget films there. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I can not help but suspect that at least some of the reviewers who praised the «Dark Chamber» is somehow associated with its production.
