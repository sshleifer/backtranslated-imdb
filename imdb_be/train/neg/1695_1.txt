Well, when I saw the previews for this movie I thought it looked really scary, and was very excited to see how the group was I was with. Now he lives in America, especially during elections, I see some very deceiving thing, but I must say that the previews were in the top of the list. I do not understand how so many people could be frightened by this film. I just noticed exactly two real jump scenes and just jumped into one. The whole movie was very predictable and perhaps spoiled some of the hopping scene for me. As for the sound effects, so much to be so scared, I thought they were funny at best. Oh, and um Catboy where it came from and why? The worst noise in general, the film was supposed to be a surprisingly sighing. As it scares someone? I can make this sound easy. Do not get me wrong, I have always loved all those really bad horror movies that your just who's laughing all the way to the end, but I do not think it had to be it was just a bad for him.
