I'm not sure if Carpenter is looking to raise questions about abortion, and make a really heavy-handed and obvious fact that a woman should be allowed to have an abortion, if Satan is the father, but he pulls further and further. Ron Perlman clown. The child looks really silly, mostly crab with the child's head mounted on it. You can pretty much see the material on Satan's suit. That mess. This episode is about five minutes of stories and 55 minutes of boredom. Very, very bad. And the ending is ridiculous. After learning his child died, the devil is destroying abortion clinic and kill everyone in this huge bloody, gory, noise? NO! He just puts his head out of the room and angry. Terrible.
