When I first saw the little scene that in some ads, I thought that the show will be interesting to follow. Little robot guy really looks kinda cute. Animation style looks like a kind of symbol of some of the classic show. Before the show on the air, I studied it through several sources. There, I became a little worried. Three children (Tommy and Gus Lola) sound properly, but Robotboy exception. It would be much better if he be depicted a young boy. A good example is a robot Jones, the robot character from "Whatever Happened To Robot Jones?" The show is not bad actually. But the way this is ridiculous Robotboy represented my only criticism. Thus, I did not watch it much.
