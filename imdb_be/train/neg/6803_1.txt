When I came to the IMDb message boards, I'm always hungry when I see "the worst movie ever» post.After watch this movie * * I think I'll be going to create your own post !! <br /> <br /> The opening titles: great, some lame zoom on a gas oven (for example, focus on a fire explosions = = big action movie !!) <br /> <br /> actors: I think that Ice T cool rapper, even a good actor (sometimes, I insist, "sometimes"), but Steven Seagal as he plays a cop is ... beyond words. The rest of the cast ... well, I do not know where these actors have been hired, but oh !! I bet that my dog ​​would have been much better than the actor them !! <br /> <br /> The plot: Hijacking.original wrong ?? <br /> <br /> sequence of actions: The first shot of the movie is explosion.I said to myself, well, cool !! at least there will be some nice fireworks .. .I was dead wrong.The rest of the film is mainly filled with low rent stock images taken with the Air Force ... <br /> <br /> funny dialogues, the music pure shit end happy (I mean I was happy in the end, because the film was finished !!!) <br /> <br /> My cousin, who was watching the film was enthusiastic (I'm 22, she was 42 ... good) .I was on the verge of making a film and record it.Maybe next time I'll look ... (who never told ???)
