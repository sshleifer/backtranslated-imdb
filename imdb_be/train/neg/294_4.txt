Shallow Grave begins with either a tribute or rip off the shower scene in the psycho. (I tend to rip off.) After that, it gets worse, and then suddenly gets better, almost to the original point. Bad action and directing amateur get caught up an interesting little story, but the film already surpasses many in Â«Yankee come down south to kill a bunch of rednecks" genre, because in fact shot in the south. <br /> <br /> a group of college girls head to Ft Lauderdale for a summer vacation and waylaid in Georgia puncture after getting off the main road (note the Yankees: stay on track when you go to Florida.).. Sue Ellen (Lisa Stahl) has to pee, so she goes to the forest . When she finally sought s a good place to make your business it shows the local sheriff (Tony-March) to strangle his mistress (Merry Rozelle) to death (Note the Yankees:. not wander in the forest, when the south and not because you might witness murder, but you may encounter with marijuana plantations). This is the point where the story, not the movie, really close to be good. <br /> <br /> while Tony March will never practice it Oscar speech, his sheriff Dean becomes horrible facsimile of a normal guy, torn, what he did and what he dale yen to do. Meanwhile, Deputy Scott Act cute and authentic Southern Deputy, as I have seen, as Goggins (Deputy Steve Naish) in the House of 1000 Corpses. <br /> <br /> A few scenes in the film are worth mentioning. The girls stopped at a barbecue in South Carolina and show their racism when a big black guy checks them. Sue Ellen works in the barn to hide behind some September and surprisingly realistic moment a large snake hiding in the hay with her. <br /> <br /> And in a strange place, Sheriff Dean does, he's going to rape Patty (Carol Cadby) and tells her to take off her clothes. Dean turned off the radio to drown out the noise, he's going to do. radio preacher should go back and read the Bible. His sermon about how Jezebel saved by the blood of Jesus Christ. I feel sorry for the flock of the preacher. Jezebel was in the Old Testament was born a few thousand years before Christ, and in any case it is one of the five people you are going to meet in heaven.
