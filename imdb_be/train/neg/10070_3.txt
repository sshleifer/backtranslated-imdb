Roy Rogers stars as Jesse James and his counterpart, gambler Clint Burns. George "GabbyÂ» Hayes is a former friend of Mr. Rogers, Gabby sheriff. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) is characteristic of the team, the two reporters looking for stories of elusive outlaw hero. <br /> <br /> Of course, mistaken identity / incarnation is a plot development, as Rogers essay "dual role". Rogers magic as usual; but there is nothing really lift its performance is higher than the normal - any potential to deliver a memorable performance Jackie / Hyde is bad stuff. Better couple watching are Ms. Storm and Ms. Payet as reporters St. Louis magazine - they are the highlight of the film. The songs are beautiful, although bad syncs. <br /> <br /> *** Jesse James at Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George Gabby 'Hayes, Gale Storm
