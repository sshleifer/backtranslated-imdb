I got this movie as a gift, I knew from the DVD cover, this film will be entirely bad.After watch it for over a year, I finally watched it. What a pathetic film ??. <br /> <br /> I almost did not watch it a bad film, but it would be unfair for me to write a review without watching the full movie. <br /> <br /> Believe me when I say "this movie sucks," I'm really shocked that some bad filmmaker decrease bee got even financed make this pathetic film, but it could not have cost more than $ 20,000 to produce this film. all that you need a cheap video camera or cell phone camera .About 15 people who do not have the acting, bags, which are a few drunken people were written. <br /> <br /> In the fist part of this ultra poor stroke reporter (Tara Woodley) start to imagine that being a drunk man over on his way to To report a hunted the city. It is very healthy. They went to the house is supposed to give up, but fortunately for him almost complete furniture and a bottle of liquor on the door step is going to be there. Just for an imaginary person to be drunk, but all is not what it seems. <br /> <br /> then assumed a drunken man to start talking Tara ghost / zombie stories. <br /> <br /> his fist stupid lame stories must be the worst in history . <br /> <br /> its history <br /> <br /> Sgt. Ben Draper let one of its soldiers died from total exhaustion (I think that's what happens) once let a poor soldier Private Wilson doing sit ups, he allowed him to dig a grave, and then the collapse of the soldier Ben Draper <br /> <br /> hides it in a shallow grave. <br /> <br /> But Sgt. Ben Draper for n big surprise. his wife / girlfriend threw knows about it, and she and her lover kill Sgt. Ben Draper take revenge on private Wilson. (Next to the grave of a soldier who was killed by it sorts) A soldier awakens from the grave as a zombie and kill their revenge on his behalf. <br /> <br /> twist ending so lame. <br /> <br /> Even if you like the B horror movies, do not watch this movie
