I really enjoyed ZB1. In fact, I did. I have no problems with the extremely low-budget films, and I enjoyed a movie with inferior production values ​​than ZB3 (if you can imagine such a thing. Check «Wiseguys vs. Zombies", if you are interested in). In fact, I prefer a more low budget zombie movies, because I suspected that Hollywood directors do not realize that zombies "on". <br /> <br /> But ZB3 just as bad. It was retarded. I do not want to bother to be worthy of my criticism. I want my 90 minutes ago, etc. Besides the fact that it actually took only about 80 minutes, because the half-way I put it in fast-forward 1.4x. <br /> <br /> So, here are some critics. <br /> <br /> 1. Walking was terrible. All told in monologues. Even if someone just had a single line, camera work and editing, and insertion of a bundle of F-bombs in every sentence with a line FEEL like a monologue. At first I was excited about 90 minutes running time compared to ZB1 in the 70th minute, but in fact there were fewer "events" in ZB3. All it says. <br /> <br /> 2. Effects Gore got sillier. Just glop rubbed around on the bellies of people. <br /> <br /> 3. In spite of the epic exhibition, there really was not a story. And exposure is really epic! I will not spoil it if you are going to watch. (Do not look at it.) But then, it's just a bunch of miserable characters that go around and bickering for ~ 80 minutes. or less, if you want it.
