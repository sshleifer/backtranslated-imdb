My wife and I thought this movie diluted made for television (BBC) version of Manhattan Murder Mystery ... which itself is good, but not great. History has little intra-intensity nature or chemistry, but not much of a plot. Woody Allen's character just kind of wanders ran into his mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson is not much more to do. It's very disappointing, I must say. The role of Ian McShane is only extended cameo appearance. <br /> <br /> The first thing that occurred to me was, "I wonder how many BBC had to pay Woody Allen to knock him out Manhatttan?Â» He must have needed the money, and they had needed his call to expand its audience beyond the youth market refers to two stars. I give this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it unbothersome background noise. If you ever want to have something while you're knitting or sort your stamp collection, it will do the job. I would not pay the rent it again for rent.
