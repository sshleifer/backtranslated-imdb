Even boring, if possible, than the original (I hope I can tell you that in accordance with the guidelines IMDb). FRENCH CONNECTION at least tried to absorb European influences, to complicate the traditional view of American police detective, even if the attempt failed ambivalence Friedkin, Americaness and general indirect. (Relative) art house boom of the 1960s (particularly with the Nouvelle Vague) allowed a huge influence of European cinema in Hollywood. It gave new strength and complexity of the environment tired, and the best of them (such as Bonnie and Clyde, early Scorsese), received new subversive practice. The original CONNECTION was part of this movement, it is difficult to distance style, and anti-detective figure. SECOND old Hollywood right reapproval of American values. <br /> <br /> It is featured in the film is very tedious America against France dialectics. For example, TWO withdrawn 70 French policier. It was the French, of course, who insisted on the greatness of American movies, when they were ignored at home, and it is, in a sense, is the amelioration, prevention of Gallic presumption. This can be seen in the picture of the two films. The compound has a French gangster rushed to New York, with the French style of suffocating American thriller - it leads to the dissolution of the detective figure and indecision of the plot - villain went. <br /> <br /> TWO has a US return to France with American values ​​thriller imposed on native genre - detective force and restored the normal resolution is achieved. This once again filmed in a relationship with Doyle French inspector Barthelmy, whose ascendancy he should shake off before he can drive the plot. <br /> <br /> SECOND seems to follow the original undermining its detective hero. From the outset, Doyle value decreases at every step. Despite the end of the communication, he is considered a hero. But he is an American in a foreign country, and his inability to control the language or customs mean that it can not dominate the story. He even police misreads signs confused informer for the offender, and to force him to kill. <br /> <br /> power comes from its detective force, as a subject, to see and interpret, but Doyle spends most of the movie watching, controlled object, the body (literally in the wings after he threw Charnier) should be considered and interpreted. In this regard, it has provoked action in pursuit of criminals, making the plot; here he is passive, tied to the bed, locked in a cage, addict, addiction. <br /> <br /> This loss of phallic power predictable symbolized in the loss of shooting, and the film is worth a depressing sign Oedipus trajectory. The sequence of heroin, he is comforted by an old lady who said that it is similar to her son. His condition under the influence of drugs, as a return to the womb, robbed an adult pressure. Her taking his watch hard times strengthen this state twice significant for a person whose career depends on the timing and accuracy. <br /> <br /> Oedipus was the first detective story, and to avoid his fate, Doyle must reject the false mother who dissolves his single identity, and kill the father (Charnier), so that he can take it adopted the male role in society . Psychoanalytic theory was popular among scholars in the 70s (ironically initiated by the Frenchman Jacques Lacan), but it's rare to see a movie just so full of it. <br /> <br /> If all these facts tended to minimize Doyle, the style of the film does not. Friedkin has distanced us from his hero, refusing to empathy or character motivation, focusing on the mechanics of the plot. Here, Doyle very ordinary Hollywood hero. Instead of getting lost in a dark long shot, he made knowable and understandable to the audience with traditional instruments - the point of view of the frame, close-ups, connecting images, etc. <br /> <br /> SECOND is all about the fall and rise of Popeye Doyle. plot of land in this case is subservient to the action, which is a common Hackman effectively. Scenes cold turkey, so despite the tediousness, not alarming. We are allowed to share, and not cold to watch; it is much less disappointing experience. Scenes are also permeated with maudlin courageous, that very American. <br /> <br /> Thus, while the United tried to imitate the sophisticated thrillers Melville, The TWO does quite the opposite. Melville LE Samourai bandit signs, which started the whole movie, powerful, regardless of language, and outlined its possible collapse. TWO begins with the character of the crushed, achieved in part through the inability of the language, whose domination begins when it goes beyond language - the final action sequence is largely wordless. <br /> <br /> The film locale and language is important, because they are fixed and undermined the detective, but as he regains his strength (figured in the gun back, burning and clearing of primitive site vulnerability, the tower block where Charnier kept it), the installation of Marseille is becoming increasingly irrelevant, and the mythical stalemate that can take place anywhere, takes over. Compare finals two films: one allows for ambiguity and frustration, another absolute confidence <br /> <br />.
