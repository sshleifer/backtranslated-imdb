Cover (showing a person who holds a terrible pellet gun) would do seem like a martial arts movie. (Hardly.) <br /> <br /> I find it interesting that the real name of the movie is a Trojan warrior. (Trojan condom brand in the United States) This film is loaded with homoeroticism. If you like this stuff, then this movie is not that bad actually. However, consider these questions: <br /> <br /> There are numerous close-ups of the perineum and examples of actors (One scene even shows that each actor convex erection in his pants.) The film also bathed in gaudy colors like lime, peach, and red. From the perspective of the operator, this film is a transvestite! Several scenes represented the characters were very close to each other, sometimes touching, they talk. In addition, a cousin of the hero loves a woman, and every other guy in a film trying to kill him. There is a message here, the filmmakers wanted to convey? <br /> <br /> Should I go into the fight scenes? (Yes, someone grabbed his intimate get-one battle.) Martial arts scenes are brief and mundane. A lot of fancy stuff here, just the standard moves you see in the old Chuck Norris flick. There is a car chase scene, which may be the first ever low-speed chase put on film.
