Well, it's Robin Hood as "cranks" all right ... just as advertised! That does not sound very hopeful, and, unfortunately, it was worse than I suspected, <br /> <br /> A laddish Robin I can take. Robin, which tangles with her daughter daring Dyer I credit; but Robin, who exchanges nya-very-funny banter with his protege difficult one to swallow, and Robin, and * all * the actors, who seem to be having difficulty controlling their line are the kiss of death. As someone who could afford such a difficulty skipping delivery without re-shooting scenes? Again and again, many sounds as if he is struggling with a half-understood Shakespeare, not letting loose with salty quip; I hoped that in the beginning, it was just a bad comedy character trait is clearly intended for the role of comedy sidekick, but then it began to spread throughout the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> What would you say about Errol Flynn in the role, he was able to deliver haughty dialogue naturally, as if he just thought it was a spur of the moment ... and how this production shows that it is not so easy as it sounds! If they were going to throw the characters as the cheeky chappies, actors should issue the appropriate lines were given: they sound as if they have no idea how to deal with them <br /> <br /> I'm afraid. I do not even like pantomime Sheriff, for the same reason; the line clearly not meant to be taken seriously, but delivered (in this case, written) with pushing and winking at the audience. They are absurd things right - the fourth-wall-busting stuff - but it really is not funny <br /> <br /> This is the promised production of reminded me of a school play limp .. only the actor and the character, I felt satisfaction at all had one plays Guy Gisbourne, who was the only one who appeared to have any handle (a) the exact meanness and (b) a precise characterization - but to be honest, I Wouldn Â«t say that was a very good sign for the future of the series! As of this writing, I'll give it another shot in the hope that things can improve and bed down a bit next week, with less stilted scenes establish the necessary and possibly actors more at ease with the dialogue: after all, the opening episode of "doctor Who" was not exactly a show-stopper, but it was nowhere near as bad as it is. But if I do not see any improvement after the 2nd series, I am afraid that the series is almost certainly lost one viewer. <br /> <br /> What would be a pity, because I have a soft spot for "Robin Hood" legend on the screen adventures of Douglas Fairbanks on a sound footing Richard Green. But Robin can not mix their blood in the smallest degree.
