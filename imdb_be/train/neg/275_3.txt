It is absolutely incredible that someone could make a point that this film is not instructive. It is instructive not only depressing, but absurd, stagebound, sharply straight jacket, and painfully excited. Watching this, one feels like an 8-year-old child was punished to write "I will not be a fascist" on the blackboard 100 times. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that it was made at the height of WW2, and was intended to be brave condemnation of Hitler and the terrible suffering it has brought about, (someone heartily applaud), and I'm sure that it really captures the mood of the day. But it is presented in such an immature, overly obvious, anvils path, it does not plaintively, like a work of art. <br /> <br /> The only good performances here with Paul Lucas, who brings sincerity and intensity of his role as quietly heroic antifascist; and Lucile Watson as entertaining unceremoniously rich grandmother, who slowly comes to realize how dangerous the world has become. Although their rootless upbringing has subjected them to all kinds of difficulties, the children to the ridiculous, as shown robotic well-behaved small incisions. They are not even remotely resemble real human beings. And Bette Davis, a great actress, like this one dimensional Noble I cringed every time she was on the screen. Her every word, her every gesture intended to convey how support and understanding she sacrifices her husband should do more, because he is fighting for, it must have been connected to receive a painful electric shock, when she decided to allow any hint of doubt or shading on the surface of its image. <br /> <br /> So, yes, this is a very important film, just not very good.
