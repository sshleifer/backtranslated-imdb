End of the game started well, at least talking about the end the better. it seemed that the things we happen just to keep the story goes, for example, a reporter who at first is very inquisitive, intelligent man, halfway through something really stupid and totally out of character does, we do not give any reason for this other than, the next scene would not have meaningless without it. The whole story can be told in about 30 minutes, that would make the average TV political drama Brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. is very watchable though and James Woods does an excellent job considering. <br /> <br /> At the end of the game it was honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen ...... and says something that I saw Jill.
