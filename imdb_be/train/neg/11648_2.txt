As if there was not enough of those floating around in time already, we have here yet another lame GodFather clone from the director of IL CONSIGLIORI (1973), which I observed at the beginning of this year. The name of the tent values ​​mess this time Savalas who arrives late in production and the first to see the back and campily trends to its colors and wearing berets in the style of French artists! In addition to not looking at a minimum of Sicily, he flaunts no accent of any kind, apart from their familiar drawl. Antonio Sabato, that makes it unlikely gangster - in addition, the resist leading man; his relationship with Savalas, who becomes his father at the flick of the eye, also inconclusive (especially since he later becomes romantically involved with the energetic teen niece of the last)! In addition, for the gangster flick, there is very little action to speak, and none of them is not in any way memorable (although the final set in the clinic is well handled); In addition, the assessment by Francesco De Masi is OK, but nothing. By the way, it is not suitable DVD Filmed begins in the middle of credits, so that none of the actors - or even the name of the movie - not always in the list!
