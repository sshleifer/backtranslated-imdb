I like Fulci films, I do, but not in some boring ironic anything, but I admit that they seem hopelessly clumsy and distorted to a large number of people. <br /> <br /> The conquest where Fulci tries his hand at the genre and actually failed in epic fantasy. Structurally, it is like most movies you've seen Fulci. Some things happen, something else happens, and sometimes one scene can be indirectly related to another. In fact, it's like Conan, no sets, no script, no real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz hardly any actor), Eduard budget, stupid soldiers looking dogs and a lot of gore. <br /> <br /> This one was a tough one to go through and I could live without Vaseline inch smudge on the camera to give him that hair metal music videos to watch.
