Watching this, I mostly saw your ads. DHL, Aquawhite strips, Rockstar, and more. This is one product placement after another. It is obvious how this film got its funding. "Actions" Jessica Simpson is funny. Any Dick should not ever get a job because he is playing the same lame character. "History" is only the background for this very long infomercial. I can not believe that this movie was even considered for the box office. The more you watch this movie the more you puzzled by all the participants. Only a small saving grace of Larry Miller and Rachel Leigh Cook, who gets almost no time on the screen as a cousin Jessica. I was confused, I watched the whole thing. I would recommend avoiding it.
