This film was a great throw going for it: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres - solid B-movie actors of all. But this is a failure of the film did not use any of them to any benefits, with none of his characters even occurring on the screen (although Christopher Lee does get to play against him in several scenes). <br /> <br /> motives for foreigners in this film seems to change on a level place. First, they just want to repair their ship and leave, they are transformed into the hero killing most of his friends and did not hold his wife after he gets them the crucial role that they need. Then, out of nowhere, this "peaceful" race decides that they have to destroy the planet, because it causes too many "diseases" (although they offer the main character and his wife's place in society). <br /> <br /> Most of the film is spent watching a man and his wife drive or walk or stand or sit at the tables, doing nothing. You almost want them to get pulls the rest of the planet in the end, only in revenge for boring us to death. <br /> <br /> Unless you just like Chris Lee seventies or low-budget science fiction, I would give it a miss. It falls in a narrow range between wasted celluloid Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
