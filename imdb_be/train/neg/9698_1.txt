There are a lot of very talented directors / actors in Germany at the moment. None of them are not connected with this "cinema". <br /> <br /> Why in the world from manufacturers actually put money into something like this? You could do 10 good films with a budget of this garbage! It's not fun to have seven adult men running around like dwarfs, pretending to be funny. What's funny though is that the producer of the film (which happens to be the oldest guy of the bunch) plays Youngest dwarf. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with moments that scream at the inscription says "You're supposed to laugh now." Hard to believe that this shit is supposed to be a comedy. <br /> <br /> A lot of people actually got up and walked out of the cinema after 30 minutes of the film. I had to do the same, instead of wasting your time ... <br /> <br /> Pain!
