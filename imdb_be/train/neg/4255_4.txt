the film begins with a beautiful lady in a tattered white dress, passing through the stereotypical Eastern European city. we know that it is something to watch, because it continues to look for her. and soon we will see that it pursues a mysterious man in a black cloak. we understand that this person is actually a vampire hunter, and he followed her. but opinion is that its reflection in a shop window ??? no its just her twin vampire! but, unfortunately, they both get it. <br /> <br /> After this brilliant and surprisingly fun to return to the old Hammer film 60 and 70 years (in the credits listed as twins evil twins, which, of course, the name of the final game in the trilogy karnstein hammer), the plot pretty much dies. <br /> <br /> what little plot there include Dracula (which usually changes its appearance every time he revived, so the manufacturer doesn "t have to hire the same Dracula) comes into the morgue, Mad students realizing that he undead and thinking .... wow that opportunity, maybe I'll just ignore all those movies that say drink vampire blood turns you into a vampire and the vampire blood is used to find a cure for the disease of our other breakthrough. It is obvious that this is a mistake, and everything becomes a vampire. <br /> <br /> The new concept, but pulled excruciatingly bad. The film continues to create outstanding situations and refuses to do anything with them. <br /> <br /> For example, students are trying to bring Mad DRAC back to life by placing it in a bath filled with blood in a secluded country house run down. The house itself is scary enough to be in the center of the film, but we stay there? No, because they have decided to take a vampire abandoned pool. Sigh. This movie has a real problem with "respect", as I said before the opening scene directly with a hammer, and the house scene would be perfect for a hammer, like the film, but the film quickly switches gears and changes in medical horror. <br /> <br /> Another problem lies in the fact that they introduce so many characters, is almost impossible to feel sorry for any of them. There Mad students and their wheelchair professor type "friend" Mad students are all: proud, boring, money hungry and foolish. how they did it all hits me in medical school where medical school should not have to meet his muscle bound Khanka / large breasts quota. and then there is a vampire hunter, who remains enigmatic through the movie. hey, I can respect that, but it would be nice if they did not put it as a movie to be about him. then you have a random priests, policemen and types of science. so many people who entered, and then quickly forgotten about until they need that person to either save time or to jump a cheap fright, it quickly becomes tedious. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a lazy film. no real panic, only a few predictable jump does not frighten. Set for them to develop so it's fun. for examp le bathtub full of blood. This is so obvious that the DRAC is going to jump out of turbid blood. and yet we have to wait too long to get to the inevitable jump in fright. then he kills one of the dumber and large breasts students median. we all know that it is going to become one of the undead. but what others do? buried her in a shallow grave near the house. Sigh, so that you know who will jump on you when the police appear in the house .......... <br /> <br /> Oh well. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone will get the hint that it is impossible to make a scary vampire movies and just go for atmospheric, and then we end up the entire film, which is just as well as the opening scene. <br /> <br />
