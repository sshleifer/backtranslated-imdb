I would give this movie a zero out of ten. Before going to this movie the next day after he left, I went to the IMDb, to check comments. Comment called Film predictable and cheese with terrible dialogue. I never go to other people's opinions, so I wasted seven dollars for this shit movie. He had to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> the man who wrote the script needs to be pushed off cliffs. So when scary movies have a juicy scene? I swear, I'm surprised they did not have GROUP HUG ^ -. * Moments <br /> <br /> I think I jumped. Once. And it's because I passed out, thinking about his research work in English. Template, bird / cat things appear out of nowhere, when you thought something was going to happen. <br /> <br /> And the characters are stupid. My friend and I almost died laughing when the alarm went off, and the main character said: "I have to get my mom's shawl !!!" you. Idiot. Screw shawl! Security is just a few steps away, but no, my mom's shawl (which is not the dress, by the way) is more important WAYYYY my health and safety. And to top it all, they take it back to the house, knowing that the killer knew where she lived. God. <br /> <br /> My friend and I also predicted the entire film. Not only that, I'm sure he's hiding under the bed, moments. It was, "He stole clothes corridor and slipped out of the hotel" and "this is Detective walks down the hall, not a murderer!" Moments. Films should never be this predictable. Disney movies even it is predictable. <br /> <br /> I want to finish my tirade today, saying it was a terrible movie. I am glad that I went to see it in theaters, so I would not buy it for $ 15.00, and then hate. It was just bad. It would be better if only one thing would have happened. If, after being hit detective, the killer would have fallen in the same position that it was shot in. Knife in hand, falling down and stabbing the girl on her way down. Oh, how good it was. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and money. Go a good movie.
