I'm a big fan of the book and Orwell, of course, my favorite writer since animal studies at GCSE. I bought a DVD of pure curiosity, the Burton actor I have a high opinion so when I heard that he was playing the role of O'Brien I swung. <br /> <br /> I watched the trailer on the DVD first and some fear began to set mainly in relation to open terrible "song", hearing Eurythmics mechanically shouting "1984" again and again to EI as bad as it sounds . <br /> <br /> The current on the whole pretty good, and the Burton Hurt scene speak well and tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth to the end can be felt, especially in the number of 101 harrowing scenes. However, this is also where the film is brought. The film spends too much time focusing on the love affair between Winston and Julia, which is open not what Orwell wrote. He wrote about a painful future, about how to create Ingsoc mans beliefs, and then break them all in his name to, to love Big Brother. The film skips that, in fact, the most important part of the book, Winstons is coming to terms with his situation in life and in the world, and its reeducation through O'Brien. <br /> <br /> comment on IMDb currently says that the film sticks to the book is completely wrong. Julia not if Winston attends O'Brien, they do not commit the Brotherhood Goldstien and confess their crimes. There is no explicit mention of the primary when Winston is an article Unpersons, but it does get mentioned in the end, if you have not read the book, it is completely misleading. <br /> <br /> A terrible scenario that some excellent action can not save. Michael Radford, seems completely missed the point of Orwell was trying to do, and electronics soundtrack openly afraid.
