I have read some of the other comments and I have to agree with those who do not get the ending. I thought it was pretty well..until end. He kept his mind works, then an exclamation point. I have no idea what went on the last couple of minutes of the film, with the exception of complete disorder. It's like they ran out of money to come up with a good end, so they improvised. Firstly, they were mysterious thing that people disappear, then they have a guy talking about Area 51 (which makes you think about aliens), then after they went to shit. I thought that the actors and actresses did fine, it's just a scenario has deteriorated. In any case, if you're watching this movie will be ready to be disappointed in the end.
