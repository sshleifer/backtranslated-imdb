There were some scary scenes, which I always liked more than just a gore, but the rest of the film was quite weak. There were too many questions left unanswered, and when they tried to explain something in the movie, it was still quite unclear. After watching this film, I still seemed to be lost in many ways. It's kind of reminded me of Silent Hill a few years ago. This film was also not satisfactory, but it's better than that, because he was really trying to work, and the story really makes sense. This one, not so much. <br /> <br /> for the most part abandoned action was decent, but the film is pulled at a constant and never gave any type satisfying conclusion. As I mentioned above, there have been some terrible scenes, but otherwise, the movie was a mess. Unfortunately, I can not recommend it.
