When I first popped Happy Birthday to me, I checked the timer to see how long the film. I was amazed at the length. Both animated and horror films have a common basis: the attention of the duration of the selected audience, and it should be at or just about 90 minutes. Anything more, and you will lose much of its audience. <br /> <br /> This 110 minutes, or 20 minutes past their prime was a huge challenge for me. I would say half of the film could have cut, but I would be too generous to say that. Go ahead and look at it and tell me how many scenes could be edited, even without being a film major. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the over-the visit, the film was less than mediocre. He spent all his time trying to be a huge mystery, which from the "elite 10" kills the remaining friends. For the most part, they do not only go overboard, but they increase the face and pretty much say "this guy! No! This is a gal! "You'll spend more time with the camera misleading you than actually enjoy the movie. And do not get me started on the action. <br /> <br /> Well, when I started. I had to laugh at the beginning, trying to remember when Melissa Sue Anderson played a character who was blinded to the Little House on the Prairie (later studies proved my suspicions are correct), because all the way through the film, she looked really blind. Surprisingly, as the actress is set, it was the best of the group, but it was worse. The rest of the staff except Anne (Bergman) was damn bad, too, but she, uh, took the cake. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a group of ten members, and one immediately killed off. Hardly anyone thinks that half of "expensive" the disappearance of another, so they continue on their merry way. Slowly, then more quickly, there is the revelation of Virginia (Anderson), the protagonist in the past and her psychologist, who is a little bit more personal (and on call 24/7, apparently) than most therapists. All the while, more and more deaths occur. <br /> <br /> What's so funny, as well as the first "disappearance" of a "best buds" disappear, the less trouble the rest. Of course, they provide a few seconds of air time to say, "Wow, (the people) just do not run away," and so on, but then they went back to their sexy image. And speaking of which, it's probably due to the terrible scenario, or maybe it was I was losing interest in the minute 30, but it was very difficult to keep up with someone who loved someone from the group, as they all seemed , sexual partners, or the next one will be either in the shock of the MAX and other best friends the next scene. SEE: awful guy who was holding the mouse / rat in your pocket ?? literally ?? and was the most obvious suspect. I give the film too much credit (and time), but he became a part of the "Elite 10" I'll never know. <br /> <br /> But, I digress, there is a mystery. Why are these children the purpose? Why Virginia thinks she killed someone when he has never been proven ( 'till the end) that any of them actually killed? And why the trailer and poster claimed the killings to be "Six of the most bizarre murders you will ever see"? Hell, even for 1981, most of them were shown in either of the first two Friday the 13th movies ?? quite by accident, Friday the 13th Part 2 was released 2 weeks prior to the day Happy Birthday to me. Maybe they are talking about when they shot him months before, but it was too late, well, party. <br /> <br /> If the "secrets" are revealed, believe me, you have to rewind 3 -4X actually get ridiculous and incoherent motives, and even put subtitles to get all the words muttering victim / killers. Even if you are the first time, it is incredibly blatant and cheerful finale. It's almost worth the whole movie to watch again, but drinking games. <br /> <br /> This collection birthday should be avoided. This is a terrible and illogical the first version of the script ?? please, please, be aware that it takes a few alterations to the role of the chambers, it contains either a path or under the influence of extreme over current, and it is 100% impossible, how people react in an emergency <br /> <br /> Side. Note: When I was a child, or let's say 10-11 years, I loved horror movies. (Until now, oddly enough. The specific offense fun, but they are becoming more and more difficult to observe, as the years pass.) We got our first VCR and I braid as many horror movies from the network (or edited version of) the TV. All I remember a happy birthday I get the last 10 minutes on the tape, which scared me to death ?? and apparently he gave a big secret as to who was the killer. Even when I saw the other clips of this movie, I think this is the first full-length view I had. Fortunately, this is not a terrible film hurt me as a child. I'm older, and I can take this garbage. . But never <br /> <br /> Side Note 2: This indicates that crazy, "Happy birthday to me" song is playing in the credits (and account for) still creeps me tremendously. I think this film (or the last few minutes) had an impact on my childhood. Shame on you, Melissa Sue Anderson!
