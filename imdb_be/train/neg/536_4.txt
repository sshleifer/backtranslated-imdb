Story of a woman (Anne) before his death, her two daughters (Constance and Nina) and her thoughts about her past. Memories are relatively weekends, where young Anne at the wedding of his friend Lila. At the wedding, she meets Harris, who will work on it for a lifetime. Through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life, she remembers him as her true love. Her daughter Constance older, more "responsible", the mother of two children, and there are some things together. Nina jumps from each other and work on the job and are not sure of her direction in life. <br /> <br /> First of all, good. Detail of the period the film is large. Dress, hair, cars, houses, etc. exactly put you in another time and place. And there are some very quality of the acting in the movie. Vanessa Redgrave pretty good drawing the main character and her fragile mental state, how her life is about to end. Claire Danes beautiful and does a great job as the protagonist, when she was young (and it is an outstanding singer). Hugh Dancy has brought a lot of life to the character of Lila's brother Buddy. <br /> <br /> Who is bad, that, unfortunately, all the rest. Things constantly violate this story, as time unfolded for us. The chemistry between the young Anne and Buddy great. They have fun and dance. Then ... You have to believe that she did not really like him more than once, and that he misses only annoys her. And I thought all the "he may be gay" was out of the blue and does not serve the purpose. <br /> <br /> Then we Harris. Wooden character acts and terrible. If it was a different genre, you would know that Harris was a serial killer from the get go. It's incredible stretch to think that all these girls loved it so much (but they draw the other guys as a pretty lame to try to help him). <br /> <br /> And the grand problem of all. Anne Harris Why not together? They fall on each other. They have this great night of sex in the cabin of the old dirty gardener, came home to learn about the tragic end of Buddy, and then ... <br /> <br /> Nothing. <br /> <br /> they meet up in a few years and get all misty who watched each other, and I could not help but wonder why. WHY? The film does not give you to know why they were forced to marry with other people, and so I had a hard time feeling sorry for them. <br /> <br /> part of the story at the moment is rather sad. Cliche good daughter and clichés bad daughter. Nina changes during the film, but I do not know why. I'm not sure that convinces her to change her life. There is a "touching" scene where the daughter is connected, which coincides with the old Ann dreams she is chasing a butterfly. This is really lame and awkward. <br /> <br /> «There's no mistakes," advises Anne to us. The operator does not ring true with the story. And it does not ring true after watching the movie, and wishing they were not wasted talent such good actors.
