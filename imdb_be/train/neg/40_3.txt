Model named Laura works in South America, where she is kidnapped from his hotel room by a gang and taken into the jungle. They are demanding a huge ransom for her release. Peter hired to get her home safe and there's a bonus in it for him if he can get the money back, as well as girls. Peter was taken to the jungle by helicopter to another Jack. They try to give the kidnappers of counterfeit money in exchange for Laura, but the plan goes horribly wrong and they need to save in a helicopter. The helicopter lifted, and they should also save them from (not to be good so far). Also roaming the jungle devil varieties. In fact, it's just a naked black guy with a fancy big eyes and breathing problems. He begins to kill some of the kidnappers and ENT escapes only to be captured by some primitive. The rest of the movie is a little blur really. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not a big fan of Jess Franco, in fact, today it is only the second film I've seen it, but even I can tell that it's actually not one of his best efforts. Film pull in quite a slow pace without much was going on. All this could be edited down quite easily in 25 minutes of a TV show. There are too many long shots of people walking through the jungle, which could only have been lifted straight. <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter poorly lit (Infact I do not think that it was a light at all), badly dubbed, poorly acted and more slowly for some reason it does not bore me. I think that the main reason for this was a few funny bad scenes in it. For example, the scene where Laura walks down the street, apparently shot in a real street, crowds of people stop to look directly into the camera as it is captured. Another funny scene is one of the gang, who was murdered, hung from a tree dripping blood, as one of his friends, standing right beneath him screaming at what seems to minutes. Then, for no reason at all the people in the head with a tree just falls and get the guy underneath. He must see to believe. Then, of course, there is an actual devil. It's just some kind of a naked black man, who, in spite of the fact that he has a great eye, he has a very blurry vision. <br /> <br /> The film was recruited into the video backward fright in the 80s here in the UK and has been banned. Now, when I have no idea. There is very little gore at all, and it's hardly shocking film. Less poverty, I would say that it can get away with almost PG. The only thing I can think of is that he was never really looked and was added to the initial list because of word of mouth. <br /> <br /> There is not much reason to see this film in fact, if you're not a massive fan Jess Franco. There is a lot of nudity, to keep you from falling asleep, as well as some of the scenes that are so bad, you can have a good laugh at them, but other wise I would say just to pay for the ticket to South America and get lost in the jungle. This is likely to be more interesting. <br /> <br /> 3/10
