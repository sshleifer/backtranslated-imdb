This film has been a long build-up, Sun menopause. People who belong to the sword, in the end, how large should be any one of them minds, or they are not. Too often, this film was soft. I'm not saying that soft films are bad. But no matter how fond you are of sugar it should be no place in the T-bone steak. This film was supposed to be revenge for the crimes committed against the culture, but it ended up that the small bar fight. And only one of them who really knew the sword was; the character of Tim Roth (and yes, he plays it well). Rob Roy was a weak "hero", not knowing how to use a sword, and he "won" was a disgrace. As drama, this film had this period, but the best performance it should go nature of Scotland. Tad is one short breath be referred to as "soap" in my book.
