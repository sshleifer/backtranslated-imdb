Every Christmas Eve, I want my children to suffer another show It's a Wonderful Life. I also really liked Bad Santa. So I have dishwashing. I admit it. I like cheese, sugary movies. I love the wonderful, clever of them, too, but as with many things, the diversity is good. What would the Christmas season without the annual cinematic ka-ching, ka-ching of Santa in all its guises, from Gwen Billy Bob Thornton? Fred Claus will make anyone forget Bedford Falls, but I do not believe that a Christmas film should achieve growth of the fine in order to succeed. "Fred," it is quite normal holiday movie, with enough humor for adults and enough charm for children. My wife and I laughed a lot, even if most of the humor was obvious, and Vince was just Vince. Paul Giamatti was top-notch Santa, which has helped many. Not a great film, and is unlikely to be required to view someone else's annual Christmas traditions. But my wife and daughter, and I enjoyed it for what it was, sentimental holiday with a little touch of spice. There's nothing wrong with that.
