*** The review may contain some SPOILERS *** I'll make this review short and sweet. I bought this film from Best Buy, because it sounded interesting, and were some of the main actors in it, like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. How bad can it be, right? Well, that's too bad. Justin Timberlake plays Pollack, wannabe journalist who stumbles upon a case that could lead to a corrupt cop in Edison police. LL Cool J is the Deed, the police because of the special forces team called F.R.A.T. (Assault tactics First Response). He teamed up with "on-edge" bad cop named Lazerov (Dylan McDermott). In the first scene we see Lazerov & Deed taking on some bank robbers, but at night they are destroying some guys doing drugs. I do not want to give a lot of information, but things turn out badly for the guys doing drugs. Pollack, who works at Ashford (Morgan Freeman) goes to court with the participation of Deeds & Lazerov. He suspects foul play and with the help of Ashford, doing some research, it turns ugly. Wallace (Kevin Spacey), who all F.R.A.T. team joins from Ashford to try to attract the corrupt police officers to justice. <br /> <br /> You can tell from the beginning that Freeman's performance and Spacey are pretty lackluster. The only person who give all of the performance, Dylan McDermott. He is full of crazy in this movie and made a believer out of me. LL Cool J scary in this film. He says that each line up as well as shows in pretty much the same emotions. He was much better in movies such as Deep Blue Sea & Any Given Sunday. The film begins with some good action, but then pulls her legs over the rest of the film. The ending is far from satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this film. I put it on Ebay this weekend.
