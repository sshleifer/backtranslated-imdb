It started bad, got worse, and by the time she attacked the grandmother in the end I just wanted to take a DVD to a person, we have borrowed it and choke the C ** T to death with him. Avoid this film, some good films and some nude shots, it would be almost acceptable when I was 14 and did not see Jenna Jameson naked a million times. If someone feels the need to watch this movie, I would strongly recommend that you spend your time is more appropriate, as an example, I would say, trying to squeeze in a Lego house your ass without lubrication will be a good start. I heard that the film was not the original version, I'd really like to see the original, as it seems that it is a shortened version is devoid of any plot, and perhaps most of the nudity, can someone please tell me, how can I get in connection with the Christian Viel he owes me an hour of my life back!
