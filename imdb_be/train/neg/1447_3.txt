1934 was when Shirley Temple played three major films and really started to make a name for himself. Unfortunately, the studio had to experiment to see what the public liked best here. Two of these things, singing and dancing. The second was a short, interesting movie that kept people's attention and get their minds off the depression. Do you know other keys Shirley successful films. <br /> <br /> This film does not achieve any of the above, despite the presences stars Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard and in spite of a very good director in Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are too many Talky parts in here that are simply boring, and too many arguments between Lombardy and sullen Cooper. To top it off, you do not get the normal feel-good ending, which is what the public wants. I think what they have learned after this film.
