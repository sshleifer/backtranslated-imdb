I actually went to see this film in the cinema, but that is a waste of time and money! Bad actions, I unfortunately did not help enjoying this rather sticky scenario. <br /> <br /> Some friends told me to go and see this film, as James Redfield, author of the book, was very much involved in the scenario. They really enjoyed the book so that the film was supposed to be just perfect. Well, maybe I had a little bit too high expectations, but I absolutely hated this movie! This was predictable, too sweet, to the point that I actually left I had vomiting and worst of all there will be a sequel! There is a world a favor and stop this disgusting campaign.
