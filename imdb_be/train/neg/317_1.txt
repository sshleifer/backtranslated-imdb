This must be the worst film I've ever tried to watch. During the first 15 minutes, there was nothing to keep their interest in this film. I was on vacation at the time, and had plenty of time to devote to just-for-fun-of-it film. Condo we stayed in this film stock - they have to have it out of the store $ 1 or something <br /> <br /> If you like Adam Sandler, it is nothing like any other movie, it did .. This It began with a poor background, and then it got worse. There's nothing even remotely funny. <br /> <br /> I've watched a lot of movies, including some I did not like. But if you decide to spend your time on this film, I do not say I did not warn you.
