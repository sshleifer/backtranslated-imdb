I've seen bad movies in my time, but it does take the bun! Why oh why is this film was made? There's just nothing here at all. Please trust me, flip the switch and destroy a copy of this film. There is a story ... it may take about 5 minutes to show on camera. This is a key issue, the story "based on a true story" (umm ... whatever) just in any way can not be be run in 80 minutes. And so we, therefore, have to sit through more than an hour watching people walk around. That is it! In general, the first half hour absolutely nothing happens, except to watch someone go to the store ... and then 3 guys that go through the forest. This time could possibly have been spent on the development of character ... but no. And so there is absolutely no connection with the people on the screen, and so when they start to get a shot, we could not care less! In fact, I was in the end to guarantee the villain so that the film is over! In addition, the camera work is really terrible! This director / editor / writer / producer, Ti West stupidity. I hate to hit the guy, but in fact, his work pants! These blunt close-ups constantly, and then a long single takes the following people as they go - I'm sure he thinks he is clever, but the results are so boring, I just wanted to stop the movie and cut his veins! As this man was introduced to direct the next film Fever me! To finish, acting as slides, ... which goes to the whole film. Maintain a healthy, clear stick from this pile of excrement common!
