When I saw the commercial for this, I am all about seeing it. Now, excuse me, but it's been so long since I've seen that I can not remember how it went. Suffice it to say that the movie I saw bore no resemblance to the "movies" they sold me. <br /> <br /> I was bored, annoyed and extremely disappointed by this film. And if that was not bad enough, they had to sink even with the awful music of reggae. Not exactly, to set the mood for a horror movie, and Mona? I think if you've never seen a commercial (or trailer, I believe), you might think that this is some hot stuff. For my money, the commercial was a lot better.
