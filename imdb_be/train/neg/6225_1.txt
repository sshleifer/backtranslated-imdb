I doubt that it ever even a cult. I loved Gram Parsons, to be sure, and I did not expect much from this movie, and got even less. What would be a reasonable and displacement was campy. She was deprived of music that made Gram and had more filler than a cheap dog food. There was no background on Gram or colorful people of that era. Characters presented were not familiar to me, even as an amateur Gram and all versions of his "afterlife adventures," I heard. Rock 'n' roll full of fairy tales, good as well, but they need to be taken with a grain of salt. They can be great stories, even though exaggerated. However, this film took a good story and has become a scar. Theft of any dead body, and these effects should never be a dull story, but they made it sad, anyway. I'm tempted to steal every copy of Grand Theft Parsons, head out into the wilderness, and burn them all.
