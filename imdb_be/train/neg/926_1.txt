This film is about the tyrants, a gladiator who brought back from the dead to bring tyranny, gladiator, to be delivered from the dead. Tyranny, we learn about an hour, also called Demonicus. This adds much needed depth scenario and challenges our assumptions about personality psychology and themselves. <br /> <br /> The spirit of Tirana carries his little list (killing some people and that repeats the phrase in Latin), having the guy college body. It uses a magic mind control helmet to do it that college boy willingly puts on his head, and then at several points in the film, removes and puts it back. <br /> <br /> Maria performs oral sex on a poor man Sean Willian Scott and tyranny wear gloves Rollerball. Tyranny has its own backlight green for no reason, and, apparently, was sitting next to the CG fire in the old concrete tunnel for centuries, as it is. The sheer misery. <br /> <br /> This film is empty and will hurt you. Look.
