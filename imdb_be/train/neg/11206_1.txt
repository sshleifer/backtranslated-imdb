No one is a big fan of the Flashman papers Geroge Macdonald Fraser, than I am. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see only now, when Richard Lester directed Royal Flash, because I see that he has already made three / four musketeers with Frazier, who I though was quite good. <br /> <br /> Royal not so flash. <br /> <br /> I was 12 years old when the film was released and could not be more enthusiastic, because I read all the Flashman papers published by that time, and was poisoned with A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (I to so far, but he has never been given the chance after that). <br /> <br /> What a disappointment (I saw him once when I was about 20, on television, and it seemed to be worse). <br /> <br /> None of sharp dialogue in the book is not listed on the screen. Comedy with Flashman character, it seemed to me, covered with roughly the same way one would imagine the high school students group trying to parody it will do. Duel and fencing was terrible and drama. <br /> <br /> Looking back with more mature eyes, the film turned out to exploit the possibilities of concluding a direct satire earlier film version of The Prisoner of Zenda. <br /> <br /> If you read the book or seen the movie, I can only say that the film ends Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg become close friends and play the game invented by Rudi only :. Russian Roulette <br /> <br /> pitiful betrayal of all books about. <br /> <br /> My comment is more direct, if I saw a movie recently, but I'm glad I do not have. <br /> <br /> If you accidentally Frazer never read this, I can only say that I think he is a genius - perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation, but based on my assessment of this set of work, as hard to believe that he wrote the script of this film, as he did all those horrible movies Roger Moore James Bond.
