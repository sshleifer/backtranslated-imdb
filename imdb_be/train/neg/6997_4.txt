I watched it with a growing sense of unease. Why would God, in the form of Ian Hunter, to help these particular people in their attempt to escape from Devil's Isle And what was he doing there in the first place? I mean, I know that God works in mysterious ways, but helping thieves and murderers and prostitutes find redemption, forgiveness and change the legal heart in a place forgotten by God .... In any case, it's unlikely handsome movie. Regardless Gable was the way of charm missing in this portrait carefully selfish person, Crawford both endearing as ever it was, that is, to me, not at all, and the whole look of the film makes it seem as if it was done in '10 before .Compared contemperaneous in films like "Stagecoach" and "Mr. workmen goes to the city," it looks prehistoric.
