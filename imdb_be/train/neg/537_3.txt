I went to the "Evening" for the actors. I went to see "Norman number" for this reason - the film offers a Diane Keaton, Leonardo DiCaprio and, in addition, Meryl Streep - and loved every minute of it. The same goes for «The Notebook», even if it was chicken fluttering light. And my feeling was that some offer performances Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close would be at least as good. Instead, I found, sometimes even the greatest actors can not overcome the banal, simplistic and - on one occasion - really. Offensive material <br /> <br /> At the moment we have not had any problems with the way the film was structured. I really enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell the story ... as long as one era illuminates another poem pressure. But while the character of Vanessa while before his death, and remembering a past event, which she felt was "a mistake" was riveting, from time to time, some in fact shows that it is "past mistakes" was not doing anything to clarify this question. In fact, it makes it seem pointless to stupid "girl meets boy, girl gets boy, girl loses boy" fashion, and the most incredible, clichéd, mistake the way. <br /> <br /> And from here are spoilers, so keep that in mind, you should keep reading. <br /> <br /> First of all, Claire Danes was severely miscast. Moreover, she does not even begin to resemble Vanessa Redgrave, as a young woman, it is far from cutlets, when it comes to action. Do not get me wrong, it can be good in the role of the right - just is not one. And Patrick Wilson was miscast, though it does have acting chops almost drag him. He was better suited to the part played by Hugh Dancy - wealth confused the WASP - not an object of sexual attraction to one and all; it's a little too WASP-in for it. Hugh Dancy? One note - "I try to drunk and wait until you find out why." And "why" (I'm in the closet in case of sexually repressed world, so I have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of all, I know) was so offensive to me, and the order in which he died (as you know, that it will be, because it is the only thing that can happen to the fag in the fifties), so ridiculously, wandering i wrong, I almost threw the candy on the screen. <br /> <br /> As for the modern part between Toni Collette and her sister, her fear of commitment, her jealousy of her sister's "perfect life," her sister, wondering when she had made the right choice, pregnancy, and it is too perfect guy ( which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful when played by Patrick Wilson and Black Moss Bahri might have been more interesting Harris, given his dreamy eyes) - in any case, it was all hashed over in the '70s and' 80 years. And in much greater depth. Do we have to submit it again, and everything as if it was a new and important? <br /> <br /> And to top it off, not even Meryl Streep and will not appear until the last ten minutes of the film, it's the old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions. It is still good, but only because it Meryl, Meryl and can find a way to pull off even the silly dialogue under heavy makeup. <br /> <br /> So, to put it simply, this film has all the clichés in the "really significant message" movie book, and it adds a few that actually had no business to be trotting, again. During the second hour of a long and drawn-out from the «Lifetime Movie-of-the-week" music that is guaranteed to rub you raw materials, it is a complete failure in both "important" and "cinematography" aspects. I give this "3" only because Meryl and Vanessa. <br /> <br /> Now that all that you require from your movies twadd la, please set my comments about the "Supper" on the side and have the time of your life. But if you want a really great experience to serve up great actors and directors who know what to do with a simple story about life and death, and all the stupid things she brings to rent a "number of Norman" and find out what is really a lot of action there.
