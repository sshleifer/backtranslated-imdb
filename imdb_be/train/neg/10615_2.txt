Surprisingly, as less than 2 hours can seem like a lifetime, sitting through a flat, boring stuff. If the story is both personal as it allegedly Sally Potter, not you would expect a little bit of passion to show through in her performance? Her action was entirely separate i I felt no chemistry between Sally and Pablo and tango scene that should have fire, given the nature of the dance, it was instead uncomfortable and painful to watch. It is obvious that the identification of such a personal story can be difficult for the film, and as such Sally Potter would be wise to get a better actor to take on the task, not to let her fear of becoming a victim of his own shyness.
