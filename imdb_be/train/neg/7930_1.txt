That piece of shit could have been recognized 60 years ago, but this is one of the most racist film ever made with the Native American Indians played by white people. Right Republican James Stewart was a huge racist in real life, as well as his close friend John Wayne. In 1971, Stewart was an actor Hal Williams fired a "Jimmy Stewart ShowÂ» (short-lived series that mercifully flopped) only because Williams was black. As if that were not bad enough, this film is very old and sad. See "Dances with Wolves" and for less than a racist view. <br /> <br /> Stewart was in his forties, when this terrible film, and even with his ridiculous wig he was still like a pedophile chasing after a 16-year -Old Debra Paget was made. I am surprised that it was even allowed. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
