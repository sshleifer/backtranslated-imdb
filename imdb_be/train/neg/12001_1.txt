A sincere advice to all: do not watch a movie <br /> <br /> Do not even go near the theater where played this movie !!. even a glimpse of it is bad for health. seriously. NO joke. it is 3.30 in the morning. and I returned from this crappiest movie of this universe. Four hours DAMN !!! I am proud that I survived after all! If it's called survival. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed. annoyed. disappointed. a waste of time! money has gone down the drain! there is no plot. I hope that tomorrow I will wake up in his right mind and memory of the night !! RUBBISH MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Happy Republic Day to one and all :)
