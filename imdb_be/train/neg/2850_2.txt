If I understand, John Wayne was in the movie, I would not have watched it. It is humiliating for the Japanese failed to Hollywood and shame any thinking person. But then, most of John Wayne movies like this. Hollywood still believed in the fifties, that all the world like the Americans, if the truth was (and is) is somewhat different. The film deals with the isolationism of the nineteenth century Japan. Maybe it's Hollywood, which should be isolated.To put it concisely as possible, this film is terrible jingoistic nonsense. (Something like Madame Butterfly with bad music.)
