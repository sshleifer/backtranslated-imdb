This "film" looks more like a music video. Kusturica said in an interview in 2004 that when he makes movies, he feels that he makes music, and when he makes music, he feels like making movies. The best thing about "Promise Me This" music composed by Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Kusturica said in an interview that the dialogue in the film, as the voice for it. "Promise me that" very little "noise". <br /> <br /> I loved "Life is a miracle." It was just like a music video for the first 30 minutes, and at some point later on, but it was a beautiful story. "Promise me this" has no plot. I was waiting for this movie with high expectations, because I read the script was written by am Bozic - one of my favorite writers, who also participated in the "Life is a miracle." Am Bozic writes great dialogue, but they Kusturica "noise", and to my regret, I have seen only two of dialogue, which I could determine, as it is written am Bozic. Another part of the script was used by the director to create his chaotic music video for the music of his son Stribor. <br /> <br /> to Mihic (the person who wrote the script for "Time of the Gypsies" and "Black Cat, White Cat") said in an interview that Kusturica never stands scenario. "Black Cat, White Cat" was the only scenario for which Kusturica said that he would not touch it. According to Mihic, after all Kusturica returned to the script, and if he does not, he does not make a good movie. And I think that's the case with the "Promise me that." He had to follow the script am Bozic. <br /> <br /> Â«Promise me this," billed as "comedy", but very few things that made me laugh. Comedic moments in the same style as the "Black Cat, White Cat", but not so funny. I think the difference comes from the fact that "Black Cat, White Cat" was written before Mihic. <br /> <br /> However, I know that some people who loved "Promise me this," they find it is very positive movies.
