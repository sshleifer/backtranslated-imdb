Today, Bea Arthur died, so I was cruising around on the IMDb website and somehow ended up on the show called "Gloria". «All In The Family» was a brilliant show for the first four or five years, and I bet I watched each episode more than once. Nevertheless, I swear I do not know, a show called "Gloria" existed. Maybe it's a good thing. Maybe it means that I have had a life as a young adult, not watch TV. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is a pity that «All In The Family» franchise has deteriorated so much that he gave birth to show that I've ever had. - and one that is evaluated very bad previous reviewers <br /> <br /> I praised the show for two reasons: 1 - the system does not allow me not to register to vote and writers and TV Execs should be condemned for the show, which had no business while in the air and besmirches the memory of one of the greatest shows in the history of television. <br /> <br /> Shalom, ZWrite
