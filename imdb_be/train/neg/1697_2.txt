I'm a big fan of David Lynch and has everything he did on the DVD to a hotel room and a 2-hour movie Twin Peaks apart. So when I found out about this, I immediately grabbed it and ... and ... what is it? This is a bunch of crudely-drawn black-and-white cartoons that loud and foul mouthed and unfunny. Maybe I do not know what is good, but perhaps it's just a bunch of crap that has been imposed on the public under the name of David Lynch to make a few bucks, too. Let me explain, I do not care about the mat pieces, but had to hold to adjust the sound, because my neighbors might have. In general, it is very disappointing release, and can also have just been left in the luxury field is set as a curiosity. I strongly recommend you do not waste money on it. 2 of 10.
