This is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever, I repeat, ever made. How is it worse, my old hero Dolph in it and he's starring in it. Jesus ... The story is actually pretty good, but the way winked conducted leveled my body hurt. The fight scenes for starters is about as well-supplied as a fight between two drunken putting it into the ditch. Actors, except Dolph, which is kind of sucks too, perform so badly you can not help but wonder if their reason for being there, that they're all friends of the director, who, incidentally, must be missing most, if not all , from time to time. It ยง12 million spent in an unimaginable way, because the appearance of effects and sets, the price can not be higher than a cent ยง1000.
