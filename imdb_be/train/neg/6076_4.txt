The fan Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? You see, the problem with this type of role is that De Niro plays a very similar characters in Taxi Driver, The King of Comedy and CAPE FEAR, and, unfortunately, the characters were more developed and had the best scenario. I found it a little hard to believe that Renard would have started out as a place not obsessive sports fan in being outside and with psycho <br /> <br /> Landmark arc not the only problem with this scenario - it is too lacking in character focus (and the problem I have with the inviolable, where De Niro were great, but in the end a little flat), within a few segments of the movie, I kept thinking that Bobby Rayburn was the main protagonist, the story switches back to Renard. In addition, it seems, I was disappointed a lot of sports fans who seem to think it should be a little more focused on baseball. I'm not sure if it was supposed to appeal to fans of baseball initially, but then again there are elements that hint, perhaps, when the manufacturers invented the opinion is about who and what the story should focus on <br /> <br /> I admit that I entertained the fans (especially the soundtrack), but it is desperately wicked, and the film should be remembered that by the mid-1990s, characters haunted by nutters in the lone white woman illegal ENTRY etc. We ran out of steam long ago
