If you want to see the real "quality" film to get hold of The Eden Formula. This marvelous movie should cost as little as $ 50 to make. It has ultra-thin script pathetic bad sets, lighting and camera work, and stop motion, papier-mache monster that is completely ridiculous (it seems they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and / or puppets gloves monster - but they were all equally horrible). <br /> <br /> The actors all say their lines as if they had never seen them before, and to read a teleprompter. Special effects far beyond lousy. It is only sad that they fell really slick original title Â«Tyranasaurus shipwrecks", which sums up exactly what you get for a full 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard for you to break through to a scoundrel who is under it. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of it.
