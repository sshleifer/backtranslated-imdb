Why would any legitimate actor read the script participated in this piece of crap? My god it's really a shame to even look. I can not imagine the shame of these men must feel for what part of it. Also, apparently, is some debate as to whether there was River Phoenix cameo in the film. He was a caption, but his list of roles here (IMDB) does give him credit. BTW ... wait for it sister to those who have asked before. This film is proof that no matter how big "names" you have. Ears do not sow silk purses. I love Lorraine Bracco, but it was just boring, boring, boring ... Maybe someone can ever explain to me the reason for this kind of film. He does not have to punish, entertainment, or even comic properties in comparison with the rest of it is bad.
