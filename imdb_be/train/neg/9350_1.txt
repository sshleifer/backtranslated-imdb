This movie was terrible. The first half hour is very similar to ... well, pardon for the lack of articulation, but it was just a bad version of A Clockwork Orange. The first scene is almost a photocopy of one of the first in Clockwork! Supposedly, it was a tribute, in accordance with the appearance of A Clockwork poster on the wall of the main character, but the "robbery" is a more appropriate word. The film felt like it was ripped straight from classic Kubrick captured only through the eyes of a new director. Blind director. Unfortunately, when he stops his carvings Kubrick, the film becomes worse. In the words of another commentator, the depth of this film just stuck in his throat. Arrogant, self absorbed and ultimately meaningless drivel. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the protagonists Ramblings touches a nerve, is there any real character development in the film. I did not feel absolutely nothing for this guy. And I'm an alcoholic, so I believe that if someone may be able to feel anything for him, it would be me. Terrible character development, dialogue and plot. <br /> <br /> The worst thing in this movie is the title. For a film titled "16 years" Alcohol, alcoholism is hardly Flick factor. See the first paragraph - it was such a cutting Clockwork Orange, I can not get over it. More appropriate title would be "16 years of violence," or, better yet, "Clockwork bananaÂ». <br /> <br /> Just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie. If you do not take into account my advice and take it anywhere if drink. Trust me.
