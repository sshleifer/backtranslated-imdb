I watched this movie alone, in the dark, and it was a full moon on the street! I did not do it in order, it just happened that way. Thus, all the elements were there for this film to scare the hell out of me !! Well, it is not, in fact, I would like to disable the DVD player only after 8 minutes, but I thought, let's give him a chance, unfortunately, I did. The acting was terrible, the only one with some decent action was Samaire Armstrong. The plot is not original, if you're a fan of horror, it's just the same stuff you've already seen many times. Some of the scenes does not make sense at all, and you just get the feeling that the director wanted to make the film more! The monster was the biggest disappointment of the film. The (terrible) scene look like they belong to a horror movie from the 80's, when there was not enough technology, but some good films were made by then! I was surprised to see the name of a large manufacturing company in the beginning of the film, I thought, that they could not put the money in it and make it worthy? !! I can not disagree with the ratings, the film has received, it is also my rating for this, 3 out of 10.
