Lifetime has done it again. We can say stupid? I could not wait for it to end. The plot was pointless. The acting was terrible! Especially by teenagers. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give the actors work? In previous screenings were attractive, and I was looking for a good thriller.Once in a lifetime come with a good film, it's not one of them. If a person does not have anything else, I would avoid this one at all costs. It was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would rather my face scraped against the brick wall for two hours, then soak it in peroxide. It would be more interesting.
