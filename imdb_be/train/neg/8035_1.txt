This is one of the scariest horror movies that I've seen ... Unfortunately, I have a horror film fan and remove any horror film, if it is not done not for TV When looking at the field, he says, that is rated R for gore and some language ... Where was the blood? Them was a good death scene, where you actually saw the gore? I could overlook the fact that if there was some brief nudity and some good dialogue. There was not even a remotely witty or funny lines in the chrome film. Sometimes horror strange, because they are so stupid, but it was just boring.
