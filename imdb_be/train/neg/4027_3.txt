This should be one of the most overrated in the history of Spanish films. His lack of subtlety and complexity and its full political correction to make it really like a child, only with good / bad characters. The world just do not like, and good films show complex characters with opposite momenta, dilemmas, etc. However, what I hate most about this film is the father of one in Bola. The director is trying to teach us a lesson: tattoos shaved heads are not always the bad guys, in fact, they may be better than average looks father (wow, it's like ... philosophy, or something). Thank you, Achero. I suggest you for the Nobel Prize for Literature.
