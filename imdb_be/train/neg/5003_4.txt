I am ashamed to be writing this review. I say that because of those who are reading this will know that I sat through the whole thing, and it's embarrassing to admit even to strangers. But I just had to warn those who read viewer comments on the IMDb, before they see the film did not see it. It's the least I can do. This is a bad film! Trust me. The plot is stupid. Acting amateurish. And directing, cinematography, sets, costumes, etc. are all second rate. Let it be.
