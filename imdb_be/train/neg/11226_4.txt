I'm kind of torn DARK ANGEL. The film seems to be "loving" a tribute to a great pin-up to ever live - but there is so little actual "content" that the film itself is virtually meaningless. I can not see the motivation or the "point" of this movie - as there is very little biographical information provided in the narrative - so that those who do not know more about Bettie will not know much more after watching DARK ANGEL or ... < br /> <br /> film chronicles mainly over the past few years, Bettie's career in modeling Kabbalah. Almost the entire film consists of "re-enactment" of some of the more "famous" photo shoots and Bettie loops. These re-enactments occupy just 75% of the movies, at run time, and do not give virtually no understanding of Bettie as a person. The film briefly touches her short-term effective legal occupations, and its subsequent decision to leave the "business" and become religious - but it's pretty much tint over the good showing long and delayed re-enactment of the scene ... <br /> <br /> DARK ANGEL entirely terrible movie - there's just no substance to it. Another problem is that the actress who plays Bettie only very similar to it on an arrow - close it will not be not suitable. Another thing that annoys me that while Bettie did some topless modeling shoots - the only nudity in the film was a short segment of a shot at the zoo during the end credits. The film itself is obviously a very low budget, but it does what it can set and costume-wise in this limit - so no complaints I have. Act fairly unmemorable and wood from all participants. In fact - the most memorable thing is the whole movie for me, it was evident at the end credits, the actor who played real name is Irving Clos Dukey Flyswatter. This is no joke - check the cast list. I can not say I recommend this too highly, if you're not a real Bettiefile Completist and should have something related to it. And if you're that bad - then you need to seek medical help in any way ... 4/10
