yes cheap shot, I know, but this film is an excellent example of how a collection of mean '' (depth of political turmoil, love / lust) can be combined to a large irregularly critical acclaim (see also «American Beauty»). Film Kaufmann runs with gratuitous sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialog sequences (in one scene, I counted three different "common European" accent affected by the actors) and manifestation of the state can run amok, while you can not tie them together into a coherent meditation Kundera suggested . and has extremely long three o'clock he manages to almost completely conceal the fourth Franz missing piece in a love triangle, which lies at the heart of the plot, and thus sacrifices the central mechanism of the novel spectrum display of emotion and power relations that are in love affairs. he also did not include even a token screen time for his son Tomas', used in the novel to illustrate some of the political point of Kundera's novel did. combined with the arrogant soundtrack, these shortcomings make this film at three o'clock unbearably weighty sinking more light in content.
