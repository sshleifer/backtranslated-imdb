I rented End Game, they have never heard about it, but I love political thrillers, so I thought I'd give it a shot. After doing some research for the film, I found that it was originally intended for theatrical release, but instead went strait to DVD. After watching, I do not mean, "not surprising." The film is shocking to false. The plot and characters are formal. I realized, in the whodunnit halfway mark, but the end was a curve ball. I must say, I did not expect it to end quite the way it did, but this is not a point in its favor. More predictable ending it would be preferable to one that is so bad. Perhaps the filmmakers saw the film was predictable, and so they decided to throw in a twist. - even the one that made the movie even worse <br /> <br /> Stay away. I want $ 5.98 and has 107 minutes ago.
