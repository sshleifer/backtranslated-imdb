After reading the previous comments, I'm just glad I'm not the only person confused, especially in the last 20 minutes. John Carradine will be shown twice went down to the grave and pulling the lid closed behind him. I anxiously waited for some explanation for this strange behavior ... naturally, I assumed that it had something to do with evil habits in the house, but he was killed by the first growth of the corpse ( 'the Zombie # 1), these scenes are not done absolutely no sense. Please, if anyone out there knows why Carradine continued to go down in their graves - let the rest of us on it !! <br /> <br /> All the action is limited to the last 20 minutes, so I'll try synopsis. John Carradine goes to the cemetery to investigate and strangled by a Zombie # 1. So far, so good. But then we get confused scene where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler, for small moon shots in the cemetery, Carradine found dead in. Strickler tries repeatedly to push Ireland into an open grave, where Zombies # 1 there, but Ireland manages flipping it into the open grave instead, and voila! Strickler comes out as Zombie # 2! Yes, I think we can conclude that Strickler dead all together (witch?), But for some reason he changed from the normal appearance of rotting flesh in the version flying into zombies # 1 in the grave never explained. (Given how painfully slow moving zombies this, I would have thought he would like to remain in the "normal" form, while its business has not been concluded). This scene also brings a question to mind - just one bracket Zombie # 1 ??? We can only assume that the Zombies # 1 is one of the first victims of killings, shown during the opening credits of the film, but who knows which one, and why he has a particular anger at the shooting. <br /> <br /> Anyway, after Ireland believes that this transformation and runs away, we see Tazhe SHOT zombie # 2 Shambling through the trees, as we have seen, for a zombie # 1. (This results in instant confusion as zombies really are). Then, at best, the 1950 horror film fashion Ireland manages to stumble while fleeing. It is conveniently knocking his head on a small tombstone dead cat Faith Domergue (and not that good, John Carradine bit gravestone for the cat, he barely knew?) <br /> <br /> At the same time, Zombie # 1 has been wrecking havoc on the house. It is easy to send a three-member crew, and then begins to climb the ladder. Faith Domergue hear him, and to think that this lover of Ireland John returned from his night shooting goes. Seeing this only Zombie # 1, it produces squeals and goes into the bedroom, where she finds a revolver Ireland. While sturgeon Carol Wells flow at this point and can not hear the cry of her as Charles McAuley (which drunkenness and hamming it up on the mirror in the bedroom) do. Taking its sweet time (and only after a few sips from the hip flask), he finally decides to investigate. (One thing that strikes the viewer in the last quarter of this film is slow to respond to the cries of the stars and shots). Domergue back into the hallway armed and ready, but McAuley errors for Zombie # 1, and shoots him six times! He makes a good acrobatic flip over the railing, then horrified Domergue supports, directly into the hands of zombies # 1. <br /> <br /> Carol Wells is now with her spirit and dry when she heard shots and screams in Domergue; it also does not feel a great urgency in the running to investigate. Therefore, at this time the Zombie # 1 is time to string up against the ropes Domergue neck. Wells to see the hanging corpse Domergue and fainting dead away. The next time we see her in a stream out (???) - but more on that later. Meanwhile, Ireland has recovered his senses and stumbles into the house, where he discovers a zombie # 1 into a bloodbath. Although Ireland just came across 3 people killed, he is more concerned with the fact that his film has been exposed and destroyed! Fortunately for him (and the audience), Zombie # 1 movie equipment sheds on his head on the 2nd floor. Here at last we see Zombie # 1 At this point, the audience was treated to the installation of all deaths, indicating that the new "mirror" of old. How profound. <br /> <br /> Zombie # 2, meanwhile, I got near the house (remember, these zombies move as slow as molasses in January), where he is to see Carole Wells float in the stream and fish its po- for. How is she? Zombie # 1 knew to wear it, throw it in, then increase the top just in time to crush John Ireland? Perhaps one of the first victims drowned in the bath, so as to drown Wells (but why on the street in the stream, and not in the bathroom, never explained). Zombie # 2 never makes it to the house (each dead now, anyway, thanks to Zombie # 1), but instead he is Carol Wells back to the cemetery. As the end credits flash on the screen, we see a zombie # 2 with his dead love back in his hands, going down into the open grave <br /> <br /> The viewer is left wondering :. Yes, but this is not the # 1 zombie grave? Why Zombies # 2 settlement? What if the zombies come # 1 and wants to climb back in - a zombie # 2 will give him, or there will be a fight zombies? Will zombies and divides the grave and again Carole Wells died? What is now dead, John Carradine - where is he going to stay? In the end, from the earlier scenes we know that he is clearly at home in the grave ... If this plot synopsis finale left you confused, do not worry, because you are not alone.
