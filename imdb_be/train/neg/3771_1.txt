This should be one of the worst films of the 1990s. When my friends and I watched this movie (as the target audience it was aimed at), we just sat and watched the first half-hour with our jaws touching the floor, how bad it really was. The rest of the time, everyone else in the theater just started talking to each other, resulting in crying or even have popcorn that they actually paid the money they earned working to see this poor excuse for a movie. It had to look like a good idea on paper, but on the film, it seems, no one in the film does not have a clue what was going on. Shit acts buckwheat suits. I can not get over how uncomfortable it is to watch. Save an hour & a bit of your life .........
