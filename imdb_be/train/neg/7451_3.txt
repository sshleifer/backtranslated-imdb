Unfortunately, not very good. <br /> <br /> It starts off interesting, but loses its way in a few minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> It does not help much that none of the usually great actors (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto, etc.) provides a very good performance. <br /> <br /> It may be required to the fact that I saw a version of the name (German), but the character of Dennis Quaid was especially wooden and annoying, and Danny Glover does not really make for a believable villain. Moreover, the nature of Jared Leto does not really contribute to the story at all (except saving the life of one of the protagonist at one point, but this scene is just as necessary as a windshield wiper on a submarine, in the first place ;-) <br / > <br /> Speaking of unnecessary scenes - main complaint really confusing and clich√©-ridden storyline: detective (of course!) has to settle a personal matter with the villain and suspended from duty gently (of course!) his personal confusion. Killer (! Of course) * * Wants to be tracked down and plays cat and mouse with his rival for many years ... I do not know how many films build on such sites - most of them are better, however. <br /> <br /> story has holes in abundance and plenty of quite incredible and unnecessary scenes, which do not contribute or work well with the plot at all (for example, a truck stop a scene or a car on the edge of a cliff, etc.). < br /> <br /> On top, the end is trying to be original and exciting, but not at all in this regard. We saw a lot * better finals with a similar native final-fight-to-train-in-the thrown-winter-landscape installation ... In the end, there is supposedly moving reunion of parent and child ... fake at measures.
