Summary: The full moon. It is a huge werewolf hunting. Not the body but not the blood (not what he appears to be a bite in the head on the way, though), but also for the partner. He is on the hunt for the girls. Not any girl, though. Girl. The girl who is clean (and werewolf, although she does not know about it). Three, good to check that the two policemen (after the first stage) and an old bag lady anything that can stop it, or even do not know that the case of murder and there are many people around the full moon, the werewolf. This is especially powerful werewolf, DarkWolf, approaching the girl. If he gets it, mankind is doomed. Now the cops need to find a girl to convince her not only that there is someone, a werewolf, however, that he wanted to rape her, and possibly kill her, but she is a werewolf himself. And then they have to stop him ... <br /> <br /> Note: This is one for the boys, adolescent boys. Many scenes with half-naked girls more or less important to the plot. Mostly less. Well, I think you need something to fill the time, because the plot (expected) thin. And, unfortunately, there is little, except for the girl to help plot against hacking. One usually refers to the two main themes. Nudity. Check. And then the special effects. Hmm ... Well, there are some things that you could cause effects. They are not very special, though. In fact, to be blunt, they are very bad. The film seems to suffer from a lack of funds. They could not afford clothes for some girls;) and cheap effects. Some conversion between a werewolf and a human form, obviously done on a computer, really bad. You can ignore such things. But DarkWolf itself is very rough, too, and you never get to see any killing. Just some of the mutilated corpses afterwards. And surprisingly little blood on, in a film that honestly has to be covered with blood. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what to say about the actors and characters. In most cases, they are doing well, but, unfortunately, there were mistakes characters (or actors) just lost it. Some of these shortcomings may be associated with the problems mentioned above. As poor effects, or poor budget (?). This may explain why there is very little shooting, even if the characters are armed as a small army and the purpose of the form (and not moving). But hey, if you're in real danger, there is nothing that will save your life, like a good one-liner ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this can not explain the moments when Cop, Steve, the only one who He knows how to possibly deal with the problem, the werewolf, who runs away when the only thing he can be sure that the shifter is suitable for a girl, which is just next to him now, and he can not let her. But I am sure that even if the producers to stretch the ending a little more ... <br /> <br /> but I would not mind seeing a single one of the leading actors / actresses, get another try in another film. <br /> <br /> Well. To give a small conclusion :. Nya film that I recommend <br /> <br /> 3/10
