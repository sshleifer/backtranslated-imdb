I basically took the film, because I saw a brilliant remake of Takashi Kitano with Datoiti and was in the mood for another update samurai tale, which also starred Tadanobu Asano. These two films are worlds apart. Zatoichi added humor and depth of his characters and perverted traditional samurai movie clich√©s. GoJoe goes into the deep end in the other direction. <br /> <br /> First of all, I hate movies that have different characters inform the audience that the protagonist is instead to develop a character for the film, "you can not decide whether you are a monk or warrior 'says almost every character in the presence of the Bank, yet this inner vanity almost transports in the nature. Instead of character development, we get bloated, boring, bloody battle scenes. Asano undeveloped character, and even he looks like he is bored and does not know what he was doing there. I know that he usually looks distant and cold, and is part of the attractiveness of Asano, but this film does not serve him. <br /> <br /> A lot of camera movement nauseating. There is a scene that goes on forever, in which the camera rotates around the main characters, while my wife and I felt like vomiting. The ending is funny and rather anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> It's too bad, really good samurai films have been made in Japan at the moment with this type of budget. Colors, decorations and costumes were great, but otherwise it's just going to take too much of a waste of time. I would like to see one of the kabuki version of this myth.
