"Turn off" occurs in / Petrol Station dive diner in the middle of the Australian desert to escape Tom McGregor (Mercury Paul), a shy boy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some visitors arrive unexpectedly. We get it in the first place, it seems vaguely flashback in which he and his sister (although their relationship to each other be better understood later in the film) is racing across the desert on his motorcycle. Thereafter, it appears as a very quiet, and sometimes in the presence of a capricious nature of arrivals. <br /> <br /> We know one thing for sure, and it's kind of McGregor spiritual sense, his foresight and such danger - his vision is only slightly related to the history, most of which concerns three diamond thieves, whose car breaks down, and who rely on Tom to help them to spot without getting in their way. Of course, Tom falls in love with one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and all of a sudden, he is all three are already trusting allies against each other. But is not that really leads to some much mystery or action. In fact, the whole movie all the time seems to want to create something significant, but in fact not able to do it. Even the ending of which is played like a trite tale fires (and the one that really shows a lot of descriptive shortcomings), almost the same as funny. <br /> <br /> It may be worth a try if you do not mind walking very slowly, but in the mood, at least, something a little different than usual.
