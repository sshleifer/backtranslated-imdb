The recipe is one of the worst films of all time: in shemale villain who looks like he escaped from the WWF, has terrible aim with a gun, which has conflicting effects (the first guy she shoots catches on fire, but when she takes off to someone else, they just fade away) and takes a long time to pet deer. Then you get a nasty character, 30-year-old college student, an unsuccessful attempt to surprise endings and many, many more. Avoid at all costs.
