If we assume that this is not going to end up straight to video release, I'd have to say void this title at any cost. If you do not get tired of a good, well-made movie, that is. I saw it last night in the AFI Dallas, and I left with 20 minutes to go, simply because I do not care more (about the story, not about insulting the director ... it's uncomfortable). If you can find a goof only 5 minutes in the film (shot with destroyed window before a shot ... and then broke the window with the first shot), things go wrong. I will say this, it is only an indicator of things to come ... unfortunately. <br /> <br /> I'll spare you all the details, but it is subpar in every way, even half of the estimated effect of Michael Madsen disappointing when you expect half-assed acting on it. And rape scene ... Christ! "Shut up and take it" should never be used in a rape scene. EVER. <br /> <br /> 3/10
