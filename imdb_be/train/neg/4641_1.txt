Sometimes enjoy a truly lousy movies .... the ones that sometimes arise when people (even talented people) get together with good intentions, to produce films and for some reason it turns out to be a disaster. Movies like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes", "Plan 9 from Outer Space", "Manos-Hands of Fate" and "Heavens Gate", etc. <br /> <br /> So, when I heard that the film "Rachel's Attic" was considered by many people to be the only worst film of the decade, of course, I just have to see it. <br /> <br /> Boy, I regret that decision. This film goes bad .... it is so bad that not even pleasant, as an ordinary bad movie. Action, filming, script, etc., is even worse than a low budget porn film sound quite terrible, the "story" is absolutely not clear, the "action" is ridiculous .... it is all a waste of time and money. At least porn movie porn does break up the monotony, while this absurd nightmare of a guy squeezing rotten apples, and tea. <br /> <br /> Lighting «sumasshedshy Shlyapnika» nonexistent .. .Many "scene" takes place in the field or in the dark, which is probably just as well. "Writer-director" (I use the term loosely), David Tybor, trying curly with bondage scene ... but the results would be laughable if they were not so pathetic. There is some nudity, but such a poor quality that it actually acts as a sexual repression. I could go on forever, and do justice to all the flaws and shortcomings of the really terrible waste of film. <br /> <br /> For the love of God, to avoid this train wreck. I know that, in spite of (or perhaps because of) has negative comments, you may still be tempted to see if this piece of garbage is really as bad as I would argue that it is .... but trust me on this .... it's even worse than I have said, and you absolutely, positively sorry for the experience (and the cost, if you spend your money to buy or rent).
