There are just so many things wrong with this film. <br /> <br /> To start with, the first twenty minutes of the film could be compressed into only five or maybe ten. Total film (thankfully) short already, but this can be compensated by giving a little more attention to the average Lion (how could miss the reference to «Wiz» on that?) And runs his story and, closer to the main story. In short, the scenario was the germ of a good idea, but it should be quite a bit of trouble. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it can be done without crude humor. The original also had some that it could do without, but at least, it was almost an afterthought. - here, flatulence and urination abound <br /> <br /> Third, show a little too self-conscious. The original series was that good enough, as the first film, but here it's just way too much. Brendan Fraser in-jokes are just a bit above (and why there is no mention of a "new Ursula?"). Other gags with a story, especially a couple of interactions closer to the end, is also higher than common sense. <br /> <br /> Fourth, a little more attention could be paid to the CGI work. At first it was difficult to say that Shemp's not a real elephant (with the exception of the behavior, of course), but then CGI stands out like a sore thumb. Ideally, the special effects should just tell a story, whether they are good or bad, and they are, at least, have success in this regard, so that a relatively small problem, but it's still there. <br /> <br /> All that said, the performance of Christopher Showerman George decent enough. It lacks the charm of Brendan Fraser, but Christopher is only really fails in this particular comparison - he even managed to give George a little bit of personal depth, which was supposed to be one of the major incidents in Jay Ward-inspired film, but he was not here. Julie Benz, as a new Ursula surprised me like even better than Leslie Mann in the original. <br /> <br /> Most of the other performances were fairly standard, the sun standing out in my mind, good or bad.
