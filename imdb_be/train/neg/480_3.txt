2 stars for Kay Francis - she is beautiful! And she does not deserve such a terrible scar that Warner Bros. I throw your way! <br /> <br /> twofold premise that this movie is based on this ridiculous and unbelievable extremes. Kay small-town wife and mother, wishing for something more: she wants to be an actress. If the big shot actor comes to town and invited Kay to his hotel to talk about the possibilities, Kay tells her husband that she was going to the movies. Biddy peasant of a mother puts a bug in your ear peasant that Kay is not being true, and he sets out to look for her. He finds her w / actor at the hotel (they only speak!), And he Slug guy who falls over the railing, landing face first into the pond (lake?) And dies. Now here are two incredible premise upon which the rest of the movie: <br /> <br /> 1) the judge says to the jury that if it is found that the person died * to * his head into the water, they have to find a husband guilty of murder first degree. (Whaaaaa ?????? I think putting a guy in a fit of rage will be counted for the murder or killing 2 in the best case, is not the first murder. Give me a break! But the plot requires it had been found guilty of the murder of 1 so that it can be sent to prison for life. Whatever.) <br /> <br /> 2) The husband's lawyer, after conviction and sentencing, Kay says that it is all her fault. His reasoning is that if she did not go to the actor's room, her husband did not have to go after her and the bullet guy and kill him. He tells her that she is to blame, not her husband, and she nods and agrees. That. . Hell?!?!?! The rest of the movie is all about Kay is trying to achieve fame and money to her husband was released from prison and immediately she made wrong, causing him to kill the actor dude first. <br /> <br /> I can not even go on the survey. The film was just too painful. Four years ago, in the pre-code days, you would have never caught Kay plays such a wimp! In the true fashion Kay Francis, though, it is to do everything possible to make us believe that this woman was a believable character. I give her a lot of credit for that breathe life and confidence in the thankless role. This character was far from the previous code Kay role and real life Spitfire Kay Francis. <br /> <br /> Steer away from this path! There are far more effective means of Kay Francis there! (From personal experience, I highly recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Jewel robbery, is also a good doctor Monica and One Way Passage I'm sure there are other great Kay clicks as well, but I only mention the ones I have. "I saw, and I can recommend.)
