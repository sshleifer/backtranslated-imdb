I first saw it when I was about 7. I remembered that I believed that the vague outlines of what happened. It turns out that now, 15 years later, I remembered everything with great precision, because it seems that the authors had nothing to do sketches for stories. There is no plot in this movie / cartoon. There's no character development, Sun history or character arcs or anything. Good guys do things because they are good, and the bad guys are doing things just because they are bad. One unintentionally paddle part, if any, who do you think important dies, and nobody cares anymore. They just shrug and move on. There's hardly anything of their dialogue. If you cut scenes and fight scenes are running, you lose 70% of the film. <br /> <br /> Look it's because you want to see some nice animations and for no other reason. Or, if you want to look at the half-naked hot chicks cartoon (or half-naked hot cartoon dudes).
