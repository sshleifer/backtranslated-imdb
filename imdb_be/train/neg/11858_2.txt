I am a supporter Matthew Modine, but this film - which I came across on the cable - this is absolutely brainless. I see that the writer and director was the same, so there was no one around to check on her worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines and not the original characters. Goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character. Who spends all this acting talent. Considering how expensive to shoot in New York these days, I have to wonder how it was done in the first place. And if you're wondering why I watched it at all, she came to after a movie that I like on the cable, and I left it while I was working on the computer. It is not very demanding on the picture!
