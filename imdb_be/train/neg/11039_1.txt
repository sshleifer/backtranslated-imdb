All the interesting things that are happening in this sitcom based on the main character Jim is a bad father, a bad husband or even just very selfish. How can that be funny? Of course, the character in the sitcom to be spoiled, but Jim's character is spoiled in a very unpleasant manner. <br /> <br /> And what? I think that this is because "it should now better." Jim is not a stupid man, he can take care of things, and he has the opportunity to do so. But he chooses to Niya. This is a conscious choice he makes when he decides not to play with your children, and not to go shopping, because he does not want to buy "Lady products" and it is a choice he does when he puts his relative. <br /> <br /> the other characters seem to be only a series of so Jim could have someone to be a jerk to. If Cheryl character was a real person, she would have left him years ago, and not stay with defaulters for 8 years. But, unfortunately, it is simply a catalyst Quirky middle class Jim extreme selfishness.
