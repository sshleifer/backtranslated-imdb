As a big fan of movies and plays of David Mamet, especially his first film, House Game, which also starred Joe Mantegna, I expected a lot from this film. Instead, I found that annoying movie superficiality and lack of trust. Racial lubricates thrown about without any sense or meaning behind them, in the hope of creating racial tension that never materialized for me. The identity of a fully cross-checked and people become "heroes" for no apparent reason. Because of this word, taken as a police officer, the chief hero refuses to perform one of a relatively small action that will not harm any one, and possibly save a life, and yet performs a different action, which is very strong and very illegal, but now refuses a minor effect. In addition, very improbably plot attended the man who killed his seven introduced only for the sake of the plot points, which all but advertised with aerial advertising, and the reaction of the police to the appearance of stretch credulity way beyond all reasonable limits. Needless to say, after waiting for another exciting thriller from David Mamet, I was very disappointed to say the least. 3 of 10.
