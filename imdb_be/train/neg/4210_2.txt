Richard Tyler a little boy who is afraid of everything. He does not like riding a bike or climbing on his tree house, because he knows what kind of accidents can happen to him. So one day he was riding a bicycle and so that it starts to rain, he decided to wait in the library until it stops rain. The whole story takes place there. He feels all kinds of personnel, and in the end he was not afraid anymore. But the whole story is incredible and even good actors like Macaulay Culkin could not make a better story than that.
