I do not understand that funny in this movie. Humor seems to be intended for corpses. It's slow. The story is too simple to be true. Symbols do not cause much sympathy, several nya-important characters in the party. Nothing happens surprising. That the authors of this scenario seems? "Ohhh funny! Let's do some old houses high on pot! Let's make them giggle ....! ... Let's make them behave like small children !! Ooooh, yes, it is absolutely brilliant and original! Â»<br /> <br /> This film irritates me the most of all the films that I've seen over the last five years.
