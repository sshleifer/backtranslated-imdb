This movie was the worst movie I have ever viewed. It was like "homework" for the film class. He completely misses the mark when it comes to the "message", which he is trying to convey. Characters more exaggerated, bad actions and, as for the story ... well, it is quite inappropriate. A little shot that made me think that it might be a decent movie, with actor nice and that's about it. The moral of this movie: never judge a movie on the cover IT! Save your time, money and energy and make your own home movies, and you'll be much better than I was painful to watch, and frankly I'm surprised that someone would spend money to make and distribute it!
