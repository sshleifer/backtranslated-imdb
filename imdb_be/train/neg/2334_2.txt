It was a high intellectual pretensions.The main drive is going to give "deep" the "meaning" render (voice over their frames of mind, of course), and he, of course, influenced by the fifties / sixties "method" -What if script and direction whether it was necessary to give excellent results (see Clift, Newman, Winters) .But here the story abysmal.Besides it moves too slowly, you could change, at least 20 minutes to enable pointless flashback, and the storyline will not be changed. again, it is very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his character "Uncle" and his painting are often bordered by parody.An interesting hand just slides: for boys / hero -el we assume that the hero of some kind-governing if he speaks to young a child that he would allow no one hurts him, some welcome tenderness emerges.But this nonsense, and only the final scene returns to him. <br /> <br /> A word to the wise: Take Foley "closeup" instead: it has two great actors (Christoph er Walken and Sean Penn together!), it is also an unusual film, but it's an exciting, suspenseful .Here my items hitchcockometer grimly to zero throughout.
