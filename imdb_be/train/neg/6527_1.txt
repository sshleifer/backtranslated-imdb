Of course, do not show on a Saturday morning children's television has ever done is bad. In the end, the producers had to rely on the audience, which is returned. Well, in this terrible sacrifice, they could at least count the money they saved on the sets. The scenario could be removed from some long-forgotten series of space opera, with a few bland lines, added to a cold dude Gerald Mohr complain about Nauru Hayden. No director could not have done anything decent with this crazy story line, so that the effect lasts just boring together. Spacecraft absurd props - Bulova clocks and portable, for example - but many ekzoplanut should be one of the worst in the history of cinema. Most of these are rough figures, and everything is bathed in red light often misfocused. Even naked breast the sea is used as a support. And that's bad one - as a thin rib-like plot. Any spectator who can make it to the end of the film will hear a message from the Martians - and probably totally agree!
