Scientist on the island is in deep sorrow about the loss of his son, who died of kidney cancer. Thus, he thinks, why not turn my dead son in a hammerhead shark. Well, who would not? It's a bit hard to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark, which kills all constantly under the name "Paul". In addition, the cast of William Forsythe as a MacGyver-kick-ass-savingtheday- interesting character is not credible. On the other hand, there are a few hot chicks that make you actually look at the screen, while Paul shark bites another to death. In fact, I feel bad B-movies rather amusing. But for my taste, it would be much better than the movie, when it was made to say 1000000 dollars less. Then it might be interesting.
