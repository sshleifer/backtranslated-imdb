I grew up watching and loving PNP. I just recently finished watching the entire series ST Voyager on DVD, which is probably my heightened sense of disgust with this episode, both in style and approach, the difference between the two shows could not be more stark. The idea might be good, if they are used as an opportunity to further enhance the character of Riker, who, as he probably would have been considered for VOY. They might be different recollection, that would be "new" to the audience, and not just regurgitate old show clips. And of the transitions between the "memories" and "real" in this episode begins like a clich√© at the beginning and very soon becomes unbearable, as a tired pattern is farther and farther. Bar nonequidistant worst episode ever.
