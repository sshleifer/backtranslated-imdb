Lipstick still glossy failure.I movie trying to think of one good thing that I could say about the film, and I am having problems coming up with something.I guess red dress, Margaux Hemingway was wearing at the end of the film was the best part.The writing and screenplay not the worst that I have ever come across, but it could be much better. Lipstick is very pleasing to the eye to view.The sets were very glossy and pleasant to look at.The roll was fine. I felt that the character of Anne Bancroft was the only real person in the whole movie.It was sad to see Chris Sarandon waste your time on this.
