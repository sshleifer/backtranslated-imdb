I do not know what it is with these kids Brady. First, Barry Williams publicly brags about how sexy his TV sister, Maureen McCormick, something about his acquaintance TV mom, Florence Hederson. Then, Susan (Cindy) Olsen makes music for porn ligament. Then Mike (Bobby) Lookinland gets into trouble because of drunk driving. Finally, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eve (John) the effect may have been a little homosexual affair on the side. Now, Christopher (Peter) Knight pursued by a beautiful young model in her early 20s during his stay in «The Surreal Life», which first was fun to watch, and now they are married and in a very volatile and hostile attitude, the last episode, where she posed for a bunch of naked photos with another naked girl for notes to give Christopher's birthday, which was not a good move on her part. And he had to deal with it in a very mature fashion, just picking up and leaving, to clear your head. I think he always bowed to her every need and now he finally take a stand. And I do not want to say, but I think she abused him verbally. The way she was tormented by his wedding ring and how it Reams him for every little thing. In addition, she speaks openly about flings with other women, and it is obvious that she is still sleeping around on him with women and men, which is not something any self-respecting person should do if you are already married to someone. If it was a man talking down to his wife, as it happens every night, parties and sex with other people, everything will be rallying for his wife to leave him. Why should it be any different. What began as a cute little crush on another reality show became a huge catastrophe. Adrian, as beautiful as it is, the other Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, is clearly in need of some therapy, because she was crying like a baby over nonsense. I feel sorry for her, but Chris has to get rid of it, because he's a good person who can not afford to be humiliated like this.
