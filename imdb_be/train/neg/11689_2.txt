I've never seen any of the previous films of Spike Lee, as their trailers never caught my interest. I saw, and I admire Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster and work, and some have DVD. I was, however, totally disappointed with this film. If this film is any indication of the ability of Spike Lee as a director, my advice would be to "get a job", and stop wasting time and talent to others. <br /> <br /> I wonder if any of the other commentators IMDb watched the same movie I saw. I can only assume from these juicy melancholic reviews that their adoration of Spike Lee has blinded their banality of this part of the work. I just paid $ 2.50, in the theater "Second Run», and still felt like I wasted my money. <br /> <br /> The page IMDb «Trifles" says it all ....... <br /> <br /> * «Shot in 39 days" - you can expect to shoot a big-budget "Blockbuster" (as the media hype promised), in such a short time? . Not surprisingly, there was such a weak performance and all <br /> <br /> * «Ron Howard was going to direct the first film ..." - He may have done this project some sort of justice, given more time to do so, Of course. Although the handwriting was atrocious, the room had some advantages. <br /> <br /> OK! maybe not. I'm sorry! This movie was so rife with clichés helpless, implausible scene, and lousy characterization that may be, even he could not do much. (Hey, Ron Be sure to thank Russell ... good call!) <br /> <br /> * «Jodie Foster filmed her part in three weeks." - And he showed! Her image «Fixer», which makes the problem of people to leave, it was an incredible scenario, it was given. Perhaps she even wants to be there <br /> <br /> Other Peeves: <br /> <br /> * How many bank robbers would bother to come to the door, and tell the uniformed police that they were inside robbing a bank and it is better to stay away ... or else? <br /> <br /> * If "Detective Frazier" (Denzel Washington), comes to the bank to check if there are any more bodies as bank robbers, without arms, will be "under the guidance of" policeman (much less " let 'cop) back to the front door, allowing the police to go after him? <br /> <br /> * Det. Fraser later claimed to have given the robber "every reason to shoot me." Why, in their brief struggle, he was not even trying to put the robber's face? It may have gotten the answer he was looking for ... the robber would have shot him just to prevent further identification. And why take the "Steve, Steve, Steve-O" (accomplice of the robber), so long to come in and help? <br /> <br /> I understand that this is not your typical bank robbers. They had a different agenda, and do not want anyone hurt. But the police had no reason to think they will not. For them, it was a desperate situation. Why, then, when two of the bad guys went out to "pick up a pizza?" They were not removed. (In the first place, as the robbers would come out into the street without using a hostage as a shield? Is this version of Spike Lee in New York City, or the SNL-x?). Taking them to reduce the amount of the bad guy in the closed plans, and the rest of the robbers are more likely to refuse. If not, then at least there would be less bad guys inside. (Give SwaT to do something, or to send them home!) <br /> <br /> * What the police department in the country, would allow Madeline White (Jodie Foster), a waltz right into the bank and discuss the matter with the robbers, she He will not disclose them first? She had no power, no government authority; and besides, it was at the end, "already" a hostage situation ... add another one? <br /> <br /> * Why not bank CEO (Christopher Plummer), a destroyed incriminating documents for a long time? Screw sentimentality! Diamonds, he could sell. <br /> <br /> * Who is "schmuck" (the character, not the actor), with an emphasis Jersey, which is convenient, voluntarily, and said that he knew that the record was "100% Albanian", but yet he could not say it ..... SIR! Put your hand down! And his ex-wife! That «Schlump» she was !!! Both were absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> * If you question suspects, why Det. Fraser, constantly pestering the person, who obviously were not part of the robbery? (Ie - says an elderly woman, she could go, and then she could not, he might, he could not?) Give me a break! <br /> <br /> * Who saw the bank robbers demand that the hostages to put on a hopping suites, unable to withdraw their escape plan included leaving the bank, pretending to be some of the hostages? <br /> <br /> * The end of the film has been shown false wall was built in the supply room, followed by Clive Owen is hidden behind the "week" .... where the materials come from? (Plasterboard and studs). It was also assumed that they crashed into the sewers, so that he could free himself. Employees of the bank did not complain about the smell, the whole week? Hello <br /> <br /> * After this fiasco !; since the documents "were" were in the hands of a robber, what kind of "links" was Mrs. White expects to receive from the general director of the bank, seeing that he is now a target for blackmail, because of its failure? <, Br /> <br /> * And last but certainly not least, that «Electric Glide», that Denzel did? HOW STUPID! Was this should indicate their "determination" to bring these guys to justice? He looked more like a man who jumped to ride on the basket, trying to prevent a bowel movement! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> Furthermore mediocre plot; lousy script; bad game; and generally helpless direction ...... yad, yad, yad. <br /> <br /> I hope it will just look at the movies, to help others decide whether or not to spend money or not! <br /> <br />.
