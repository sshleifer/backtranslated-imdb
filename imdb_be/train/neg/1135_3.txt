I have not read a biography of Lincoln, so maybe it was an accurate portrayal ...... <br /> <br /> And maybe it's because I used to be as detached and unrealistic image worship, which is unnatural worship Lincoln as a brilliant, honorable, and the savior of our country ...... <br /> <br /> But why did they make the film, which is the Lincoln as a clown? While Henry Fonda made a great Lincoln, his his image as a "shell ah, I'm just a simple guy" seemed a little sad. <br /> <br /> [Of course, this was a whole Bushie Jr. Company, to make us think that he was "just a regular guy," so we do not care that he is rich and privileged moron. - but that's another story] <br /> <br /> Not only did the film show Lincoln as a kind of simple (almost ingenuous) a guy, the film argues that Lincoln just kind of got into law by accident, and that he even I was not interested that the law - only falsely simplistic ideas of law to be the rights and wrongs. In the film, he's not a very good lawyer (he lounges around with his feet on the table and makes fun of witnesses), and the result is largely determined by chance / luck. <br /> <br /> In addition, partly because it was funded by the Republicans (in response to some games under the auspices of the Democrats, who came out), and partly because it was just a sense of time, a film, unfortunately, religious, racist and conservative. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time on this movie!
