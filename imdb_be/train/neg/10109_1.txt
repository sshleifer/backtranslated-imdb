BTK Killer, Killer the Green River, the Zodiac; man continues to simmer absolute rubbish and the ironic thing is, he likes his shit. <br /> <br /> I've never seen the film Ulli Lommel, but I was so amazed on how everyone thinks his things so badly. As in the movie, I said at the beginning is not even six, when added together! After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy really is. He is the worst there is. <br /> <br /> credits will not end like a worthless movie started and I quickly noticed that the sound was incredibly badly dubbed in. Action was incredibly awful and the same camera shots, editing easily the worst. This film does not make sense, and I could no longer unbearable to endure, it is not over, and I was only 45 minutes in the film. I could not stand it any longer. I spent 45 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this shit!
