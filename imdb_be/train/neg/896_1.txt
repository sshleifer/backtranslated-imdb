This movie is terrible. Nha offensive, but very predictable. The film is behind the life of a small town family in the mid 60s. Father, principal at the school, is going through a midlife crisis. Enter the cute teacher from the big city who starts challenging the minds of their students with some thought-provoking things, how to think for themselves. The principal does not agree with its teachings, but she's pretty. You can connect the dots. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick) served with a small urban lifestyle and wants to live. She gets bad advice, hanging out with some bad boys, and, apparently, planning, families are not set out in their school. Shocking! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro mainly worked in television, the film plays like a more adult version of the after school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane comedy.
