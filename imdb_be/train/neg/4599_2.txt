The adage "Never judge a book by its cover", it was devised as a warning for those who do not look under the surface. <br /> <br /> As I saw the cover to the "King of the Ants" I immediately thought of the horror! Arkan shooting proudly displayed on the cover, and therefore spoke of a dark vision synopsis promised murder story of betrayal and revenge. Instead, what I found at this surface was less interesting than what you can find under the middle of the rock. <br /> <br /> Â«King of the Ants" features Chris L. McKenna, Sean Crowley, average guy, ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. Besides Sean Crowley someone does not care, never I felt no sympathy or compassion to this character. In fact, he really is unpleasant, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews), who finds himself in uninspired performance as did the worst in a completely ridiculous dialogue, he is forced to read. Throw in Kari Wuhrer as a grieving widow who apparently has an unconditional trust (especially homeless people), and almost no common sense, and George Wendt as the Duke, which is basically a sober Norm from Cheers, but mean! <br /> <br /> Now, there are a few interesting sequences "hallucinations" in the film (the source of cover images), but this film never delves further into this world. He prefers to bomb you unmotivated signs, bad dialogue, and is unlikely after the unlikely event. Oh horror!
