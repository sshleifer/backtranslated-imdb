Occasionally a strange cast was wasted so badly. Griffin Dunne, Ryazanov Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, John Turturro, everyone jumped on board, only to be torpedoed by the script, which seems like nothing more than a joke in Hollywood. Attaching the Martin Scorsese on it is probably a draw, but the end result is much less than the sum of its parts. Such a nightmare gone awry, each scene seems more far-fetched than the next. "Seek and Destroy" is nothing more than an abstract, stylish, indulgent nonsense themselves, and the whole film is obviously a sad .......... MERK
