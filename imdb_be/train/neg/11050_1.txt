Terrible use of cut scenes. All continuity is lost, or terrible scripts or lethargic direction. This sneaky robot ... Moustiers was jazz dancer? In addition, one of the worst tracks I have ever heard (monologues are usually drowned out by the music.) And ... Where do they get props? This ship looks like a milk carton ... I did the best special effects of 8 mm at the age of 13 years! <br /> <br /> I would recommend any student film must see this film (5 minutes at a time) so as to learn how NOT to make a film. ... or whether it was the wine editor? <br /> <br /> This is really too bad, because the script was actually a good idea ... just poorly executed all the way around. (Unfortunately Malcolm. You must send "understudy." You're too kind an actor for such a stink bomb.)
