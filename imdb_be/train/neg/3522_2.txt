If you like the standard clicks Sly, which involve over the top action, stunts (incredibly entirely conceived as complementary here), and delayed the dialogue; you will love this steaming pile of mountain goat manure. I had high hopes based on the trailer. I thought that Stallone was about to be forced from him "has-been" days give way to smart people, and make a film of action that would put a reliable figure in a secure situation in which the history, production, and (probably) the action will prevail, I thirst actions that, at least close enough to the reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that will come from such an event. My knowledge is limited hypothermia and its consequences have at least one scene ridiculously funny. Judge Dredd only better because you know, vahodyachy to the theater, you're going to see a comic book made into a movie. The character, setting and everything else are beyond comparison to anything we might encounter itself. Climber on the other hand, it turns climbing guide Rambo before you you can say, "Hey, Adrian!"
