I have made this film in a hotel room to entertain your children in the morning we were leaving home, because I had packed all his toys. (Kids do not like to watch "Regis and Kathie Lee" or «The View»). My four years found one funny episode, but said to me, the rest was "too stupid." This four-year, folks. Anyone over the age of, say, nine want to kill their TV rather than let it play itself out. < br /> <br /> to say that this film is bad, as saying the Holocaust was a little mistake. there's no word on how funny and absolutely awful this "movie" really is. Acts bad, stupid story, and pathetically unfunny script. Since this must be a comedy, the fact that you can not even laugh at harmfulness of the film makes it even worse. Bronson "Beam» Pinchot is the worst with a strange fake accent (Irish-Pakistan-Bronx-kok-the Cajun, as far as I could tell), but all the characters are awful. I did not look real Laurel and Hardy film in age, but I know that they were supposed to be much better than this. What is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with it ... <br /> <br /> The result :? derivatives garbage. Avoid any price, if you have some fancy Bronson Pinchot fetish. 2/10
