While watching this movie, I came up with a script for a film called "The Making of 10 points or lessÂ»: <br /> <br /> Mark: I have good news and bad news. The good news is, we can get Morgan Freeman <br /> <br /> Author: That's great! But it's bad news <br /> <br /> The producer: We can only afford to hire him for a day. I think we should get somebody <br /> <br /> Author :. Thus, we are bringing it in one day. The film is an hour and a half long. A work day lasts eight hours. I do not see a problem <br /> <br /> Manufacturer :. But ... he would have to spend time getting into character <br /> <br /> Author :. Thus, we have, as he plays a character who is essentially self <br /> <br /> Manufacturer :. But he still needs to understand his motivation and the like. You do not tell us how he plays the famous actor, which makes low-budget film with you <br /> <br /> Author: Why not? <br /> <br /> The producer: This is ridiculous! But well, at least we will have Morgan Freeman in the film. And I think we need to set the film in Los Angeles, also <br /> <br /> Author :. Of course <br /> <br /> Manufacturer :. This scenario is nonsense. We would be better to make money. In any case, have the character Morgan Freeman connected Wal-Mart or Target or one of these stores, so that at least someone wants to sell a DVD-disks <br /> <br /> Author:.! Sure thing <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: Wait a minute ... what about a tiny wine cellar to the "ten items or less" express lanes <br /> <br /> Writer: Oh, I think it's pretty weird . But we can not change the name now! <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that my script actually has a lot in common with reality, but neither did "10 Items or Less." This case is a good action, but bad writing shape, and I hate to make this happen. When viewing the independent film, you expect it to try to convey some message. I think they might be trying to tired old "do not let anything hold you back," a message that has been done to death in much better films. in any case, with the "10 Items or less," the only dressing edamlenne that I got was, "Look! Look at the Morgan Freeman!"
