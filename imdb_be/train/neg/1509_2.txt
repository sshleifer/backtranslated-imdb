I do have a problem, the rating for this film. It is directed brilliantly, then, obviously, a lot of money in it. Weights and Danes intense (though its screen face could use a little more definition and season), editing and cinematography is excellent. On the other hand, this is one of those who really really sick of movies, where one can not help but wonder, love whether the director himself puts a specific scene, and, yes, one can not help but wonder how many imitators is a film inspired. <, Br /> <br /> in purely artistic terms, it is 9, but I really have to ask yourself, who are these people give money to make this movie ....
