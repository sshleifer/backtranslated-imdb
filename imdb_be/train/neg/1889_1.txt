This film does not entertainment, but more to delve deeper into the dark side of human behavior. Loosely tying a half dozen stories of the worst kind of wickedness, perverted sex, greed, violence and intolerance. All the action is played out in a few very hot and sticky days during the heat wave in Vienna, and the heat may be responsible for some of the anger and hatred in the film. For me, the treatment delayed the girl steward of safety equipment was the worst episode closely follows the scene of drunkenness and corruption in the "slags" apartment. You exciting, and I hope that the horror of this film. I hated it, but I was forced to go through it. 1/10 for the "fun" 8/10 for display of "man" as he is sometimes.
