I would not say it's bad * film. Unfortunately for me, I feel that the more you know about the fencing, the worse it becomes simple due to the fact that it becomes completely unrealistic. I fencing since I was 14 years old, and this film reflects this very badly. F. Murray Abraham is a good (and there seems to be some fence background), but most of the other actors - especially students - just seems to be lost.
