I look forward to seeing Dreamgirls quite a long time ... what with all this crazy comments, categories and media attention. And I must say that in the first quarter of the film was good! It really draws the black music scene then. However, as the movie wore on, I and all my family were bored out of our mind. Singing just kept coming, one after another. I mean seriously, just one more than the number of music and it would break even with RENT <br /> <br /> Also, I noticed almost no character development in any of the characters. I just do not care about what happened to them! Even if the character Eddie Murphy died of a drug overdose, I knew I had to boring, but I just did not feel any emotion for that character. Symbols were given flimsy background of singing as a child and whatnot, but there faces were not found enough to attract me. <br /> <br /> In the end, the conflict was simply not enough to make the audience care that goes along with the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of the movie copy cat by Ray, Chicago, and rent (Ray and Chicago were great movies, in my opinion). Overall, I think this film will be best suited for someone who really does not care about the common history, but will use two o'clock entertainment and fun singing performances.
