OK .... I just 3 words - cheese, cheese and cheese! The only softening of the film Dean Cain. In addition - it CHEESEBALL SUPREME !!!! <br /> <br /> The film has some prospects in the concept - an underground laboratory creates a real live fire breathing dragon - basically gives us a "Jurassic Park" meets "Reign of Fire" ..... there are some great opportunities, but they simply are not controlled by .... decent special effects - even if you know the dragon CGI, it's not terribly See how CGI .... <br /> <br /> I would not lay the blame on Dean Cain (although he one of the producers), I would lay greater blame on Philip Roth - director and writer. It's his job to make this film .... and, unfortunately, he failed.
