I can not believe that I actually sat through it all. This film has the worst acts with Killjoy <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the plot :. The film begins with Jojo and that another chick sitting around on the beach, drooling over skinny blonde hair Beach "hunk", which looks as if it has not been in the gym a day in his life. Anyway, everyone knows it, and every chick in the movie he wants. UH OH! But the competition! Stereotypical "chick" and her best friends, who drive an ugly pink car. We find out quickly Jojo mother and got a job for life in Australia, which means that Jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind (oh no, I think I'm going to cry). A huge storm comes, and fills them from the opposite pool water. Anyway, no reason at all, a little baby bird falls into the pool, and comes face to face with, yes, you guessed it, a mermaid! This is where "history" is really taking off. Basically, they want to get the mermaid to fall in love with the "piece". <br /> <br /> This preteen Flick out so bad, that makes 80 look like the pinnacle of Oscar worthy performances. This film has all the possible clich√© ... best friends, "a chunk", which everyone wants, "hot" bad girl and her bitchy friends, scared old ... you name it, it's there. I took one for many people, watching this. Consider my hour and 40 minutes to sacrifice you. Please do not watch this movie. Do not make it so that I have suffered in vain.
