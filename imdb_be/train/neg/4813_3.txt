I gave up trying to figure out which version of the I'm watching. The copyright on the end of a decree one thousand nine hundred eighty-three year and although it does not matter a bit of my objection to this film, I have to say that watching the film is clearly made in the Age of Aquarius (including long-haired hippie chick and odious station wagons), but since 1980 the first years of synth soundtrack disturbing . Very disturbing. <br /> <br /> My main objection here how dare creator BURY sweet-AS-A-BUTTON Pamela Franklin ALIVE. How dare they <br /> <br /> Seriously, she's like a magical and stuff, but two films that I saw her. - this crapfest and other prominent Legend of Hell House. - they kill it by <br /> <br /> I would like to put the film industry on notice. Pamela Franklin apparently gone out of business, but if it ever decides to make another film, and some blasted mutt with the director trying to kill it from I ask him to step outside. <br /> <br /> No one can compete with the UP ON PAMELA Franklin and runs away with him. I am very CROSS. Fury unleashed. <br /> <br /> For those who like a B-movie searching crapfest, you could do a lot worse than that. On the positive side, it's not a film that includes Satanism in peripheral and sensitive manner. - this movie hardcore satanic movie <br /> <br /> from one wall to satanic rites, baphomets, hallucinations, ridiculous rat attack. - what more could you ask for <br /> <br /> This great stuff pretty much destroyed confuse grafted on 1980 synth soundtrack, which is about as inconsistent with the movie as possible. Soundtrack reminded me of something you'd hear on the equalizers. This is very bad. <br /> <br /> In addition, they did Pamela Franklin crush her magical English accent, which was also quite rude, if not brutal crime (against the viewer), such as you might find covered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . I say that we have a right to hear Pamela Franklin to speak in her own voice. Who's with me? I could forgive everything else about this film, if they are not abused Pamela Franklin. And so I throw the gauntlet down, gray - ANYONE WHO Messes Messes with Pamela Franklin ME <br /> <br /> Even in a fictional context <br /> <br /> A GOOD DAY, THE LORD ...
