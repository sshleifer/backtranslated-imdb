Let me start with the fact that I can enjoy just about any bad Italian horror film or a jungle operation fantasy flick from the 1970s. Seriously. This one was completely awful. <br /> <br /> There are too many elements that Martino is trying to introduce and none of them does not work (for CRIC-gone-wild thing except) very well at all. There are some ignorant Westerners, of course, that created the resort in the jungle somewhere. I do not even remember where this is going ... how sad that ... Basically, people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its ceremony, but in the end they violate the "Alligator God" River, which then continues to go on a rampage, killing said vacationers and some tribesmen as well. Sounds good, huh? Well, do not expect. There is a minimum of violence to end, the special effects are so bad, it was like a kindergarten class is organized and their love story thrown into a clown. <br /> <br /> There are seriously a couple of scenes where they appear to have established an underwater camera in the pool and dropped toy alligator, like a spear into the water, and that there should be an alligator attacking. I'm not kidding. In another well create a special effect, match Van calculated incredible fading plastic alligator that suddenly five times the size of the van. (A few minutes ago he was just big enough to eat people, but now it outshines the full-size cargo van ...) It's really pathetic. The only film I can think about where the effects were so bad, I pulled out of the stories was a masterpiece by Bruno Mattei, "Rat", which with plastic rats on a conveyor belt, and anyone who could not be terrified. <, Br /> <br /> I usually say anything Sergio Martino was definitely hard to see, but this one is a must pass. A waste of time, and certainly not worth buying for $ 15 + stickers shame. Shame is one. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10 children.
