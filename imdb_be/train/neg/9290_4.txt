Star Rating: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday morning ** Sunday Night Monday Morning <br /> <br /> long time inmate Twitch (Kurupt) gets himself transferred to the hard prison than reopened Alcatraz. He argues that it is, to be closer to his lady, but his real motives a little more ambitious. There it intersects with Burke (Bill Goldberg) cumbersome prisoner who can take care of themselves. Twitch, despite a less muscular, just as chatty and pretty much the same. But there's a gang war brewing between black and Hispanic inmates that explodes in a hostile takeover in prison, when the leader of a gang of black shot and pointing at Burke. But sh! T really hits the fan when the real killer and leader of the Hispanic, Cortes (Robert Madrid) takes girlfriend twitch and daughter hostage. <br /> <br /> Burke Steven Seagal does not make sequels (reportedly, very much in contrast to the idea of ​​Under Siege 2, and only agreed to do so, provided the production company he was with at the time, even direct your own movie) so despite this the future DVD sequel, a leading role at this time going to Bill Golberg (Steve does not even appear in some of the footage from the first film, which appears at the end.) But there's a reason why he did not do much work as Universal soldier 2 and that's because it is not so much an actor and not much action star or character head m, which begins as a very dark and brooding, but unsubtly turns into a standard action hero quipping embarrassed by the stupid jokes. Support wise, veterans from the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, who just jumped at the chance of extra work. <br /> <br /> This is a film that tried to copy the style of the original is pretty good, with dim lighting, dark shadow and rap music playing over the lot. He does it very well, unfortunately, he can not fight unengaging hero, just a cardboard villain and apathetic history that manufacturers make so many seem to have done, as they went along. **
