Pretty useless made-for-TV movie that pretty much goes for the screenplay of insect killer. Ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near the hotel. I think it's from the hotel food, as the waste water from the hotel's kitchen drain directly into the formic bed. There is no suspense in this film, and it's not terrible either. Watching a bunch of ants sting its victim is not very scary. <br /> <br /> section spoilers Stupidity hero is incredibly close. He said that health inspectors that the ants could not be a hero. He must be a mysterious virus. After the inspector says it, the hero has its bulldozer destroys a huge colony of ants. It bothers millions of ants and traps people in a hotel. <br /> <br /> End of spoiler in all, this film is very accurate. I do not understand why he received the DVD release, when so many worthy films no. Now is my suggestion for the DVD release is that Suzanne Summers in the film. This is a film to avoid.
