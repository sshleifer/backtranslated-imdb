I wonder why this picture was taken at all: the story itself is very unlikely, if not funny, the characters (experimental single Cops vs. young, very passionate about) completely predictable ending quite dull and impossible to understand (perhaps after a few views but you must have a masochistic a tendency that, the idea is that you have to read the book to fully understand what it is all about) and the action is bad. It was the main idea is to show that the French filmmakers are able to do, as well as an American in the genre, which include "Seven" and "Silence of the Lambs"? If yes, then it is a complete failure. It was quite successful, though (and there is a kind of cult status as the first French serial killer film) and, apparently, is regarded as a good product for export. Strange.
