First observed 12/26/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): Corny comedy murder mystery with a little laugh. The film seems to be two fairly popular American writers of romantic comedies on the basis of earlier Italian cinema on loans, but has been rewritten. But this one, Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts. The story of the couple down and Americans travel, played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young, stumble upon a lost dog and hopes to make a fortune in reward money after seeing a newspaper ad to return to the dachsund. When you try to return it, they saw a hand sticking out of the garage door at the home place of residence, which, according to them are connected to the rest of the dead body of a woman who is supposed to give them money. They worry, and instead contact the police and tell them the truth, they do like to escape from the place, who plan to be framed for murder. The rest of the characters in the film are found on a train before, and hang around Monte Carlo gambling resort doing different things in order to be involved in the story. Other actors include character actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. After the police learned of the death, they start questioning the main characters and, of course, they need to work through their stupid lies, to find out what really happened. None of the actors of the nature mentioned earlier can bring this film because of its mediocre condition, despite some funny moments mainly provided by Belushi / Shepherd Wed. It's not a terrible film, it's just not as good. There are a lot of average films there, and it's just one more to the pile. Try it, you might like it probably will not.
