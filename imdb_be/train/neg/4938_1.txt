The cave was the biggest load of crap I have ever wasted my time watching. This show is based on the GEICO commercials less interesting, the actual 30-second ad for Geico. Makeup was half-ass edami, to put it mildly, it is difficult to imagine a cave with the prefect white teeth, even after going to the dentist. This show could have been potential for a fun series, when they could have got a cast in commercials that it make itself filthy show. Perhaps, if the authors were the same from the Geico ads it may have been a chance, and the pilot did not have a good storyline. I give this show 1 out of 10, I would have liked to put a zero to 10, but this is not an option. I pray for a quick death in the show, I'd give it at least 5 episodes, before he dies, that he deserved death.
