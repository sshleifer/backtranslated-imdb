As I and my other half large garbage horror fans, we could not resist to enter the film, which contained two large, we were thrilled! However, for the film in 2004 with a cover strip off Freddy vs. Jason this outrage! The worst film I've ever seen, but it is necessary to look at the laughter, if you're able to sit through it! <br /> <br /> action awful effects ... well, I could have done better on my video camera in fact it is so bad, they only bothered to put makeup on the faces of zombies and have not installed the neck, hands, etc. NO storyline, strange memories that make no sense and awesome script! <br /> <br /> "You broke my tooth!" from one vampire "you broke my cigar" was the answer from the man, who looked like Uncle Jesse from the Dukes crossed with Santa!
