If Richie first burst on the scene of the film, his films have been regarded as a funny, witty, well-directed and original. If you could compare the hype he generated with his first two attempts and almost universal aversion to his last two outings have created one worth considering - Ritchie has been found? Is he really that talented? Is it any true original ideas? Or is it just pretentious and selfish filmmaker who really wants to be Fincher, Tarantino and Leon all rolled into one enormous and unorganized heap? After watching Revolver one can be forgiven for thinking it was all go wrong? What happened to his great sense of humor? How did he all of these mixed and confusing ideas? Revolver is trying to be smart, philosophical and concise, he tries to be intelligent analysis, he tries to be a difficult and complex thriller. Richite makes a huge effort to fulfill all these multiple tasks and investing large chunks of script in the existential reflections and many plot twists. However, in the end it all is to build a strictly awkward, unstructured and ultimately unfriendly film to the audience. His plagiarism is so sinful and scandalous that, although Richie does at least attempt to give her back, he must be punished for even trying to pass it in its work. So that the public receives is ultimately a terrible script intertwines with many pretentious and clumsy oneliners setpieces. <br /> <br /> Revolver, eventually stereotyped and soft film that stole countless threads of the masterpieces like Fight Club, Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects. It aims high, but inevitably many arrows blank. <br /> <br /> Revolver deserves to be abuses, it is really poor masking film as a masterpiece of wannabe wannabe filmmaker. However, it falls flat on his face slapstick and simply fails in everything he wants to be and achieve.
