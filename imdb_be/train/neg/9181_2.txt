I usually try to be a professional and constructive when I criticize movies, but my God !!! It was the worst movie I have ever seen. Bad action bad effects, bad script, bad! <br /> <br /> The story follows a group of teenagers on a cliche way to rave (what is happening in broad daylight) on a remote island. However, if the group comes, they all find an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the other party-goers, on the set of the clan on a mission through the zombie infested forests. During this campaign, they helped the police chick and sea captain, who just happens to have the right amount of weapons, to give each of the children. In addition, they meet with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors. Basically, the rest of the film is a collection of sequences poorly directed action, including an overly long gunfight outside the "house of the dead." This fight was applied cheese Hollywood violence, backed clips with video and inaccurate HotD matrix-esque camera rotations. One of the volunteers even characters to sacrifice themselves to save others. Why? Not because he was a noble and brave, but because of his people got scars acid zombies spit on him after he went on to beat the creature long after it has been disconnected! I have to feel sorry for this guy?!? <br /> <br /> In summary, there is absolutely no point to this film, if you do not want to see for myself how terrible it is. The theater I was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure that the money that I'm not used to see this piece of shit can easily cover the expenses it took to do it. GRADE: F
