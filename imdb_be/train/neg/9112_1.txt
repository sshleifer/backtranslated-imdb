In principle, Brutal 2 Brutal 1 is, again, just poorly done. History is the same as the first one (even some of the lines), with a few exceptions. Cast more unknown, and certainly less talented. Instead of being seductive and pulls me into watching it, I end up feeling dirty, because it compares the viewing soft-core porn. I'm not sure whether to blame some stupid line on the actors or writers ... and I always feel bad saying that because I know how difficult it is to do it as ..., but it was mostly a waste of my two-hour life. He just amazes me that some films get made, and this is no exception ... I can not believe that they make the third.
