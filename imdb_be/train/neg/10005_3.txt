A second attempt to intellectual New York in less than 10 years to make the "Swedish" film - the first of which Susan Sontag "brother Charles" (which was made in Sweden, with Swedish actors, no less!) Results? Oscar Wilde said it best, referring to Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop": "You could have a heart of stone not to laugh at the death of Little Nellie." Pretty much the same here. "Interiors" full solemnly sang Pearl. ( "I'm afraid of my anger." Looking into the distance, "I do not like who I'm becoming") Director's quote (to use a polite term) from Bergman's close to parody. Incredibly own family involved to constantly remind us of how brilliant and talented they are, until suffocation. ( "I read your poem the other day it was in -. I do not know -. The New Yorker» «It was about an old poem I reworked it" ...) Not taking care of them, however, I found it a lot of fun . Much of the dialogue is just as ridiculous things early Elena movie - only he sent his actor to play in a straight line. Having not throw in the film, he has a poor Mary Beth Hurt copy all his theatrical tics, intonations and neurotic habits, making it a substitute for the faulty (as well as Kenneth Branagh in "Celebrity"). <br /> <br /> the main story - problem family of quietly domineering mother - appears to rise more or less from Bergman "Winter Light" core family melodrama deceived with a lot of existential angst. All of this comes through in the banal visual / aural tricks: the deafening creaking pencil on paper, towering surf, dwarfing the people walking on the beach. etc., etc. <br /> <br /> Later «sereznye» Allen movies less awkward, but much less interesting. I'll take «Interiors». Woody rarely funny movie.
