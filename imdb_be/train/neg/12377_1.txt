Just because someone is under the age of 10 years does not mean that they are stupid. If your child loves this film, you'd better have his / her test. I always wonder how so many people can be involved in something that turns out badly. This "film" is a showcase for digital wizardry and nothing else. reverse compilation. I can not remember when I heard such bad dialogue. Songs for lamentable. Acts subpar but the actors did not get much. Who decided to use Joey Fatone? He can not sing, and it's ugly as sin. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is evidence of this. It is as if the authors went out of their way to make it all as absurd as possible. Large children's films are evil, smart and full of wit - films like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years, Willy Wonka and the Witch to mention two of the past. But the continuous dumbing down American flock over dreck like Finding Nemo (yes, that's for sure), the recent Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and debris crossing eyes, like Little Red Riding Hood.
