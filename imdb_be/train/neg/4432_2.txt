Auntie Danielle all about creepy old witch, who torments her, who love and not paying attention to the family of pure malice. There's a bit of subtext that could be France's colonial past, but it's basically just Danielle doing different things (for example, deliberately broke a small child in the park), which soon people gaining their teeth broken fingers. Unfortunately, this is not happening. It looks good and acts in order, and there's nothing really wrong with the concept, but it's just so smug. God does love this film. It is a pity that it was not so clever or funny as he thinks it is. The only incentive in the show - I'm sorry, cinema - going by Danielle getting nastier and nastier and the only surprise comes from viewing all the more incredible ways she does it. That's right: just as in a comedy, which is what it is, with the addition of "bonus" delusions of grandeur, and 110 minutes of running time.
