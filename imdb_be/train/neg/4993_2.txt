Went to watch this movie without waiting for "nothing really much" action flick, there are still very disappointed. The opening scene has promised little action with a touch of comedy. It keeps you hooked for the first half of Soga so, what do you expect, it is now time for action, to die. Well, nothing like this happens. The film drags and ending just thumps you to such an extent that you get what annoyed.Wonder was the director thinking. It does not make sense watsoever. The film is not enough in all aspects, there was no real story line, and it seemed a very hollow, even if the "Rambo" was in it, I do not think he could help the rating at all. There's just no logic in the movie. An ideal way to spend your time and money. By far the most annoying movie I've ever seen, and I'm sure there will be others who will have the same point of view, having gone through it. Definitely not for people who have little sense of film left in them.
