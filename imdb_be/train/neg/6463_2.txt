I watched the free money last night and it was the longest 90+ minutes of my life. With such an intriguing cast, I really thought I was in for a treat - especially since I'm a fan of Brando. Wrong! Which is a waste of talent. It's almost embarrassing to watch at times (eg, cattle before the stage), and there were so many missed opportunities for humorous installations (why do not they show the character of Charlie Sheen is going to return to the tow truck Brando?) Ugh. He's trying to be a cheap farce, but I just did not buy it. Skip this one. Only Brando fans. <br /> <br /> I give it 2 out of 10, because I still think the worst film ever made was Skidoo.
