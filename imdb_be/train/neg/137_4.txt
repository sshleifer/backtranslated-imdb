It is clear to see why the filmmakers found Scary so easy to fake these films "teen slasher". They are so incredibly formulaic. And if Valentine was released in a year or so ago, I'm sure they would be spoofing the film as well - that if they found any actual source material, to distinguish him from crying, I know what you did last summer and Urban legends. <br /> <br /> Valentine does not offer anything new to the genre, except that rather than the usual finale, which, of course, leaves plenty of room for the inevitable continuation. As always, masked psychotic killer stalking a bunch of beautiful young women, killing one of the hero, one after the other, in a typical over the top style. Lots of T & A on the display entirely the nature of development, poor acting and overly complex bloodshed. <br /> <br /> What I can not tolerate this kind of movie is that they present themselves as "who made his? ". The fact that they do not because the motive is revealed only after a killer unmasked, and tells the protagonist, who is now friends were all killed. Usually what has been done is not clear at the time of the film in any way (fishing partner, his mother's uncle, for example, the main character in his father pushed the dog into another). Still remained alive throughout the film is a "suspect", but they are more "Red Herring" rather than a suspect. As we all know, at this point the protagonist manages implausible escapes and kills a psycho killer unmasked after the motive is revealed. <br /> <br /> Valentine was this formula almost to the letter. *************** SPOILER !!!!!! (Mini spoiler anyway) *************** The Valentine motif was found, but more left for you to think that this film is not entirely enclosed in typical "teenager slash" way. The question is only solved part, and the purpose of leading killer may or may not be performed in living bloodshed and killing almost everyone. killer will want more, or demons were really defeated? <br /> <br /> This Valentine has not made a good movie, but instead he just saved him from as bad as usual, that is still not considered for the Shema . To anyone thinking of doing another film in these areas, please do not. Originality is so important, and it is difficult to see any originality comes from this genre.
