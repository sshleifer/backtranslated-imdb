This terrible film collects every Asian stereotype you can imagine, in one disgusting package. Money to dig, sophisticated Japanese businessmen send goofy but loveable policeman Pat Morita restore industrial secrets in Detroit. Here he meets down on the heels of Jay Leno, who immediately relates to the murder victim as Jap and calls Morita Tojo. This is all getting worse.
