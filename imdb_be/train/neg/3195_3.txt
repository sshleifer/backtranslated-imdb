Two qualifying right in front: I actually think Joe Don Baker can be good or even great right material and the right director ( "Cape Fear" remake, a small role in "Goldeneye", "walking"). And I even loved the Baker in "Mitchell," because it plays an anti-hero who was supposed to be unsympathetic. So, MST3K coverage was gay, but they took a lot of cheap shots at Baker - that he did not deserve - to keep things lively and interesting - it was a match the level and tone of the film, and it was the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> «Final Justice», seems to be more of the same, but, in spite of the exotic locations and "cowboy lynching" theme, it is quite a bit weaker than the "Mitchell", and the main reason is that the nature of Baker, as it is written, you idiot. The film has a self-esteem that, since Baker personifies the old style border courage, he challenges his opponent the old style of Mano-a-Mano quickly hood competitions. And because it is so tough and macho, he always wins, even if he is injured, wounded, superior, etc. <br /> <br /> This conceit with great potential (he worked for Gary Cooper), even if he condemns the film on «B» status of the film. But Baker is so frigging stupid and Obsessive he needlessly puts three protégé bad guy to a showdown in the public market, with civilians everywhere. He could just shadowing them in the headquarters of the main bad guy (which is why he went after them in the first place), and they would never have noticed. Or he could get a drop on them and forced them to surrender, and was one of the henchmen to take him to the headquarters of the barrel of a gun. But no, it has to be bush league hotdog and a macho fool, and so he gets the child is taken as a hostage in the ensuing shootout! <br /> <br /> This is the guy, we have to admire? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is basically like this. Most of the supporting cast somewhere between kami (protégés) to very good (especially the bad guys, and his parents, two well-known European actors - they just go through the motions, but they have their own pros and even replay it as they're appropriate). But through it all, the nature of the Baker pulling stupid stunts overhead and errors that are at least two relatively innocent people were killed, plus a couple of bad guys that may have been taken alive without the use of the death forces. <br /> <br /> on the positive side, as 90% of the film is established in Malta or in the Mediterranean Sea, you will get to see a lot of beautiful scenery and a lot of nice and exotic-looking extras. Indeed, myself Baker can be congested and a little dyspeptic, but it is not so bad ... of course, not a tub o 'lard, this movie criticism (including Mike and Boat veselome they cover), seems to think. <br /> <br /> In short, this film is good for video wallpaper, but the viewer does not pay attention to it.
