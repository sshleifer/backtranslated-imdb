My friend took this one; in Southern Born and raised African American I found the plot of this movie and the room is completely without credibility. In order to believe that class and racial prejudice would have been so easy and comfortable to be suspended only come from someone completely unfamiliar with antom Bellum South. Absurd !!! I wonder how they got a good actor Harvey Keitel, and a good actress Andy McDowell (who, being the southern knows best), to participate in this shit
