I have noticed that the previous reviewer (who seems to be back in school), gave this film a good review, and I can only assume that this is because the referee did not see far higher in 1989 BBC adaptation of the classic novel. The main problem I had with this (1999) version was casting Anthony Way Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented boy treble, made famous after appearing in the TV miniseries "Chorus". I can only assume that he was cast in the role of Tom Long on the strength of its highest operating in the "Chorus". Unfortunately, a little boy appeared in the "Chorus" has grown into a tall and lanky youth at the time, "Tom North Garden" was filmed, and as such does not Anthony convinces as students Tom. It's too far a stretch to believe that Tom (as played by Anthony) will be friends with a much smaller Hattie. In 1989 BBC version of Tom and Hattie much closer in age and development of their friendship so much more believable. For the 1999 film, even the special effects are not convincing and not a marked improvement on the one thousand nine hundred eighty-nine television effects. Casting, and this version gives an earlier adaptation, and all in all the film version was the lack luster true classic. As a final observation I would like to note that VHS in 1989 BBC version receives over £ 20,00 second hand while the new DVD this version can be bought for under £ 5,00, say more?
