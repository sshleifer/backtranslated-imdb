Firstly, I would like to point out that while I am not an expert, as the trial was treated with insult your intelligence. First, the prosecution had not proved that "facilitated learning" actually works. Irresponsible for prosecution (because they can get a refund) and the protection does not act on it. According to another commentator, he has facilitated the training has been proven untrue. Second, they used Terry as a translator, who has a personal interest, and will even testify in court, that's just stupid. If the court allowed him to give testimony in a manner that they brought in someone neutral otherwise they would just ask for an appeal. Third, this child never asked specific questions to the defendant by the prosecution (moles, event details, and so on), and even the question of the protection of specific issues such as when he started, he could not answer. If it is not well-founded doubts, I do not know what a competent lawyer would have received an acquittal. <br /> <br /> As a result, he starts well with a vice to be the father of a child with autism, but the court makes this film is absolutely incredible.
