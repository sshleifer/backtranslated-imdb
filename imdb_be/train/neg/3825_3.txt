I saw this movie at the weekend, and while I was struck, as always with the beauty of the Church and polished film production, I left disappointed that this one fell so short, Sun informed the members of the investigator and leaving many unanswered questions. <, Br /> <br /> film 70 minutes of vignettes from the life of Joseph Smith. This is not true biopic, because there is no real coherent story. Most episodes Regarding Joseph to do good things, playing baseball, running and laughing with children, often in sloooow motion. What a great, simple people, the kind of guy that Joseph was, huh? Look at him out there beating carpets for his wife Emma. Well, howzbout carpet with his 33 wives plural ?? No mention at all is made not polygamy. Bright omission. <br /> <br /> And it is in these omissions, which will slow down the film. It provides too little information and critical thinking leaves viewers wondering WHY Joseph getting tarred and birds, why is he getting thrown in jail, and why, what the crowd wants to kill him? The culmination of the film is, of course, Joseph and Hyrum march to Carthage jail (passed by the United Nations Organization currently faces coming out of the doorways in Nava). But there is no mention of ever WHY did. Nothing about Smith suppressing newspaper Nawa interpreter and customized his press destroyed for its disclosure of the secret doctrine of polygamy. The viewer is left to wonder, or to assume that it's just a groundless persecution of the Church. No any of Joseph is not charged with treason for declaring martial law and call the police Nava. <br /> <br /> Of course, I certainly did not expect that this church is a film production to present a recent biography of Joseph Richard Bushman in the rough stone rolling, but I was surprised and stunned at how little substance was actually presented . <br /> <br /> and even worse than the material that was presented often inaccurate. Two examples popped out at me. First, the translation of the Book of Mormon. The film shows Joseph read directly from the gold plates in which two ring binder, which is actually the plates were hidden away from the scene. It is well known that Joseph did his translation, hiding his face in hat looking at the seer stone there. The second inaccuracy occurs in Carthage jail, where a crowd stormed the cells. Church history tells that Joseph was a six-shooter and even fired a few rounds before jumping out the window and giving a Masonic distress (as reported in the Times & Seasons). <br /> <br /> Maybe, showing the reality of a skirmish would broke the heart pulls the mood established filmmakers, but lowering it, they were wrong, and history could not show Joseph as he really is: a hand with a gun and able to defend itself . In fact, the film gives the impression that Joseph was a good guy, but a bit of a shy, that all was beaten, thrown in jail, and eventually killed in cold blood. He was far from it; Joseph was a disciplined and determined man who has experienced a lot of difficulties and struggle to bring to the end, in which he believed. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, but I know what's going on in it is cotton candy. Then get the meat and potatoes, reading a copy of the biography of Bushma Smith, rough stone rolling <br /> <br /> PS: Church production of films that do not have loans, but hardened eyes can choose a pair of familiar faces. Rick Mace well as Joseph Smith, Sr. and Bruce Newbold, beloved, as Thomas in search of faith in Christ, plays a cranky Methodist minister who failed to show Christian love to the young seeker of Truth.
