Monster from Enemy Mine had somehow made his way to the small mountain community, where he settled. He hunts female doctor, who became a vigilante out to destroy it. This woman is a murderer, who looks like a refugee from a video Motley Crue, to ride a motorcycle and tries to save a bunch of kids who decided to have a weekend Big Chill right smack dab in the middle of the turf monster. Decapitation and a lot of blood, first of all, on the spot, to distract attention away from the story, which is limping along, like a bad version of the island of Dr. Moreau (and yes, it's worse than that, with Val Kilmer).
