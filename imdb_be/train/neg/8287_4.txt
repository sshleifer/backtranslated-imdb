This is a very short story version of the television, the film begins as an episode of "Xena ...", with little substantive dialogue or description of the character. It does get a little more meaningful over time, but all the characters are still cartoons. <br /> <br /> Salma this exotic beauty. Richard Harris is an evil and sexually repressed Frollo, fiending bust a nut up in Salma. The other characters, including Quasimodo pretty forgettable. <br /> <br /> It is also Grade liberal version of history, Frollo is a suppressor of the ideals of the Enlightenment, as the abbot in "The Name of the Rose" and Quasimodo is a champion of freedom. The dark side of the nature of quasi-linear ignored, although he pour the liquid in charge of people. He really just an outsider is that he looks different and loves to play with bells more than the average person. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the film is intended for children, but I doubt it, considering the bloody cuts Frollo himself to change the desire to spank my monkey. For the most part, uninteresting and forgettable, but not terrible, and sometimes entertaining, color rendering tales.
