this movie was pretty good sounding plot, but the pasta was very slowly ... very slowly indeed. even if someone thinks that it is a cult classic, I think there are much better movies of the era, to be signed. <br /> <br /> Film entirely fine, but not the worst either. OK sounds. OK lights. <br /> <br /> I still would not recommend it to someone else, than, perhaps, a film-student. <br /> <br /> film contains no music, and the horse having sex don "t do anything good friend. and a woman masturbating on the bed was just plain stupid. <br /> <br /> no gain here, do not miss this fierce boredom. I've seen worse, believe me, but it's just a waste of time, and I did not get good reviews here. especially high ratings ...
