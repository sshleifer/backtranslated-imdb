I was never sure where this thing is going. These people seem to be interested in what is happening on any mountain. They explore, have narrow escape, leave, return, leave, put each one in danger of sleepwalking, attacked witches with successive cabinets, etc., etc. The guy seems like a girl, but leaves it unprotected many times, it gets removed, he gets her back, leaving her again. You get the point. All this seems to bypass some of the victim, I think, but I'm not sure, turning people into witches, but I'm not sure. It's just boring and endlessly, and not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the print is so bad that the days when twenty seconds of blackness is not unusual. Does it depend on age or excessive nocturnal filters.
