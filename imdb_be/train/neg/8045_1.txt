I'm so confused. What was the movie about the world? Which was the motivation killer? He seemed very angry, but I still have to understand why. Nothing in this film did not make sense. He had zero depth. Or less than zero depth. What I think would have made it up the hill. Or a bunch. With the shit. The acting was terrible. When I was looking for some of the actors in this film, they were very few things that I have heard, and that was not surprising. I can not decide whether to feel sorry for them because of embarrassment to be in the film is bad, or feel that they should never be offered another acting job again. Starting. ,, NOW! (Seinfeld reference.) In fact, however, do not waste your time with this. There is so little substance, that there is nothing there even just to make fun. This is undoubtedly one of the worst slasher clicks - no, one of the worst clicks ANY that I have ever had the misfortune to watch, and I've seen a lot.
