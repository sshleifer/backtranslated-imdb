There is a bit of a spoiler below, which may spoil the surprise ONE unexpected and really funny scenes in this film. There is also information about the first film in the series. <br /> <br /> I caught this movie on DVD, which someone gave as a gift to his roommate. He came as a set with the first film in the series «Blind Dead». <br /> <br /> This film was, of course, much worse than the first, «La Noche del Terror that." In addition, many of the features of the first film have been significantly altered. To boot, the film was dubbed in English (the first was the subtitle), which I tend to find distracting. <br /> <br /> The concept of the series is the fact that in the distant past of the local branch of the Templars were involved in heinous and secret rituals. Upon detection of these crimes, the local peasantry put Templars death so that more can not be used by their eye, thereby preventing their return from hell to recover their place. Then we get to the present, where, due to some events, the Templars arise from the dead to exact their revenge on the villagers, whose ancestors have spoiled them first. Of course, since revived the Knights do not have eyes, they can only find their victims when they make some noise. <br /> <br /> The Templars were a secretive order of about the 12th century, leaving the Crusades. They were only around for about 150 years before they were suppressed in the early 1300s by Pope and others. Because they were secretive, there have always been rumors about their rituals, in particular, to initiate. In addition, because of the way society is organized, you do not necessarily church officials oversee that mean that they do not have inside a person when things heat up. And, because of the nature of their trials, they were subjected to torture in confessions. The order was strongest in France, but there is in Portugal and Spain, where the films take place. <br /> <br /> If the first film was a virgin sacrifice and knights drank the blood directly from the Virgin of the body (chest shots here, of course, is a horror film after all), and then, when the Knights back to life, they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood; in this sequel, it all disappears. You still have the same scene (redone, not the same as frames) are virgin sacrifices, but they drain the blood in the bowl and drink from it. Thus, when they come back, they just chop people with their swords or claw of people to death, I have to say, it is far less effective in interfering with your audience. There's also the problem of time: in the first one dating much closer to the Templars, where here now they say it is the 500th anniversary of the peasants burning these guys are on the map, which dates it around 1473 and how the Templars lost their eyes are much less interesting. Firstly, they have their pecked out by crows. Now they just burned, and in such a ridiculous manner. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah, and maybe it was just me, but it seemed to be a lot of people from the first film being in this movie (even though he died). Nya really a problem, since the film completely different and not a sequel in the sense of continuing, but no less odd. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film is a rich man who uses a child to distract the undead while he takes a break in a jeep. The child's father has deceived this rich man in attempts to get a jeep, so he goes out and tells her to find his father. He comes out of the blue a few, and easy to funny scene in the movie. Of course, why the child does not die at that moment me and frustrating for horror fans. <br /> <br /> I could not recommend this film to anyone. It's not so bad that it becomes ridiculous, so it's just ends up being a mediocre horror film. The main part of the film has a few people are hiding in the church, all of which make various attempts alone to avoid the blind Dead, that their environment. When the movie ends, you are not surprised by the outcome for all; in fact, very disappointed. If you see the novelty of the Spanish horror film, see the first film, which at least has some innovative ideas and not as the expected results.
