Frankly, Omega Code worst film I've seen in a very long time. During the first 30 minutes I sat stunned in his chair, trying to decide if I should demand a refund. But since I did not pay to see it in the first place (passes), I figured I might as well stay. And I do not think it could be worse. <br /> <br /> He did. I quickly run low points (includes some spoilers): The terrible miscasting with Wang Ding like Gillen Lane, a motivational speaker with two PhDs. Feature does not match; for example, Lane, despite its credentials is complete jerk. Then there is the image of a lame performance of Bible prophecy; we see a bunch of breaking news Soundbites accompanied by funny computer printouts translated the Bible Code. In addition, the terrible "action" sequence: Lane escapes from difficult situations without giving a reason, and one lane times in fact, seems to be in danger, it is a dream sequence! That's nice for grammar writing assignments, but it is inexcusable plot device in the movie. Walk was bad: after a long knife, the first third of the film scene changes every 90 seconds. Later, Shagan improving, but still too many unnecessary jumps around. And as someone said, the year did not go so far not one (not even the young daughter of Lane) ages. It's embarrassing. <br /> <br /> There are some good things though. film quality (eg, the absence of grain) is high and very attractive. Open shots were well done and the place shooting added realism touch. In addition, there are a few points in the last part of the film, when Lane calls God (eventually) to help him - it was pretty exciting - even for me, someone who does not accept Jesus as their personal savior. But I liked it because it struck me as the only real scene in the film. Unfortunately, a large incomprehensibility followed. <br /> <br /> characters, dialogue, direction and actions were all badly done. Michael Ironside has nothing to do, and Michael York was just amazing. I think that the producers wanted to do too much; if the site has been stronger and more focused, and the characteristic of a more specific, the film would have been much better. <br /> <br /> In general, Omega Code disappointing. Definitely do not pay to see it. ** I give ten stars. <br /> <br />
