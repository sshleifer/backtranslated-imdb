"Look, I know that it can suck right now, but the pain is temporary, film is forever. What do you like now burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come. "?? Robert De Niro <br /> <br /> It was originally a film by Steven Spielberg, the director hires some writers to develop the script so that it no longer fits its theme. And so we have a family problem that threatens the rabid monster in the form of recently released from prison by Robert De Niro. Like "Jurassic Park", "Poltergeist" and "War of the Worlds", dysfunctional family group together to defeat the beast, the beast is the creation of his father, a lawyer, who was unable to defend De Niro during the trial. <br /> <br /> In a typical Spielberg fashion, the father kills the monster that undermines the family and then quickly released from their sins. Like Oskar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise, and almost every "daddy" figure in Spielberg land releases father father's duty as a bitter codes that Spielberg loves. <br /> <br /> But Spielberg finally gave up the picture, and the project was instead turned to Martin Scorsese, who at the time was looking to try their hand at a commercial rate. As a result, perhaps the worst film in Scorsese's filmography, and, ironically, his most illuminating. <br /> <br /> failures or misfires artist often very significant, revealing the inner workings of his art. If the story does not work, the characters do not connect or drawings does not burn, we are still a kind of inner core. It ?? carcass- the rest is the fact that the director of the movie. <br /> <br /> Currently, "Cape Fear" impersonal film, so that we find no thematic links with the rest of Scorsese's filmography ( "You have sacrificed me!" screams De Niro, but the movie theme of Catholic redemption a screen). making the film, however, expose a language depends on his filmography. See how the camera Scorsese frantically whipping back and forth as he approaches furiously on the door handles and windows in an attempt to stress and how it characters all loud and scream for your attention. But that ball u important to see how the film has no spatial sense. Showdown on the boat at the end of the film take place on the apparent sound stage, street parade and claustrophobia occurs within the broader context of the family and the house does not seem to exist anywhere in particular. there's just no geographical sense something in the film Scorsese has managed to remove the space, or create a spatial environment. <br /> <br /> the reason for this lies in the fact that Scorsese camera must always be connected, or closely tied to its central Persian azhu. In order to make the world around the character to understand that his camera should be focused on the character. Resnais can take you around the French Hotel, Wells and Hitchcock can dance you down the street and up the building, Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic, Scott can restore all future cityscape, Lucas can give you someone else's desert planet, and most of the other directors can create a feeling of space on the textbook "close-up shot of the center of a wide shot" combination, but Scorsese could not do it. There's no poetry, no sense of physical space in his films. He's all about character. You break the chain, you leave that boxing ring that taxi, you look away from De Niro, and everything collapses. He just can not break away from this very documentary style of shooting, which is thus a prerequisite for action movies. <br /> <br /> Scorsese tried to correct this problem with "Gangs of New York", where space and sets become the central character, but even that is very consciously a spatial experiment gets sabotaged magnetism Daniel Day Lewis, actor image Scorsese camera inexorably to him like a butterfly to the bulb. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? Even as an ordinary B-movie, it's ugly, vulgar watching a movie. Look for matte paintings, clumsy attempts tension rotorscoped silly special effects and fake fist fight showdown. Nevertheless, we are with Robert De Niro, to pick up the slack. De Niro, who gives his body to Scorsese as a tattoo of Christ, gives the film its only big stage. In an impromptu romantic sequence in a young Juliette Lewis, he puts his finger in his mouth and kisses her. A kind of symbolic rape, the girl runs away, how excited and repelled by this man's interest. <br /> <br /> But De Niro's performance, so good i over the top, just can not be imitated by Scorsese. You must have been an opera and baroque visual tone of someone like De Palma, to make this work. But Scorsese? No. <br /> <br /> It is worth a viewing.
