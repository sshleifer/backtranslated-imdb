I would say that at least the film makes sense, but it's bad. Actions for the most part is not good (I think the only Sky showed any promise), and you feel uncomfortable to watch. All of the scenes to be really significant shallow, for example, if Ng comes to their parents. There are many sugary items, such as kanji tattoo on the shoulder of Skye, fridge magnets and girls god awful decor on the sets ... and the music ... and all clothes..and. Real life has never been like this movie. The boy said that at some point, "I'm gay, but not banal." And it is not known. Even in the terrible comments, I turned it off after Ng says that she was weirded out to play a lesbian.
