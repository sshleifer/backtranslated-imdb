Yes, I rated this film as one star is terrible. Nevertheless, it would be in my rotation of Christmas films from this time. It really is so bad it's good. This is another production K.Gordon Murray (read: buying really cheap / bad Mexican film spends zero money to get it translated into English and released it on the kiddie matinees in the mid-1960s). It's a shame, I came across this so late in life, as I'm sure some "improve your mood" would make it even better experience. I will not retell the fact that many of the other reviewers have said, a Christmas movie with Merlin, the devil, mechanical wind-deer and some of the most touching child actors I've ever seen bar none. I plan to continue this during the holidays back to back with Grammer «A Christmas Carol». Really I made the holiday experience in hell. Now that I can only find "To all a Goodnight (aka Slayride)» on DVD, I'll have a triple function that can not be beat. You should see this film. It moves so slowly that I defy you not to touch the button is particularly fast forward on two dance! This thing smells like an expensive Bleu cheese thinks you need to pass the stink enjoy the experience. Feliz Navidad amigos!
