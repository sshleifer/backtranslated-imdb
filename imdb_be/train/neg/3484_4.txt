I remember when it was in theaters, reviews said it was awful. Well, I do not think it was bad. It was interesting and had a lot of sarcastic humor on families during the holidays. <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck rich guy who has to find a family for Christmas, to please his girlfriend. He goes to visit the house he grew up in and makes a deal to rent the family there for Christmas. I really liked the scene where they sign a contract lawyer. It was interesting. <br /> <br /> So, it makes stupid family requests and even write scripts to read them. Of course, the family has a hot daughter's love interest. And he knows that holidays are not so bad. <br /> <br /> In addition, all dd act was funny, especially when they replaced the first with a black guy, and his parents friends are waiting for game "t even talk about it. And the part where dd beat on his "alleged daughter." Verdict: I thought it was worth checking out if you catch it on cable.
