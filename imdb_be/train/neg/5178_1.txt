I feel it is my duty as a fan of horror films to heat other people about this terrible and very very bad "horror" film. Do not waste your time and money on this film, acting is bad, the story of just one of the worst I have come across and the script was horrible. There was nothing good about it, you end up thinking why I watch this crap. The plot is so many holes in it, and they have never been cleaned at the end of the day, it was so bad, I do not know how a film can be made so scary. As I said before, I love horror movies and I was so let down, it was 18, but you do not see a bit of blood and are not afraid of jumping there at all. Besides the fact that annoyed me was how stupid it was in the film, which made no sense at all in the story, like brother and sister kissing, why? that's all I can say. Just do not worry, there is a much greater horror movies out there, just do not waste time on life is too short.
