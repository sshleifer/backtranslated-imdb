I appreciate the need to hire an unknown for this kind of "horror" films, but they should at least hire the right actor. Sergeant especially guilty of using his monotonous to a bulldozer every line he has. But let's face it, the line is not very important. There is not very well-known story, so a large part of the letter contains the word F ** K, S ** t, m ***** f **** t and other sort cursing instead of a proper dialogue. <br /> <br /> «History», as it mainly consists of a seemingly random blood and death, with a couple of decent creep "surprises" that take place around 10 minutes after you see exactly what will happen. Not only that, but there are some glaring plot holes and continuity errors (Why are they going there? Does not he have a gun, not whether he was dead?), So it makes the whole film seems as if it was cut down a few hours would be do to fix them. <br /> <br /> Another film that simply relies on blood and blood rather than any real cinematic experience.
