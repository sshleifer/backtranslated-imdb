In my Lit class, we just finished the book, Ax, and this film has nothing to do with the book. (1) Brian never ate worms in the book. (2) He did not know the name of the pilot. (3) His mother changed his father's station wagon is not in the forest, where everyone can see. (4) The man's mother cheating with no black hair, he was blond. <br /> <br /> Now the unreal part of the film: (1) thirteen years can not punch his fist through a window in one hit. <br /> <br /> And for the actions of a child who played Brian was a terrible actor. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that the scenery was spectacular, although I very much doubt that the director even read a book. <br /> <br /> This film is good, if you have not read the book, Ax, Gary Paulsen, but if you have, then start with a complaint to the director.
