Beating the bad guys ... Again, this is the tag line for the movie, he gives so much of the truth about it. <br /> <br /> One house one and two film classics. One home three and four, a good movie, if you three! As Sharkboy and Lavagirl, as hard as he's trying to be funny, it's not. Culkin replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else. He is very soft with soothing actor performances, but it is not his fault, writing called for mild language and soothing expression. Sinister simply copied from the first two with a variety of scams, and you'd have to be blind to think those real chicken pox. A good choice if you're an educator, which indicates the movie on a rainy day. And to make things worse, a completely different color, to see if you do not believe me, but you'll regret it.
