Just have a good horror movie about a beautiful suburban family business with the death of his parents and the "thing" in the basement, that they continue to feed the people they pick up from the street. Of course, there is more, it is, but to say more would be to talk. <br /> <br /> For me, it just did not fit, he is trying to have it two ways, both as a family drama and a horror movie. the film tries very hard to walk the cutting edge between the two genres, but it seems a stumbling everywhere, as he tries to be shocking, something he never really was. It does not help that the final revelation of less then stuffed "o" as in "Oh Thats it?". Maybe if I had not watched so many horror films in recent times it might be better, or it may have just seemed to because I would not have been compared him so much. <br /> <br /> I would take a pass
