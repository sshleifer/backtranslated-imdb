This film is pretty disgusting to begin with female future related and psychological torture. There's a man full of naked, dead parts of animals, dogs, licking nipples, woman loses bladder control. All shot in cold gray color. Effective, but a little too much. Then we move on to seeing the youth of the BTK killer, as well as the present and the history of his crimes. Tension is completely psychological and scenes killer entering the homes of their victims, and speak to them lasts for quite a long time, and it's scary. Here we see fantasy or good pictures, it looks as if shot from a camera in your home. It does not look terrible, but in a way that sees the offender to engage their victims for some time, before killing them is quite unusual and frightening. The fact that this film is not a drama, really. There are some police scene every once in a while, but there is no excitement in terms of finding the killer. There is not much to this story arc. This could be an effective psychological thriller, exploring the madness. Unfortunately, the film is filled with real massacre frames. It is dispersed throughout the film and comes suddenly again and again. Sometimes you do not know what it is and do not have enough time to look to the side. And I have to give. I'm all for a low-budget horror movies, but I do not tolerate the suffering of animals. It was unnecessary, excessive, and comes without warning. I am pleased that Lionsgate produces things that no one else does, but they had to go to this movie, or cut Gore animal. Stay away from this garbage.
