This sad movie bears little resemblance to 1971 Broadway, which was a "nostalgic" hit. Keep in mind that when Bert stir directed that revival, he rewrote the book widely. I have a feeling that this writer forged as many changes from the original 1925 version. I played an "innocent philanderer" Jimmy Smith on the scene in 1974, and thought it was $ 1 DVD will bring back memories. Not a chance. Even the expected pleasure to see "Topper" Roland Young to play "my" part was a big disappointment. Three songs from the play remains, and done very badly. Even the classic duet "Tea for Two", made as a virtual solo. Many familiar faces in the 1940 debacle do themselves proud at all, and the star, Anna Neagle, simply drive themselves. If I feel gypped, I spend a dollar, I know that the film has to be bad. Another commenter mentioned version of Doris Day, which is actually called the «Tea For Two», and on the implementation stage of the game (the original, of course), so that those who are looking for a real "No No Nanette" could find a well-known option is.
