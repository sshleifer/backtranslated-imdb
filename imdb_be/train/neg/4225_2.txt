This movie is another in the line of Christian Agitfilm The Omega Code. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, but the fact that most of the propaganda films sacrificing sincerity and realism they want to deliver the message. If you like the foam life on the streets and how the gospel can change lives, than perhaps you may enjoy this film. I say save your money and rent Cross and the Switchblade, or mission. If Christian leaders know that sometimes people say bad words? It was unpleasant to see criminals drew, who are not allowed to curse (to? Criminals say bad words?) And flat characters, I did not really relevant. In addition, it would be great if the film showed some T & A. Now that would be something that I would pay to see. Who was the idiot who compared it to the sacrament of the finest history of cinema with The Boondock Saints and Sting?
