This should certainly be the worst movie I've seen in the last 20 years. When I saw that Michael Madsen was in it, I realized that it might not be too bad movie as it was in some pretty decent movies, and he was pretty fair actor. Wrong! Nobody should spend their time on this movie. I quickly crossed the 80 per cent, and I do not feel like I missed a thing.
