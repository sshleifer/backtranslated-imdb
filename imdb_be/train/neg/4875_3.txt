My grandmother took me and my sister to see this film when it was released in 1998, and therefore we are pleased to have purchased tickets, popcorn and soda, and went straight to the theater and sat down to watch a movie. When it was over, the audience did not applaud much, I remember that I heard some people say that they do not like it at all, I do not like it, I thought it was pretty stupid and not worth seeing. Eddie Murphy was hysterical in it, but, apart from him, the whole movie was bad, I rarely laugh at parts of it, I also thought that other people in the theater almost almost laughed. And what I really thought that it was bad to make animals talk because talking animals exist only in cartoons, in live-action films, they are completely dog! I said that, in addition to hysterical twist Eddie Murphy, he brings this film is not worth watching, it's pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> I saw Eddie Murphy in several films, and I thought that it was ridiculous to those I have just said that he was the only fun part of this film, I have not seen Eddie Murphy really "big" film The Adventures of Pluto Nash. This film is not a film that I highly recommend that you see, because apart from Eddie Murphy, you're probably not going to like, especially because of the great in talking animals in it! <br /> <br /> I will give this film is rated 3 stars out of 10 stars.
