And maybe, like Fred Sanford said, "One of my lips." This is for those who released the film on an unsuspecting public. And, perhaps, a man in "Rue Morgue", who called it "the Fender Hellbender" and said that it was good. <br /> <br /> Five young girls, apparently taking cut home from a football game high school, get lost and stop to ask directions in some little shop in the middle of nowhere. While the driver accidentally gets into a parked SUV and knocks the spotlight, but the girls all decided to just leave and not have to go to find the driver. But the driver comes to find them, and it's not only that the headlights on her car got dinged, it is for another reason that women still do not understand. If the driver makes the first catch them it (yes, it is) waving a gun shot and making them undress, and continues to yell at them, "How many did you see?". Of course, the girls are scared to death and did not know what she says. <br /> <br /> In the night rolls on the girls end up in a cat-and-mouse game with the SUV driver, who manages cause injuries of varying severity on girls that are surprisingly resistant to shot gun blasts and screwdrivers, where they do not want them. In the end, they come to find something that happened back in the store after they are gone, that is the cause of psychotic rage of this woman. And in the end, they have a chance to take revenge and take it how they can go. <br /> <br /> There are elements of the film that are very disturbing and frightening, but, unfortunately, those moments that undermine the bad acting, bad dialogue, and huge gaps in credibility. One girl was hit by a shot gun blast and seems mortally wounded, and she felt cold, her life passed before her eyes, but it became better? And how far can a mini-van to work on a nearly empty gas tank at a speed of 80 miles per hour? I need one of those things that, perhaps, receives a large distance. <br /> <br /> There must be the end, when the girls got their revenge, but the film continues for some time after that, that is an anti climax, but they at least learn some of what set off a woman and the driver is still worried about "messing up the van of her mother," which is obviously the least of anyone's efforts. <br /> <br /> So it ISN "t the worst film I've seen, but it is too amateurish to be a good and a little too scary and bloody at times downright awful. But this cake to take a lot of shrill hysteria, and you want to put the two through your ears, if you look at it. Which, incidentally, I do not necessarily recommend it. 4 10.
