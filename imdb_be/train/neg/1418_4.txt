I do not know why this behavior was ever allowed in the movie business! This film (short) is a gross (to say the least)! This is a bunch of 5-7-year-olds wear diapers with large bobby pins, acting as adults (and too much of it!). Nevertheless, it is interesting because it is a good example of how the "good old days" may not have been so good in the end! (Thank God, we have laws against this kind of stuff right now!) <br /> <br /> {This is one short of the "Shirley Temple Festival"}
