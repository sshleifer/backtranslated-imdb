I do not know who wrote the script for this film, but from the first moment I was annoyed. Of all the possible solutions that they could do in the mountains, why did they decide which is the most dangerous of them all? Why criminals are dumb, but they managed to get a huge amount of money from the bank and get away with it? Why is not the main culprit land a helicopter, shoot Stallone, take the money and fly away with a chick as a hostage? And there are still cases of illogical behavior. I would give this movie 5 points for good performances and great landscape scenery, but because of the illogical behavior of the characters, I just can not give this movie 1 point ...
