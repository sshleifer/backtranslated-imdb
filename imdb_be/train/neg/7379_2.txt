Steven Seagal thinks? I mean, first of all, I love Segal. I love all his films until the mid-2000s. His early stuff is one of the best in the genre. This, however, did not live up to its beautiful name. Attack Power (the protagonist Marshall Lawson Segal {}) might be expected, it is pointless action film with Seagal in the typical form of One-Liner ass kicked. However, what we get is a crime mystery, which borders with the political thriller with little or any action. Seagal is always in the shadows because of their weight. I could not stick to the story. There are people that are mutated in superhumans, when they take medication. What happened in this movie. Dubbing Segal is a shame and disgrace to the slaughter. Why dub man? History horrible. This is a 2/10 from me because of a scene where Segal asks for backup, despite the army with him, and hilarious fight scene where Seagal waving his arms like a girl in front of the camera! "Revenge is a two-way street," Seagal says in this film ... well forget Steven revenge, you need to redemption!
