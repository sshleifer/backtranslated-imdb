Already his first requirement, that desire is always artificial, completely erroneous. <br /> <br /> When the Lord reject the witness gets its own documentary about the movie ?? or anything on the subject - it is time for those who get their own. Although far, far smarter than, say, Paris Hilton (I know, not too difficult) Zizek mouth spewing as much as stupid as her only other race. It combines the worst of both their professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are famous for offering convenient expert b * LLS *** osopher a lot of leeway to create unprovable theories, talk without beginning or end, and connect concepts almost by accident, in the course of incorrect use of the English language, creating a semantic mix only a mother could love. Example: There are three major Marx Brothers, so that the "big" idea, to connect them with the three levels of human consciousness, identity, ego and super-ego. I'm kind of surprised that he has not played a clip from «SNOWHITE» and draw an analogy between the seven dwarfs and seven levels Gahannah (Muslim hell). It's like the premise of Schumacher's "The Number 23": play with the numbers long enough, and you can come up with some ridiculous theory you want, even tying the ancient Greeks to the death <br /> <br /> Princess Di, however. there is an element of entertainment TPGTC: look ravings of a madman sweat like a pig, saying crazy singing disguised as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun. Why watch "Cuckoo's Nest", or any other Madhouse drama, when you can have Zizek more than 2 hours? It's like watching a train wreck funny. However, it is almost funny to one or two times. <br /> <br /> I have always been puzzled by people who are desperate to raise the movie-making in the sublime intellectual civics. Providing stupid movies like "The Birds" is a lot of thought, so this big loan, probably has your fat creator laughing in his grave. Untreated truth is that the vast majority of films has zero intellectual value, and the few of them who really have some intelligence does not require the shrinkage, which became a philosopher, to draw a map to understand them ?? if someone is not a complete idiot. Zizek see layers and layers of meaning in the mundane movies. Hallucinogenic drugs have to be very popular and cheap in Slovenia these days ... <br /> <br /> If Zizka showed a hole in the bath "Psycho" shower scene, I thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes; they drain the life out of the stars as well as a bath hole sucks blood Janet Lee. Or, perhaps, he might say, as the hole is the vagina Leia, with blood in it, and not (as in the period), then representing a kind of "smart (Zizekian) irony." Incidentally, the real irony is that if Hitchcock really put that much thought into each scene (and the script), his films would not have been unreasonable, frivolous crap that they frequent. The point of these holes bathtub analogy was to show how easy it is to improvise on the "hidden, deep meaning." And if you add a fantastic Zizek terminology from philosophy and psychology, cuttings of these terms at the top of these analogies as decoration of the wedding cake, you get unintelligible jumble that can instantly impress uneducated. - that is easily impressionable and gullible <br /> <br /> Zizek says the number of (unintentionally) funny things here, one of the most absurd ideas when it binds to clean Anthony Perkins in the bloody bathroom with a "fun job, a job well done ". Do not laugh ... Neither Hitchcock nor the author of "Psycho" would ever even remotely entertain the idea that Perkins may enjoy a job well done - cleaning the bloody toilet - at the time they were conceived / direction that scene . It's about to enter text in your (dead) in the mouth, but also in the context of distorting what the director had to "speak." <br /> <br /> I like the original idea Zizek on Tarkovsky stunning "the Solaris", but he has a rare ruining a good impression, dragging in the "anti-feminist" and other nonsense in his theory. <br /> <br /> Zizek attitude towards logic is that of the dog in relation to the plastic dice. "I just want to play with it all day!" Logic has its own rules, and should not be raped - at least not in public - like him. He seems to consider the logic, evidence, common sense and reason as enemies or simple toys are not suitable; concepts are either avoided, twisted to conform to the ultimate goal, or simply destroyed. Zizek LSD stumbled hippies, and all his favorite movies are his personal «2001» s <br /> <br /> The fact that Zizka overly focused on the two most overrated director. - and those whose films often lack of intelligence, if anything - such as Hitchcock and Lynch, only further reduce its already low credibility. I was surprised, De Palma is not more prominently; is another lame filmmaker who writes screenplays inept. Zizek has a field day with incomprehensible «Lost Highway» Lynch. There are just as many explanations of this film as there are people who watched it. <br /> <br /> Note Zizek, the viewer easily accepts ridiculous "innovative" physical setting Trier background in "Dogville" made me giggle. <br /> <br /> However, Zizka not only make up things as he goes forward, he indulges heavily in «Bleedin 'clear'. Like all "social scientists" (an oxymoron), he wraps his very banal "observation" in articular (when the full spitting), and sometimes complex language blankets Eventually, sociology operates exactly the same way:. This makes us believe that we hear something new, when in fact this is what we are all aware, but said eloquently - that fools more inattentive listener <br /> <br /.> I was half expecting to men in white suits, to all of a sudden appears out of nowhere and tie it in a Looney suit ... <br /> <br /> Slavoj Zizek: only a stalker in the park Deer near you. <br /> <br /> http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
