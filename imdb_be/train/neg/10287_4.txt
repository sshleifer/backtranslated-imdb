It is available on «Drive In Double Feature» by Dark Sky Films, and since I had just finished «Barracuda», I also watched. This film, which is an incredibly ambitious and inappropriate at the same time. <br /> <br /> We will start with the two young ladies, wandering the streets of a foreign city, but where are they? They stop to look at the necklace out of a Chinese manufacturer, and try on clothes in the Chinese style in the store, but we see some Aztec dancers? And all the time, these girls watching two guys who eventually quit all secrecy they do not have to chase the girls on a wild run, although the city, and they finally catch them. <br /> <br /> It seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around his neck, and these guys want to find prey, and where to get it? So, in his memoirs, we will be back to find out. And they learned that she had this coin? Hard to say, really. <br /> <br /> Now, back in the day when the two women were 10 years old, they went out with her sisters and friends of the sisters on the boat, and once stopped to get air into the tanks, they to haul the young boy back to his own dock, only to his grandfather to go out and invite "young" the UNS »herbal tea with her grandmother. But not all have tea, Todd returned to the boat to check on the young girls, and then, when they are away from it, the boat exploded, and when they return to the house of his friends mysteriously disappeared. Well, it seems that the "good folk" raise their own vegetables, but they are waiting for the meat to go for a spell, and serve herbal tea. <br /> <br /> But the girls, and Todd did leave the island, but now they are coming back, accompanied by their captors, and they are there to find the treasure, despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was before. There also seems that someone on the island, and thugs mysteriously begin to die, one by one, and since there are only three, it does not take much time. And there is even a sort of happy ending that will leave the audience every bit as confused as they were throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The two thugs seem to speed freak with problems of anger, and combined with no acting ability are borderline hilarious. Knotweed family type is also devoid of acting ability, despite the fact that his grandfather Hank Ward, who has appeared in many films and television shows. Action confusing locale even more confusing, and the island looks like in Southern California. <br /> <br /> So what the hell is this? I'm not sure, but it is definitely worth to see once, so you may think (or say), right? 4 out of 10, is very strange.
