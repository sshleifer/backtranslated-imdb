This is the absolute worst performance by Robert Duvall, who sounds just like William Buckley throughout the film. His unnatural melodramatic action takes away from any dramatic interest. I'm not sure if it was intentional or unintentional theft scene, but it's the only thing I can think of a really forgettable film. This picture should be shown in every amateur acting class example of what not to do. Thank God, Duval went on more and more things, and stopped trying to implement a cultural focus. He's a good actor character, but that's about it. Klaus is so much better. His speech muffled and deserves attention.
