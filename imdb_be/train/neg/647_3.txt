The acting was terrible, and the script. It was badly put together, and made almost want to laugh at some very played the murder scene. The ending was even worse. All died, but somehow the end made it look like everything was perfectly fine! They do not give enough stories about obsession teachers, etc. the film needs more time to possibly develop a storyline. The only reason I give it 3/10, I'm kind of feel bad for the young actors. They needed more coaching. They could have really made it KI film, but the script and the cast failed miserably.
