This film is simply not worth the time and money spent. Full clich√©s and plot that makes absolutely no sense! I can not believe that so many people gave this horrible film 10. My opinion is that they are puppets of the film producer. <br /> <br /> If I could give this film is zero, I would. Sorry, IMDb will not allow. <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched it because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it. What's sad that I have never had great expectations from this film to start, and yet I felt cheated. Honestly, do not waste your $ 8 on this piece of garbage. The only entertainment I came out of the film was to make fun of Directors name. In general, really do not recommend!
