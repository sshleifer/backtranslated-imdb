Jared Diamond made a point in the first episode as the other nations of the world were not tame animals, but the Europeans do, and that explains why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines. <br /> <br /> but in the third episode, he says, when the Europeans in South Africa got too far to the north, they ran to the Zulus and other tribes who grazed cattle and planted * culture *. So what explains their lack of technological, economic and artistic achievements, when they were the key moments, as the author claims, which are necessary for success? <br /> <br /> Diamond also claim in the form of smallpox germs (brought to the North American black slaves) were our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can win 20,000 native soldiers and 400 non-military South Africans can win 10,000 Zulu * * without a single accident in any case, I think you have to conclude that the embryos are irrelevant. With or without microbes, we want to succeed. <br /> <br /> He says malaria has stopped Europeans from colonize farther north, killing "thousands" of Europeans without affecting Africans. (I would like to know the actual numbers, but it does not say.) Then, in the end, he says, that today Malaria kills thousands of Africans, and that is why they can not catch up with us. So it's Jared? Malaria or help Africans stopping Eurpeans or hurt them? And how Europe did well despite the massive sores throughout our history? <br /> <br /> He also seems to try too hard to say that the reason, the Europeans succeeded was because of the stupid luck. Sometimes, when proof of danger he reluctantly admits to destroy his shaky theory that perhaps the Europeans were successful because they worked for him. It's sad to watch this obvious neo-Marxist to distort reality, to try to prove a point.
