I read James Hawes book. It was very neat, not great, but quite interesting. Without having read the book, I would not have had any idea of ​​what was going on, and it was still a stretch with this knowledge. <br /> <br /> Literally every element of this film plaintively ways I do not have the ability to describe. Half of the digested fish could do a better film with matches and dayglo lipstick. <br /> <br /> Never before or after, as the film made me feel so angry. Mattresses sequels came the closest, but even they have never reached such depths completely rotten annoying appallingness, that bilge made. <br /> <br /> So how to spend 90 minutes of my life, I witnessed this plague on the human form I am now unable to even look at any book by James Hawes, without feeling angry. That is, the depth of hatred I have for this part of sh * t. No, it's not fair. Let me apologize to all the feces to compare you with the other evils that Rancid Aluminum. <br /> <br /> Plain and simply cancer in the world of cinema.
