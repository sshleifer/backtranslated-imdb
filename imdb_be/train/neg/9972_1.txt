PROBLEM CHILD is one of the worst movies I've seen in the last decade! This is a bad movie about the wild boy adopted by two parents, but he gets into trouble later. It can drive a car, Jr.'s grandfather. It can scare people with the bear. He can put the room on fire! This is a bad movie as much as BATTLEFIELD EARTH. Continuation is an even worse fate. Rent instead of the chicken coop. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 **** with I give.
