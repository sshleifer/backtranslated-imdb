Sean Bean is great, as well as photos, locations and costumes. However, the plot is messy, and the conclusion of the flat. The site has been changed significantly from Cornwell novel, and not for the better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much better reading than watching. Sharpe was too narrow here, unlike his literary alter ego, which seems more reasonable and determined, despite concerns in its new role as an officer promoted from the ranks. I really enjoyed the short scene in which Sharpe stumbled on a "real" officer, and after a quick break, and piercing eyes, surprised and intimidated by pushing back the officer. He sets the tone for his further tests as commander <br /> <br /> Evaluation :. "4" to "10"
