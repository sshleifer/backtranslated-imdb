- a small time hood tricks local mafia boss of a lot of money. Of course, the mob boss wants his money back, no matter who he has to kill to get it. Punk recruits his old friend and a gangster, to help him save his life <br /> <br /> -. If it sounds funny, it is. The whole idea that it's wearing Izod, driving punk gods could keep one of the most powerful mob in Rome is just silly. His friend could be good with a gun, but he was against a group of trained killers. Old gangster little more than comic, and no real help when it comes to face off with the crowd. There's also a sub-plot about how a father was killed years ago, mafia boss, but there is little of it, and it does not help any film at all <br /> <br /> -. The mob boss, Mr. Scarface, played by Jack Palance. I believe that he got the name because it has what looks like a shaving nick on his cheek. Palance is ineffective, as the rest of the cast, doing what he needs to get <br /> <br /> salaries -. I have seen some pretty good Italian crime / police flicks lately, but Mr. Scarface is not one of them. Check Syndicate Sadists or Revolver instead.
