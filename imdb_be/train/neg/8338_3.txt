This film is very important, because that offered me this view: sometimes you may want to be patient ... sometimes you may wish to have the syndrome ... sometimes, for example, you may wish to have Goldfield Syndrome ... So you "I do not remember d this sad movie ... and, above all, you do not want to remember Adam« superfluos »Sandler ... sometimes, simply, you may wish ... rented another movie ... <br /> < br /> my voice? 3 out of 10. My suggestion? If you're not a fan of romantic comedies sad or Adam Sandler (this is a joke ... there is no fan of Adam Sandler ... I hope it is), save yourself ... Someone has to save? Drew Barrymore. ... possible.
