Well, first, if you finish the zombie Rebellion as some very early Night of the Living Dead (1968) -type film, forget about it. This is a "zombie" in a psychological sense, in which the term simply refers to someone who is not in control of their own will, but who should instead stick to the freedom of another. The "zombie" is as small as in the film, mostly metaphors state of subordination or authority in general, as well as in time of war. It is quite a stretch to call this a horror movie <br /> <br /> The film is set during World War I. A "French Cambodian" Contingent heard amazing stories about zombies -. Ostensibly Angkor Wat was built using zombies - and there are stories about the army of zombies is easy to overcome the enemy. Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) returns a priest who allegedly secret zombie knows, but he will not say. So Louque and international head of the military contingent in Angkor Wat archaeological expedition is designed to discover the secret of zombies and destroy the information before the zombies have a chance to "destroy the white race." <br /> <br /> One of the odd things about a zombie uprising, it seems, can be a writer / director Victor Halperin decided to change his game plan during the shooting script. The film begins as if it will investigate a zombie ~ d / military metaphor, and perhaps even has elements of adventure, but after about 15 minutes, he shifts gears and becomes a longer history of a love triangle. <br /> <br /> Halperin does stick with overtones of freedom and power (and Nietzsche's "will to power"). The film is interesting at this level, but the script and editing are very volatile. This is another older film for which I would not be surprised if there are no frames, the more that some scenes even fade or cut while the pronunciation of the character dialogue. <br /> <br /> Among the contrived romance stories, Halperin tries to keep referring to the zombie thread, but little zombie material has a lot of sense. Louque discovers the secret of zombies, but this does not mean for the viewer. Zombie material mechanics are vague and confusing ?? Halperin even resorts using overlay frames Bela Lugosi Googly one with its one thousand nine hundred thirty-two film, White Zombie, but never explains what it has to do with anything. There are large gaps in the story, including the love story. Prospective, interesting characters early reels disappear over a long period of time. One potential villain unceremoniously disposed of before he gets to do a lot of <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of the old creaky B movie, Rise of the zombies can be worth watching at least once. - not acting all that bad, and if you have a good idea, you can put together an interesting story in your mind to fill in all the gaps. But this is the second time I saw the film, with the first being only about five years ago, and I could hardly remember anything about it - so it's not exactly memorable.
