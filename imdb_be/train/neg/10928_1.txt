Just saw this movie, and it's a waste of time. The film was predictable and slow. It is basically a Mormon Bad News Bears, who play basketball sanctioned church. Instead of watching this film, I had a root canal. Cameo appearance is apparently due to sponsorship / funding. This film was the potential for outrageous behavior of the Mormon Church when they play basketball sanctioned, however, because it is a PG rating, the true nature of the spectacle can not be transferred to the film. Actions terrible except Clint Howard and Fred Willard. The emergence Tarlev Bailey in the film was completely unnecessary.
