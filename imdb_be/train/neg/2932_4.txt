Not that he is still, but I'm not a friend of Simon Pegg in. If I was, there's a good chance we would the fallout when he went on to make the waste as it is. The trouble is that he has found a successful formula, as a clumsy, ordinary type of guy a neighbor in Shaun of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run, etc. but it's starting to wear thin. Here, his character has no notable qualities, he is rude and insulting, and thinks he's funny, if it is not openly so. In the transition to New York from London (and I believe that this link is designed to appeal to audiences on both sides of the Atlantic), it is equally absurd with his new colleagues. However, it is not surprising if some of his merry japes he hires a transvestite stripper appears on the editorial meeting act of revenge for his boss. However, somehow, Kirsten Dunst starts to warm up to him, despite the fact that he did not do anything good. Yes, because it is a superficial man, he falls to the Megan Fox at first glance, perhaps because of its character as shallow as it is. All this makes for predictable conclusion of the film, although I can not see any viewer to express how it affects lives. Shame that on paper is supposedly cast worth watching. Pegg, however, Himself, Kirsten Dunst seems to just go, even though the movement, creating entirely on screen chemistry, and Megan Fox entirely stretched all. One huge plus Miriam Margolis, as New York hostess Pegg - now, if it was on the screen more .....
