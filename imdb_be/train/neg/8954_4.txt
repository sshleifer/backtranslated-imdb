I had high hopes for this film, because I enjoyed the book so much. However, I do not think I would have understood the premise of the film, when I have not yet read this book. The film is a noble attempt to show the desperation of people who are trying to destroy the communications to overcome the government's rules, but the book reflects the suffering much more carefully. Corrupt officials have a comfortable, almost luxurious life, while ordinary people struggle to get the bare necessities for survival. Perhaps most people feel that way their leaders and managers, regardless of whether or not they are in fact suppressed or repressed. dystopia Orwell, it seems as if it can exist in many places in our world today. It has been several years since I read the book, but one can hear references to Big Brother, Newspeak and the thought police are often in the media and casual conversation. Probably, many people use these terms do not understand where the terms came. I highly recommend you read the book.
