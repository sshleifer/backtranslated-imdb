I'm really looking forward to watching this that I love Danny Dyer, and I think that the talented actress Gillian Anderson. The start was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. He then moves quickly to the main plot, which they attack a group of strangers and Dyer hits a very bad while Anderson gets raped. Then they decided to go for some sort of revenge. Sounds good, does not it? Well, it's not. History becomes boring and side tracked, and some things get really strange. I will not give any details, but it happens that I, for one, have no desire to see. I would give all the films in the benefit of the doubt, and I really wanted to like this. It just does not work. I give it 3 out of 10, mainly for the action.
