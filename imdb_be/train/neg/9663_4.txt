How cynical are writers, so indulge. Maybe I'm an American citizen, but I do not want to see other Americans Pat each other on the back for half an hour to enjoy the film. I am surprised that so few have commented on how thoroughly leavened, sentimental and corny dialogue in this film really is. Historical inaccuracies of the film is not as rude and insulting as in Â«U-571" (changing British submarine to the US), but you still walk away feeling a little slippery. Indeed, the Germans in this film do nothing but fond of Americans between the battle scenes! How sad it is unnecessary! I just wanted to say a writer: it is obvious to many of us that you can not capture the real people with real problems under real pressure, and that you have made some very well proven shortcuts. Fortunately for you will always be nationalistic nutjobs to evaluate your sugar coating the rumen.
