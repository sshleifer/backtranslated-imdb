This film was physically painful to sit through, probably because (like many people my age and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss books, and loved it - funny, clever, whimsical and subversive at the same time. "The Cat in the Hat" sucks all the interest and sparks from the history and performance of Mike Mayer, like a cat mostly bewilderment. Why Borscht Belt accent, not funny patter, silly jokes, the unsightly suit? I had to go back and re-read the book to see the real problem: the book easy. This film is a bloated and way too long. <br /> <br /> You do not expect every child to be a movie Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but this one set a new low. Mike Myers may need the money?
