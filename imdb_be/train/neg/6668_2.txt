The longer the film came out and seemed tedious to follow forever more annoyed I became as quite frankly, it's a waste of time sitting through this nonsense. How on earth did people get to do films like this, to really get the financing for this rubbish? Do not be fooled by the relatively high rating on IMDb, as it only proves that you can fool some people all the time. And in this picture, the major players have an obsession with guns, so it's not difficult to work with as the film would eventually unfold. America can never understand what the rest of the world finds it strange, as a society in the United States has such a rude and fatal "gun culture". <br /> <br /> Either way: <br /> <br /> The leading actor reflects loser who escapes into a fantasy world, to be a cowboy in the urban sprawl.He comes across a family with two children, a spoiled child, a girl -padletak and boy; He took care of his father's strict parent who can barely cope. Cowboy seduced teen, or vice versa, and impressive boy, seemingly fainted lose. <br /> <br /> Cowboy spend all their time in a state of unreality and depression. . a total loser, who prefers to go to the beach, then to work for a living, and then commits a burglary at his family as he was too lazy to make money legally <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: < br /> <br /> who wants to look sad or failed loser in a fantasy world keeps a death wish, or even viewing a poor family, which is not really much better than the white trash? <br /> <br /> This film does not make sense. nonsense <br /> <br /> It's only saving yourself from getting the lowest level possible with a half listening to music to: <br /> <br /> 2/10.
