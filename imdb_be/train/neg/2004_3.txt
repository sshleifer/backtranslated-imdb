I read the book a long time ago and do not remember exactly the plot, but just remember that I liked. After all, I'm home sick on the couch, it seemed a good idea, and hey !! This Lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with unscrupulous actors and actresses B. <br /> <br /> The female cast directly from Desperate Housewives. I've never seen the show, but there are a lot of commercials for the show, and I get the gist. There is nothing more original? Of course, but not for life. <br /> <br /> The man cast all rather effeminate appearance and functions, but the girls have husbands I suppose. <br /> <br /> In one scene, a woman fighting with a man of her life, and what she was doing ??? She kicks him in the testicles. What else? Women love it, but let me tell you girls something ... It's not as easy as it's always watching. <br /> <br /> It was not all bad. I really got the chills once or twice, so I have to lend to someone with it.
