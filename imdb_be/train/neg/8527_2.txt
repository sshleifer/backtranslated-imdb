There are three films to this animation style, which I fondly remember from my youth. This film, «The Last Unicorn», «Flight of the Dragon" and "The Hobbit." I have copies of both "dragon" and "The Hobbit" (both excellent), and I have not seen "The Last Unicorn" in more than a decade. That was until today, and now I wish I had not. What bothers me most is the script. It was an incredibly volatile and often meaningless. Everything would happen without a cause, and other things will happen without explanation. We're not just talking about the little things here either; we talk about the key points of the story! The story itself is not that great to begin with, but it would work was the script was decent. Not even close. In addition, the music was awful! I know that the music in films such as this is rare, it can be called classical works, but the music in this film I wanted to knock himself unconscious with a bowling ball. It was one of those films that I was going to show your children someday, but it has just cut. I do not think I could sit through this crap festival again. Disappointed to say the least.
