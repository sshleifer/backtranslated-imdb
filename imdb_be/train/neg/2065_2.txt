I put it last night. Opening (2001) ran WAAAAAAAAAY too long. Hitchiker scene does not make sense. Some scenes were simply backward. I knew in advance, Chevy Chase was less than 2 minutes. No problem. Here's the best part: <br /> <br /> KOKO, Uranus, Babs commercial, Curtis Mayfield song <br /> <br /> Total: 7 minutes of good material with 75 minutes of the film <br /> <br /> Everything Else it was either unfunny and stupid as hell <br /> <br /> Let me give you some tips :. If you want the raw film substitution TV and movie rentals «Kentucky Fried Movie». If you want lower crude film substitution of television and film, the moon rolled "Amazon" or "D» <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not bother renting this movie. You'll save $ 2-3 <br / > <br /> IMHO best movie :. Ken Shapiro STILL "Modern problems"
