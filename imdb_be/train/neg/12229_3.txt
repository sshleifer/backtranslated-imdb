This film started well, I felt like I was watching an adult version of Seinfeld. Much quickly I began to question the situation and the actions of the main characters, and did not find an answer to why they do what they do. All the action was excellent, but a few scenes were brief moments when they were really funny. Dan Cortese was amazing. I loved him in this role. His agent has to show this film to the casting agents. See the first few scenes, and then find something better, otherwise you will find yourself completely lost in this mess. I found it in the bin in the video store. It cost me two dollars and because of the rarity of the film, I feel it was a good price.
