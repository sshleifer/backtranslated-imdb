By reading all these positive reviews, I find myself baffled. How is it that many use what I consider to be a very bad adaptation of my second favorite Jane Austen novel? There are many problems with the film, it has been mentioned in several reviews; Simply put, it is hammed up, over current, chintzy mess by the end of the opening credits butchered. <br /> <br /> While many of the characters properly cast and no Ewan McGregor, Toni Collette poses no performance that is worthy of them, the worst is by far Paltrow. I loved her performance in some roles, but here, it is disgusting - it is self-consciousness, nasal, stooping and is completely separate from his characters and those around her. Very disappointing effort - even though the perfect Emma could not save this film.
