I just watched this movie 15 minutes ago, and I still have no idea what I just watched. Basically, I think it's a film about the internet S & M "star" CDs that are just as realistic as Flash cartoons online. She killed someone, that leads to her sister and a crack team of two FBI agents to investigate the death. Local killing unit Big City, United States of America is also investigating, although much of his work is on the way oogling on CD ROM, which he claims are realistic "as the real thing." I know. Wow. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is the only film that has any credit for it. He's in the movie for about 15 minutes, and half of that is he pounded home Woman, seemingly no reason at all. I'm not even going to explain to the end, because, frankly, I can not do it myself. But before the final scene, we are treated to a 3 or 4 minute installation all in the film. Honestly, they could have run that then the final scene, and it would be the same effect with the transverse direction of the eyes and all. <br /> <br /> In general, stay away from this movie. I got it because I love bad films and I love Michael Madsen. I really could use that 80 minutes on something else and been more satisfied. They say that playing this game with a knife where you Jeb in his hand a few times. It is within 80 minutes will be much more interesting.
