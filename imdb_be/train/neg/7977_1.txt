Well, Jesus of Montreal mainly intelligent film. The actors are really good, and the technical side of the film in order. But, although I was very interested in this topic, and how to think and discuss about religion (I'm an atheist), it was difficult to force myself to watch a movie on a roller coaster and I think somehow unconsciously funny end. Why is this movie so incredibly sad? I do not know. It's easy and it is not recommended.
