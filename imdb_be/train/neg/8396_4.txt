... but I've seen better, too <br /> <br /> The story is predictable. - crew is trying to shoot a horror movie in the place where the murder occurred. Three guesses what is happening. This is not a complete bomb - the cast is pretty good with the pros, John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine, giving the best performances. It's quite well done - for the low-budget film. Just do not expect poverty, language, blood and gore (the film has a very mild PG rating). I've never been entirely bored - it's ok, view on a quiet night. I saw it on video - it was horrible print - very dark and some scenes can not be seen. However, I do not hate, and it has a cool finish that surprised me - basically nothing happens to until that time, so that catches you by surprise. Worth a look, but only if you are full of horror movie.
