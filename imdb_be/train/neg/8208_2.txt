"Hello everyone! I have an idea, we found an egg little thing from outer space, so why do not defrost it and open it? "" Yes, I know that would be the dumbest thing a scientist can do, and it can be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses, unknown land and could potentially destroy mankind, but hey, I want to know what's in it. " "And nobody says NASA, they can take it away from us." "Wow, that little thing gives vibes!" "Yes, really strong on contact, so do not touch it, but it's okay to cut it open." "Hi there looking, check out my IVC." (Later that day); "Do not open" !!!!! Uh oh, we have to run all the way to the lab and tell them not to open it, because we do not have phones or radios or intercoms, even if we have a Gazillion Dollars other equipment here . "I have never seen such an organic technology!" "Yes, Lemma take this stick and hit him.". "I'm out of here, I do not care if I have to kill the other 6 billion people on Earth, no one nukkin 'me!" "Look! This friendly aliens from "The Abyss"! They want us to come with them. " END
