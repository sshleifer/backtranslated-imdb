supposedly based on the life of Domino Harvey model turned bounty hunter. I would say that 95% are made. I always keep an open mind when it comes to movies, but this film has lost its chances when it became apparent that there was a story throughout the film, something I can not stand, and to top it off, the story character so odious and portrayed as an arrogant Of course! h I just wanted to finish her shots in the head. it is too incoherent, too flashy and too boring, it is who gives a shit interesting story, and I really think that the big time directors have to make films based on their own, or own imagination of the writer is not something that is based on the life of some ignorant snobby Brat in .
