I was not expecting much from a film directed by Sidney J. Furie and starring Dolph Lundgren, but I certainly expected more than GOT. A single-line user comment - second action film speed - does not seem too impaired to me for the film Lundgren. On the other hand, I would not bother to watch this film when his approval rating was below 5.0, but hey, the film was 5.9 out of 10 points, which seemed pretty reasonable to me for this type of product. <br /> <br /> Now I know that 37.5% of people who rated this film 10 (excellent) obviously a publicity stunt, because the detention is regular garbage Nu Image you have seen, time and time again. <br /> <br /> Lundgren does not convince as a former military man turned history teacher assigned a rough school. Its effect is simply awful, senseless and unnatural. Lundgren's inability to act becomes more noticeable in scenes with juvenile delinquency children. Either they are great actors, or as compared to Lundgren, they seem to have great actors - simply because they seem natural and believable <br /> <br /> DETENTION there are some elements that could be of potential interest for this low-budget film . - a closed-for-weekend high secrecy of high school, four teenagers in custody since the war teacher veteran and a group of ruthless criminals trying to get in - but the story (something like Breakfast Club meets die hard, or is it PANIC ROOM?) Full of incredible situations, a lot of clich√©s and stereotypical characters. And let's not forget, Dolph Lundgren is the protagonist. <br /> <br /> Alex Karzis and Kota Dobo play Bonnie and Clyde couple in love, and they provide the most appropriate presentation of the film, even if it seems to be the low-budget version of Sam Rockwell, and she wants to be Milla Jovovich. In the film, where everything fails, their folly and style to supply enough fresh air to prevent my interest from falling to the ground zero.
