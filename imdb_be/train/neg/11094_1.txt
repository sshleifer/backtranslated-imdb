This film is another one on my list of movies do not bother with. Saw it 40 years ago, as a teenager, staying up late to do it, it was very disappointing to find that it was about 95% of the song, the rest 4%, 1% of history, if that. This is what I call bait and switch of the film, one with an interesting name, the film itself is a scam. This is a topic that deserves a good cinematic treatment, the film is almost an insult to those who served. The actual members of the Lafayette squadron were on the run from the law, they were not the product offensive at home, they were in fact idealists who wanted to do something to help France. And I suspect that many of them have come from a higher class background than a symbol Tab Hunter. The flying school is not reasonable for alecks and know that it Alls, an individual, such as the one pictured here would not have lasted two days, this would have ever been a stockade or infantry. Discipline in the French army are often quite tough. In short, even Hollywierd version of the historical episode that deserves the proper treatment.
