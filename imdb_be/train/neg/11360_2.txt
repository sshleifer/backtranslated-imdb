Okay, so, someone, somewhere, a few years ago, we thought that it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX film about some flies stowing away aboard the Apollo 11 and going to the moon. So they did. Someone, somewhere, was an idiot. <br /> <br /> I want to give props to the artists doing their homework on the equipment. As far as I'm concerned, the rocket launch and hardware were drumming. The graphics in general were pretty good - the launch rocket gave me goose bumps like a good rocket launch always does (my Popular Mechanics flying car Reducer blood still running strong) and the 3D was quite effective. CG Sun Pixar quality, but overall good. Flies were a native Anthropomorphics mediocre, with some half-estimated the late 60's symbols have been added for color (hippies flies, African-American with a giant fly AFROS and black shades, etc.) and the larvae look like larvae-headed baby man (although they did accordingly rude squelching noises). <br /> <br /> writers, of course, do your homework, based on offensive and outdated clich√©s (60 gender policy including mainly female characters useless, racial stereotypes, evil Russian, fat fly who just want to have a class-two gross of humor level). The film, directed to the IMAX, they blew a great opportunity to sneak in some education about what the content of physics and space travel - they do not get the physics right they could not "(weightless in the lunar module during landing burn PLEASE?). I do not even bother to read the original radio statements between Houston and the astronauts, all of which are publicly available; instead they wrote their own dialogue, which sounds like crap. <br /> <br /> But we liked the larvae. <br /> <br /> Thus, they prepared a point and half of the missile and larvae. Uh, ah. 1.5 / fifth
