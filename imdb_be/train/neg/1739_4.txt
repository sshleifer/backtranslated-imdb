Watching Lady in Ermine I was wondering what makes Grable in a project that seemed to be designed to make Marlene Dietrich. Someone over at 20th Century Fox, might have decided a sex symbol as good as others. Zanuck should have known better. <br /> <br /> Betty plays an Italian countess of the 19th century, the area was captured by a detachment of Hungarian hussars, led by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., her ghostly ancestor, whose portrait hangs in the palace hall, along with the rest of her distinguished family tree does not see similarity in the Arc now also invader about 300 years earlier, she had to deal with when the army failed. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is now Betty has just married to Cesar Romero and invasion came at the wrong time, before it was all over. This is going to give someone a bad attitude, I guarantee. <br /> <br /> Fresh, healthy all the American actress Betty NOT make seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich could have put it again, but with Betty falls flatter than a presidential candidate yesterday. She and Fairbanks no chemistry at all, although Doug as charming as ever, and someone I can look at something. <br /> <br /> Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the score for this film, and This Is The Moment got Oscar nomination for Best Song. This Lady In Ermine another chance for Oscar glory fell to the buttons and bows. <br /> <br /> Ernst Lubitsch died halfway during the film and Preminger finished that Lady In Ermine. I can not believe that Lubich had in mind for the lead here Grable. Neither you, when you see that lady in ermine.
