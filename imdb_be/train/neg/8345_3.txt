This film could have been much better, especially given talent. drawing Larens Tate Frankie Lymon was not good, especially in the musical performances. He is not a synchronization word is good and his stage manners are Larens Tate when he was Frankie Lymon. The image of women as a bunch of gold digger has Hollywood written all over it. the powers explicitly pushed him, but he only made the characters more unreal. Positive film was a portrayal of Miguel Nunez to Little Richard, and cameos of Little Richard. Rochon is eye candy, as usual, even in a conservative role. It's too bad that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox wasted. The whole saga of Frankie Lymon was spectacular in real life. It is a pity that this film was a missed opportunity.
