Hi all ... <br /> <br /> There's really not much to say for this film at all. The basic plot is that guy (Brandon) took some friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a relaxing weekend away from work. Pick up a girl on the road, things start to go horribly wrong for all of them. <br /> <br /> Only in the storyline (written by the actor who plays Brandon, I believe, although I could be wrong here) it is unlikely and unconvincing, and played accordingly. «Clown Killer» itself is rather boring ground for a psychotic killer. Far from being a dark, mysterious, but above all, a clever predator, we instead offered a rather cumbersome, nursery rhymes, singing clown, who appears to be experiencing a minor mid-life crisis. The only thing that justified the writing of this commentary were the sex scenes and all that blood was in the film (the quality of the film led me to get some pleasure from such things). <br /> <br /> In short, this film falls below a set of possible standard. However, I have shared a few beers with a close friend, as I watched it, so we were able to scrape together some relative entertainment value from this movie, and therefore fair to say that S.I.C.K did fall just shy of two ratings. However, in reality (and with the benefit of hindsight) one star rating is more legitimate for this film. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of ten.
