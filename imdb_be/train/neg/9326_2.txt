I and a group of friends to remove the terrible video mocked them, believe me, this has led to some awful spent money, but also some great laughs. S.I.C.K. it is one of the best horror-but-funny movie we rented. The plot is overly done, all your friends in the woods and never return to a very old thing. Goriest of the film looks like your visit to the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the game dough looking for meat. And if anyone ever afraid of this movie at any time, they must follow the Cartoon Network for the rest of their lives, it's pathetic. The good aspects of the film that the two girls it is quite hot, one better than the other, and you can see that they are both naked in the course of the film. Another good aspect is that this film is so bad sometimes that you will laugh until you cry. I do not like to watch terrible actions or rent these awful videos, I do not believe that the pleasure of seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so bad oars and stands renting.Unless you're too mature to laugh chyoy- it crashes, I would recommend it. <br /> <br /> If the lease / purchase of his laugh about it, I would give it a 8.5.
