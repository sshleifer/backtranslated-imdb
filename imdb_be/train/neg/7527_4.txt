There are so many stupid things in "Tower of Death" / "Game of Death 2" that you really wonder if it is a parody. At times it seemed that I was watching the continuation of Kung Pow, not Bruce Lee movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this film has everything to do with asshole "Game of Death". In any case, it is rather a continuation / remake of "Enter the Dragon", which includes many of the elements of this film - in particular, the real footage. hero Bruce Lee Billy Lo (apparently) is investigating the sudden death of his friend and finds a piece of the film, which was the daughter of a man. If the body is stolen during a funeral (!), Billy also killed, and it's up to his wayward brother to avenge the death of the two men. <br /> <br /> Tong Long stars as brother Bobby Lowe and actually has a kind of charisma to carry the film. His fighting ability is very good, however. Bruce Lee is obviously due to the (no longer) be deleted footage just cash-in on the inheritance. To say that, in general, the staff actually editable in better than "Game of Death", but this does not stop the film from being a mess. <br /> <br /> So, fighting is actually a very interesting (dare I say, stunning) and to make a film, at least watchable. But there are so many Daft elements in this film that he really feels your patience. Firstly, there is the alleged offender is living in their palatial estates ... or is it a mental institution? Seriously crazy eating raw deer meat, deer drinks the blood carries a monkey on his shoulder and has several peacocks and a lion (?!). This is an attempt to make him look tough and smart just makes you feel sorry for him - you half expect someone to bring him back to his room <br /> <br /> In fact, it is the average of the terrible, and if the scene with . naked prostitute and a lion costume arrived, I turned it off. However, I did finish the movie and was kind of glad I did, because a fight to the end (just as "God") was the whole reason for viewing. While the history of the difficulty, the effect is very good and has excellent choreography. <br /> <br /> Even the ending is disappointing, when the room was anything to go by. What we said was that the "Tower of Death" had good weather, which was turned over and under the ground. It sounded great, like a twist on the original idea of ​​Bruce Lee with different styles of combat at every level. Could this be the "Game of Death", which was originally planned? Nope! The film was to be called "the generator room of death", because that is how the tower is. Since yes, there really were one or two "different" styles ... were plated foil grunts, leopard skin henchman and foolish monk. It's like Enter the Dragon has never been done with the plot to be a poor imitation. <br /> <br /> It is worth to see once in a fast-paced action scenes, but so stupid that sometimes it hurts. If it was intended, it's good. Not bad, but to restore the scene of the projector room of the «Enter The Dragon».
