Well! What can I say? Firstly, this device too long at 4 hours for the complexity (or lack thereof) of the plot. Actors are trying very hard to do this movie, but too little content for the allotted time. Swayzee really NOT Quatermain character at all. After seeing Sean Connery's interpretation of the big man in the "League of Extraordinary GentlemenÂ», Swayzee really makes the class. That guy with the hard drive by repeating rifle has no strength, height, subtlety or humor required for the part, and upstaged by all, including the witch doctor, who, by the way, it seems, from my point of view, to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast. Some prospects pleasant, but there are stupid mistakes in the film. For example. If happy team will arrive at a water hole in the middle of the desert, they should be visible to the oasis, just waiting for them to walk in them. Once out of the shaft leads to the outlet (the next frame) is nothing like exit is seen from the passage, they have climbed through, and so on. I was expecting Doug McClure to appear at any moment. In a sense, I want it to be. <br /> <br /> Russian leader persecuted Quatermain is poorly designed stereotypical character who just shoots around. <br /> <br /> Swayzee doing very well as a sad father, he returned to London, who can not get custody of her son. Swayzee must adhere to this kind of thing. He was not able to bear part of the brave gentleman arrogant heart, the experience of life, and a sense of fair play. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10. Barely
