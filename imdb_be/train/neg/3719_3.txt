Imagine diverting the death mask of the killer and find Barbara Cartland there ... this is what happens with this film. <br /> <br /> The discovery has shown promise, but soon he drops all pretense of being a thriller (or even shaped love story), and the only reason why they did this story become quite clear: to fill a gap in the female market observation, creating yet another re-hash "MVS-bottomed, brooding bad boy" (Andrew) meet the "innocent, capricious beauty" (Paula). <br /> <br /> Rather than spend time creating original premise, the filmmakers went straight for the money shot: the bad boy be tamed said bizarre beauty. It follows the line of insincere and highly clichéd love scenes sprinkled pseudo philosophical / poetic fluff. Andrew being recognized (eponymously) and "poet" is a lever to round out the perceived quality of Byronic hero should be - but even then, when we said, in a heavy, exaggerated writing, who and what he is, it's still hard to believe - . or care <br /> <br /> for Byron's hero / anti-hero work history requires subtlety, style, and innovation - all of which are non-existent here. This is not the modern Phantom of the Opera, it's just what happens when a weak and rather stupid (with loose Knicker Elastic) dates the bad man, who, after meeting her, it seems as dangerous as a bunny slippers. <br /> <br /> presentation could save this movie, if they were no good: Actress concerned about not looking for sex and "otherworldly", no matter how ridiculous or forced; Dougray Scott and the poor seems to have been under the influence of drugs, he Shambles through part of it. This is not his best work. The glimmer of interest were brought Prochnow as the «Vashon», and Andrew Lee Potts, a young photographer / brother. It would be better if the film offed sister and brother held instead.
