The film is as much fun as looking at sun.Sheriff Pataca is a complete retard that loves nothing better to do than sit on his fat rear making the smoke ring from his plump cigars and drink alcohol while the doctor acts as a version of zombies with Nicolas Cage absorbing all that so-called "blood", which actually seemed like Fruit Punch. <br /> <br /> Most of the drawing, it seemed very nasty even call that piece of shit on the screening of the film the other characters in this film are common waste of time, the end was terrible, the outlines were cheese, and the scenes were terrible. What's more I have to tell you the viewer is there? My advice would be to get a rabies shot if you've seen the movie. This film can give you foam at the mouth, if you do not get your refined shots.
