I watch this movie now on WTN because it was the channel, the TV was turned when I turned it on. It is not very reliable and quite a sad story about a minister's wife (Paul Alexander) falls in lust with a young pin / tramp (ABS washboard) plays Measles Sevier. There may or may not be the story. Corey whips his shirt a lot and Alexandra fainting. I get the feeling that it must be up to no good, and that's why he dabbles with thin Alexander Paul. It is not so important, because, as I said that he takes his shirt off a lot, and I just caught a butt cleavage. There's a lot of saxophone on the soundtrack, which is just painful.
