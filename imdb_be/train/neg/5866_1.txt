I remember this film when I was 13 (I think a lot of reviews saying the same thing for 13 years!) With a group of high school friends. We would all like to see Billy Crystal in his first film, and fell to the typical commercial advertisements that tell us it was a great comedy. We have experienced about 45 minutes away, and all agreed to leave the theater. It was grotesque, and tasteless, and away from the ability to Billy Crystal would make us laugh, we laugh. I came across this review of chance, and decided to register only to tell the rest of the world that rot-gut film waste it was, now that you rent it, you deserve what you get, you have been warned !!
