This should be one of the worst fillums I've ever seen, and I've seen a few. It is a slow, sad, amateur - not even consistent within its own simplified story reading. Actors do not operate. I can not blame them - they gave the script a complete banality they can do is to extend through the pain of their eyes, which has nothing to do with the evil goings on SummersIsle <br /> <br. /> There is not one moment in the film that sounds plausible - not honest line, not a single moment when one moves. The character of Nicholas Cage is so hard on that one feels in smidgeon of sympathy for him through all his hardships. I have no doubt that I have seen people suffering there, but it was Nicolas Cage is fully aware of the fact that he was the worst film of his career.
