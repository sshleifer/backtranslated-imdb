I saw this film in a real cinema (probably $ 2.00 one) to my cousin and uncle. We were about 11 and 12, I think, and in fact, in horror movies. I remember so excited to see it, because my cool uncle highlight film (and we probably will never do it again!) And sooo disappointed then !! Just boring and not scary. The only redeeming thing I remember was Corky Pigeon Silver Spoons, and it was not all that great, just someone I knew. I've seen bad movies before, and this one has always stuck in my memory as the worst. This is what I remember, one of the most boring, without frightening waste of our collective $ 6, and film waste. I have read some of the reviews that say it's worth a look, and I say, Â«Too each his own," but I would not even bother. Not even so bad it's good.
