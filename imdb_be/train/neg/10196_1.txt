In poker enthusiast, I look forward to see this film - .. Especially as it was Scotty Nyugen it <br /> <br /> Basically, Scotty Nyugens short spots in this film all this going for it <br / > <br /> characters unsympathetic and annoying soundtrack and terrible story, well, there is not one. <br /> <br /> I honestly got a headache and found himself reading the barcode number on the DVD-box after twenty minutes I'm so bored. Its really ashame fact that Nyugen was in this film, otherwise I would not have spent $ 16 buying his Ebay <br /> <br /> Take it from me. - AVOID July 2nd unsuited !!! Dire. :(
