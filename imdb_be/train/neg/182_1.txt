This is the worst sequel to a movie on the face of the world. he does so again. The killer is still killing for pleasure. But this time he is killing people who make a film about what happened in the first film. This means that it is stupid movie ever. <br /> <br /> Or do not look at it. If you value one valuable hour during this movie, do not watch. You want to ask the director and the person next to you, what made him do it. Because it simply does not match the original brand of horror, action and crime. <br /> <br /> Do not allow your children to watch. The teenager, a young child or a young adult, this film has that effect on people varieties.
