This is a very bad movie. The plot is sentimental mush. I believe that the production values ​​are CI, decent photos, unobtrusive direction and the like. Mark Hamill was awful. I never cared much for him, and this film proves that perception. It is not surprising that he never had any career away from his "Star Wars" films. I'm just saying "Bug-date, Mark," as he plunges into deserved obscurity. On the other hand, a very young Annie Potts completely eclipsed. She showed the charm, beauty and acting chops all in one design. I remember her in "texasville" lately, and taking into account its beauty. It is interesting to see it from a decade ago. In any case, if you are not interested in Miss Potts, to escape from this film that cries out in the hills.
