Will Spanner (David Byrnes, fifth acting actor) plays another bizarre case, this time with vampires, not ordinary witches, warlocks & demons (he is in the hospital to check his friend's son who was injured) has hit and ran when they ride with a girl who was attacked by vamp). He brings Detectve Lutz together with a case that revolves around a secret vampire organization trying to get a business combination to let them legally own all the blood banks in the world, or some kind of nonsense. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie takes pretty much back to nudity and simulated sex scenes. (As expected from this series). So, complain about the ears of good practices or compelling plots and even persuasive characters. If you watch this movie, you don't care about such "frivolities" and just want some "action". Unfortunately, the film on this front also fails. All women are attractive enough, but the way the scenes are shot is simply cruel. It is a more or less meaningless exercise in every sense. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Both Kimberly Blair and April Breneman show everything; Ashlie Rhey shows the full front; Aline Kassman & Mai-Lis Holmes Shows Only Your Breasts <br /> <br /> My Class: D
