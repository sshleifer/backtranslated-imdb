Taran Adarsh's prestigious critic praised this dubba film. <br /> <br /> The film has a strange story where the lover sells his love for the brothel, he wants the money to save his mother and then LOL <<br /> <br /> The movie is first <br /> <br /> Throughout the first half, we have focused on romance, comedy that doesn't work. Twist shocks, but the other side is confusing and the climax is clich√©. Aditya Data Direction is Bad Music is Typical Himesh <br /> <br /> Emran is doing a serious role, but his wardrobe, his walk through songs.etc, is similar to his previous films Geeta Bhasra disturbs Ashmith Patel's conviction that this actor was in MURDER good so far and then downhill Mithun for some time on the screen and he's okay, but breaking his song is forced Ranjeet is okay
