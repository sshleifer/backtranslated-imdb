For 8 days there is no script that DVD will tell you how the movie is made. It is a photographed blurry video that is sometimes accustomed to, but it is really partially naked women who sit in the room most of the time. It works very well and it helps a lot. But the killer will only appear once for a long time and the girls / women will sit and mope they will not try to escape or do something too interesting, so the whole thing will stop for about 20 minutes. It would have been a good short, perhaps even powerful. Even within eight days they do very little. Why? Because they didn't have a script. How many movies have been made without scripts. Not too much. I don't know why this is so? How many good movies have been made from bad scripts. Not too much. Why so? By working against this great problem, the direction is trying to do some interesting things, but with what is essentially something. Surrounding girls who have been photographed with dark, colorless, colorless videos will keep for a while but not a short but too long function. Actresses deserve praise if only there was a script. Miami Vice, The Last Movie That's. However, this is not intended to congratulate the Vice President of Miami or his failed attempt.
