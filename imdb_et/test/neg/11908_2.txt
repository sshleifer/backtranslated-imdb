Canterville Ghost (1996). The director did it too fortunate. Maybe it's a generation, but I really liked the Charles Laughton version. Time and place for "emotions" and this production does not change very well. Patrick Stewart, who spoke of Shakespeare, was very good but still inappropriate. Wouldn't recommend or review it again. For me, close-ups and padded text and sub-plot lost. Adding external materials and scenes takes a really great job. The scriptwriter should find another profession where his talent is wrong, maybe afternoon soap operas would be a better place. Really check the good version and forward it.
