How much do I love this movie?! Now I'm not a fan of bad movies, but I love a movie that's so bad it's good. This is one of them. Juan Pablo Di Pace has a big ass, looks up on the screen, and definitely does not make his debut (I believe) bad. Billy Zane is suitably imaginative and moody, although I still feel she has more. I felt it in Titanic, the vision of his face, when La Winslet spat him, completely broken, shocked and put down ... fierce! Kelly Brook is a beautiful face ... not serious, I think it's so! It's worth seeing to see one very hot man, some Brook bras, Billyst nasty wilt, laugh at dialogue, rejoice all over the landscape and madness. - Yes, I bought it !!!
