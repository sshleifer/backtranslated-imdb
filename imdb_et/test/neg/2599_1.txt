Family Guy is one of the worst examples I've ever been forced to watch (but not at the bottom - I've seen Jersey Shore). The popular hit with high school and college children who are mistaken for inaccuracy in edgin is an unoriginal and exaggerated exhibition. <br /> <br /> As it is dubbed as a comedy show, we look at its "humor". 1. Accidental setbacks / cuts to celebrities or movies or politics or anything that can be cut for knee-laughing. It got old after 5 or the same episode. A simple solution: every time you hear "It's worse than time ...", connect the ears. <br /> <br /> 2. Incompatibility for your own benefit. This exhibition is known for entering inappropriate gags with little to do with the general plot. Solution: Look at South Park. They did it right. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that Family Guy is not worth the time and does not hold Simpson's candles.
