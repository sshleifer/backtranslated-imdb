I'm trying myself to watch 3 bad movies in succession to find out if watching 3 bad movies can give me amnesia because I have a duplicate version of this movie in English. Now let me go under the scores Music score: poor quality, but at least this is the story: it is about a man who goes to town and meets his sheriff brother and fights for the farmers for the big ones and join the Mexicans to ride them and Trinity and his brother try them out Protect - The ultimate climate fight mixes someone out of #### who are good guys. Summary: Better than I thought, but I have to continue to see Dolph Lungren and Jean-Claudde Vanne Damme's "Universal soldier" pray for my peace of mind
