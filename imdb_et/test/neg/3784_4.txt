When Corky St. Claire, who is waiting for GUFFMAN, was led by Blaine's citizens with a comic undertones in a horror film, the result would have been very similar to MILPITAS MONSTER. <br /> <br /> To be generous, this was the longest hour and twenty minutes of the movie I've ever seen. Calling one temple as a butterfly is kind. <br /> <br /> Almost none of the people involved in this project ever made another movie, except Ben Burtt, who made some truly admirable (budget-based) effects. He also made sound for MUNICH and several other major budget projects. Narration has been made by veteran voice commander Paul Frees, who probably donated his efforts. <br /> <br /> If you look at the opening lists and you see the Millionaire Single School District listed as one of the manufacturers you feel is going a long and strange trip. <br /> <br /> Pollution in Milpitas, California, is so poisonous that it creates a monster. Remember that this is 1975 and ecology was a hot topic. Just a couple of years ago, GODZILLA was a filmmaker for VS. SMOG MONSTER. <br /> <br /> So far it's so good. The monster is a creature with wings of at least fifty feet and has the ability to separate the city. Instead, it steals garbage cans. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of the center, this idea is that this monster can tear down a small town and leave footprints of eight feet away, but no one notices. There's a nicely created scene where he walks through the carnival in the middle of the night, but somehow nobody notices. <br /> <br /> The only person who sees the monster until the last scene is George, drunk in the city. I hope the whole movie I was hoping hoped George would break into the cameras, but that didn't happen. Drat. Actually, no one can be killed. George supposedly sacrifices himself to save Priscilla (he's involved with a helicopter to lure the creature - George smells worse than garbage and the monster attracts the smell). <br /> <br /> Nominal wires are a high school group for students. There's pretty Priscilla and her inadequate boy and some "bad" guys who (surprise, surprise) are hitting themselves to help the monster win the final scenes. <br /> <br /> The monster has four main features. . He attacks Browning-Ferris garbage truck and leaves it on the highway, but no one knows. He walks through the carnival, again unnoticed. He tears the building up (nice miniature work) and no one can see him but George. Then, during the dance, he attacks high school and grabs Priscilla and carries him like any very long monkey has done several times, most recently in the last winter. <br /> <br /> There are plot ideas that come out somewhere and have fallen off. Local citizens choose the town hall because they want their garbage can back. A detailed secret weapon to track the monster rides on a private plane, is reviewed and forgotten. <br /> <br /> So why did I look at the whole thing? Because these people had so much fun. I had the idea that firefighters were firefighters, businessmen were filmed in their offices, Priscilla could live in this suburban house, and the scenes of their yards could be in their shipyards. <br /> They may not be big actors, but they are real people. No one has an amazingly good look. In fact, I think the four screen adults wear glasses. Since it is in the mid-seventies, we see some very bad clothes and some men have awesomely bad facial hair. One of the dignitaries interviewed before the Ciry Hall meeting has such a strong tie and sporty coat that he thinks he is playing in MUSIC MAN Marcellus. <br /> <br /> And it got two extra stars in the movie. Create a zero. Two points sometimes for proper special effects. And two points that community people actually got together and did it. They can actually say they have made a movie; despite many staging experiences and working behind the scenes of live television, I can't say that and I'm happy about them. <br /> <br /> Do you remember those great old movies with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland? At some point, someone would say, "Let's put the show!" Aunt Edna owns all these old clothes in the attic and we can use Uncle Nedi barn! "Then they make" neighborhood exhibitions "with suits and costumes that would cost you seven in a duplicative way. <br /> <br /> This is the spirit that the militant good people had for this project and blessed them.
