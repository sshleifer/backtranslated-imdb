After seeing the TV commercials on this movie, I marched to my local cinema, waiting for a lot of laughter. Finally, it was one of the longest 90mins I've ever spent. Indeed, Wog Boy could not offer a story that would be interesting enough to keep his interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes out of space. <br /> <br /> A scene where two "Wog Boys" dominate their local nightclub dance floor was the only one I was impressed with. The only sign that was worth seeing was "Nathan" played by The Castle's Stephen Curry, his fight against the opposite sex, offering most of the few smiles. <br /> <br /> The word for this flick is boring. Save yourself time and just watch TV advertising because it's just laughing.
