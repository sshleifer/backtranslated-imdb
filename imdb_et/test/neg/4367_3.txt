It would be wrong and understandable that I would recommend watching Killjoy 2, you have better things, washing the car, throwing stones at the stream, but at the same time it is not as terrible as you think it is. This is almost a true movie that is much more than most direct DVDs. Killjoy 2 has helped a lot in Trent Haaga's manic passion as his name when he puts himself in this fever-abandonment to almost point to the movie, but of course it takes more than one man's big shoes. Tammi Sutton gives the head of the most entertaining director, as Roger Corman is haunted by nature and the whole thing has almost ruined the rush, the sweet ended. The whole place and almost fun.
