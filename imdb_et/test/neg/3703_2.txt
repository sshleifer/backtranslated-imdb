If it weren't editing curse words and blurring next to each other, if one sign gives another finger, this simple Sci-Fi channel pilot would be a small budget snoozer error. The plot of the government's attempts to destroy a trained telemetry group, originally trained as a military weapon, is a hero who is gifted with a degree of vagueness to become a temptative telecom survivor. Unfortunately, the movie is talkative, boring, predictable, and even without any special effects. Top-billed Louis Gossett, Jr. is a small role as a bureaucratic bureaucrat who initiated the program and now wants to remove all traces. She walks through this part and it's hard to see why she was bothered. Other cast members do a decent job with a script that requires little.
