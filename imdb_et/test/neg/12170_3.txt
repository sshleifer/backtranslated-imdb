First, it's not Stephen King's book, story, short story, or anything else. From the EW website and their reviews at exhibitions when he first made it, "... he never writes down to his audience and he never gives contempt for his subjects. His first original work for television, Stephen King's golden year" (CBS, July 16 at 21-11) is no exception. "<br /> <br /> The series was probably (as others have mentioned) a continuous series, so we've never seen the End after they left us. But it was never clear to viewers who were wondering how it all ended ?? <br /> <br /> When the series came on a video tape, she was herself "never seen before!" "It should have said," Never seen the end! "<br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> The end result alone was the only important part of the video (although all parts were omitted) For example, not our two terrible FBI agents who realize they are now labeled as bad boys and evil evil by Jude Anderson (as originally aired), Jude just walks on them ... And they Bang, Dead and Real Emotions to Speak in a Scene: Get a little Harlan and his wife If the original end left with us a spectacular cliff, they just dropped out of the video. <br /> <br /> * <br /> <br /> It was a sad ending for a fairly well-made mini-series and makes the video completely unrecorded or even renting.
