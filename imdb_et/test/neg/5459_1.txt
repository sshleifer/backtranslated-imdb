Anna Kokkinos' success with "Good On" will now look like it totally depended on the script and Alex Dimitriades. The extent to which this latter, the Revelation, is both derived, pretentious, and completely unigeneral (except Tristan Milan's fine cinematography) seems to be out of the question. . Unfortunately, there are quite a few Aussie films that deal with such topics, some again for "sexism" (and / or explicit sexual scenes) in the 1970s and 1980s and beyond, and maybe they are deserving again after that stuff. Of course the whole thing refers to the ballet world and makes it all quietly slow (and in its choreography, like the experimental number of the 1960s Dutch ballet), to recommend great art if you haven't traveled much and then only if you ever developed beyond Art Theory 101. <br /> <br /> Add a claim, terribly archive to the dialogue ("do as we command ...") and the entire sheep will fall on its well-funded face. Then there are "sexy" bits: straight from Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Considering Colin Friels' beautiful but trimmed performance - how about a true city thriller? <br /> <br /> Everything, the Revelation, is a feminist project once again set back a decade - and ready and deeply imitating (male writers like Henry Miller, William Burroughs, even Bukowski), collaborating in Melbourne. Oz, who carries the form of educational and ideological amnesia! There are no revelations here.
