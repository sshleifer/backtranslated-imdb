I would give it to zero if they had such a rating. Fun wasn't fun at all. I grew tired of the movie in about ten minutes, but I ended up thinking I was going to get better - it wasn't. Others I also watched this movie by agreement. Action was annoying. I'm tired of Jim Carey over the top ham. Support pain was not better. Although this film was a statement of the greed of the company and the situation of the employee who stepped in when the big company goes down would be different for better performance of this vehicle. I didn't really like the leading figures (Dick and Jane) so much that their antics were never funny, but pathetic. I'm trying to remember one scene where I or someone was laughing and not. A worthless movie and a waste of time.
