This film does not literally have one redemption function. The characters are one-dimensional, clich√©, incredibly miscommunicative and foolish. The script looks like it was combined with 100 other movies, the actor is terrible, and some "gross" humor made me feel sick. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Gregory Poirier, thinking all this would be funny or interesting! <br /> <br /> The worst film I've seen for many years.
