Not surprisingly, unless ABC reacted quickly to unpleasant ratings. According to published reports (Variety), the exhibition had the worst estimates of ABC television network history. <br /> <br /> And I quote: ABC Music Talent Contest "The One" opened on Tuesday evening to cancel ratings now. <br /> <br /> The article explained that the exhibition received a "shockingly low 1.1 rating / 3 share of adult 18-49 and 3.08 million viewers." <br /> <br /> This makes it a weaker premiere of any networking reality show, as well as all of the ABC history series. <br /> <br /> From the first moment I saw the ads I saw that I knew it wouldn't work. We don't need another American Idol clone. But ABC should have shown it to be fair.
