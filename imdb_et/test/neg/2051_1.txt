Bled begins when a young female artist Sai (Sarah Ferooqui) meets a mysterious but charming guy, Renfield (Jonathan Oldham), and they return to her studio apartment, where she gives her some wooden bark used as a hallucinogenic drug melted. The swan becomes a fast hook because it is thrown into a reality of alternating fantasy involving vampire beings. Got a photographer's friend Royce (Chris Ivan Cevic) worries about him when he gets drug-addicted when he becomes drug-dependent, whether he can cure a drug or destroys his life, and why mysterious Renfield got him addicted to things first and make complex fantasy dreams like traveling any importance? <br /> <br /> Collaboration and director Christopher Hutson is this anemic artificial Vampire flick that is pretty much 95 minutes long and very thoughtful of all the bad comments. The script was interestingly written by Sxv'leithan Essex (how the hell are you still saying?), Who is also credited as a production designer, and his unusual name is actually more interesting than what happens in Bled, I think the makers tried to make a very serious fantasy-based horror movie, which has a strong moral message about drug threats, drug addiction and rape drugs. Most of the film will be spent on the drug problem Getting first introduced to the drug, how big it was for the first time and how it would hopelessly become addicted, eventually destroying her, her life and friends living. It has never been explained where he keeps this medicine because Renfield gives him a bit of a preliminary meeting, but hey, who cares? Bled's first twenty minutes are boring and boring, the next hour is not much better than the ten-minute confusion that comes with Vampiric's monster and Renfield. The moral elements are patronizing, the fantasy elements seem like anxiety and there is no horror. There is also a dialogue that is terrible, every sentence tries to be deep, they have a lot of hidden depth and just trying to mean that it's tiring to listen. <br /> <br /> The concept of a movie is terrible and it is filling because there is no gore or violence to talk about, and the whole thing is set in an apartment that doesn't seem to be any fire. The fantasy setting seems a little better, but it is sparse and underestimated. Here's not to make fear, the atmosphere, and things worse, if the makers have chosen to use silenced, very faded colors, which I just hate and find what's wrong with a color image wrong? It seems to me that this is the current filmmaker who seems to think it will make the movie automatically cool or add to the atmosphere that it definitely does not, most often making the movie boring and drab, as proven here by Bled. <br /> <br /> It was probably a low budget and cargo in Los Angeles and has reasonable production values, but it's all so boring. Action doesn't impress me, I didn't care or anyone who's never a good sign. Bled is a horrible vampire movie that goes both psychological horror and physical all kinds of parallels in real life dug out and what he can do little or no since the whole thing is so boring. Such a movie may have an audience, but the other comments are not so big.
