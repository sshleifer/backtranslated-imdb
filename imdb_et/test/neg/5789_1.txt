Oh, man, I hated this movie. The locations on this site were great, but this is the ONLY positive thing I can say about it. Now, right at the start, I am very critical of how weapons, especially firearms, are portrayed and treated in films. The war flick was imaginative well, but a real SEAL team would never have adhered to the dirty weapons on the film. The action was more wood than my first sailing ship, the equipment (or lack of it) was ridiculous and the dialogue was, we say, missing something interesting. Well, except for the journalist who was actually premature. Watching this movie was comparable to watching "Palmetto" with Woody Harrelson, where every scene was so bad that you just couldn't turn it off because you had to see if they could worsen with the next scene. Like Palmetto, they certainly did. The scene in the water, where, after shooting the first enemy, CLEARS DAMN BOAT UP and thus faces possible drowning, made me laugh so hard that after milliseconds I thought it was worth waiting for this movie. Then Charlie Sheen decided to pull the survivor into the depths of the ocean (as it was filmed, with many camera shots, it seemed that they fell about 80 feet. The cucumber was so damn stupid, I was stunned. Then again the whole fucking film. I enjoy action films but not this NOTE: The revised version was a TV version, pan & scan. I can't imagine it changed except that the whole thing was blessed shorter!
