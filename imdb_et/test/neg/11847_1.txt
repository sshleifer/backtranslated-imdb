This movie is an intermittent, deadly attempt to put together several bad films and make some extra bad film. It even fails because there are too many "plots" and not just enough funny jokes and ridicules. Seriously, the dolls are sweet and the boys are really good for me. The performances are class C best and flat everywhere, special props for the Spec-Op guy who spoke of some strange east coast / Venus break that was almost impossible to decipher. Not that you really care about what he says because only the curse words are different. It's not offensive by cinematography, pretty much what to expect from a direct video of a small rent (like a script). The fact that New Concorde used material from "Carnosaur" films is offensive and rather confusing. Shame, New Concorde. Shame. "Carnosaur" is one of my favorite scary movies and they somehow screwed it up and made it almost invisible. Watch the "Carnosaur" movies if you want to see the chaos of a dinosaur racing. <br /> <br /> I give him one star because I am so fond of the movies he steals, and also because the scale is not zero.
