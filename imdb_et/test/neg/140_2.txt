The success of the original French "Emmanuelle" series (I only looked at the first, which was not too bad) led to an imitation; An Italian colleague who even changed his heroine race was clearly less polished and more exploitative - more and more vulgar when the series went. Incredibly, there were 16 "Black Emanuelle" movies, where the heroine even changed the spelling of her name to avoid copyright issues! However, Laura Gemser - the target of desire - became almost as many icons as the original Emmanuelle, Sylvia Kristel (although personally she is too thin for my taste)! Here he is even more like "Emanuelle" than his real name - with the director, becoming "Albert Thomas"! <br /> <br /> The film itself is of little interest: in fact it would be best to approach it as a tour operator with some decent movies of wild animals in Africa. Gender scenes I don't know how perfect my tracked version was, but although there was a lot of nudity, none of them was very explicit - or even titillation (the scene that was closest was when Gemser - who works as a photographer - and her companion Karin Schubert turns the camera on to each other, of course, dresses up in the middle of the jungle, and there is an artist who looks like Salvador Dali, but apparently does not take his scenes a lot of time. The score of Nico Fidenco is traditionally 70's odd pop and really nothing to write home.
