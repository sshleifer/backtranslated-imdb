The first 1/3 of this movie I loved and thought it was one of Truffu's best films. I loved a plot where a pencil girl marries a man half way through the world - vision invisible. Especially if this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the REAL pen so she can take her place! Then he cleared the man's huge bank account and disappeared! I was really trying and I wanted to see more, ... <br /> <br /> And then the movie broke down and just became empty! Although he came from New Caladonia (Pacific Island) and RÃ©union (Indian Ocean Island), when he goes to France to South America, he stumbles upon him almost immediately. Hmm, the odds are 187,000,000 to 1, but he finds it. Then, instead of killing him or going to the police, he forgives him - even if he recognizes what he has done. Okay - it's hard to believe, but okay ... but she helps her hide her personal detective, murdering her !!!! No one is stupid! Yes, the character Catherine Deneuve plays is pretty pretty, but it's human - it's just silly. And if he wants to be just a sex object, why should he do it for a woman who is often cold and completely selfish and evil. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worthy of such high ratings due to a very ridiculous plot! If you're not an evil fan of Truffaut, try another movie - even Truffo - just NOT that.
