This * should be an amazingly funny movie ... but it falls on your face. (In fact, I stopped half-looking at what I rarely do ...) - Bill Murray plays Jack Corcoran, a second-level motivational speaker whose father inherits the elephant he was supposed to be dead before he was born; then it has one week to get the embarrassing pachyderm across the country. His adventures on the road are, at best, just fun. Janeane Garofalo's remarkable comedies were largely untapped. Anita Gillette, in her small role, is impressive with Jack's mother (who has many explanations) and Pat Hingle looks like a former circus companion. - Perhaps the other side of the film was better than the first, but I find it hard to believe ...
