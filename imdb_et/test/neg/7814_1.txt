This movie must be about one of the worst I've ever seen. Humor was crude, hardly funny, and it was heard a million times earlier. The beginning was noticeable and worsened and worsened when it went on. I got about halfway through and couldn't look at it anymore. Fortunately, I only watched it on TV, so it didn't cost anything, but I strongly suggest that you don't waste time or money. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie was new. The signs were not developed at all. I think it would have been better than a little children's film because it was full of stupid unreal "funny" events that were like home alone or something. Getting home alone was somehow as terrible as it was.
