If this film is rated on a scale of 1 to 10, it would be necessary to create a new rating system because it should not even be qualified. The film plot (if you call it) rotates with Charlie (Stephen Baldwin), a former professional agent who has been killed by his brother, who he killed while he was still working with the US. If this seems to be an interesting scenario, don't be fooled, because this film doesn't produce what his story about his activities says. <br /> <br /> Comedian Chris Rock said that if you see an actor bad film, because of which he wants to send the actor $ 50, given that the actor must be so bad money to do such poor quality work. After watching the movie, you can send Stephen Baldwin for $ 100. <br /> <br /> It seems that Baldwin did not catch his role in the film. In the film, Baldwin is forced to drive across the city of Los Angeles to protect his "honeycomb" from the murder of a (woman) he had previously killed. Throughout the picture, Baldwin seems to be barely able to drag. His retrospective force can separate from any tension the film should have imagined. <br /> <br /> If you are a person who enjoys watching very bad movies and laughs at these shortcomings, this movie is for you. However, if you are looking for a well-done action pencil, it would be best to look elsewhere instead of renting this movie.
