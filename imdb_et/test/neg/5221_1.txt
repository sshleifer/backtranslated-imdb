Usually I don't like Chuck Norris movies. I appreciate his work as a martial artist and his fighting scenes are usually quite choreographic. Chuck is undoubtedly one of the martial arts googles. So, in my local bookstore I found a movie that I had never seen before and took home. <br /> <br /> While acting in this movie was worse than most Chuch Norris movies, I was hoping to see at least one fight. I quickly realized that it wasn't a typical Chuch Norris film; Rather, it was a Christian film that was meant to illustrate the paradigm of "good will prevails". <br /> <br /> There's really nothing on the packaging that shows that it's a Christian film, except for a label. .. Goodtimes Entertainment, I've never heard of before. I keep this in mind the next time I see a movie from this company. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with Christianity ... I have a problem with horrible proselytizing. If someone is going to make a religious film, it has at least a sense to show the viewer that this is what they get. The only redeeming part of the training is that I spent just $ 3.25 to spend 97 minutes to watch a great martial artist. At least it was at dinner and I spent some of this cooking and eating. <br /> <br /> In short, if you are looking for a mediocre martial arts movie and don't count much don't bother with this movie because it doesn't even offer it.
