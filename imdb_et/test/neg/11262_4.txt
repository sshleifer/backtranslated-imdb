I've read and enjoyed many of James Lee Burke's Robicheaux secrets. When I read "In The Electric Mist With The Confederate Dead", and Tommy Lee Jones played the lead, I was excited. After seeing it last night, I'll end it after about twenty minutes if I don't want to see more people who shoot or beat. Don't make me wrong, I don't mind the blood and gore love of "The Untouchables" and "The Godfather Trilogy". Maybe it was just what I saw "Born" and "What just happened" before looking at it. I know Burke's books are violent, lyrical, and especially in the "In The Electric Mist" they may be like the Cajun moles he writes, full of things that have never been fully explained. In the book, it's okay. It is confusing in the film. Many of the previous reviewers are also keen admirers of Dave Robicheaux, which makes it more understandable that the film really liked it. Or they are admirers of Bernard Tavernier or both. Even as a fan of all the actors (and especially Vince), I felt that it was a waste of these talents - they gave a good movie that wasn't together. Now, I say this, having only seen a US DVD and hoping that the Tavernier cut is a huge difference. On the plus side: the soundtrack was wonderful. Robicheaux places were perfect - just as I imagined the feed shop looks like. Mary Steenburgen was like Bootsie, as was Walter Breaux Batistina. When you read books, you know why Robicheaux is a uniformly hardened person at the beginning of the film, and then people start to hit different instruments. In general, I would like them to have filmed more "electric fog and confederate dead" and left out a large part of Robicheaux's interrogation methods, explaining Elrod's gifts and his bond with Dave, as well as Dave's public. Then I don't feel like I did last night when I turned it off: "What just happened?"
