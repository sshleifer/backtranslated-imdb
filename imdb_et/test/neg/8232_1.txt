This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The plot is turned around by a man named Luther, who carries metal dentures, bites people around his neck and walks like a chicken without a scoop. He also thinks he's a chicken. <br /> <br /> Sounds wrong? Well, for me, it's strange and weird, the better. The more gore, the better and so on. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a table, deciding whether they want to release this maniac from their institution. They mention that he has created some dentures in prison, which he previously bites his neck. She clings like a chicken and THINKS she's a chicken. <br /> <br /> If I had such a patient, I have no way to release him. <br /> <br /> First of all, Luther controls the supermarket and attacks the old woman on the bench and walks away. Then it slides into the back of the woman's car and drives all over her home. <br /> <br /> In the house, Luther takes her to bed with her wife. When a woman's daughter and her daughter's boyfriend come home, Luther hides. <br /> <br /> Later, after the movie, the policeman comes to the front door and asks her mother. You can clearly see that the daughter is scared of her mind and crying, but the officer asks if everything is fine. He replies that everything is fine. Finally, the officer gets into his car and leaves. When I saw a woman who was constantly crying and looking for fear, at least I would like to enter the house to look a little. <br /> <br /> The end is also stupid. When the woman was in the shed, she began to grab her and get Luther excited so she started to move around and like a maniac. Finally, he lets him down and just sits there for a few minutes before finally closing up a little more. <br /> <br /> Then credits count. <br /> <br /> This is one of the STUPIDEST movies I've ever seen! Nothing happens in the woman's house! Never! <br /> <br /> I sometimes like campy movies, but it's really boring for me. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 1 star 10. Good idea, bad direction!
