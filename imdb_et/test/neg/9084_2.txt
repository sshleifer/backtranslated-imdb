What's more, director J. Lee Thompson connects actor Charles Bronson with a violent and uncompromising momentum. In fact, it is probably Bronson's most brutal film (quite for the man who appeared in Death Wish, Ten To Midnight and Chato Land). But brutality does not make a good movie by itself and The Evil That Men Do is finally a disappointment. If you had taken your cruelty, the film would be of little interest. <br /> <br /> The story is about a pensioner (Bronson) who lives in a cozy life in the Caribbean. He is convinced that he will retire to track down and eliminate the sadistic torture physician who has been trading insecurely around the various hell holes in South America. Throughout the film, especially at the beginning, we are treated with some graphic torture scene to show us what the nasty work it is. <br /> <br /> These topics are actually quite serious. Torture continues in the repression of Latin American dictatorships and in everyday life, some desperately painful experiences simply suffer from an unpopular position. But the bad thing that people do - all that is worthy of it - is not that bad for the poor. It is disrupted purely by giving Charles Bronson some uncomfortable bags. It is just an exploitative person who hangs on the real questions of his hair. Torture sequences make you, the viewer, feel like it's a dirty, sick head voyeur, rather like someone who enjoys watching "snuff". The script is full of terrible dialogues, including some torture descriptions. It is bad that men are unable to explore their disturbing ideas ... it serves them as entertainment and asks us to enjoy them. Sorry, but it's just wrong.
