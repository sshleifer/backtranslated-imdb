In a world where people can live forever, you spend the whole movie wanting to die. First of all, if you look at this movie, do two things first to mute, don't worry that you won't leave the plot, they don't even talk about the hell of the 87 minute movie in the first 70 minutes after mute, now you have to move fast until the main chick dies, don't worry, even if you don't know why or how he died. When you reach the "good part", take it off. Oh, how do you know this good part, wait for the elevator scene to be with the weapons of two world wars in space. These guns do not seem as much as you realize that the first protagonist had a laser marker gun and CO2 cartridges. The only remnants of the plot are between the glowing ball and the semi-hot chick that looks like a Wolverine attack. After listening to the "plot" you want them to go back to talk. Of the four people who are in this movie, none of them can act remotely, not even a little bit, so it's better to see the kindergarten in the theater. <br /> <br /> For special commenting effects, just let me just say "Wow," you don't really spend the whole movie on your own "Where's this $ 1.8 million budget went!" Seriously, it leaves you with the size of the failure. The best "kits" are basically window wallpapers. The ships are basically driving keys, expect some to have barges that look like whales. I've never heard so many words in my life. They have their own wrist buttons (large step meters) that can put them in a "combat mode" and super-run mode (making them super-blurry). It will seriously remove their power supplies, but they will find a cord to restore their strength. The explosions were less impressive than my fourth July, I only had sparks. <br /> <br /> So the plot as much as I think goes something like "mother" is the spacecraft captain and goes into the desert for some time flying rocket dies. Then his daughter will remember 6,000 years in the future (I'm not an exaggeration) reminiscent of my mother's memories through a capsule. Anyway they jabber for another 10 min and then cause a big bang. Yes, the same "Big Bang" that started our solar system. It has been explained how it is going in time or something again, it is not really important if it happened. Role of Credit Seriously, the entire script was gracefully on one piece of paper, unless it actually described in detail a terribly fighting scene. <br /> <br /> After looking at the loans, I now laughed more than the whole movie, jobs created as a "galactius sarcophagus" catering supervisor and then special thanks to George Lucas. <br /> <br /> I really did not expect that much of the movie I paid for 99 cents, but seriously some of the body owes me for it. The most common comment heard after the movie "I want my life back". You have to admire some, but put some time and effort into this movie, but seriously, why?
