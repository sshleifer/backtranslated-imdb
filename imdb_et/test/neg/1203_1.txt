I remember it for the first time in the 80s as I do. Man, I've read the comments in this trash and I find the vote surprised. This movie doesn't deserve four stars !!! This movie is no better than Topgun. Topgun has its own problems; don't get me wrong. This movie must only be banned for its stupidity. With so many stereotypes, so many loop holes, so much bad dialogue. I can't think of the quality of this vomiting. This is not an action / adventure. It's a bad joke about the movie. Kindle like looking at plan 9 for stock F-16 recording. This film not only reads logic and common sense in the context of the military environment, but sends a disturbing message. The military will not save his father's Middle East b ***** ds from the evil. So get out of there and take out a multi-million dollar weapon and hit it back on the reluctant clutches of American Arabs. Cuz you can't justify these animals. This is Bruckheimer's letter without budget. Bland's direction, weak functioning, flat music, idiotic plot, equals ... Iron Eagle.
