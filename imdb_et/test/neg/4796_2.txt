It didn't know the film and was fortunately short (less than 90 minutes), it seemed like a computer graphics opportunity: most of the special effects are great, definitely. But it's not a big or even a good movie. Not to say that this is an absolutely worthless look, because it is possible to see what the possibilities in CGI or GCI are, or what it is called. <br /> <br /> When I read somewhere, "You can't cut it into space", bad story and non-guided actors, you can't fix in the cutting room, or even the most amazing special effects! Things can be improved in the cutting room if they have a real director and the material they work on. <br /> <br /> But they thought it could be sold in the US when the US was an idea. > <br /> And is it not typical for such low budgets, they have to create an imaginative country in southern Mexico? Well Well, I'm gace it 2! Just because of special effects, the rest is an absolute trash!
