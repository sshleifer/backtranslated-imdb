First of all, I will question this movie title. Chupacabra is not a Spanish word. The name they refer to is "Chupacabras". I think they fell 's because it sounds in many ways, but I assure you that it is in Spanish only. <br /> <br /> Next, I thought this movie was made years ago. It came out as one of those B-horror clips I looked at when I was home when my husband was out of town. Then it would have been scary. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about special effects. The most important "effect" is the costume used in Chupacabras. Given that this is the main character, you would think that serious money would be put in it, but that is not the case. The shape, color and texture were all outraged as some stupid haunted houses in Disney World. <br /> <br /> There were times when Chupacabras walked where nobody could walk. His movement was nervous and strange at these times, but moving around on the floor looked like any normal man. The other thing I ask is that there is no animal in the world that kills everything he sees that he does not have to eat it. Chupacrab would kill one, then the next, but it never seemed like eating a victim. You say, "It's just a movie," and I agree. But the idea is so far away that it is stupid. <br /> <br /> Which country is Dr. Pena? She sounds like Jamaincan / Hawaii / British / Something-Else, but I think she should be Latino. The problem is that his accent is so bad that even Russian can say he is not Latino. <br /> <br /> The soldiers took the round after this thing and did not kill, but continued to shoot. I'm not a soldier, but do soldiers, especially such tactical forces like them, need any sense to accomplish these tasks? Didn't they think it was a waste of time and something new to try? They didn't. They were just burning, while Chupacabras continued to kill them and not eat. <br /> <br /> Did they kill a small dog? :) Anyway, my voice on this flick was 3 because it was bad. Why did I look at the whole thing? I'm sure you've done the same thing repeatedly, so don't give me a check. ;)
