One of many silent comedies, Stan Laurel, prior to Oliver Hardy's matching, "Mud and Sand" is a ho-hum hockey. The story is badly dispersed - though it may be due to today's editing - and humor itself is not at all inventive. <br /> <br /> Potential drawings are launched and ignored; for example, Stan's promise to pay Fillet de Sole a reward for what he has done to him never gets fruit. Stan's character also doesn't seem very central, but it's a general criticism of his work before he created Laurel & Hardy's "Stanley" fame, so maybe I was expecting this flaw. <br /> <br /> I firmly believe that all silent movies should be preserved and viewed, and I'm glad it is still available. It's not just a great movie.
