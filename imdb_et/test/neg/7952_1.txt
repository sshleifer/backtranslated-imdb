... Or is it below the barrel masterpiece? Preferably both! Somewhere between 1969 and 1972, there were several fearsome horror films that have all disappeared again. There is no need to explain, ask, or punish anything more. If you followed closely my writings about blood or GURU THE MAD MONK, then you know what SCREAM BABY SCREAM is. The title sounds cool; it's just a weak script that should have gone elsewhere! Nonetheless, it's hands down, the most terribly crafted craftsmanship of cinema that once worked on film! , Next time lucky! The real truth behind the script is never related to a film that allegedly speaks of a blue face psychopath "to kill" and makes some ugly face sculptures for its victims. Looks like you are looking at another episode of "SCOOBY-DOO" early. My favorite scene is a monkey cage where four young hippie teenagers play. And the hooray actress named "Eugenie Wingate", which gives us the worst facial makeover! 1969 has never been so bad, but it is! <br /> <br /> Try to find this 30-year-old rarity in the basement with five bucks; it makes a perfect new element to go back to the psychedelic day of these flowers, bad fashion and trash music! Interesting note: SCREAM BABY SCREAM is also listed in Troma Film Archives on the company's website. Only time will tell when it will reach the top of the bottom 100 list with some early 70s; gosh knows they need !!! PLAN 9 is history !!!
