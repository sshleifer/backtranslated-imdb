I watched this movie on some of the comments that said it was bad but funny. But you must warn that this film has the greatest special effect ever produced. They make films of the 1950s as films of art. It's occasionally funny, but it's usually annoying. And to unite the problem with serious perverse special effects, there is a complete lack of logic that characterized most of the events depicted. One of my favorites is where three characters fall into the hundreds of feet of an aragic tunnel and arrive to find it completely illuminated. Apparently, arachnia has also been able to connect to the network. Very impressive. But this is just one example. And what's worth it, sucks music to suckle, two wonderful girls are annoying, an unpleasant guy is annoying, the so-called beautiful leading man is a geek and a black girl who falls on him is stupid. His father is the worst actor I've ever seen. I'm not sure that short moments of humor can make up for the experience.
