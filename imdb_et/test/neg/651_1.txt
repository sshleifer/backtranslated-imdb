I didn't know that when I signed the "all pay TV" package with Direct TV, I can see such a movie. It came right after the second movie we watched ... and I was a teenager in 1981 so I'm not sure where I was ... but I missed that movie. <br /> <br /> can't believe we've left it. It's kind of funny because it takes you back to the time machine back in the early 80s ... but I think even then it would have been a painful film. It was just ... well ... "too cute"! ET was "cute" in a sense ... but not amazingly cute ... and stupid. <br /> <br /> When I see such a movie ... I come to IMDb to see what others are saying. I have blown away this thing! The Wow ... film industry has come a long way since the 1980s! Oh ... it showed some old actors ... btw, which is another thing I was surprised ... lineup ... not a bunch of names ... but some real actors / actors. Must Have Been On These Drug Days! Anyway ... strange, interesting, bizarre and making one happy when they grew up!
