I consider myself a fan of Jess Franco and his trash films, but almost every time I see one of them, I can easily see missed opportunities and plots that don't play well. Unfortunately, this movie is not different. The film certainly had a lot of possibilities, because Franco has blended the intriguing theme of the classic "The Most Dangerous Game" with its usual trashy slace, but the plot here is too often lost and Franco will forever get to the main point of the movie. Since this is a later Franco movie, you may be forgiven for thinking that the director would be better, but in fact I have found the opposite is true; because this and terrible Killer Barbys are his two worst films. At the center of the plot is a stripper and his buggy boy. The couple is invited by a rich woman and her lover to a private island. But they will soon find that they have not been called there for social reasons because they are "freed" on the island, so prosperous women and their friends can do them! <br /> <br /> What drew me to this film was the front panel and the fact that it was led by the King of Butterfly Gifts. Then you would think I would be happy that the film has many sexual scenes and a general gap; But I'm not. The reason for this is mostly that the sex and slip in the movie are really boring and most of the time only served to give me a condition called a itchy quick finger. But my tendency to see everything is complete, ensuring that I had to hit it. There was a time when I didn't think the girl in the girl could be bored, but since then I've proven to be wrong. The only positive thing I can pull out of the movie is that the soundtrack is quite pleasant and despite being stupid foreign pop music; it really fits well with sex scenes. I enjoyed the last ten minutes; when the plot finally went, but it was too little too late and unfortunately it is a very bright film. In general, I recommend this movie only to those who feel they have to see all 180+ Franco movies ... everyone else should look at Vampyros Lesbian, an obscene, or his killed Ecstasy.
