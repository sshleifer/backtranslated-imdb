The daughter of a rich businessman, who as a young girl with rheumatic fever and now suffers from shortness of breath, discovers that her father (whom he affectionately calls "Darling") organized his marriage with a charming ne'er well; worse than having a few weeks to live, leaving his wife free to marry his married romantic rival. Pure punk. The Paul Osborn scenario (a thin story by Jerome Weidman) outlines the second half of the setbacks instead of going on a plot that is already subjected to a gloomy speech in a soap-like scenario. Why go back when we understand what's going on for us? It is a "woman's cry" who doesn't believe in her target group, so simplicity is a structure. Dorothy McGuire, who is in most of the furs, is not a clever, wise heroine at all; when he is upset, he gets inward and stony. After understanding the marriage, she is basically shameful, she shrinks from her husband as a perfect virgin (well, this is an opportunity, she and Van Johnson are sleeping in a separate bed!). Ruth Roman has the best moments of the film when society grabs the trap assigned to Van, but what exactly do these women see? Johnson can be charming when it is needed, but puts it in a melodramatic setting, and he is also stony. MGM output values ​​are only so, but director Gottfried Reinhardt tries to add some visual taste to the rebound segments and he tries to live the movie in the original half hour. ** from ****
