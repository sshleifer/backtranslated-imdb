Even if I promise that my first two films wouldn't like the franchise, and I beat any biased tendency for Max's character, I can't judge myself on average the waste of the comic space that is so close to the soils that went before. <br /> <br /> A harsh nasty tape has passed, which has brought Mad Max Rockatansky into a sense of being affected by the destruction of apocalyptic world and, more importantly, the passion of the director George Miller for franchise. The scary score fits the heart of the film, it seems that the makers did not know what to do with the amount of money given to make this third {and, fortunately, last} installment. Of course, the stunts are on the ground (presumably now), and of course Miller will be able to paint a barren desert, purely what he has done before. Yet he obviously fought for fresh ideas, because the crowning honor of the Road Warrior petrol tanker is repeated here, only he uses the train instead! <br /> <br /> This is just a very bad show, which may have been the turn of ambitious events in the mid-1980s; but when you watch three movies, Thunderdome just comes as a director who loses his nervous approach, but unfortunately it falls between comedy and fantasy. And the truth is that neither of these genre slaves would have worked separately in the context of such a series. I only give movie 3/10 for one real good Thunderdome battleground, while the tricks here are worth at least credit. But this is the third time I've been trying to like such a movie, and if I am undoubtedly a punishment, if I am no doubt, I never want to try again.
