Not many people remember "Carey Treatment" and I can't say I blame them. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards did this in his lean years (ie between "Pink Panther" films) and the story of a doctor who turned to a detective (Coburn) who worked in his hospital to solve the murder, which is actually quite forgotten. <br /> <br /> Coburn is dependable as always and O'Neill is as beautiful as ever, but it just seems to be nothing in the process. Turns and twists of the story are not very involved, and even the climax that should be anti-nervous is rather intestinal intake. <br /> <br /> Missed opportunity and unfortunate, based on Michael Crichton's book. <br /> <br /> Well, at least Crichton didn't follow it. <br /> <br /> One Star. "Carey," Coburn.
