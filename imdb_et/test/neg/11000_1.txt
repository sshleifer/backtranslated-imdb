This is one of the most stupid and valuable movies. It really doesn't match the movie's state. It is very cheap (probably shot on a videotape), terribly acted and just rebelled. I couldn't believe how cheap and unfair this piece was. It seemed like a home video! I think I believe that the guy I know some houses have been dropped out has to dig out their camcorder and do it in 2 or 3 hours. It's so bad. I noticed the name of where it came from? Shelters? When renting Flick, check to see if this is the "business". One thing is true - if you like terrible action, amateur movies, you might like this loser. It's totally boring and terrible !!! You've been warned !!!
