I just looked at this "latest" version of Macbeth and I was pleasantly surprised by the firm action and the obvious effort that had to make a historic piece of art with a small budget into a fully observable movie. <br /> <br /> One note, however, was the music was very flat and did not add anything to the film's intensity and sounded like someone with a keyboard and a lot of samplers, not a full orchestral score. I think Paul Farrer needs his action together!
