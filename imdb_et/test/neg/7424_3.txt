A large biotech company, including the CEO's daughter, goes to the thick forests of the Pacific Northwest. When a search and rescue operation is called, Executive Director Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) will assemble a small group of messengers to complete his search and rescue mission. But exactly what Knowles is looking for and trying to save, and that's exactly what follows and looks in the woods? <br /> <br /> Oy, what a mess this movie was! It was disgraceful, for one for Lance Henriksen, one of my favorite musicians, and two, it could have been a decent film. It has two main drawbacks and they are probably the fault of writer / director Jonas Quastel - this movie (which I call this Sasquatch) is almost the worst editing I've ever seen in the dark (2005) and Quastel's constant counseling the pain seems to have been, "Okay, let's try it again, but this time I want everyone to talk to each other, improvise the non-offspring and generally try to be as annoying as possible". <br /> <br /> There was a chance. In spite of hanging (any material related to an aircraft apparently attempted to let The Blair Witch Project (1999)) and any material related to a named monster, Predator (1987) was looted; and potential for subtle and much less saccharin subtext. The monster costume, when we actually see it, was more than enough for my taste. A mixture of character-driven character types could have been great if Quastel and co-author Chris Lanning had reduced the stereotype notch from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time studying these relationships. Monster's "bay" was somewhat nice with product development, especially with the body decorating the primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001). If it had been well edited, some scenes had a proper dialogue that could easily have been effective. <br /> <br /> But Sasquatch's most frightening thing is the number of mistakes made: for some reason, Quastel thinks it's a good idea to hang dialogue scenes that take place in real-time in a matter of minutes, so we'll see a few rows of scene A instead then a few lines of scene B, then back to A, back to B, and so on. For some reason, he thinks it is a good idea to often use black screens between dialogs, do we need the point of unspecified time that moves between irrelevant comments or irrelevant comments appear to be one after another. <br /> <br /> For some reason he doesn't care whether scenes were shot in the morning, in the afternoon, in the middle of the night, etc. them randomly. In this regard, the scenes we display appear randomly. Important events that never appear, or hardly, and we have left too many pointless scenes. <br /> <br /> For some reason he continued to film the cave text if he needed more explanations to justify getting there, or it just had to be cut off because it was not so important (monster intelligence and "humanity" could just have shown otherwise). <br /> <br /> For some reason, there is an entire character - Mary Mancini - left in the script even if it is superfluous. <br /> <br /> For some reason, we are suddenly moving from an extremely soft core to porn, although the motive never repeats. <br /> <br /> For some reason, characters like Harlan Knowles call "H H" as they are in the Asian home stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Quastel calls for some reason a "blurry Cam" and "Distorto-Cam" monster attack on scenes, although the costume does not look so bad and it would have been much more effective to put some fog, fine filter or anything but bad cinematography. <br /> <br /> I can go ahead, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Did I really want this movie better than I did? I'm Henriksen fan, I'm interested in the topic, I loved this device, I love hiking and it's basically a one-way trip - but I just couldn't. Every time I thought it was "better than this point to the end", Quastel made another terrible move. Ultimately, my score was 10 out of 10.
