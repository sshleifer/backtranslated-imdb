OK, I've seen over 100 Troma movies and some of them are pretty bad. "Sizzle Beach USA." was terrible, and "I was a teenage TV terrorist" was unobtrusive, but it's a TROMA LIBRARY ATTENTION! <br /> <br /> Women are being held in prison and tortured when they try to escape. <br /> <br /> It's really terrible. Even when using movies. Doris Wishman and Hershall Gordon Lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this poor apology for the cult film. Avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br />
