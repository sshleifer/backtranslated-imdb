For me, this film is basically similar to the pilot episode of the functionality of TV series. This reminds me especially of the British remake of the TV series Wallander, starring Kenneth Brannagh. The people questioned by the police are resilient and often as bitter as the weather, the head of the investigator has big family problems, the investigations always lead to the atrocities of the past, and drawing is a maze of strange events and sub-blocks that only makes sense at the end. Both have excellent cinema. <br /> <br /> Jar City's drawing is remarkably reminiscent of the UK or US standard crime series. Effectively, you can take plots of some Frost Touch episodes and transfer them to the tiny spot of this movie and have an effective sequel. <br /> <br /> Really, the script probably couldn't be a cookie cutter. You get even the most familiar motives, for example, the police go to a local prison to interview a manipulative and dangerous psychopath who inevitably explodes at the end of the interview. <br /> <br /> I am absolutely convinced that this is a scam and jam for many folks, but I feel he has to show people like me who doesn't go to the cinema to watch TV. What I felt was the lack of a message. The theme of the film is genetic research in Iceland. Genetically expressed Icelanders have remained largely isolated from the outside world, giving scientists an excellent opportunity to study their genetics. A lot of information about heredity has been kept and many Icelandic genetic diseases can be effectively monitored by the population who have refrained from crossing and are significantly genetically homogeneous (like trying to put together a puzzle puzzle). London Underground Map Daisies Square Jigsaw. The DeCODE Genetics Company tried to create a complete database of genetic and hereditary information for the entire Icelandic population. Due to privacy, this project was discontinued and deCODE genetics in Iceland ended at the end of last year. An episode is a rich topic for discussion. <br /> <br /> But in the genetics and medical science of the film, there is no education because they are a strange atmosphere there. <br /> <br /> This is a sharp film if you are interested in it, and there is often a morbid focus on the food that accompanies the events, such as a coroner who eats lunch between incisions. For me, the hardest thing was when a head inspector eats a sheep's head. Unfortunately, from time to time it became a farce. The film attempts a rather delicate task of mixing up moody senses and finally ending with involuntary humor. It's a cinematic attempt to make a fugu, if you're not skilled enough, your hands and eyes are sharp, then a poison client. This, rather, a novice director would have had to reduce its performance by charging.
