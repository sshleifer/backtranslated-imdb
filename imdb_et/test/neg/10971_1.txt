This film takes a lot of freedom with known historical facts. Even small things like Flynn, who one by one strikes a temple, if he almost certainly would have used a moistened sponge, are one of the most annoying things. Flynn has never been killed or killed. He is not aware that he has loved his mother for another man, and it is not known that he would have had a homosexual relationship with anyone and that he did not reach Sydney's slipping mode. She did not get her twenty-year role with the In the Bounty watch, and that role did not make her a well-dressed movie star. <br /> <br /> This is just a mediocre movie where Errol Flynn's name is only about selling tickets and videos.
