Right up (or down) there with toys and Jurassic Park 2 and Phantom Menace. <br /> <br /> Some ads are expected to be semi-promising, but unfortunately, the entire film had a 30-second clean stroke at the 30-second slot on the small screen. <br /> <br /> If you want amateur writing, secondary effects, ridiculous costumes and all snoozefest ways to look at it. The plot is a recycled sci-fi feed. Too bad because I thought it would be bad, but hoped. It may be the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - don't look at it. <br /> <br /> If you didn't like it, of course, any of the above-mentioned movies.
