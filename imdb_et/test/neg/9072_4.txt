Ed (Kel Mitchell) is a teenager who lives in Good Burger, a small but friendly neighborhood hamburger, while his friend Dexter (Kennan Thompson) is also working there, but there is no Ed's unanimous commitment to his work because he is there because he accidentally destroyed his teacher, Mr. Wheat (Sinbad), and has to pay the money to compensate. When Mondo Burger, the mammoth fast leg disc, opens across the street, it seems that a good burger is history until Ed compiles a secret sauce that brings hundreds of new customers to its door. But Mondo Burger, Kurt (Jan Schweiterman), the monomanic leader has decided to put his hands on the sauce and put a good burger out. Meanwhile, Ed and Dexter have to rescue Otis (Abe Vigoda), the world's oldest fast food worker, the Demented Hills shelter, and Ed can just find love with Monique (Shar Jackson) if he could take his mind long enough to turn it on attention. A good burger is a children's comedy, a decent story, an actor, and a generally harmless children's film.
