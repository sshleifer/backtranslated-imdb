Hulk Hogan stands for the Champion of the Masters (a real acting stretch ...) called Rip, who is forced to defend his honor, his title and his girlfriend's greedy corporation who wanted to sign his network (because wrestling sells!) But when Rip falls, he can a network of battlefields called (and I'm totally serious) "Tough Boys' Battle" who is champion Zeus (played by Tiny Lister Jr.), perhaps the most deadly person. Rip refuses to fight until his brother is attacked and hospitalized. No Holds Barred is pretty much what I was waiting for Vince McMahon's production, which starred in the least versatile actor of the genre (Hogan), basically a lot of inadvertent humor, tons of uncomfortable sequences, a few okay sequences and tons of stupidity. In other words, it is not different from wrestling, so I give him a fair assessment mainly because anyone who rents it knows what they get. The film is cheap but well done for what it is and really the wrestling fans enjoy it. I myself found that it was finally fun. They are the moments of the absurdity that you only make yourself. (As an example, how Hogan's limo stuck in the limousine jumps 20 feet, how does it force the guy himself and, of course, how Hogan says out of his card. (IE: "I'm not going over when this control goes out!") No Holds Barred is fun , true, although it is mainly because it is ridiculous. Camp fans should really enjoy this clinker wisely. <br /> <br /> * * off 4- (fair)
