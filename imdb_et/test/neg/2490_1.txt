I did a screen test and read this turkey script in 1988. Now it was terrible and even worse - I noticed it in VHS's local HollowWood Video and said, "Oh, hey, gotta ang sine." They had to shoot most of Mexico after they ran out of money, a couple of "stars" shining females because they ran out of some exotic fruit drink. I think the plot plot is OK, but I know this writer has predicted that he has a spy trap that works all the time. <br /> <br /> Dr O finished the comic book. In the Kremlin wall, he still has to bury the grave. <br /> <br /> The technical flaws were in the movie, not only with the baby's atomic technology, but with the uniforms, symbolism, and jargon of the army. Of course, they were too cheap to hire a professional military adviser. Even Mr. Newman's August and the presence of experts could not fill this bird for Thanksgiving.
