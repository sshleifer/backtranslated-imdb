Once upon a time there was a big American film. That combined horror and comedy with equal excitement. This film was wise. Breakthrough special effects and great comedy and serious behavior. It was titled "American Werewolf in London." Sixteen years later, the long-awaited sequel to the poster desk was put on its local theater. Certainly it would be at least some of the original excitement. Think again. "American werewolf in Paris" is an incomprehensible confusion from the beginning to the bad finish. Problems start with a leading person. Tom Everett Scott's presentation is rigid and tiring. From the outset, he seems to have the intention of proving that all young people are simple. In his defense, even an experienced Shakespeare nationalist would not have been able to come out as a result of a juvenile and effortless dialogue. At one point, one of Scott's dead friends, who have been understood to walk on Earth after one of the werewolves has grown up, is finally able to leave the descendant. Then he goes to Scott and his friends. "Okay, guys, look." What a memorable goodbye. Julie Delphy will soon appear for Scott's mysterious European love. Basically she's a French girl playing a French girl. It's not much stretching. But all this stupidity is not even the most disappointing thing about the film. Special effects, such as an integral part of an excellent original text, are far behind the flop. Fools look like cartoons. And no matter how well you sculpt the crusts with blue lycanthrope muscles. Classic fear is still hard to fear. Instead of the ultra-weak Scott-led vacation, the American gang is still looking for excuses to return to the catacombs of werewolves. Here, this incompetent team of special effects is much easier to keep the computer under improved beings or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness. Some have said that if you don't follow this movie, it's not that bad. I do not agree, this film cannot stand by itself and is even more disgraceful than the brilliant original. If he did not want him to be seen, he would not have borrowed the title of most of the 1981 film. I don't care how much you love werewolves. Or how much did you worship the "American werewolf in London." as I did. It's not just wasting your time. "Okay, guys, look." Terrible. 3 out of 10 T.H.
