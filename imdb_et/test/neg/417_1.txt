A lot of commentators have noticed the plot's unreliability, especially Fr McKenna should have gone through a tremendous amount of trouble, and the impossibility of some of the calculations he should have done, including that Langdon deciphered every minute. McKenna is a trademark; a few seconds later he gives orders and a few minutes later he works (literally) for operations - in real life he would be in shock. And as usual in thrillers, the assassin did not kill the heroes, giving his only flat explanation that they weren't on the deadly list, as if every other innocent bystander. I have always used the Independence Day as a feature of a truly terrible movie (the US President directs a jet plane and wins aliens, ha ha), and this effort goes near it. For such an unreliable movie, angels and demons include a significant number of predictable incidents. Who didn't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get a reward for Volkswagen? I felt shouting, "You have to blow." Who didn't know that the heroine was going to find the body in the lab? Who didn't see this baddie? Technically, the film was terrible. The dialogue was more evident than clear, while the races over Rome to the next church were grievous with music. Moreover, many scenes seemed mud. One of the redeeming qualities was Roman shots and what seemed like a Vatican achievement because I am sure that the Vatican officials would not have wanted to hit it in St. Peter and its surroundings - and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magical place and I liked to see it briefly.
