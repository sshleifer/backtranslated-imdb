I admit that I watch a lot of really bad movies. But there is very little I think they are pretty bad when women were tails. This is a hiss of epic proportions. What should have been a sexy comedy about a woman who first discovered a woman is a boring, inanimate affair without a smile. Comedy is extremely weak. I think if you think someone in your head is funny, you can find a laugh or two. The guys in this movie look like the three Stooges look like high art. And it's just not enough to keep things together. It seems to be dragged on and on and on. Good question! And I have two answers. First, the curiosity of the film is not worth it. I find a little interest in the Italian spoof, such as one million years of B.C. Raquel Welch. I'll give you when the women got their historical "value" point. The other two points are only in the presence of Senta Berger. I know this is not an explanation or justification for the rating, but what are you going to do? This is the best I can come up with.
