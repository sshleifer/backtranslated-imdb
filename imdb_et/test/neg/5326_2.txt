One of the strangest films in cinema history. Wait, I'll take it back - this movie can't be put on any category related to "cinema"; it belongs to categories such as "waste", turds or similar categories. Ironically, it's even two of them. The film is "Men At Work", a light crime comedy featuring Estevez (Sheen) brothers since 1990. Asinine and the incredible plot line, bad performance, bad dialogue, poorly performing stunts and punches, continuity bugs, and high speed non-named players who never came to see again were still a bad movie (at the center, I mean). It was a movie that could be good for one thing: you can watch it about 200 times, learn each line, and repeat it back and forth publicly with your * wasted * friends, thus ensuring your 10th largest dorks status . <br /> <br /> To make things worse, I presented an IMDb trivia entry (along with this bad overview) to the IMDb webpage, if only because I noticed a foolish little punk music joke that apparently no one else was noticed yet ( Butthole Surfer Shape). I am so inconsistent why I should even * waste * my time, which looks like a supportive trivia, if what I really want to do is blow up Emilio's acting career (no, wait, she's already done it myself. Thank you, dude!) I'm so glad I wasted * only time, not real money. Can I have at least one tenth of my budget for this? Anyone other than this director (Emilio) could have made two or three much better films just like they blew in the car, carefully placing the bikini-covered bimbos and beating useless additions (henchmen) in haz-mat suits. I would mention Emilio's writing credit, but it would be a stretch to name this scenario in "writing" - it is rather the idea of ​​cartoon-drawn cartoons. And Charlie Sheen, if you read it, I'll assume that M.A.W. must have been done during your career when you were exhausted, a whore-loving Hollywood brat who hadn't grown up yet. (Okay, I'm sorry, some of your life is not over yet. Well soon, "half man." Such a promising talent, so * wasted *?
