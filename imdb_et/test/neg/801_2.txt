Established in 1976 for obvious reasons other than keeping locked up, "The Box" was directed by Richard Kelly ("Donnie Darko") and celebrates Cameron Diaz and James Marsden Norma and Arthur Lewis, a young couple allegedly struggling financially, although they both have a successful career - he is a high school teacher, he is an optical specialist at NASA's Langley, Virginia Research Center. They have one child, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). One day, Lewis finds a pack containing a black box with a large red button at his fingertips. 'Mr. Steward ", which shows that he can explain the box before 17:00. <br /> <br /> The mysterious Arlington Steward, played by Frank Langella, will appear for a specified time, nattily attired in the elegant Savile Row suit. but her most noticeable feature is her face, half of which seems to be blown and improperly cared for. Langella is the only thing to watch in the movie, but she is unfortunately her own makeup similar to Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight" Harvey 'Two Face' Dent (Aaron Eckhart) It's like an elephant in the room: you can try to ignore it, but it's more than a bit confusing. <br /> <br /> Steward explains that he will return to the button after 24 hours. The only catch - and that's big - is that somewhere the stranger dies. It can be the whole city, it may be on another continent, but Steward assures them that the victim is an hour for them As an example of good faith, he leaves them with a chronic $ 100 bill to hold the button or not. <br /> <br /> Arthur and Norma are skeptical, believing that the whole thing is a scam or a tricky confusion, but it won't be long before they start thinking about what would happen if they pressed this button? Would they really get a million dollars? Does anyone really die? Wearing speculation, Norma hits the button. Nothing will happen. But their initial relief gives you the opportunity to bother when Steward comes up with a suitcase full of cash the next day. They decide to call the whole thing, but Steward says it's too late. "You've already pressed the button," he explains. As Steward's limo shrinks, Arthur notes the license number he will later discover to the National Security Agency. <br /> <br /> At this point, the film begins to shoot in a deeply unacceptable area as secondary characters start bleeding and flashing peace marks. In the meantime, the city will be attacked by bad guys, jaw jaws in bad shirts starting to follow Arthur, as a pre-eminent party to compete with the zombie aliens nerds. Finally, Arthur traps the library with threatening book transitions (?), Where Steward's spinsterish woman sees - whom we have not seen so far - and tells Arthur that he must step into one of three vertical columns that look shiny to leave the library. "What happens when I choose the wrong one?", Asks Arthur, it seems much less confusing if he should be in a situation, and certainly much less confused if the audience is by then. "An eternal destruction," says spinster maliciously. <br /> <br /> Arthur will step into the middle column of digital liquid effects, and after a short absence, suddenly, the water will appear on Norma's bed. When he wakes up and sees him, the water bubble breaks, and Arthur falls into the bed in the shower, which strangely continues to flow into the pipeline directly from the camera area, while the alternation between Marsden and Diaz is confusing, I know. <br /> <br /> Finally, we learn that Steward was once the NSA's public relations officer until he was hit by a lightning bolt that destroyed part of his face. He was declared dead, but later he came back, having become a kind of superman who now serves "those who make lightning" and whose powers have allowed him to take over the CIA, NSA and NASA. And what's the point of all this nervous rubbish? Obviously, Steward's mission is to put some sort of Biblical character test on people (eg, "Binding Isaac") to determine if humanity is worth saving. If enough people pass a button test, refusing to push it, save Steward's godly bosses from the race. Unfortunately, people who push this button, like Norma and Arthur, will be punished for their moral spinelessness, which is why they are subjected to a number of harsh Lady or Tiger trials that play like one of them. We saw the films except for the benefit of fun gore or a single plot. <br /> <br /> "Box" is a meaningless mental masturbation that students of fantasy philosophy want to be attracted to by a couple of beers. Richard Kelly is a tedious exercise in existentialist fraud, eventually under his own misunderstanding; The tortured melange of unusable ideas will ultimately undermine, as with too many colors, the inclined gray of the film, which is uncomfortable as one of those flying films that have no more or less grounds on the plot. Quenched with a calm nap. <br /> <br /> Boxis is the point where Arthur, a technically meaningful man, becomes curious about how the button works. Opening the device is disappointing that you can't find anything inside. <br /> <br /> Having seen the box, I know exactly how it feels.
