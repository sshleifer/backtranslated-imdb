European films can be slower and smaller plots than American films, but it goes too far. It also shows a number of imperfectly drawn characters that make unexplained things. It's not fantasy, it's not even surreal, it's just uncomfortable and bad. <br /> <br /> What's the message here? That people in France are comfortable and morally looking at a lot? That they would like to see other people who have sex? They spontaneously scream or touch his stranger? Do not wear the watch while watching this movie because you will be surprised at how little has been explained or learned during the massive period. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a "police superintendent" who is deeply concerned about the brutal murders of a little girl, although in reality she seems to be concerned about it. He is not just disturbed by his own personal tragedies, but he is probably mentally slow, behaving very much like a six-year-old child with learning difficulties. He barely looks, walks his hands as hard as a little boy, speaks in shine, simulating, toning, behaving strangely in all his interactions (though no one can see it carefully or carefully, even if it should be police work). He's not a troubled policeman, more ambulatory. Picture of Andy Kaufman's Latka symbol in a taxi, but without humor. He is not only credible as a policeman, who he is not believed to be an adult. The fact that he won the prize for interpreting this character is truly amazing - if he didn't play that part exactly as it was written and the guilt is who wrote it. The plot is clearly secondary. Don't wait to see something far away as the police would do when a little girl is found. This is not so important, although the credibility of their behavior is offensive. The problem is that the rest of the movie doesn't make any sense either. It leaves a long time for fields, vegetable gardens, human faces to remain in the near future. The final hit was particularly ridiculous - it was not supported by all the events that followed - if you don't think, "What's the worst way this movie would end?" <br /> <br /> There's a lot of sex and nudity that should mean something. Want vaginas? You see the vaginas. Don't worry, it's art. It has a deep meaning, which I am not sure of. Besides, the protagonist seems to have some homoerotic neck or fetish in spite of his innocent wonder. <br /> <br /> Finally, the subtitles are white and often appear on a white background - very hard to read much about them. On the other hand, there is not much dialogue, so this is not a big problem. There is also very little sound in the film - not even the surrounding sounds that could be expected from the emptiness of the whole experience. Old Woody Allen should have parodyed this work. <br /> <br /> That's the award-winning movie is sad. I wouldn't want to see losing movies. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
