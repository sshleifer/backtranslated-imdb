Matthew Aldrich. It's a name that deserves to be remembered. This is the person who took the fingers on the keyboard and came out of one of the slowest scripts. Clich√©. Predictable. Insulting public intelligence. <br /> <br /> Is he the only culprit? Of course not. Renny Harlin took this notorious excuse for the script and made it a movie. Sam Jackson and Ed Harris read it (or not) and chose this letter. The weakness is very high. <br /> <br /> This is Denise Richards, a movie script. There is not enough Razzy in the universe to properly recognize how really this terrible writing is. <br /> <br /> In all justice, Samuel Jackson's profession is incredibly novel and the way it is very creative, but at the end of the day, it's just decorations. Pretty decorations. <br /> <br /> Pack it in any way - writing garbage is still writing garbage.
