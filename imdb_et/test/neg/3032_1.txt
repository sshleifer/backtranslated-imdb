The words can hardly describe how terrible this Irish vanity project is (financed by Canadian taxpayers - both federal and Albertan). <br /> <br /> A nice-looking Canadian wife (Kathy Ranheim) will appear unexpectedly. in real life, Alberta was a star-athlete, not for any other reason to secure Canada's content. Credits also show that some Calgary pubs were helpful. <br /> <br /> Everything here is badly filmed and with at least a third hand (poorly digested Trainspotting, readings, digging and reservoirs). . Avoid like a plague if you do not want one of these camps "so bad that it's almost funny" nights in front of your TV.
