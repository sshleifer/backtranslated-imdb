A low-rent, cheap-made police thriller, considered fair humor, a chemistry between two fabrics, and particularly a satisfying procedure by James Remar as a narcissistic, psychopathic (and of course, indestructible) villain. Obviously a low-quality image, both visually and dramatically, with rather retracted Burt, but not invisible. (**)
