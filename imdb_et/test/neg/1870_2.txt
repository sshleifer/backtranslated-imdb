I don't know why IMDb lists all Ghoulies movies for theater. They were all directly on video. The same applies to the Puppet Master series. Why hasn't anyone noticed it yet? Right, somehow, you've been through Ghoulies IV, probably 1993's old old abandoned video rental store. You looked at the discount section and found it ... Look at the back and front panels. What are you waiting for, Shawshank's redemption? There is no need to review this film so critically. This is the fourth film of GHOULIES! I bought this from a DVD 6.50 because ... it was 6.50 .. I knew it wasn't Kubrick's material. And I was right. Ordinary DVDs without attachments, not even trailers, are hidden in the film. <br /> <br /> It actually includes the first Ghoulies movie, Peter Liap, who actually didn't get much "big" roles other than these two movies. And I don't understand why ... She's not too bad an actor and is pretty fun. But I think if you have to lead Ghoulies movies, Scorsese and Tarantino will lose interest. Also, his idiot is a baton of Bobby Di Cocco, who, despite having very little similarity to Al Pacino (very small), retains his ability to act ... A complete idiot who is simply uncomfortable to watch. Then Stacie Randall - probably a porn star, I don't have to watch it. She looks pretty sexy, although her costume, her character and everything she does, pulls the credibility of the movies, which is not an easy task for such a movie. <br /> <br /> Then Ghoulies itself! Who can let us down. Ghoulies III made them start talking, no mistake. 1, but Ghoulies IV takes this step further. Instead of being dolls, this time the Ghoulies are actually KOSTUMES KIDS !! The filmmakers decided to drive this extra mile to offend the film's viewers. There are also only two of them, and they are not the main highlight of the film, because they don't appear much of it. But sometimes they're fun fun ... And they're not bad this time either. <br /> <br /> It's really a fun thing to do, it's amazing that I really had the chance to enjoy it. I don't like why ... Some black humor is actually funny, though the script is mostly effortless. Imagine Satan's only risk to you that he "will kill you slowly ... painfully ...". <br /> <br /> But at least Full Moon did not participate at that time. Did they do that? Yes, a very bad and cheap film with 0 output, but not so bad to be Puppy 1/2, lawn mower Man 2, Santa or even Ghoulies III.
