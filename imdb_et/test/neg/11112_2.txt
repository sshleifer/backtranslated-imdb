Chupacabra Terror: 2/10: It was a team of navy seals that pulled the balance from a bad-chewing film to a bad one. So far there was a lot of bad movie baggage, but a seal? They wear bicycle helmets that are painted black. You know those who have air vents that make every adult wearing them look the whole. Of course, a cruise ship could have a second clue to welcome a cruise ship (it didn't change it around the Tampa Bay, not to mention the ocean)? and their tactics wouldn't go through the third level XBOX game. <br /> <br /> Does director John Shepphird have photos of John Rhys-Davies in a compromising position with Hobbit? Because I can't think of another reason why he would be in this movie. Other participants have a great excuse. They are talented, unattractive cages that didn't become a sign of information. The plot is that two men are trying to smuggle Chupacabra (Love to Name), which is being smuggled into the salon. <br /> <br /> Sets consist of terrible cruise ship counterfeiting (with large chimneys). a small apartment), monster killing is at the bottom of the barrel, there is no nudity, and many really bad actors refuse to end the scenes of their death. Particularly disturbing is the character of the 60's Doris Day movie gigolo. <br /> <br /> Cast bleeding in ketchup, while Chupacabra bleeds from day to day in green to dark blood. (Why is the Mexican mammal eating goats bleeding, except red, is farther away from me.) <br /> <br /> Every B movie has a tilting point that makes it fun (Hey, this is a lesbian shower, OMG ate it eyes) or not so much fun (did they just call those forty overweight boys wearing overalls and bicycle helmets on the Navy Seals?)
