I heard this movie for the first time when Patton Oswalt spoke about it on his "werewolves and lollipops" CD. He said it was a lost classic that is completely ridiculous. Being a terrific lover of cinema, I knew I was a treat. <br /> <br /> This movie is under your hands, one of the strange things I've ever seen. Definitely one of the strange movies. Basically, the demon took the man back years ago for the woman, the woman died or something, the demon wept blood, the blood fell to bed, the bed has now occupied and now eats. With fruits, flowers and chicken, it is also delicious for people. People can range from hornyiste teenagers, mayors, gangsters, servants or professional orthodox fans. There's also a sick boy who ate in bed, but put his breath behind the picture in the room. <br /> <br /> Most movies let you show off through exciting activities. There is another way to go about the deathbed: it basically tells the story of what is happening at the time of the slow, deafening murder scenes. I must also say that everyone who eats in bed is surprisingly quiet. I think that if the bed eats you through a fair trial of fifth-class science, that would be little. I don't think nerve sections were invented before 1981 or so. <br /> <br /> The story is unpleasant, the direction is slow and quite terrible, the sets are sparse, it works quite painfully and the brother is one of the inadvertently dirty actors I've ever seen. It would probably be a big party table when it comes to alcohol and smart things. It should definitely not be left out.
