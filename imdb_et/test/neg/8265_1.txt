This episode was boring and wasn't even in horror, so far this season's fears have given one really good episode ... The Damned Thing ... it's still early, I believe episodes are getting better. I admit that the vampire episode was okay, but there was no definite style. The episode of a couple who tried to kill the serum began to be boring, but the last fifteen minutes were really good. Although I am just frustrated by the lack of originality and horror of the first season episodes. Please save this season to John Carpenter! I believe Pro-Life will redeem the entire season. <br /> <br /> "You're an angry little elf!"
