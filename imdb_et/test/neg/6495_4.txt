This film suffers from the fact that Hollywood has no idea for years how to package Jackie Chan's packages. His low budget Hong Kong movies were all fast paced kinetic thrillers that highlight his amazing gymnastics skills and talents for easy comedy. His early Hollywood films hit him in the same films that were packed for Stallone or Chuck Norris. The character of Chan in this film is nothing that requires the character to be Asian, except for his star. In her Hong Kong films, Chan is never bored because movies are one of the fastest martial arts sequences, but "Protector" is lifeless throughout life. Danny Aiello cannot do either job, and the absence of these two chemistry is probably the result of a script and direction than the two participants together. Both have been better in inferior movies. The best thing about the movie is Hong Kong settings. The worst part is the terrible way that Jackie Chan comes in both colorless and drab. It would not be the "Rumble in the Bronx" made in Canada that the West would finally explain how to make a good Jackie Chan movie.
