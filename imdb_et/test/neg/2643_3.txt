If in a leading role it would not be very attractive to Jennifer Jostyn, I would have turned off Milo in the first 30 minutes. But as simple as the eyes are, it's not enough to save that movie, not to shoot it long. <br /> <br /> Milo starts a group of young girls who are accompanied by a "young boy" in a forest house with a yellow slice, showing them embryos in jars. Apparently, this agreement was that when he showed them the jars, Milo gets his gynecological exam in return. One of the group's volunteers was Milo's "first patient" and he led him behind closed doors. Moments later, blood flows from under the door and we are thrown to this day. Enter the lovely Jostyn who plays one of the girls who have grown up today. A secondary-trusted substitute whose closest friend seems to be a goldfish will be invited to return home to a friend's wedding. Yep! You guessed it. Back to Miloville. Milo, who allegedly drowned years ago, seems to have a dilemma that will remain dead and start terrorizing and murdering girls whom he has not "explored" all those years ago. one of Cronenberg's "The Brood" mutants. He might have been scary, but how does this frightening person wear a yellow raincoat? The confusion of the plot itself and the conclusion left me wanting my 90 minutes ago. I'm sending Milo, an intuitive movie, to stand in the corner!
