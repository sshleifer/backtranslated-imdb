George Sluizer's The Vanishing, called The Man, who wanted to know, is one of Europe's quietest disruptive sociopaths and one of the most memorable finals (Tarantino's stolen steal for Kill Bill Volume 2), but it has much more to offer. Playing chronologically and reversing the usual clich√©s of traditional "lady-lost" parcels, it also offers excellent characteristics and strong, under-performing, but convincing performances. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can only assume that the new version, Sluizer, was so sure that no one else could destroy his movie if he was able to do it himself, but few people should have predicted if thoroughly his work in the trash. His career has never recovered from this disaster. <br /> <br /> The Chief Culprit is the amazing power of Jeff Bridges, who has thought through all the details to a truly catastrophic level. A friend who made one of his first films said Bridges was a great instinctive actor when you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this movie is a pudding proof. Every movement is just too mechanical, so it looks like a rusty toy, while its voice is a strange mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas taxi and Dalek, all of whom have taken the doctrines of Dok-e-E-ville. There is no deception, just a looney, who walked with an invisible sign over his head, saying, "Please. Let. I'll kill you. Thank you. But the accusation must be shared here, none of the performances are good: they often don't even look good ? Keifer Sutherland looks like a baby hamster, when a deliberate man ending in a quick scene at a gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock is not at all impressed by his obsession with the subject, not that they have received any help from either the director or writer Todd Graff, the script is Particularly weak when focusing on a pair of brides to focus on Bridges, the worse is that the movie is hurrying, clearing life and character in every scene competition to get to the next / Low mood disorder in a couple relationship or apparently casual but meticulous location, we can just a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he is probably better without him. after all with lame, best not to go there? this is the advice that applies to canceling the entire train train. Even the shockingly fun and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything about it.
