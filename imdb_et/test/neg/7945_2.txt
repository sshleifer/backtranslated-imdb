Los Angeles, 1976. Indie film brat John Carpenter, fresh out of school and with a single film - his 2001 budget, called Dark Star, under his belt, completes his class project, named Assault On Precinct 13. The story of a nearly abandoned police station constrained by the invisible LA gang, it was a small hit in the drive and earned little praise from just a few caregivers, but it barely saw the film as a world fire, unlike Carpenter's up-up Halloween (1978). In the area, Carpenter had still learned how to use his almost non-existent budget, using lower-shelf participants, keeping activities in one of the hellishly small locations and moving the film at a little pace with editing, a combination of intelligent camera work, and the Savvy genre turned on. <br /> <br /> Nobody wants or needs to be hungry in Hollywood, especially if the weekly meal bill for the 2005 version of Assault On 13 is greater than the total cost of the original. It translates the filmmaker into a type of laziness - you have a foolishly large union team, a studio and a marketing company that all make you think. That's why, twenty years after watching Carpenter's movie, I've still seen every glorious moment, from the cold blood of the little girls at the time of buying the ice cream, to the relentless pounding event. A week after the 2005 attack, I remember Larry Fishburne's eye-catching ping-pong eyes and little else. <br /> <br /> "Forgettable popcorn actioner" is perfect for a poster. This is the New Years Eve at Precinct 13, a station that closes with skeleton workers to see their recent times. Calling is Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), an ex-narc who is now deeply concerned and collided with Jack Daniels and Seconol after his partners are frozen in the opening picture; Iris (Soprano's Drea de Matteo), a nymph with a criminal type, and Jasper (Brian Dennehy), a rough old timer, one of the scotch's retirement. Like the Carpenter attack, a bus with four powerful criminals is directed to the train. All the cozy eyes are on the gangster bishop (Fishburne, which is still in the matrix), who has narrowly survived the murders of a secret police and intends to break the endemic corruption in an organized crime unit led by Marcus Duvall (tired, Gabriel Byrne). Soon the phones are turned off, power lines are down, and both the thin and the police are armed with a serious police arsenal and consumed with paranoia, driving a war against the Duvall corrupt police team working on white balaclavas, bullets, red bazookas and more high-tech devices than Skywalker Ranch. It is assumed that when helicopters call the top of the police station when shooting in rocket windows, this is a secret action that covers the Duvall tracks. He can also take out billboards at the Hollywood boulevard. <br /> <br /> As with the recent seventies genres Dawn Of The Dead, Assault 2005 takes the most important items of John Carpenter's original and quotes the seventies as "Is It Your Own Man". The main question is - why? John Carpenter's 1976 is a favorite among genius boys, but it is hardly a collective public consciousness. Carpenter himself was busy recreating the classical western Rio Bravo of Howard Hawks for a tight, claustrophobic city thriller for just $ 20,000. French wunderkind director and rap producer Jean-Francois Richet, an independent fan of John Carpenter, seems to be less concerned about worshiping Hawks or JCs - although the script is referenced to cowboys and injectors - and seems to be deliberately squeezing so much lightning and firing power, how multi-million dollar budget can withstand. The result: some tense moments with hand-held POV cameras, unexpectedly high (and bloody) body numbers, a pair of clean plot twists, but essentially a Class B cityman with a much inflated price tag. As far as the names in Carpenter are concerned, it is a pure idea of ​​the filmmakers that will not pay off. I tell Monsieur Richet that I was traveling, and I wish you good luck in your music career.
