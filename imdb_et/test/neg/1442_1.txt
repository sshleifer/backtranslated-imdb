All I talked to said that this movie would be good and very weird so I thought I'd rent it. On the side of the film, I was thinking about myself what the hell happened and what the idea of ​​this movie was. This movie from start to finish is so bad that even the diseased parts of the movie didn't bother me. I mean what they are going to do with the next volcano 2 Return of the stage. I mean, this movie is so stupid that the characters are so badly developed and on the eve Robert Englund makes the film worse. I mean, he might also be Freddy Kruegur and Spook. I was actually a bad guy to win this is how bad it was. I mean, Dad is a cop he didn't know about the very caring fact that his daughter passes one of his life moments. I mean, if my daughter was treated so I would do my best to keep the guy behind the prison. It also seems obvious that Dee Snyder's character would be bad. This is one of the worst movies of all time there Volcano and 8mm. Don't wear your time that you don't enjoy ....! <br /> <br /> Grade If there was no grade on this site, I would choose what this movie is bad for!
