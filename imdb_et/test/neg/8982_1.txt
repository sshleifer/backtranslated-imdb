This movie was not such a book. <br /> <br /> Everything was mixed or changed. Most of the movies were things that were not even in the book. <br /> <br /> This movie should never have been seen. It was a big disappointment for me when I enjoyed the book so much and then I was watching this film splashing all over. <br /> <br /> I would never want this movie to be a fan of Nora Roberts or JD Robb. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this movie hasn't been watched when you really left the book.
