I clicked on Encore Mystery to wait for the movie I wanted to see on Dr. Moreau Island. I just got a few minutes from Shadow Conspiracy. The old man runs with Charli and grabs him. Suddenly, Assassin touches an old man across the street from a bright rain coat (with an old side arm). After waiting for "C" and waiting for "A", "A" is waiting for C, and obviously will not go. "C" was a much easier target, the old man couldn't drive far. Duh! There's a chase and "C" on the elevator "A" on the roof, so he tries to shoot a cable that is parallel to "A". He hits and hits the cable impossible. Later, this time with a special rifle, "A" rises from "50" to "C", but is silly to notice the motorcycle that arrives and touches the rider instead. How can Charlie get her parts? Does the father go to the producers and say, "Look, my child needs a job ..." It reminds me of my fool of Sit. All actors are good, except. I usually have to wait for C.S.I for 2 or 3 minutes. to come. Let's see what I can do next hour. I know, I cut my toenails! Better use of my time.
