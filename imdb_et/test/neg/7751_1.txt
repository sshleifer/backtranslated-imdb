This movie is a strange story of fantasy that I'm sure it doesn't like anyone over the age of 10, but it's too strange for kids. The plot is stupid and the actor is one of the worst I've ever seen. 25-year-old Kathy Ireland plays a teenage girl who is 9 years old. He seems to have received the voice of his character by listening to Alvin and Chipmunks. His high-level, funny baby voice is going to be annoying for the second time. All the others are bad, but in fact Kathy is Ireland's worst. The plot is also a terrible and sort of blend of Alice in Wonderland and Mad Max. Wanda Saknussem (Ireland) receives a letter saying that his father, who had left him long ago, fell to Africa, and when he was looking for him, he fell underground, full of strange people with an Australian accent. This is one of the horni lines of the corniest movie you will ever see. <br /> <br /> This is a tedious effect that this movie uses to develop character. Kathy Ireland is a nerd who doesn't do anything or go anywhere. She flies to Africa .... wow what development! He falls off his glasses and doesn't need them. Why not dropping your glasses might make them nervous. It should represent his descent into darkness. It's just stupid. The only positive thing I think is the semi-effective special effect and the camera work and the musical score sound good. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is a ridiculous family fantasy that only turns to those who don't expect something to film. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 84 minutes. PG for violence.
