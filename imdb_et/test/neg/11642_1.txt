If you are a witness to bad movies for bad movies, bad deeds, poor production, etc. Jim Brown will be reminded forever that this is one of the biggest football players ever playing ... as an actor, he will be remembered forever as one of the biggest football players ever playing the game ... I'm not sure who Rolf Bayer was ... but i hope he was 15 or 16 years old when he was in charge, maybe he was next to Spielberg ... because if he was an adult man who led it ... 15 years or 16 could have Better Doing .... The film's base or plot probably had some historical value and maybe even really accurate ... but the real movie may be one of the worst movies in American film history ... I was waiting for Lee Marvin, William Holden or Charles Bronson to wait to somehow save any "face" from this movie. I would have loved to have had a red carpet in a black tie gallery to unlock Hollywood when this movie was viewed ... because this movie had to have a lot of viewers who smiled and jumped under their breath ... this is a dime on DVD shelves now ... look for entertainment value ... this movie is so bad that it is too good to go on ...
