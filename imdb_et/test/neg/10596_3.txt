The DVD sleeve explains the assumption: "The three teens of the problem are in jail," and "are set to take the time until Captain Greer offers them a lot of work to work for him - secret." The movie opens with "Mod" and "Squad" so you don't have to search for them in the dictionary. For the "Cool" visual definition, look for photos from the original thirty: Michael Cole (Pete Cochran), Clarence Williams III (Linc Hayes) and Peggy Lipton (like Julie Barnes). <br /> <br /> One black. One white. One blonde. When they're cool, the three who make up the "The Mod Squad" version of Scott Silver's Aaron Spelling are the twenties: Claire Danes (like Julie Barnes), Giovanni Ribisi (Pete Cochran) and Omar Epps (like Linc Hayes). They can't do much with this material. The portrayal of Mr Ribisi is the most "remote", which means he loses most of his original character. Mrs Danes romanticizes Josh Brolin (Billy Waites), who looks like she could be transforming into "Marcus Welby, MD". You don't think this cozy Michael Lerner dances with Mr. Epps "Linc". He explains, "I'm not a fairy, I like to dance!" and asks, "Turn me on!" <br /> <br /> *** Mod Squad (1999) Scott Silver ~ Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, Omar Epps
