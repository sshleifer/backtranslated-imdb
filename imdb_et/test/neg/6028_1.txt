I have also been a husband's spouse, even though my situation was psychological rather than physical. He presented a very respectable, responsible and generous personality to anyone who saw us together, which, unlike ourselves, made others treat me and unstable. Initially, I was so incredibly attracted that someone like Gus (who worked in the bank and was confident) even gave me the time, and I fell completely on IDE, not the person. he was. If I were straight on my head and felt better at him, I would have no chance of getting married. But this is my mistake. It wasn't my mistake to abuse it. I do not deserve it, nor did I see it until I get into the heart, criticism and isolation. He acted like I had no company that had a different opinion from his opinion - in fact he went further. If I disagree, he assumed that I misunderstood and would simplify my wording ... by the time I finally lost my self-esteem, I could not recognize that I was involved, and I had to actually hit the outside . My father said Gus called me a bitch. Well ... it was half a year before the rage that started at that moment exploded and I offered some things at work, and I left. ..and it was several months before I realized that I was abused, and that it wasn't my fault he did. ..... so please, anyone who assumes it is the victim's fault, THINK !!! When a puppy is called by a brutal owner, when in a worrying situation is this a carpet accident, do you blame the puppy? By the time the abuse in the relationship reaches an obvious violent level, the target of abuse has been so wounded and depersonalized (as in the Nazi concentration camps) that it is almost impossible to accurately assess this situation, because by that time the victim has believed all the terrible things that the perpetrator forced. Have a heart, people. Marking the victims of abuse as a stupid moor is like someone who has already been terribly beaten. -------> and it helps how ???
