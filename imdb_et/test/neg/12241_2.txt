When I saw movie previews on television, I thought it might be a funny movie. I was wrong. Everything, though I'm not completely against the movies that entertain others. Some are actually funny, like the first scary movie. It was one of many that was made late, which is not. The humor of this movie was nothing but funny and was quite boring. <br /> <br /> I feel one of the biggest problems is that they cut fun for many movies, like Varsity Blues, Friday night lights. etc. And if you're like me, you're trying to pick out every movie instead of paying attention to what's going on. Even the adult humor of this movie was dry. Make yourself a favor and save money and time by renting a movie
