This is probably the worst film I've ever seen. I think you get the title. There is also a specific scene of love that could be more strange in the film's history. I don't even remember why I saw this movie or when. Only this is an absolutely terrific movie viewing experience. On the other hand, if you are looking for an absolute strange movie to waste two hours of your time, rent it anyway. Good luck finding it in your local shop. I doubt this film is very widespread. And don't show it to the kids in any way, because it can integrate their impressive thoughts forever.
