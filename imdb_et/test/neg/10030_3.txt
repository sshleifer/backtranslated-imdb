The predator has an interesting history if you don't remember newspaper ads in June 1984, maybe you have left the movie channel in the summer of 85, but you can't remember.

The tagline for this image claims it is not human, and it has received AX, but Ax was used only in these first two killings. Now we have a number of teenagers who look like they were in their mid-20th century. We all know they are Prey, and the monster strikes them one by one. The 80-minute movie seems to be longer.

Hey Prey had the potential to be a fear killer in the movie, but it would be a bit short. Attention, the monster has gone into the films of the Addams family of the 1990s.
