What could I have thought of Irene Dunne when she accepted a role in this striking account of a woman with negotiable morality? Certainly, the 1940s Irene Dunne, whose reputation as a faithful Roman Catholic, who publicly intimidated her mouth and looked at film scripts or Hollywood society, which could even be interpreted as corrupt public morality, would never be such a suspicious project as it is. <br /> <br /> Maybe the New York Cardinal Spellman gave his private audience a good role with his role? That we probably never know how much he didn't talk about it in later years, though he condemned his morally suspected (albeit quite successful) 1932 movie "Back Street" as a "trash." <br /> <br /> Certainly, by the time he became prominent in 1965, St. Robert Bellarmine's prize for exemplary Catholicism, mostly the public did not remember "Ann Vickers". <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that "Ann Vickers" doesn't work as entertainment or social commentary. <br /> <br /> Miss Dunne as a marital social worker who sleeps (rebuilding prisons and writing the best seller during remedial treatment) is not compatible with her temperament or behavior of the screen, and one suspects that the whole thing is a blush on the tongue (which we still think when we know the look of Miss Dunne's sympathetic hope that lies on the strike of a woman's imprisonment?)) At the end of the film, she has abandoned her career to marry (not convicted convicted Walter Huston - and what embarrassment would it ever have for romantic tying) <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne's graduates will undoubtedly want this curiosity as an opportunity to hear her promise to restore her cocaine addict to her: "I'm going to get you out of the cold turkey!" <br /> <br /> Well, if anything else like this cute move, present your light years with your regular operator, the furbellowed chiffon and the strawberry phosphate milieu - a cocaine addiction that is not the first subject associated with inappropriate Miss Dunne.
