On the contrary, LOSE ARK RAIDERS is a completely worse adventure for David Hemmings to save World War II with valuable cargo. Assets include beautiful New Zealand settings, Brian May's energetic music score and some dandy helicopters and jet boats. Bad, however, goes far beyond good. Donald Pleasence's hams like maybe ever; half of his dialogue is almost incomprehensible. George Peppard is trying to get an Australian (I think) accent, then gives it halfway down. Lesley Ann Warren is the most irritating to her. Ken Wahl is fine, Ken Wahl. Dialogue is painful to hear and Hemmings' direction is largely incorrect. The script is not only obvious but terrible. Jokes fall flat, scenes do not hit, and consistency is virtually non-existent. According to the final credit, two men were killed during the film making pilot projects. What waste.
