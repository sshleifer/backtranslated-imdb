QUATERMASS XPERIMENT Lame rip-off (1955): The first half is deadly boring, even tough - but the final stages are significantly improved when scenes include a robbing "monster". The accompanying featurette (a pretty dry thing in just 9 minutes compared to those created for other titles in the Criterion "Monsters & Madmen" set), director day, who admits that there is no sci-fi fan genre - tries to justify the shortcomings of the movie by saying it zero budget to work together (where all the scenes in space were made up of footage!) ... and I would have tended to be a softer film I haven't watched recently by CALTIKI, IMMORTAL MONSTER (1959) - similar (and similarly wet) but more stylish companies From Italy! <br /> <br /> Bill Edwards, a surprising but unhappy astronaut obsessed with the achievement of a title, is first and foremost bored, but eventually succeeds in collecting the audience's sympathy when his physical characteristics are deformed and his character develops to taste for blood! Marshall Thompson as his commander and older brother is O.K. as a lighter type of Glenn Ford; he had previously played in FIEND without FACE (1958), another (and more successful) sci-fi produced by Richard Gordon, which is also available on DVD. An English-speaking Italian star Marla Landi makes an inadequate female lead; even his contribution to featurette turns out to be a little permanent! The voice comment is another enjoyable Tom Weaver / Richard Gordon, where many things raise the fact that the first room for maneuver was meant to be a double function (1958). up - but it was finally released as an independent release to use the current news of the current space race; it was also mentioned that the monster dialogue was duplicated by Bonar Colleano (who tragically died in a traffic accident before the movie was released!). Weaver even remembers a couple of anecdotes since he was involved in the production of DVD games filmed by all human beings, ex-cult-ish filmmaker Norman J. Warren, but Landi, who had become a lady by then, was ready to help out several interviews stairway!; Edwards had to take part in the featuret, but once in London he turned out to work with Weaver - finally he learned that the actor was recently diagnosed with cancer and actually died in 2002!
