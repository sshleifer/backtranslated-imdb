In my opinion, Quentin has written and directed only one good movie and it was multiple award winning Pulp Fiction. But most movies, especially recent ones, have been real turkeys. People appreciate him and his stuff today and I really don't understand why. There are many other directors and writers today who are producing much better entertainment in all their films. From that moment on, I don't believe the hype that is Tarantino's film. <br /> <br /> Inglorious was too long and worse than you knew. Humor was very minimal and not humorous. Violence was nothing new (minus the end scene). The dialogue was sometimes very pulled out. <br /> <br /> For some, they love this movie; and for others they hate it. <br /> <br /> ... and I thought the Nazi theme was finally slept with the 2004 German film Der Untergang.
