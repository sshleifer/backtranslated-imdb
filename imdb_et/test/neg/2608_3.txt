It had its moments, but generally, when I looked at this comic as a child, I missed my mind. The only thing I watched was that it was a comic, probably my first contact with the animation. It's also one of my least favorite anime, I remember others who have a giant ship in space that didn't make sense, but was more enjoyable because they were in space. I also remember that these people were dressed like birds that were a bit strange but more fun. I don't like car racing, though not at all, and it's still not that it's probably one of the reasons I'm not interested in this show, though today I'm an avid anime fan. The signs were also a bit funny and then there were terrible scenes where virtually no action was likely to be used to reduce the cost of animation and make the show. The car gadgets were cool and gave me entertainment at that time. In general, I think this exhibition is more unnoticeable compared to the newer anime and some of the same timing, but it is just a personal opinion. I'm sure many other reviewers love the example that is cool.
