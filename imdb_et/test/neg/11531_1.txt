I had the first 45 minutes. or so, but suddenly it was all down the hill. The thrill began to become somewhat thin and the jokes were somewhat the same. What he held was a good actor. <br /> <br /> But the problem with this movie is that it is trying to be cleverly funny, like Tarantino and God are outdated things. Tarantino is sometimes a little overestimated, this film is too late for ten years. At best it is for teenagers, and I am sure many of them will find Johann's jokes he has in the first 30 minutes. The other problem I have is that the story disappears more and more, I tried to find a restore point. Maybe it didn't recover because the lack of passion is trying to be cleverly funny. Also, as in many films, good players who promise it do not seem to require a better dialogue or just write down the script.
