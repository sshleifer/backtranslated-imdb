It is a shame that such a good film did not have any plot supported by the work of Sarah Cawley (cinematography) and Adam Lichtenstein (film editing), and above all not the idea of ​​what was going on in Mexico City. The film tries to be a very realistic image of city life, but it can't do it. It's a shame, a lot of movies are wasted. The American woman is trying to find her brother who has been kidnapped. The first report of the story is powerful and interesting, very realistic, but it seems there was no effort to try out a better narrative, especially when it comes to the attitude of the US Embassy staff in Mexico when it comes to such a problem. Compare, for example, Frantic (1988), which deals with a similar issue. Something similar can be said about the role of local authorities. Compare, for example, Todo el Poder (1999). The film is worth seeing if you want to get a sense of the city's own look, with little or no attention to the rather weak "plot" and many twists that require quite extensive incredible stops. Who thinks that the Mexican patrol from the city of Mexico goes to the main characters at the Mexican-US border? And this policeman can use his radio from the Mexican city border! Only the producers of this movie. It is worth noting that, unlike Frida and other Mexican films, at least in these Mexican languages ​​speaks Spanish.
