Wow - Thank you God for being on the plane and seeing out the window. Bad Hollywood fire scenes, predictable, terribly (who the hell was that terrible woman who played the woman?), Poorly cast, terribly written. This film was apparently made to appeal to a person who is ready to kneel specifically to change firefighters, "heroes", or generally gods. I just don't have to say anything bad about this movie. It wouldn't have been cheap with all the stars that were in this plus all those special effects and fires. It should have been a fortune, but it still sucks worse than any movie I even remember. Funeral Activity? Amazingly bad. Judgment between a firefighter and the aforementioned terrible woman? Corny, minted, tritiated. Fire Fighting Equipment? Don't we all want us to be both male and passionate at the same time.
