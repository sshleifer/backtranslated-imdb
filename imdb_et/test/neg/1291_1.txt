I only registered in IMDb to warn others about this movie. Does anyone receive funding for such projects? It's a secret. Farewell to Harry may be the worst film, except that I tried to erase others who competed for this silent idiot decision. Bad plot, non-believable logic lasts all the time. I can't spoil this movie for you, revealing something that would make your experience less enjoyable. Nothing like this movie. I have a CD and send it to you for free, it's so bad. First serve only. If I know you, this offer is insignificant because I wouldn't create this movie for anyone, not for the purpose. YOU ARE Warned.
