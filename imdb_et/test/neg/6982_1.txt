This film was bad, but it was so bad that it could reach a state of cult in the distant future. A sort of film noir corresponds to plan 9 from space. The story was, there wasn't really a story. There is a reserved place for Ed Woods and Russ Meyers where this film proves. "So bad it can be good" is the best way to describe it. I have serious doubts as to whether this legitimate film is raised by any legitimate distribution company, and it is therefore unlikely to be widespread. <br /> <br /> I'll add that I'm looking for more actor Ron Carey. He did the best he could. The rest of the action, if I call it, was quite forgotten. I've seen larger large studios with a big budget.
