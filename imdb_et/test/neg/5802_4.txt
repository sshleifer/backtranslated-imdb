First of all I would like to say that I really enjoyed this movie. However, I cannot say that it was a "good" movie. I went to the theater with rather low expectations (something I've learned to do). I'm glad I did because the plot and development were not stars. Jokes were low quality humor. But I was in the right entertainment to enjoy them. <br /> <br /> I wasn't the only one. Actually, the whole theater smiled aloud. I didn't hear anyone complaining after the movie ended. I even saw that one man fell under his chair to laugh! But again, I have to warn you, Grandma's boy is not a top quality film. This is a funny (albeit weak-eyed) movie, and if you go with the right mindset, you really enjoy it. Oh, and don't take the kids here.
