This movie is a gay love story that is a hidden graffiti and friendship story. No review described this movie as a gay-novel film, and that is the plot weight. I don't know if it was to trick people who would otherwise be interested in waiting for the movie to be marketed ... The film does not come across graffiti culture, abuses and graffiti culture, and the operation is exhausting. Oh yes, graffiti sucks too. This film was a wise way to hide the young boys' portrayal on the agenda. Just look at the rest of the movies that the director has to do, all with the same theme. Bored as hell, not what I expected.
