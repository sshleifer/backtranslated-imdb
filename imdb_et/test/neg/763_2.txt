The scientifically engineered super dog, who was supposed to respond to petit crime, was CHOMPS chump. <br /> <br /> All I saw in Chomps was to sit or walk or run. Or run, then walk, sit ... and then up and stretch again and then walk and then run into K-Tel dance hits. And sometimes they responded to everyday Jumbo. But mostly just sat a lot. <br /> <br /> Everything I say is: Celebrity Death Match was unable to take Chomps out of Mr. Bigglesworth.
