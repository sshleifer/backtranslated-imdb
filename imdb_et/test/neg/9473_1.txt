I saw Roger Moore strike it on scenes that needed running or training. He was James Bond, who would be most comfortable sitting in a bar where his British British knights were talking. Nothing about the elderly against age roles, but how realistic is that a weak-looking 58-year-old man fights over the wings of the planes, hanging on the side of the train, swimming in the swamp with crocodiles, and so on. ? Apart from being incredibly silly, coats of arms and moronic, OCTOPUSSY was that the weak parent who took part in many deadly tricks just made James Bond laugh so much easier. By 1983, Roger Moore clearly searched for his age, and he was a long time when he looked like he could fight with younger men. I saw it in the movie theater and laughed a lot and very often. Any trust that James Bond had built up went for OCTOPUSSY. <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappeared from OCTOPUSSY was Benny Hill and his supportive cast. Another low point was that the incredibly flat Louis Jordan was half the evil axis. Jordan made the whole concept even more ridiculous. And the Russian general was a whore. OCTOPUSSY works better than comedy that resembles similar to the US-like spies. <br /> <br /> Even the train fighting scene was just a bad copy of the same train scenes made by many other films by better actors. TAKE NORTHERN EMPEROR (1972) where Lee Marvin & Ernest Borgnine fought over the top and bottom of the train and made it exciting and real. <br /> <br /> Roger Moore had a thin, weak body in 1983. and yet his stunt double was clearly younger, taller, athletic and muscular. Even the hair color did not match. This only made his fighting scenes more comedic. Moore stunts looked like these old low budget Chop-Socky Kung-Fu movies, especially for poor editing. The director seemed to try to make bad deeds and bad stunts better by offering the same stunt several views. It only emphasized the differences between Moore and his stunts. The fact that Moore's train scenes were shot in the studio could be seen in the light when Moore was hit, compared to the off-shore frames on a real train. While many Bond Movies must be the worst ever when it comes to making your stunt-fights. Usually you can clearly see that the bond actor does not really fight. All in all, OCTOPUSSY must be one of the worst movies and easily the worst Bond movies.
