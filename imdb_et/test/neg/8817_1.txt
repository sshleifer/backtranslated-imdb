(This review may not reveal a plot of film, but it may change the film's expectations and hence the less pleasurable experience.) This film had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. It was badly cut and jumped too much; making a reference to the past seems more like excuses because the plot was in its particular direction. Writers should not think about how a potentially splendid piece of land could be carried out because a bad building time on the entire plot will not let the viewer catch up and make the film look more and more tiring. <br /> <br /> Almost worse than writers who abused what might have been a great and classic thriller, it was gradually based on cheap tactics. The action did not make it scary and the situation was barely frightening, so a couple of blind scenes needed to jump to you to value it. Even these were predictable. <br /> <br /> Even the gore was unable to save the plot and it competes with successful thriller Se7en gore. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Se7en, I feel like Saw was trying to follow the incredibly exciting psychological theme of Se7, but he couldn't do it unhappy. I was terribly disappointed with the analysis of the killer psychology and the lack of a plot structure. The original scenes tempt the viewer to think that it is a psychological thriller; believe me, it's not far from it. <br /> <br /> Did I mention poor action? At first Cary Elwes seems a convincing result; however, it deteriorates completely in the most important parts of the plot. I got tears of smiles at the show that is worth Razzie. Leigh Whannell's performance is also terrible and too played, though not as bad as Elvis's performance, and the big red flag in that Whannell is also a movie writer. <br /> <br /> The end of Saw was never able to compensate for the loss of its entire center, and it makes it a big failure. It was an opportunity to waste, and I have no idea why Monica Potter and Danny Glover chose the roles of this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm mad about wasting money just for renting it. Certainly it wasn't worth $ 4, and in the future I'll definitely not see anything related to Elwide, Whannell or James Wan. The great tragedy in this is not that he did not have the foundation of this plot, that is, a great potential vision was thrown away and bad action added insult to injury. I avoid the poor plugs that contain the title, and just stop it: don't look at this movie.
