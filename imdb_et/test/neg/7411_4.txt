The waste of time is what you get out of this bag. I rented the hope that I would hope for some alternating film, perhaps with some plausible scenes, but I was never disappointed. I think the title should have been "Camping 101" or something like that. Anyway, stay away from this movie of hell. It will make you die. Don't be afraid of the big mouth, be afraid of this mess !!
