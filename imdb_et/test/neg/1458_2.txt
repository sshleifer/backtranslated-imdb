Bad movie about bad movie. Is it original or what? If that is the case, then this is the only good thing. Lovely Ally Sheedy couldn't stop this bomb to destroy cinemas and video clips everywhere. It should also be noted that he and other Danny Aiello-type hired participants themselves presented the bill as well as what they played on their D-rated movie. Naming a B-rated movie is too complicated to bring glory.
