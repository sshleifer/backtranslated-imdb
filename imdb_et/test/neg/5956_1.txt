Where do I start? The box should have been kept away from this experiment, but I taught early that I did not understand the book (or film) with that lid, so I ignored the box's nasty graphic quality and leased it anyway. But common sense should tell you that if they can't do the same picture properly, how steep are they moving later? Yes, yes. They were quite awful. <br /> <br /> The actors in this flick were completely unaware that they were filmed because every expression seemed fine, regardless of the situation in which the characters were or were responding. However, a good story can compensate for a low-budget production decline. Good dialogue can be an occasionally poorly funded experiment. Unfortunately, it wasn't one of those times since the story was so weak and non-existent as the other good cinema elements. <br /> <br /> Just no words about how bad it was. <br /> <br /> Maybe you get an idea of ​​my rating from -2.3 / 10 ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
