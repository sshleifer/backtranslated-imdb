It is literally three Stooges again, without charm. This exhibition is more than the worst thing to hide. I'm surprised that they actually have writers. The so-called jokes are completely random and "controversial" for no other reason than very (very) difficult to be controversial. And people think it's nervous? Get the clue: this exhibition doesn't make any sense, time, effort, money or creativity / originality. Existing references are aimed at all 6 to 16-year-olds who occasionally browse the People magazine. But I think it's just what all the kids want, like and need today.
