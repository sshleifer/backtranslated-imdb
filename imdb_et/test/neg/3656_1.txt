Reading the back of the box, my first thought was that it was probably Saw blasting. I couldn't be farther from the truth. It seemed to me that they gave someone a camera phone for $ 10.00 and said they made a movie. The plot did not exist and did not work. It was almost like I was watching a quiet film of grass growing. It didn't surprise me at all to find out later that the whole film was "improvised". At the end of this "movie" I had lost my will to live and I could just get AIDS for watching this film unit. It was about 70 minutes to be able to spend something less painful. Like jumping out of the building.
