Simply put, this mini-series was terrible. Let me read you. 1. Drawing Absurd. 2. Over acting. 3. Scatterhot Approach Characters. 4. Annoying narration. 5. Failure to create spectator interest. <br /> <br /> This movie can't even pass the test of the soap opera Dummies test. I'm sorry I haven't read this award-winning novel, so I only appreciate it under the film, but it really smells. Imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers. You look at a wide range and want to taste them, but maybe they're taken back and you don't know where they went. It's like this movie, too many characters and never pulled out. There are enough stories and symbols in this movie to create a series of 20 episodes, but we have been given less than four hours to digest this. <br /> <br /> Ed Harris has more facial expressions and reactions than you find 10,000 monkeys. Speed ​​is extremely slow. <br /> <br /> Dennis Farina and Helen Hunt are so far away that their characters are unreliable. The character of Joanne Woodward is one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Permanent river metaphor turns into tricks. <br /> <br /> And probably the most absurd part of the movie - the cat. This evil and vengeful cat, who follows the hero to scratch her and her seat covers - well, come now --- it's not even good Stephen King! <br /> <br /> Probably the most interesting character of a movie and someone who is not well drawn is John Voss, a disturbed boy whose final desperate act is the only plot device that works in this movie. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone in this movie is incredible. To sum up, there is little inspiration here. Drama is a bad melodrama. It's just a terrible effort.
