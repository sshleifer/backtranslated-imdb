You see, if the flick is not controlled by his brother, it is the best he can do. And sad to say that his best just doesn't cut it. "Ice Cream Man" is a very strange horror movie, it's a real blast to see if you're in the right mood. In the wrong mood, it is known that people are violently breaking with loved ones, so please look carefully. <br /> <br /> Clint Howard stars (is Clint Howard really stars)? "evil" "psychotic" "bizarre" (yes all in quotation marks, he's not quite any of them, but he's getting close) is an ice-cream man who tortures local children with a bomb that is truly a scream and ice cream that is shredded for humans and dogs. Ick. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot is really just an excuse to show ... well, um, well it's a plot. Wait, I know! This is an excuse to show off all the losing actors! There is Jan Michael Vincent and Lee Majors II (continued)? And even Doug Lleyweln appears as a supermarket worker. <br /> <br /> Even better than some of the more strange movies. I really like the fact that instead of renting a fat actress to play an unhappy "fat" boy, they do just that kid wearing a paddle. And the whole assumption that someone is going to peel ice cream from ice cream. Who buys ice cream dwarfs? Then the whole psychiatric department scene, where Jan Michael Vincent acts lightly interested, is bored by the state of consciousness. These are police officers who also clean up Ice Cream Man's tips, but they can fill the gloss of an ice cream truck (where of course different bodies are kept and of course). Well, better luck next time troops. <br /> <br /> Howard himself moves as he is convinced that two cities can see and hear him. It's all just stupid. And it's fun to laugh at Pumaman or Gymkata's fine tradition. You are good to laugh in the right sense of HUMOR. I love it. <br /> <br />
