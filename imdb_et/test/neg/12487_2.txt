Transformation can be successful. Adaptation can be successful. It does not matter whether it has been reprocessed or adapted. <br /> <br /> A good movie is a good movie and a bad movie is a poor movie, no matter what. <br /> <br /> Sarkar, I am afraid, was a very bad film. First of all, just making signs of danger, or macho, they don't produce aura for them. <br /> <br /> What was the size of Nagre (the character of Amitabh Bacchan), which we should have been an aura of power, and which showed the character's "benevolence"? Nothing. <br /> <br /> This comment was made by the commentator and Amitabh continued to show his facial expressions. Now Amitabh can give brilliant facial expressions, but why should it mean something without history or story. <br /> <br /> There were also no characters working under "sarcasm". . Just because the man had glasses, why should we expect him to be wise. The film's flow was generally empty because of the creation of godfather scenes (like a policeman who hit Abhishek Bacchan), an older brother who was killed by Abhekek (as Fredo was killed by Pacino's instructions), but too many attempts were made to wrap the film with too little story and depth go together. It was indeed a problem. <br /> <br /> If you try 3 hours of sophisticated details such as a godfather in 2 hours and too few dialogues, what you get is highlighting the cricket game, never making a full-featured full play.
