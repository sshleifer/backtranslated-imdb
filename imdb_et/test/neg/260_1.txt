In 1998, Murli Mohan Rao made BANDHAN much better. This movie is terrifying over the COMPETITION SINGER. <br /> <br /> In principle, the film, Salman Khan, who in those days had an abandoned lover who loses his girlfriend and had his own comics, where he was badly worshiped today, is doing well here and losing his Jackie Shroff-wasted, boring and tired, his role is so stupid He's been shown as a Pooja Bhatra lover, then she's shown as a single female scene as a scene? <br /> <br /> Inder Kumar - Confused Characteristics Again <br /> <br /> Rani Mukherje- boring, overweight and doing nothing special Pooja Bhatra- tall, fair, and actress worthy, but lacking talent. <br /> <br /> Kashmira Shah- says it would be poetry. <br /> <br /> Mohinish Behl - poor companions 2 children were terribly too <br /> <br /> The story is the same and it has terribly comic, unexpected love story and boring soldered scenes and forced comedy Shakti Kapoo Direction bad Music is good <br /> <br /> Salman khan is just going through the movements, Jackie is bad, Rani is like usual, Pooja is bad, Mohinish and Kashmira are not big big Inder is terrible
