I am from Australia and have been watching closely the extraordinary culture surrounding the rugby club in New Zealand. I can fully appreciate the comments made by Kiwise on this film. It was a complete insult to the attack of people and their beloved sport. <br /> <br /> Who was involved in making this terrifying movie should be formally apologized to anyone who failed it. Note: People do not kneel and shout when they start describing slowly. What a sad scene it was. <br /> <br /> Should we feel some compassion for the idiot who would kill almost his girlfriend, who refused to listen to any side of the brain, but apparently saw the light? What is an unpleasant character (visiting children's hospitals does nothing to redeem a despicable personality). And why do people even make a movie about Americans who play rugby? They are not nearly in the world athletics, not so legitimate that they even try to make this movie (yes, Rugby is "the world sport, unlike gridiron and baseball)?
