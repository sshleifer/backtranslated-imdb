"Speck" was apparently meant to be a biological link with serum killer Richard Speck. However, there is not much killing in this movie, and none of them is explicitly shown. The most annoying scene in the whole movie is perhaps Speck pulls one of the eight regrettable siblings in his bath, but even this is just indirect and not shown, except for some convincing downward gentlemen. The most entertaining part of this film is likely to be the voice that should be the meaninglessly boring nature of this film. Every aspect of this movie is terrible. If you don't feel bored, don't worry. This movie is only 72 minutes, but it seems to be eternal.
