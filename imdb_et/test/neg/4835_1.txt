What offends me most of the followers of this film is to mention "originality". This film does not contain one innovative element. When you refer to "originality", you refer to pathetic scenes of action, excessive violence, violence against violence, blunt humor and overcoming intellectual belief. Then "originality" is something Swedish film can do without it. <br /> <br /> How Röse and Karlsson agree to be a "mystery" to the movie "Poor Excuses". And how Eva Röse can see the promotion of breakfast television after making this film, it just disappoints me. <br /> <br /> This movie does not contain a story, the script is illogical, stiff and last, but not least, just bad. These two young directors have put together quite abominable violence, comics and trivial psychological portraits. I would not be surprised if the DD scene with a bedroom with a microwave dinner is actually placed in the everyday life of the two overgrown cinematographic runners that are the director. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't show this movie to my worst enemy.
