This movie is cash. Cash, which depends on setting up an exciting theme from the past to the classic. Yul Brynner has long since jumped the ship and so most of the production values. Lee Van Cleef takes over Chris leadership. I can't think of an actor who looks less than Brynner than Van Cleef. Hey, he could have shaved at least the hair and lost the mustache, just for the sake of consistency. Some repair centers show this to punish offenders. One step outside and a great seven races! is highlighted and used. They didn't even bother to see this movie look like a TV movie! Abysmal.
