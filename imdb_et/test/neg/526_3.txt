Finally I got a DVD copy of this production and was curious because I had read so many people who praised it in heaven, especially Angela Lansbury's portrayal of Mrs. Lovett. I saw Tim Burton's movie a few months ago and thought it was up and too bloody; Fortunately, this version is not so terrible, but it is suffering dramatically in many other ways to make it the least satisfactory to me. <br /> <br /> First casting. George Hearn is sufficient and at least some expression (unlike Johnny Depp's endless wooden face in the film). Angela Lansbury is just annoying. At least he has enough power in his voice to get a point across from Helena Bonham Carter's piping and the voice of a little girl without expression, but the subtlety seems to be just a word in the vocabulary of Mrs Lansbury. This story cannot be brought about when one of the main characters spends all his time and silencing "I, I act!" and listening to too many audiences. It is not something that is typical for productions, the sky knows - I've been a regular participant of many productions of the Stratford Festival for many years and the directors are NOT behaving in this way as a rule (at least those who want to continue to find regular jobs!) ... <br /> <br /> Betsy Joslyn. Oh dear, oh dear, dear. Has anyone besides me noticed that he can't sing this role even vaguely? And playing her daughter, George Hearn, is just scary, because she was married at that time. Shouldn't he be a sweet little sixteen? Yes, I know this is what works, but never convinced me that he was younger than about thirty-five years, and the phrase "lamb dressed in sheep" seems to have been created for him. In her "green and bird birds" meat industry, I had to brush my teeth and turn off the DVD player at the same time. This song was so well done in Tim Burton's movie and it was a sad shock. The song needs Julie Andrews' vocal range in the 1960s and the purity of the voice, which is comparable only to the boy's soprano. Any vibrato kills this dead, and Mrs. Joslyn spent so hard that I thought she would start to fall off her ladder, because she was trembling so much to keep the colorado's comments with the voice, which at best is mezzo. We'll overcome our vibrating spectacle with at least a fourth tone that is at least three of the higher notes ... It's not just the role of coloratura and maybe the director who needs it should have told him - but the fact that he was married to the star might have been the director's hands tie. <br /> <br /> Cris Groenendaal was enough, but again obviously too old for this role and she and Mrs. the entire sub-block is completely flat. I am reminded of some of Wagner's circular past performances, where the vocal power of the singers, which was demanded by the voice of the Wagner Orchestra, would be cast in the ability to penetrate vocally, not to any appearance or ability to act, or even a good voice; when the libretto demands forever a young and frightening essential beauty. Casting "young" leaders is exactly the same - if you close your eyes, you can almost believe Mr. Groenendal's Anthon, but as soon as you look at the screen, the illusion is broken. (And you can never believe Mrs. Joslin Johanna ...) For me, the rest of the production was completely lost because three of the four big characters were so obviously wrong. I can't give anything else because they were so annoyed that they broke the rest of the production. I really do not understand why people are robbing this poorly fired and self-conscious stage playing. Are you sure to do more work in the theater than just shoot the camera in the front row? When I want it, I go to a decent game, preferably at the Stratford Festival, where at least they work together for the production and are not constantly on the camera. I only give him three letters because, in addition to Lansbury and Joslyn's production, the quality of the production seems to be sufficient, if not remarkable. <br /> <br /> It's probably best to buy a soundtrack for the movie and this game is saved and connect the two to make a satisfying whole. That's what I do, and I try to forget that I was bothered to rent this completely noticeable production.
