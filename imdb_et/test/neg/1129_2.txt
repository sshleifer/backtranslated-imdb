Obviously, with this film that goes straight to the DVD, I didn't expect much, but it is so strange that it is incredible. The only part of the movie you are really funny about is that they even get to the island, where Eddie's son is blown by the bathroom with a jet of water and that's it! Why do they struggle at all? The first Christmas holiday with Chevy Chase was great and fun. This is not. They rely on jokes about a dog with a flatulence and a character called Uncle Nick, who is about 80 years old and is trying his way with beautiful women. When they approach the island with a boat, it seems that the island is just so fake and Randy Quaid, although in the previous movie is funny, it just moves and it looks like it's too hard to be funny. You have been warned!
