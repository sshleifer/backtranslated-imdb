It must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. The general idea that throwing out corona masses on the planet's surface with EM disruption is fairly fair, but where did they get the idea that people could stay at 155 Â° F? The action was so terrible that I felt the casting agents just grabbed a handful of people from Santa Monica Boulevard and threw them in front of the camera. Frankly, I have seen less of the wood in the ironing board. Sorry, this movie was poor, poor, poor.
