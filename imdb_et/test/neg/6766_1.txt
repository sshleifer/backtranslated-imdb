Yes, yes. True stink. I saw this movie on the advice of my "sweet" friends who told me it was a great "psychological" movie. This film does its best to not be understandable. I knew I had seen the stinker in the first 20 minutes. I was expecting I expected to see something of such value and most importantly that I was happy with this movie. Waiting was unbearable. After seeing the film, I talked to my friends and found out that in the intellectual environment (they call it under this title) this "film" is recognized as a masterpiece. Yes, a masterpiece, but in the category of stinkers. I think the film must be taken for granted. This movie is just the opposite. Keep away from the thing that calls itself a "movie." Burn your money for this "phenomenon" instead of paying. Rate: 1 out of 10
