I would like to start by saying that I will not see this movie again if they give out a gold popcorn and the ticket gave me eternal life. This movie was terrible. I can't make it really honest because there are no negative letters. Operation is absolutely terrible. This movie is a travesty based on the classic "Most Dangerous Game". If you really want to torture yourself in 90 minutes, rent something like Gigli. At least J-Lo offers some better landscapes, Ben should reassure women looking at it. I'm not worried about the $ 7 I paid to see the movement, I just want my life 90 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> "Do you give me your time back!?!" Samuel L. Jackson, changing lanes
