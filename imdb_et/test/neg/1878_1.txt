I've seen tons of trash in every language and every film-making trend in every language. Every director has every director and every budget. That said, I really have to declare: <br /> <br /> This is one of the three worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's painfully bad. It's pompous. It's gloomy. That's incomprehensible. It's annoying. This is really a bad mess. This is a piece of knowledge about you. <br /> <br /> And more importantly, it has no point. Even if it had been, the characters are so unrealistic and annoying that it is impossible to ignore the lack of cohesion of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> It's just strange to be weird. <br /> I felt you were looking at it in the trash. The theater where I saw it (Lincoln Center in New York) was full of it. At the end, half of the audience had gone out. At the end, Q&A was programmed but no one left. Except for about two hurt, everyone else ran to the door itself. <br /> <br /> Save 2 hours of your life. This is probably one of the worst ever made. <br /> <br /> If there is a cinema in hell, this movie is played around the clock, forever ...
