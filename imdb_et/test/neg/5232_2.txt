The things I needed were one of my favorite Stephen King books. But this movie is one of the worst movie adaptations I've ever seen, so they changed so many things to make me sick. The film did not even show the concept of the book, which is fraud, things that are not always reminders of the book. Althogh was enjoyable because many of Stephen King's films, but so much of Stephen King's movies, did not follow the book and got a Hollywood trailer dump. 2/10
