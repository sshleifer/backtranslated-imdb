I've recently seen a series of hit movies, and this movie managed to knock out all the worst aspects of such movies. You feel very little about the surrounding cave or the monster, while the characters are clich√©s (spiritual guy, leader with tragedy in recent years, etc.) and the end was just weak. It seemed to me that the director continued shaking the camera or showing almost complete darkness. I have read that this film gave real beauty and yes, I imagine the caves are blind. Showing almost half of the dirt in half of the movie really brought this home. I liked the pretty "descent" that showed more tense fooling situations, better monsters, and a good ending to make my money work better. <br /> <br /> **** Spoiler ****** <Friends turn out to be a guy whose plane crashed and parents were killed, leaving it to grow in caves. He seems to have developed superpower and speed, but why never be dealt with - maybe the same force that discharged his burner batteries caused it, but during the movie, when someone is killed, the impression is that the claws that all the victims tear , are great. See how much blood the walls blast! I would like to disregard this when high heights were reached, but that was not the case. Then he will rape the last remnants and roll credit ... Almost absurdly bad I thought. Sometimes the film is so bad that you appreciate it and maybe it is a laugh, but this film doesn't bother easily. <br /> <br /> You watched it, you can't open it!
