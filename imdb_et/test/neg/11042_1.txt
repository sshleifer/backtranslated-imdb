There is a thin line between theater and mere coercion. Forced action. Forced to take. Forced plot. Even forced photography. There are people who say, "The film develops as it is from Asia," but I don't see any of the forced elements of the seven samurai or sonatine. There is a thin line between fixation (and between every artwork that is five, fiction), and it's just unlikely. Personally, I just don't know anything about the film, it doesn't take me anywhere, and I just can't believe the fictional world when it is done. It just doesn't feel right, there's something or just doesn't click through it.
