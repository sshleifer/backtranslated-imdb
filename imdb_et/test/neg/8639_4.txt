Theresa Russell sometimes did some semi-decent movies, so I hope one of his ten-year efforts deserves at least 6 or 7 (10) ratings. But DARK WORLD is the last in a series of disappointments. The first 90 minutes are very difficult to see. The management bodies give these lines as they are read on the first sample or even during the casting period (where participants do it for their agents but do not really want the parts for which they are perfectly read). Sets and props seem "out" in some way (which police department could a detective have a wall of a living room full of file barriers?). There is a constant pointless time on the screen and data that appear without rhyme or reason. Now that the scriptwriter stood here after the lights coming from the film festival, they would undoubtedly be in the shadow of how all these shortcomings are really clever tips on a plot that turns topsy-turvy into it in five minutes. Well, for the audience members whose only film experience is TV: MOVIE and SURFER, DUDE; they can be nailed to agree on their head. But it is hard to believe that anyone who has seen 10 or more movies in their lives - and that is not a DARK WORLD cast or a close friend or relative of a team member - may fall against such a flat canard. Whatever d.v.d. The box may lead you to believe this film is similar to SUNSET BOULEVARD (Dead Teller Device) or Hitchcock (Schizophrenic Main Character) because the empty Jim Beam bottle is filled with urine!
