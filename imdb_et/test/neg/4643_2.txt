I know Full Moon, or any other film in this studio, never got back the fun and cheesy sci-fi feeling that was the original "Trancers". And the last two entries with Jack Deth instead of the medieval futuristic Los Angeles became quite evident that there was really little hope of revitalizing the Tires. Breathing new life into a movie is one thing, but our main character did not work out of his element and put it in the past! Now, Trancers 6, there has been so much new life in the Full Moon series that Jack Deth is no longer involved. Now we're dealing with our daughter Jo. Jack is in his body and has to go past and fight with Trancers one more time. <br /> <br /> MINOR SPOILER: FIRST CODE OF THE FILM SUBMITTED * <br /> <br /> To prove how bad this film is, you need to watch the first two minutes of the movie when the original Jack Deth appears on the screen. But that's not really Tim Thomerson. It's his clips and soundtracks that are put together (trust me, you can say they're put together) to give the viewer the last true Jack Deth humor. And from that moment, things go down the hill. This girl, Jo Deth, as our main character, if Jack Deth should be in his body, is the world's worst idea. The behavior of this cute young woman is harsh and the harsh person is not the right way! It does not work and it really comes as a fool. <br /> <br /> I will not go into the special effects and makeup aspects, as most of them read what a full moon has got: A really, really, low budget company. I don't know what to say about this movie unless I really want Full Moon to be like Demonic Toys, Puppet Master and Trancers 1. Days when special effects weren't big, the story was. They made serious b-movies for serious B-movie and horror fans, and this is not happening today with the new Full Moon Studios. I miss good evening and I really hope that Full Moon can pull himself out of the terrible blow they are currently on.
