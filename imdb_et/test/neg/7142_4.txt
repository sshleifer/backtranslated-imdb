Hey! Grudge 2! What, man? I have a friend with whom I would like you to meet. Grudge 2 will meet Johnny's worst in 2006. Johnny's worst year 2006 will meet The Grudge 2. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? I had the impression that it was supposed to be the order of The Grudge as a remake. If so, why not do something but the original? This float doesn't even know the movie. This is just 90 minutes of sound from a strange reluctant chick that makes this annoying curve sound. <br /> <br /> The sound I don't want to start with. It was a kind of horrible thing when I first heard it, but I've heard about 12,367 since 2004, so it's pretty much gone. And it is even more annoying for the audience of 20 people who thought it would be strange to mimic the sound when the film had a quiet place. Sigh. People you don't come with so well! I promise you that every time a character walked slowly through an empty space (which is about 97% of the movie), someone would start an audience, "Uhhhhkkkkkkuuuuuhhhhhkkkkkk." Yes, I know it's a terrible way to repeat the sound with the letters, but you get the essence. So some guys in the pub would strangle and should not cross their rendition. I was very close to walking to the audience and punching people at random. <br /> <br /> I said I wouldn't start. <br /> <br /> There is nothing I can recommend about Grudge 2. There is no original fear or idea in the whole movie. There is no memorable actor. Are you a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellari? Welp, enjoy her two minutes of screen time and one line of dialogue. Are you a fan of Amber Tamblyn? I hope you can do it by not giving him more than walking around as he is suffering from a nervous nerve. Do you believe this story (if you call it) is even worse than Grudge? At least the original was quite creepy and proud of some effective jump scene. I never jumped during this lametrosion (yes, I did a word, I deal with it). This is correct. Not once. The "fears" are so prepared and they are so blatant with the telegraph that there is no shock value on the arrival of "gotcha". Watching this movie is like playing a good chess - you are always four or five in front of the scene. <br /> <br /> There are also some strange scenes that don't make sense in this sense. One that instantly reminds you is a scene where a girl runs a gallon of milk and then returns to the jug. Ah? I say HUH?!?! Audience laughed. I shook my head and sighed. There was a lot during the movie. Let's laugh. Sighing. The head shakes. Sleeping (I did twice). <br /> <br /> The film even makes a "twist" test on a plot with 1/5-heart. Wow. It's so bad that I don't think we should even label it dignified. Did they really think someone would be surprised by the revelation that was hidden behind? Please. It was as shocking as Elton John came out of the closet. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the whole unchecked "look, we may have another sequel" route. As soon as the credit rolled the audience. My feelings exactly. If the audience had paid for that burger, things would probably be violent, and I'd be happy to drive that reward. <br /> <br /> We learned from The Grudge that there is a Japanese belief that if someone dies in a powerful grip on rage, the curse will be left behind. Like Ben Affleck's film, this is the "stain" that forever becomes part of the place where death occurred. Well, in Grudge 2, we find out that when a horror film covers its budget on its opening weekend, its sequel is attacked and more often than it is and it leaves a blemish on every theater where the movie is shown. <br /> <br /> GIST <br /> <br /> If you are a wimp and have never seen The Grudge, it may offer some cheap fears. But I suggest you save money, otherwise you will have a good chance if you step out of the theater.
