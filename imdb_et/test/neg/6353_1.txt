Wow, Jeez, I don't even know where to start commenting on what they called the movie. I don't really know what hell David Bradley started smoking after Hard Justice, which I think was a good film after the American Ninja. I didn't see any such men after Cyborg Cop. Happy to see them on Amazon like 5 pounds and I can say the following: if I had thrown the five pounds I spent on all the reality, the crisis, and the expectation, I would have been happier than sitting for 90 minutes, each of which lasted. My God, how can HECK be able to celebrate these "movies"? And why do deeds / martial arts fall on the knee's deep horseshoe when they reach their top? I mean, David Bradley is not worthy of Oscar, but his first films were pretty fun. Tough, cool guy with a pretty good martial arts experience, who gave some whores, but at least entertainment and martial arts fans. But I really want to know what went through this boy's head after Hard Justice. To be honest, his last 3 films must be WORK, which I had to sit on. As I mentioned earlier, I would like to get my money back to the 3 DVDs I bought. The crisis was a phenomenon of drowsiness, the complete reality was harsh, but this expectation of death is just a complete mess. I bet the director was either mega-rock when he did, or he just took a pee out of every David Bradley fan who sat through this pile. The plot is surrounded by a doctor (Bradley) who develops a type of virtual reality game where he simply kills different people one by one. Sorry, but I just couldn't play this man seriously to play this hairy hair, goggles and gray pants and do some physical struggle (honestly, his best asset). The film is even worse than any of these B-films on Saturday afternoon, because the actor is ridiculous, management is terrible and a few struggles in the film, well, what I say ... Participants look like they train their gym buddy. We get a foolish policeman who starts showing his battle game like a one-hour movie, and fails ... French hairy version of Van Damme who just can't fight, act or talk to save his frightening life, the supposed protagonist who plays an evil doctor who was really happy when he finished making this type of consuming garbage. I even think he will probably not throw a hit in this movie because of his heart disease that has already played him. For B-actor, I have to admit that I really liked this guy, his style, body, fighting skills ... But I'm really happy he stopped doing this monstrous operation because honestly I wouldn't have been able to sit through another ninety minutes like that tear-off material. Avoid at all costs, even if you are a David Bradley family, you are glad you did, word.
