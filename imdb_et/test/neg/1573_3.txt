Bette Midler is the best thing about this movie. Natalie Wood is a gypsy if it is original in 1962. The songs were much better in the original and the costumes were better. Bette's voice was high and in most costumes Cynthia was better than Gibb. Only someone who didn't see the original would think it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> There was not enough change between ugly ducklings and beautiful girls. When Natalie Wood was a gypsy, she only looked beautiful when she hit her dress for the first time at a Burlesque show. If he has his hair down and then magically it is all beautifully made and he looks so elegant, it is an important aspect of the film because it is also the first time a Gypsy sees himself as special and that he can actually be a star. , not just a nurse's poor substitute. And the scenes where he slowly became famous were rushed. It was an important part of the movie and they killed it. It is extremely important to show him that he will be more satisfied with his future if the defendant and the costumes are amazing in these scenes in the original. It was immense to have a look at this movie while watching it. I was completely disappointed and if Bette Midler hadn't been, I would have turned off the movie.
