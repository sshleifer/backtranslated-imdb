I went to see this movie last night as a birthday party at the London National Film Theater. It was the first time I saw it, and I think it's now a terrifying "Twister" as the worst movie I've ever seen. For no reason left, self-conscious and full of images that oscillate and are obviously unclear and incomprehensible, not particularly beautiful or innate, I really do not understand why it is considered classic, homo or otherwise. I usually enjoy movies that suppress borders or even movies that are difficult to watch because of their length or unusual cinematography. But it was really terrible.
