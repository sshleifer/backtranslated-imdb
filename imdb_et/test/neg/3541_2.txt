Do you think you've seen the worst movie in the world? Think again. The person who shaped this box should be blamed for the wrong advertisement. Kate turns it into a terrifying scary thriller. But not. Instead, it is NIGHTSCREAM. The movie that makes "sweeeoooowww !!" every time the credit screen flashes. The biggest name of the film is probably Casper Van Dien, who has hardly any part. <br /> <br /> I voted against it just because I couldn't vote lower. If I could vote something like a negative five thousand, then trust me, I would. So, I now give NIGHTSCREAM 1/2 * 5 just because it ended.
