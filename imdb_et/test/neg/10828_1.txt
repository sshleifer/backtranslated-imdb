Right ... so you have an oak, a ton of water (which looks really slow to flow) and a small town that will inevitably happen under the dam of dams. Throw a fun riddle, probably a mentally unstable and calm architect and his son, and then spice things up, add a weak plot and bad behavior. All in all, if you look at this from the perspective of the customers who pay the movie ... I would feel it would be a pay-per-view movie. If you want to laugh ... then you have to watch this movie.
