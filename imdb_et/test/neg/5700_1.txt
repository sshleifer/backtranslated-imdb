It must be a long time ago that I saw such a bad movie. I have to say that there is a very good and / or realistic film about the air disaster, but this film was a waste of time and money. I also think this is an unofficial way of trying to get a bad reputation in Airbus. First, the cockpit looks a lot like an Airbus cab, and secondly, you have a handle, the third with computers to control the steering / elevators / ailerons with a "wire". When I saw the movie I thought the film was meant to "do not fly with computer-based airplanes like Airbus, use Boeing instead of having a direct link to the steering wheel and steering." <br /> <br /> All I can say: Bad story, terrible action (most of the actors), the worst movie trick ever ...
