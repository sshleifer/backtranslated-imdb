This well-thought-out film is a bit short and unfortunately too many areas. <br /> <br /> The landscape is proud of the Vermont's northern and central view, which gives a story by the middle of this century. Quebec Bill is trying to go back to the current past of his whiskey to save his farm. <br /> <br /> When moving back and forth between magical realism and straightforward action, this film rarely hits its pace. Kris Kristofferson, when Quebec Bill seems to be quite blunt, or else his lines are; or his cross with Yankee and Quebecois accents. Anyway, he just comes out as a low-key shot. However, his dialogues with Gary Farmer's Coville character are bright. William Sanderson's Rat Kinneson is sure. Charlie McDermott shows true potential as a young Wild Bill; but his part is not big enough to carry the scene and he will never steal. Luis Guzman appears on the Memphramagog Lake (with a fine stand-in presentation of Lake Willoughby) as a boy who is not a cabinet accent: who knows? And then there is Bujold Cordelia: an oracle like his namesake, he's channeling Yoda when he enters lines like "You marry a Quebec wife!" Just weird and not somewhere near the puzzler. <br /> <br /> The end gets really nervous. Again, this is a mixture of magical realism and concrete. And Yoda never gives the answer we can understand.
