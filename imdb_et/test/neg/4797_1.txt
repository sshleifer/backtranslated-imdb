I went to see this movie with Matchstick men, actually buying tickets for Matchstick men and went to others because it looked like a fun movie with action, romance, excitement, jungles and exotic locations. They had it all, but so many movies with the concept of the story. <br /> <br /> Everything I can say is WHY WHY WHY WHY DO THOSE DO NOT MAKE IT AS A Straight Story, instead of returning some horror. <br /> <br /> Here are all the movies the movie has seen: Of course, Indiana Jones and Romancing the Stone, but also True Lies, life proof that the old 80s Tom Selleck's film, Bananas (Woody Allen) and Hero ( the use of digital extras). <br /> <br /> PS's only scene in a movie that was cool is when a central character finds his space blown.
