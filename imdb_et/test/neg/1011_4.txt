"Death Wish 3" is a movie equivalent of a shooting gallery. All characters (except of course Bronson Paul Kersey) exist only to kill, either as "provocation" (good boys) or "punishment" (villain). The director simply casts meaningless violence (people are even burning alive and blowing up), making it a "Commando" version of the city (and Charlie, like Arnold, rarely bothering to protect himself from the enemy fire). Fans of this short thing (and probably many) will enjoy it, others .... be careful. (* 1/2)
