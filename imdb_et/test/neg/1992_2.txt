Cow and cynical, "Hospital" represents Paddy Chayefsky's special brand, which marks the status quo hidden in the satire. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Arthur Hiller, a ham-handed director, this ridiculous script visually gets a bad bad pace presentation that it deserves. <br /> <br /> Only George C. Scot's excellent performance, which he was born playing, keeps the hospital from a complete disaster. Ironically, Scott's performance is a service for viewers. His magnetism keeps them watching when they can turn off the VCR and look at the cabinets, the clouds, or the Baywatch. <br /> <br /> Certainly someone who emotionally invests in modern medicine, which has apparently gone, seems disappointed when Chayefsky shows that the system works just fine so you stop your carp. <br /> <br /> While the first half of this movie gives some fun black comedy is all red herring. Before that, it becomes clear that Chayefsky gives Scott the good features of his middle-aged, middle-class, white man stand. <br /> <br /> Bitter, alcoholic, impotent, Scott Dr. Herbert Bock has alienated those who know him best and has a bile to dispose of. Of course, in Chayefsky's worldview, Bock makes a magnetic hippie chick of his age. <br /> <br /> Playing with adjectives, long-haired, long-haired, braless and almost busted, Diana Rigg fights for "girl". The British rigg is uncertain as the southwest free spirit, but other actors also fight. Rigg cannot, like the other good disappeared, fail to cross a script that is not interested in any character except Bock, or any philosophy beyond banality. <br /> <br /> For fans of George C. Scott, this is another star move and worth a look. For Black Comedy fans, turn it off after the first 45 minutes. Don't worry about anyone else.
