This movie was absolutely terrible. The only explanation I can think of from some of the good reviews here is that they are written by cast people. This movie was really painful. Even my grandchildren (aged 6-13) couldn't see it. As far as I know, this film did not do in theaters and for good reasons. It would be like some people sitting around the beer and saying, "Hey! Let's make a movie. Who wants to be in this?" It's so bad. In addition to Luke Perry, who is only a small part of the film, I didn't know any other actors. This is not necessarily bad, but it is the case here. I liked Sandlot (I) and I generally like stupid and foolish movies, but this film doesn't have any quality of redemption. The people who wrote it do not have the slightest idea of ​​how children think, speak or act, and the film is a confusing confusion of dirty lines and stupid jokes. I rarely write negative comments, but this is the worst film I've ever seen from Man's best friend, and it's definitely one of the ten worst films I've ever seen in my life. When you rent it, keep in mind that I warned you. The fact that some people rated this movie as good is a sad comment on their taste and intelligence. I'm not an exaggeration.
