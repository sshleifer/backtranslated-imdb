The wolf's curse begins reluctantly Werewolf Dakota (Renee Porada) manages to escape from his pack and the town where he works in the vet 6 months later. The rest of Dakota's package is unhappy and wants her back, their leader Michael (Todd Humes) says she's coming back to them, but the greasy Werewolf Franklin (Brian Heffron) chooses her smell and the package decides to force the problem and get her back using her love for her friends, including his boyfriend Danny (Dennis Carver). Can Dakota save Danny and finally get rid of his werewolf tracker? I doubt you care ... <br /> <br /> The chairman produces, wrote and directed Len Kabasinski, who also played a relatively big role in a movie such as Stick, which I was afraid of watching a wolf curse, because Kabasinski was a man Swamp Behind Zombies (2005), which is certainly one of the worst films ever made. Unfortunately, my worst fears confirmed that the wolf curse is a truly terrible film, both conceptually and technically. A wolf curse is a movie where a low budget dictates what happens and a script, not budget dictation. You get the impression that everything is written and intended to take advantage of a couple of sets and the actors you received, you can almost imagine the actors who say we have some actors, some basic equipment, and a couple of places to make fear movie around them. The story is terrible (Michael finds the location of Dakota, looking at the big dog, two women walking), the character is terrible (a big greasy werewolf boy who drives a lot), the dialogue is terrible (almost everyone has no motivation for anything that happens (why the pack are so desperate to get back to Dakota?), people just look at things randomly, and since the director Kabasinski's background is in martial arts, he requires a lot of random martial arts sequences, not offensive, but it's a horror movie, not a martial art, isn't it? Except for some werewolves, you would be hard-pressed to describe the Wolf's curse as something approaching the horror film, almost two hours long and it seems to be going on forever and so slow and endless that it's just not funny. <br /> <br / > Director Kabasinski obviously worked with a small budget, but this bad film making should be a crime. no consistency, fighting scenes look terrible and so badly staged that it is wrong and sometimes it is impossible to keep track of what's going on because it's inconvenient editing and bad camera angles or the fact that sometimes it's so dark you literally can't see anything. Seriously, at a time when the Wolf's curse is from time to time, when the screen is completely black and you don't see anything, I hate to have to look through it, looking at it with fuzzy low resolution VHS. Sound is also terrible, you hear the wind and the wind from the microphone! Almost every scene has many other unpleasant and unwanted surrounding sounds. Did the lighting have lighting in the production? It doesn't know it. The special effects consist mainly of werewolves masks that look like the shops that the shops sell to Halloween children, basically they look terrible. <br /> <br /> Technically, the curse of the soul is as bad as they come. m sorry, because i know it was a small budget but it is really terrible to sit down and try to collect entertainment. It's the quality of a high school student, I'm sorry if it sounds uncomfortable, but that's a fact. To act, maybe I think I'll stop myself here before I say anything else, I mean, I've done enough of it and I really don't get that joy. <br /> <br /> The wolf's curse is terrible, both conceptually and technically, it's a real chore to sit. The wolf's curse is the type of film where your time seems to be standing, it's a type of movie that lasts almost two hours, but it feels like two years. One of the worst movies you or I will ever see will definitely be avoided.
