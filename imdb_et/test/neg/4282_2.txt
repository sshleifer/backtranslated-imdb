Animation is great, I admit it. But Disney continued every stereotype that Alaska residents have tried to overcome in the last two generations. And the names, I mean, come ... Sitka, Kenai, Tanana & Denah (Denali's cheesy takeoff)! These are the real places where real people live! And the real people to whom these real places have been named are probably the land that is trying to look out for revenge on this little little blow. Disney, you're out of California and Florida, just among the rest of the countries that still treat us like a foreign country. If you can't keep up with what you know, at least hire and / or work with people who know what area you're trying to do. Maybe it wouldn't be so offensive! (
