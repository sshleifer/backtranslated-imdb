I really like Lawrence and I was in Australia that I haven't seen much of my upright, so when I saw it in my video store, I thought I was watching. I wish I hadn't seen it now. Apparently Lawrence had a deep experience that opened his mind, and I think he wants to share it with others, but it wasn't time or place. <br /> <br /> This whole experience seemed to be a motivational speech in hell, it really did. I believe that at night there was a catch phrase "drive up to the fall of the wheels", which he confused with just sexy jokes that turned around sex and genitalia. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, I don't think about raw humor, but Lawrence doesn't have a gift to classify Eddie Murphy, Richard Prior or Robin Williams in fashion. Lawrence was just lewd, the only time I laughed, was when he recovered his experience with the law and his recovery at the hospital. If there were minus points, I'd give them ....
