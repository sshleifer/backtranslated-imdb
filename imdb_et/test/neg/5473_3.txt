Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing combined one horror film; it always sounds like a terrible plan. Two of the most diverse cultural figures from their generation, who had already played together in terrible genres such as "The Flesh and Fiends" and "From Beyond the Grave". How can it go wrong? Unfortunately, this may be the case. To my deeper regret of the "Minotaur lands" can hardly be called mediocre, and that despite the pain, the exotic environment, the tempting title and the potentially high sounding assumption. In Greece, far from a small area, especially near the archaeological site, many tourists disappear because Baron Peter Cushing and his obedient followers keep them in the fire-proof Minotaur. Cushing, who never saw the more boring and uninteresting role he played in the past, has a giant medieval castle, and probably in Greek means you also have additional archaeological ruins and an underground cave network. This is of course quite convenient if your hobby is a robbery of casual campers and amateur archeologists. If three of his young friends disappear from the same area mysteriously, a couple of town priests Roch will decide before the investigation. The "Minotaur Land" is a boring and extremely slow pace that never takes any major attempts to create a satanic atmosphere and does not worry about specifying the details of all potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia. For example, the Minotaur's Greek mythology is an intriguing creature with a bull and a human body, but for some unexplained reason, the script never enhances importance. Instead, the film focuses on tedious and overly telling sequences and loudly unsuitable music that has been altered by experimental noises. The only reason to even consider such a disappointment in the film is the possibility of Donald Pleasance. His image of a rude, boss, and old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents contemporary youth is powerful and reliable as always.
