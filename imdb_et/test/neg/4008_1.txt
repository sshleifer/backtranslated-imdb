Let me tell you a story. One day on the streets of Athens, the film director came across a male prostitute and decided that the world MUST know its story because ... you know ... he's been deprived ... and he takes his shirt off a lot and ... so on. <br /> <br /> This movie is the result of his revelation. Repulsive, exhausted, homophobic, misognist ... but of course full of beautiful boys with their own boxes. If this is your good movie idea, enjoy it if you don't avoid it like a plague. <br /> <br /> It will make me in Greece that is certain.
