Steven Seagal is a thief who specializes in the abduction of drug dealers, giving the poor and the deplorable ... a little, Harlan, Robin Hood. Anyway, Harlan wants to go straight to her girl Jada (Mari Morrow) so she works to work as a armored car for Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe, who has been wasted). Max plans to get millions of himself and his unscrupulous companions to use his charger Bruno (Robert Miano) to bring him money, but Harlan has other plans. Fleeing from Pollan, hiding money and hiding Bruno (who had loaded the gun with Harlan's head, who didn't drive him when he didn't drive), Harlan goes out. Harlan has been imprisoned, among other things, because of the police murder caused by the rapid reaction, and many want to know where the money is. Harlan joins forces with a prisoner, an ice (prison), the leader of one of the many gangs in prison, breaking out plans to find Max and eliminate all of his corrupt associates. Soon, DEA agent Rachel Knowles (Sarah Buxton) will be part of this scenario thanks to her superior, Saunders (Nick Mancuso), who claims to be a drug. The plot is also injected into a hospital for the closure of Harlan's wish, and Jada has a mystical dream with Max. <br /> <br /> Seagal and Treach are cutting each other talking gangsters, while Buxton spends time trying to help Harlan, revealing the possibility that his boss is capable of Max. Mancuso's character is a strange duck that allows Rachel a lot of freedom despite her career threat. Tighe appears at the top of five minutes, which is a shame. Seagali Harlan escapes from prison and finds every rich Max's companion, discovering inevitably his location after breaking some skulls, grabbing some wrists and breaking some bones. Treach speaks in his rapper speech and Seagal tries to answer him in many ways, giving inadvertently a laugh. As you thought, many people will get off and Seagal will not break the sweat. It is interesting to see that the convicted prisoner in Seagal prison, helping Treachi out when the group "Esesi" plans to take him out.
