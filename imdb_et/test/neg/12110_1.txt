The director of this movie is the famous French television presenter Patrick Sebastien. He loves music and humor for the redneck, and his incredible film is completely in his picture. This is the story of a young slow person called "Zep" (sic). At night, she sees her sister SM's sexual relations and decides to do the same - she rapes the girl she loves! Zep is placed in the shelter and his unhappy girlfriend in the clinic. One man finds them. One man connects them. This man is a psychologist. This man looks like an angel of hell. This man is ... Patrick Sebastien! By using too many clich√©s, we see how Absolute Love can break all misunderstandings and how a humanist doctor can force the victim to fall in love with his violence. We also learn how to use sandwiches to attract girls. Not only does Patrick Sebastien think he can do better than a century-old psychiatry, but he also puts us on a stupid left ideology; Daddy's girlfriend, a boss who wants to take his girl off weakly. Annoying. But it's very nice to laugh at Zep (mentally retarded people aren't funny except in this movie.)
