Grudge 2 ... Let's see. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Japanese horror movie or horror, nor a grudge basher. I loved the first and original Ju-Oni. I think that much more justice could have been done for that. Aubrey was just to fill what was ultimately "discovered" (if you have already seen Ju-On already, then you already know the whole movie), which was really a complete remake of Ju-Ons, just closer to The Grudge. Although everyone might have thought it was coming to America, it was a bit interesting, it was assumed that the house burning at the end of The Grudge left another hunger for the new plot. <br /> <br /> Save your $ 6.50 and wait for it to appear on the DVD, rent it, check it out and decide if you want to buy it. This movie is good for 2 sleeps in the morning movie. But at all, I'd say 4 out of 10. Sorry Grudge fans, it's just ... They just failed.
