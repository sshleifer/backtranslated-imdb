Yes, the film that the visuals have already shown is terrible and not very promising, but the assumption and the light seemed good, so I still expect this movie to be entertained. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The assumption is good, but the story is full of improbability and logically flawed. <br /> <br /> This movie is a potentially cleaned toilet. The main plot is interesting and somewhat original. It's good enough for you to think of a good adventurous movie. This movie, however, fails and I think this is the biggest mistake in the movie. Maybe it's too serious and a little more humor wouldn't make the film any harm. Instead, there is something other than a flat and cheap-looking movie that is filled with one unlikely event after another, which also steals a little too much of other more successful films. Mainly "Jurassic Park" probably. <br /> <br /> Characters do not help to make a movie attractive or at least interesting. I still think that Edward Burns did a decent job as the "heroic" chief driver. The rest of the characters really get confused in the movie and they can do a lot of fun. The film relies more on its visual, which is extremely bad. Catherine McCormack is also very irritating. Basically all her character doesn't complain and talk about how she was and the rest oh so wrong. His character is not just pleasant. And the rest of the characters ... I have already forgotten my names, I think it tells them enough. It is certainly true that Ben Kingsley alone is watching this movie. He's really a great sort of insecure businessman role, but from the moment he goes out of the movie, the movie really goes down fast. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is very bad. It has some terrible CGI effects and they couldn't see convincing effects even in simpler blue screen effects. Sets are also terrible and cheap as they can fall and break up every moment. <br /> <br /> The film will never be tense, exciting or adventurous, because the story is the least interesting and interesting. . It's a very distant film with distant characters who can't impress. There are many sequences of action, but all of them are so ridiculous and far from incredible that they are never tense or good enough. <br /> <br /> So basically, this movie is missing everything that is needed to create a genre. such a film is good and successful. It is sad to see how the low director Peter Hyams has fallen in the last couple of years after the good film of the 70s and 80s. <br /> <br /> 4/10
