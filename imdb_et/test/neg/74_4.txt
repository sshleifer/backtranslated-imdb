The talented scriptwriter Alvin Sargent, unfortunately, cannot get any interesting ideas about baking this artificial cavity on the road mother and her mature teenage daughter who is trying to work her life in Los Angeles, despite her mother's flying behavior. In addition to a number of good sequences, I did not buy Susan Sarandon's flake (he is too smart and focused to pass it on as a devil) and his naturally justified personality is bad for this role. irresponsible parent. Natalie Portman's price is much better for her child, but her work is still horrible (and some of her scenes, like where she asks the boy to stay on tape, are wrong and uncomfortable). It is certainly not an incompetent piece, "Anywhere But Here", which has moments that work but it is not an acceptable film, nor has it been important. ** from ****
