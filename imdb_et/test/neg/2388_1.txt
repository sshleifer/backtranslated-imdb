Four boys (Jacks) enter the restaurant with the fifth Guy and lose common sense. They allow themselves to be misused by textile workers at the turn of the century, leaving the situation just to leave. It's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I hope I can resell this item to someone who likes it. <br /> <br /> It is true that this keeps your attention if you allow the illogical plot developments not to distract you too much. However, it is very silly, but especially when it enters a stranger restaurant. Who is he? Think. <br /> <br />
