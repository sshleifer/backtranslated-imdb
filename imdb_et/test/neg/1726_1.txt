Like many others, I thought the look of Dennis Hopper would not be a complete waste of time. Unfortunately, I was wrong. All this negative talk about this flike is more than true. What the cake takes is a terrible and terrible story for the main people. <br /> <br /> Here's why: the planet can be destroyed, ONLY the way to recover it, to save all mankind through this is to get so many smart, capable, nice and competent people underground. And Dennis Hopper is a single seer / scientist with a vision that was ready for the worst and who has understood it. But what is the main motivation for Stevens (Sonny D'Angelo)? He's angry because Dennis has decided who is rescued or doomed! Although it clearly explained to Stevens that Dennis's character had done everything to warn people of danger, but that he laughed. The Hopper sign was a boy with a finger, and now Stevens accuses him of "choosing and choosing"? And if that's not enough, he wants to stop everything in this hiding place because "it's not fair!" AND .... he is responsible for the death of one person who is the savior of mankind! OH MY GOD, how are you stupid? I mean, two million euros in the budget, what could it have done? Think of Clerks, Blair Witch, and lotsa other movies, made for less than $ 100,000 and were even better. AAAAARGH! I find myself happy that I didn't pay one penny to see this mess, and sit down to this famous end, one of the most heroic things I've done this year. No wonder this writer writer had jobs as a camera operator and headline designer before ...
