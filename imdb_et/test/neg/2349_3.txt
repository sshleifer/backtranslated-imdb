Whatever someone says, its b-movie and effects are badly done .. if you're a vampire fanatic, then I think it would be OK, not 10 out of 10, you other here can't sincerely say that? we look at it as a movie, do not read it as a book, so the effects and characters are important, as well as the story. The story is good, but it doesn't wear the movie, it's no wonder it has a low rating. I write this because I decided to see this movie when I saw good comments in IMDb but I got really disappointed. can't get me wrong, I thought the blade movies were fantastic and loved the underworld, but these characters aren't close. vampire formation is badly done and the consequences are worse. it sucks. I would not be so disappointed if I hadn't read the comments that said it was great. Reviewers must have something to do with the production company or something, seriously, if you think it's fantastic, you don't care about acting or setting up. it's better than a book. 3 out of 10 OK-OK.
