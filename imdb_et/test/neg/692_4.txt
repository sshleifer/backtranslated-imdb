* POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD * <br /> <br /> I only say what has not yet been said here (and I will continue with the rest of WWF / WWE comments). <br /> <br /> If you have a female title, at least make it interesting, not just a squash that puts the current champion. I think Moolah couldn't cope with an intense match, but they wanted a legend in WrestleMania. <br /> <br /> I thought Killer bees were wasted in WrestleMania, especially here. I became a fan in 1989, about a year after Brian Blair was gone and Jim Brunzell became a canvas. So I didn't think for a while that they were top marks, even top competitors. <br /> <br /> But I loved seeing Bill Fralicit in battle. He really reached him, creating the character of the golden heel in an unsuccessful interview and even destroying the royal battle. Alongside Steve McMichael and Kevin Greene, he is the only professional athlete from my generation honoring wrestling (does anyone remember Dennis Rodman?). And what about Hart's ridiculous green tights?
