Snake Island is one of those films that, while one sits and looks at his amazing foolishness, the film camera never wants to be invented. The real reason why Plan 9 from Space captures its venerable title "The Worst Movie of the Time of the Time" for a while is not so much because of how bad it is. This is because it is the most fun bad movie you will ever see. Snake Island is another type of bad. Snake Island is just so bad that it is embarrassing. The stupid assumption combines a script written by monkeys that knocked disposable typewriters onto films that then overlapped to resemble a dialogue to make the most obvious problems here. The film, which is filmed entirely in South Africa, is the film in which the film takes place, the only element that can truly be reasonably held. Many frame-related shots consist of close combat, which is surreal to start thinking about whether these snakes are CGI, dolls, or real snakes fed with really heavy drugs. <br /> <br /> The stars of William Katt, if you can name it as an island traveler, is what appears to be a river barge. With him there is a choice of very general, badly defined characters. Everything is a matter of writing a random screen that ends, but Katt definitely seems to consider shooting his agent. The rest of the majority seems to be from home and stranger school, where the mindset of any unpleasant plot is accompanied by an open-mouthed glance and eyes in every direction. Foley effects are often worse: one memorable scene where a double-caught shotgun sounds like flat sound effects used in games like BioForge. Meanwhile, the snakes are constantly exploding or jumping randomly. It would have been more accurate to name Snake Holocaust. <br /> <br /> Of course, these days, the Z-Class horror or sci-fi movie is not complete without being dressed up for nubile women. As every woman cast, almost gets her clothes off, the movie begins to become less Snake Island and more Snake Island Orgy. But like all the worst piles, there's really a lot of setup out there that lacks real profitability. Sexual scenes may never happen and the death of characters is so flat, so uninteresting that the whole movie becomes meaningless. If you don't think you're looking at William Cat running through an unpleasant cricket, tougher forest and crush scissors in all directions with a bat, it will cost you. Because I don't know. I thought Anaconda was the worst film ever on predators. I was so, very wrong. At least Anaconda had a snake who might have been afraid if they stopped suspicion for some time. Some of the shown scissors that killed human pain are no bigger than some of the rubber bands I've worn. <br /> <br /> So we still have a checklist for bad horror movies that go nicely. Unknown, lame cast is considered as well as bad sound and visual effect. The dialogue is so sad, so badly timed, that I've seen better writing and delivery while playing some school, which I did many months ago. Unfortunately, where Snake Island falters in this area is a deadly area for all bad movies. In essence, it is so bad that it is funny. It is so bad that after opening the credit it will end up good and will become the second that the cast begins to speak. Compared to William Katt's activity at Snake in Iceland, Jon Voight's Anacondas was both Oscar-worthy and Russell Crowe in the Gladiator. Not that Voight or Katt is necessarily a bad actor, but with such material you will of course have one word to say. Listening to some lines was like a victim of a violent crime. Reason tends to eliminate experience, which is the primary self-defense mechanism. <br /> <br /> Because of this failure, I didn't give Snake Iceland ten. My special result for such bad films is that they may not be good but not bad enough for entertainment. It's all just so boring or meaningless that you can also look at the test pattern. A suitable way to write "nonsense" is S-N-A-K-E-I-S-L-A-N-D.
