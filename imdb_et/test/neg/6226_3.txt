This is a new approach to comedy. That's not funny. <br /> <br /> The joke is that it, of course, should be funny. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a French short story, located in Paris and characters in French. Louis Aubinard, for example ... played ... Bob Hoskins? The film also marks French Jeff Goldblum and Natasha Richardson equally. The situations are similar and the characters act like these Carry-On movies years ago. <br /> <br /> I believe they are also jokes - those actors who don't try to act French in any way to get them a comedy for a wide range of English dance halls and leave the whole Bloomin mystery open to the public. <br /> <br /> In the Humor Department, it is virtually the Algonquin Round Table, isn't it? <br /> <br /> The film is trying to be charming and peculiar and I think these qualities are kind of funny. Maybe not as funny as Duck Soup or Love and Death, but more fun than Deer Hunter or Battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> This is an example of personal movie making. It does not make a real effort to get to know the audience and share it, but it remains within its space and internal logic. Although all situations are incredible, they are logical in the bizarre world of the film itself. <br /> <br /> I like such an eccentric movie, but I found it too slow to numb, annoying, and offer too little pleasant surprises or real spirit. It's like shifts in predictable and sophisticated ways and wastes great talents along the way. It must be the lower point of any major career that is otherwise distinguishable. I found this to be the biggest waste of talent from Betsy, and I wish I had never seen Goldblum and Hoskins in this matter. <br /> <br /> So call it interesting and let it go for rent if you don't have much time to kill. <br /> <br />
