This film was lacking in many areas. This is the Elvis guy who drives cars and has turned to BANS for SATANS ANGELS. One of them is named Banjo and they beat the fun after college kids. You want Elvis's man to be their "leader". Sometimes I wanted people from MSTK3000 to be silent because the movie was really good. Of course, there was violence and many cheesy traits like "What kind of beer do you want? COLD ONE". It was cheesy. The guy who plays Banjot is a great boxer and I was happy to see that he was doing some fighting scenes. The FATS biker NAZI SWASTIKA was also his jacket !!! It was pretty bold when I had to say it myself.
