(r # 64) <br /> <br /> A non-returnable, less valuable, and above all harsh trash. You know, the movie is bad when its only star is Lance Henriksen. The French title of this movie says everything "inexplicable". How can you make this movie incredibly bad on this day and age? Whatever Jonas Quastel is, it is. It's Ã¼ber-trash, I'm talking about "Manose" level nonsense, pointless, unobtrusive, non-even-bad-that's good, movie movie in the highest order. <br /> <br /> Lance Henriksen IS Harlan Knowles, a character who might have been interesting if he wasn't so completely lacking in qualities or personality. He goes with a bunch of bullfighters to look for an evil Sasquatch, which is thought to have attacked an aircraft that fell in the forest or something. Nothing happens. There's some nudity in the soft core (meaning: Teletubbie level) and some "Predator" dirty cracks. After 92 minutes of complete pain and another hanging scene, this time "Blair Witch", the movie finally finishes the finish line and ends. As a bonus, we see the monster itself in only one or two scenes throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about this movie. All you need to know is that it's a very bad movie and it's not even worth it as "so bad, it's good" flick. "The Untold" means the entertainment value that Orlando Bloom characterizes. Avoid this as arsenic.
