I just saw this movie in a beautiful air-conditioned cinema here in Bangkok. And because the ambient temperature is very high at about 37 Â° C, my 100Bt is not wasted. <br /> <br /> If this is not the case, I have not seen such a very well-made spam for a long time. It's a movie that offers a taste test. Anyone who claims to like or loves it immediately goes to the same list of tasteless backgrounds that still speak of British television. The old wide wide at least wheelchair was good for some of the blame. <br /> <br /> Pseudo-depth and fat lips, though having a lot of French cinema, aren't really a good movie. I'd rather look at Independence Day 10 times in a row than sit back with that stinker.
