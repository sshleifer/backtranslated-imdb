It's hard to find anything to praise with this movie. It's not the worst picture, but it doesn't mean much. The plot is rather inconsistent and incredible; it seems that the producers wanted to make a cosmic film, but decided to make it underwater to get into the Abyss success. In some scenes, it seems as if the story really was placed in space; there are landing gear in the area, technicians are worried about hanging rubber diving clothes at a depth of several kilometers, where the pressure breaks the diver and the suit like an empty beer can. <br /> <br /> The movie starts right by planning to restore the lost navy slave. After that, the film will suddenly take the siren. <br /> <br /> The effect is so. Navigation screens are all made on the Commodore 64 (remember that this is 1990, not 1983), the sub is controlled like no other; Instead of control consoles, officers have keyboards with which they enter a long number to control the ship's various functions. The interior of the ship is also not convincing. <br /> <br /> The final scenes will jump uncomfortably absurdly. Welcome to the fifties, you can control the suspension of your belief on the door. <br /> <br /> I don't see a joy factor here. The film is not a good or fun bad MST3k style (until you reach the final scene), it's like eating a little gentle apple.
