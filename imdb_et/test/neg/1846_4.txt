Who wrote this film's scenario has probably never consulted with Lucille Ball books, especially his autobiography. I have never seen so many mistakes in the bio-region, from his early years in Celoron and Jamestown to his later years with Desi. I could write a whole series of factual errors, but this would happen for pages. All in all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of the most imperceptible people who cannot be imagined by anyone else. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be angry at how many mistakes were made in this movie. The filmmakers tried hard, but the film seems terribly sloppy to me.
