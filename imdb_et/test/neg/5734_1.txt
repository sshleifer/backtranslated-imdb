In the mid-1970s was my NYC. finally, the cable was built for cable TV and since Showtime (instead of HBO) was the only channel that offered the latest movies, I registered it. Being a writer and a night owl by nature, I soon discovered that the channel showed films late in the evening, and until the morning morning hour had ever heard - most of them were American independent films and foreign films that had never been given to them by the US theater edition. Many of them were recognizable "stars" and venerable leaders, and thanks to Showtime I discovered many first-class movies I (and other Showtime subscribers) who would never have been able to see. Most of these movies were indeed "dogs", but they were often so bad that they were unintentionally fun. One evening, Showtime introduced a small Italian pearl called "Redneck" (filmed in 1972, giving a limited European release in 1973). Although the film was never published in the US, the MPAA rating was "R". As the director was one of Sylvio Narizzano (the director who gave his name to the brilliant "Georgian girl") and three members were Mark ("Oliver") Lester, Fabio Test and Telly Savala, I decided to try. And I found myself shifted to my TV screen for 89 minutes incredibly. Recalling two of the criminals in Savala and Test, a former fierce maniac who accidentally sent a German family to death in one abdominal scene, poking his trailer out of the cliff and falling down the desert. So far it is so bad. Then the Test (like "nice" psycho) and Lester (all 14 when the movie was made) does not look in the men's room as naked as the Test slips on the body of the child while shaving and the poor confused Lester fixed the test with naked butt close-ups. As the film industry's still unattended member and card-carrying liberal (I was as much against censorship as I am today), put the whole movie in trouble (and in the early 70s when I thought I saw something-going films in this liberated era - including Altman) cold day in the park "uncut version, real jaw drop, until it was trimmed for" R "rating, and would have written the end of Altman's career if he wasn't the next one to call" M * A * S * H ​​"), I still don't know if anyone other than me ever saw "Redneck" and was terrible when I was. Acting with actors and movie transmissions is a joy for unmatched filmmakers' entertainment since the beginning of time. But using a very respectable and talented child artist (Mr. Lester) at a time when he started to make a difficult deal for an adult adult actor (and I am sure his movie offerings were therefore unfortunate junkies like "Redneck" "... Mr. Narizzano, you (By the way, I was soon going to have friends with actors who had appeared in Narizzano's future, which they didn't want to recognize. They both despised him.
