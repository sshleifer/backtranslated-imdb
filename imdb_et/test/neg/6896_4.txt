I took my family to see Barnyard last weekend. We had waited so much, but if my kids hadn't been there, my husband and I would have left. When we came from the farmers' community, we found that all the male bovines in the film, having the tails drawn from them, were a little disturbing. We felt that we were looking at a trap cow or something. It was just strange to hear that the male voice came from the woman's body. After checking some of the production pages on some other website, I felt that the animators could slip into that fact. I know this is just an animated, humorous show, but with the placing of the female body parts on the man I had so much that I could not enjoy such a movie as I have. I know the udders can be found funny, but they were definitely used. No other animals on the film had any gender-specific parts of them, and I would have preferred the bulls in this show to be at least as accurate as they were at all. However, the children enjoyed the movie, although we took the time to make sure they knew the difference between bulls and cows.
