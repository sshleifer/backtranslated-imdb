I saw the Greek Tycoon when he first appeared in 1978. I found it very boring. I thought it wasn't better than a travel book, except for one thing: for the first time in my life, I realized why it would be good to be rich. I saw the Aristotle Onassis yacht landscape and opened my first true look at the rich and famous lifestyle. Paraphrasing Martha Stewart: It was good. Funny, I don't remember sex. I hadn't seen the movie because it was on a big screen and found that the lover was memorable at that time. Maybe because I was younger and single, it wasn't a big deal.
