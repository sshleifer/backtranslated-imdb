I'll probably try to make one of the worst movies ever, I'm still trying to figure out if it was going to be fun, but I certainly didn't have any fun at all. Maybe the movie lost the movie during the English-Italian translation, for sure I missed this courage to look at it again in its original version. <br /> <br /> My price for this 2/10 and I feel I'm m pretty generous (let's say 1 point is for Liv, because she's a nice baby, and the second is their proper for actors who trapped a precious, useless, and pathetic movie) <br /> <br /> Alex
