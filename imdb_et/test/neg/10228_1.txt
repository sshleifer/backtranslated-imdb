HOW ALL MOVIES ARE NEEDED WITH ALL HEIGHT, IS THE RAGTAG TEAM WITH ALL MONEY? !!!!!!!! There is nothing new in "The Big Green". If anything, you want to lose them. Steve Guttenberg had such a good recovery ("Brazilian Boys", "Police Academy", "Cocoon"). Why, oh WHAT, did he have to make such films in the 1990s and beyond? So, just avoid this movie. There are a lot of good movies, so there's no reason to waste your time and money on this spam. Apparently "green" was the money for them because there is no creativity here. At least in recent years, Disney has produced some smart movies with Pixar.
