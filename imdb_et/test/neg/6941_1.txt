This film basically uses spouse rape as one of its main comic devices. Now I turned it off at a time when she literally tied her to the bed and raped her, but I can't really imagine how it would finally become fun and funny. This movie not only destroyed a wonderful lie and was constantly uneven, but managed to be quite disruptive and misognitive. How so many people seem to have this sweet family flick that's over me. "Definitely enjoying the preservation of these apricots last night" is not a funny joke if you know that it refers to an unwanted virgin to have sex with you in the hopes she finally learns. Watching tracking bans isn't fun for a family member. I honestly feel that I was looking at half of this horrible "comedy" and I'm completely confused by these positive comments.
