I love ghost stories and I sit through the end of the movie, even if I don't really enjoy it. I rarely feel that I wasted my time ... But this Bell Witch story was terrible! <br /> <br /> It wasn't the least scary. What are the moments of comic relief? The dialogue was annoying. Controversial actions The film was too long and some scenes were open. (Like a birthday party) <br /> <br /> The only good idea I have to mention is costumes and props that were well done. , I'm going to read the story.
