First, let me explain that I love aircraft and watching movies with these films is usually worth it - and I've been sitting through some shocking ones. The same does not apply to this film. James Stewart is a great actor, but he has been wasted on promotional films in this strategic airline. Operation is mediocre and the direction is weak. I had to stop watching this terrible garbage about half way. This was despite some very good, perhaps even the best aerial photography. The problem is also for a nutty like me, doing something about the shocking plane (B-36 and B-47) just too much on the nerves. It is a shame that the film was not made when B-52 appeared, then the top races used for the aircraft of this film would have been valid. Then I could have sat through it. Maybe I have lost a movie point that may be loved by loved ones when they are loved by active tasks. In any case, it could have been much better. Suggestion? It is worth disappearing.
