An unprecedented, but - to varying extent - traceable, mostly meaningless "stories" collection. But let's start from above. <br /> <br /> Kaurismaki: If anyone knows what Finnish love / romance was like, maybe this boring little strange is some sign. Weak feelings, non-emotions, apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from Finland to Siberia! I think this story follows "Our Honeymoon from Siberia to Greenland". Anyone who obviously had no idea what to write for this little movie, so he just made a semi-non-"story" that focused on the band he likes (or maybe they are his friends) because we can watch them and Listen to their music in more than two main characters. <br /> <br /> Erice: You haven't heard this man before? and now I know why. Nice black and white photography and pretty much anything else - if it can't be boring, it can be considered an asset. But you would be surprised at how many film critics and film students love boredom in the movies, so I would recommend Erice's 10-minute stab to these two humanoid groups. <br /> <br /> Herzog: Not a movie, but probably a slice of his documentary about South American tribes. It's not a short film, it's a report, but given that the first two scraps are boring, Herzog is a bit refreshing and has some interesting moments and if anything else fits the film's "time" concept very well. br /> <br /> Jarmusch: As it was almost expected, this interesting filmmaker (peanut brain, gifted idiot defender) serves us one more nonsense. He has become lazy and cannot be disturbed to write something interesting, either for his own films or for his collection, such as TMO. Looking at the only bright side, how the stupid veggie actor spends 10 minutes in the trailer, is that it is played by lovely Chloe Sevigny. Otherwise, leave this crap. Oh, and btw: I don't think every young actor listens to classical music; Did Jarmusch try to be surreal by making Chloe listening to such music? Maybe Lindsey Lohan may be listening to opera? Maybe Drew Barrymore is a jazz fan? Who am I saying they're not? <br /> <br /> Jim Jarmusch is a moor. Oh, right ... I already mentioned that ... <br /> <br /> Wenders: Here's the real movie shock: Wenders can actually do something good !!!!! Everything else I've seen about this overrated charlatan has been boring and pointless so far. But this short story is made with style (! ?? atypical) and it is the best part of the movie. This leaves one who wants to see it more, even though the story is in resolution. <br /> <br /> Spike Lee: Oh, dear God? What can I say here? Lee makes someone know the talent. Like Herzog, does he choose a story, but a report? and the report on left-wing political propaganda! CNN, but black and white and unilateral, of course. Of course, the slower title "We Wuz Robbed" of this "small sleep-inducer" is how poor, light and endlessly idealistic democrats WUZ ROBBED Bush and his EVIL EVIL team. It is by far the toughest and the most boring movie, and I had to use the speed dial button to not break. Spike Lee is really the result of a positive action. God knows how many truly talented (black) directors could never make movies because this pretentious and talentless little runtime is an opportunity to do it. And he gets it wrong every time! Now it takes some talent, right? <br /> <br /> Reverend: The Chinese story is a prerequisite. That's okay, more. <br /> <br /> All in all, there are many, much better movies to spend time with, but if your time is not as valuable (as is probably the case with my own) you can watch this little movie. <br /> <br /> "Ten minutes for sure that cinema anti-masters can have eternity. Time is precious. - Fedor Miklowitz, 1588
