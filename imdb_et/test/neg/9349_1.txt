I like the "Star Wars" series. I also like good, cheap sci-fi, as well as some time. Heck, I like even the best of Roger Corman's nickel-dime. <br /> <br /> I don't like "Ice Pirates". <br /> <br /> For one, it just seems too cheap, you know? For a movie that is supposed to take place in space, it seems narrow and closed, as it is recorded on someone's Mazda front seat. And the special effects, though suitable for cheeses, seem more than anything that is metallic gray-colored foam rubber. . <br /> <br /> They are not. <br /> <br /> The whole story of those non-well-spatial pirates who decide to find a planet full of ice can thaw and sell underwater (hot goods in the future) is about as original as jokes which is not compliment. <br /> <br /> Humor comes about at the foot level (like this castration) on a machine that you see early on) and everyone seems to have a tough attitude. And who told John Matuzak that he was funny? Whoever did, shame them. The good old Robert Urich is trying, but he is a trusted actor on a poorly sinking ship (or in this case a full-length ship). <br /> <br /> I watched it about three times and I felt like every time - shanghai. <br /> <br /> No star. Despite Huston's presence (one year before "Prizzi au") and Carradine (a one-time career at the tail end), these "Pirates" should walk with the plank.
