This exhibition is what happened to the screensavers after G4 got it, taking it from a useful source of computer information to an exhibition, the highest point of which was pulling a miniature web server from somebody. When the G4 ratings fell, they moved away from their original target group of players, generic hormone-guided young men, adding eye candies to workers and the gender counseling segment. Now, even the players who praised the show are disgusting. I look forward to the exhibition and the network is mostly late and earned death.
