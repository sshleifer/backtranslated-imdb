I am speechless. Matty Simmons has managed to do something I thought was impossible. He has made "Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan Island" like "Citizen Kane". Painful can't even describe this piece ... I don't know. Keep in mind that the assumption sounded funny, but now that I saw it, it's funny that falling down on your scrotum is funny. <br /> <br /> I don't care to describe the premise, as the title says, but to say that I don't think that in this movie there was literally one funny thing, no one, not even a monkey bite. How could one of the funniest signs of "Holiday" franchise, a lousy white trash, Eddie (Randy Quaid) make it so terribly uncomfortable? I never felt such a great compassion for the actor in my life. I liked the others in this "comedy", Miriam Flynnis (Catherine, Eddie's long-suffering, but sunny woman), Dana Barron (the original Audrey Griswold), Fred Willard and the stunning Sung Hi Lee (the only reason to watch the movie when to turn off the sound) except this old Commie, Ed Asner (Uncle Nick), he had come. Unfortunately, there was no audience. I only say "thank heaven" that Chevy Chase, who has fallen for years, drove this diarrhea spray, it is the wiser career he has ever done. <br /> <br /> I don't know if your people are religious as I am, but I know I pray today to the Lord to add 2 hours (if not 2 years) to my life to make up for the time I spent in front of the TV to never get back. <br /> <br /> Hot water burns baby says ZERO 10 stars (if you take a few strokes and drink water, maybe one tenth of 10 stars)
