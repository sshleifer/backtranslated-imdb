This is a movie is very bad. I like to fold the TV and this movie looked like it would be good to sleep and the boy was wrong. My body woke up in my sleep while sleeping and said, "Hey ... this movie is terrible ... you have to watch it". I love bad movies with bad actors and fools. Something unintentional about comedy goes to me. This movie is impressive. I really don't know how to ignore it to suggest you look at it to see how bad it is. I mean seriously, you should watch it with people. During this movie I made the best jokes and no one heard them. <br /> <br /> Worse than Swimfan. It's so bad.
