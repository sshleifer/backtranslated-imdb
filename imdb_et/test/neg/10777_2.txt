The title, though unique, undoubtedly reminds us of the real horror blowers of Tod Browning's immortal classic circus frenzy and how they were misunderstood from the outside world. I can assure you that this "thing" has nothing to do with "Freaks" or even with professional filmmaking in general. This movie was recommended for me because it is raw, disturbing and thought-provoking, despite the low budget. Share, of course ?? The person who suggested this to me can now consider myself to be my personal enemy! The low budget factor is right, but it's concise. "Freak" is terribly slow, badly done, and every introduced character is completely unsuccessful? Two sister-new brothers on their way to a new life are confronted with a deformed mental patient who escaped from a truck to another hospital and headed back to the house where he killed his mother at age 9. but instead Tyler Sharpe decided to make it a boring and pointless family drama. Leading actress attempts to feel emotionally devastated are pretty ridiculous and the lack of a limited budget and effort is limited by the budget. The whole failure!
