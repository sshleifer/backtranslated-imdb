I have to say that there is one redeeming bullet for this movie. This firmly affirms the bottom of the barrel. Now the filmmakers know what to do when making the film. Other than what I regret to look at this attack. What a shameless abandoning this "movie". What is the waste of $ 100,000 (right, any dollar). This "film" reminds me that the "Adult Video Awards" show in which "industrial prostitutes" group they praise themselves, believing they are real actors, actors and filmmakers. Ironically, how I looked at blue films for better functioning, directing and writing. I also found it funny that the CEO, Justin Ament, just had to be in the movie. He plays Deputy Jake Barker. I'm sure his "acting" career has taken off ... Ted Pfiffer, a writer, has a part. Undoubtedly, he had created his own created clich√© in glory. It should be noted that Carrie Finkle has a leading role in the film. Maybe you remember him from Gus Van Sant 'Elephant. Although I'm not sure he wants to write this movie in his CV. And I'm not sure what is the more depressing point; the money was spent on making this movie or people watching it. Together with the 2004 'Worst Movies', 2004 "LESS FILM", "Torque", "Godsend" and "Sky Captain and Tomorrow World".
