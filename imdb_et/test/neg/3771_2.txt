This overheated southern Gothic "mellerdramer" has some decent moments - but too often the beginner's director of the cliché cliché is beyond the clichés and the star who apparently chose to take on himself to make a picture of his personal presentation. allowing author / director Gabel to upgrade Inge or Williams to a modern "Midnight Cowboy" that corresponds to the "Lolita" tear guide. <br /> <br /> Close your eyes, listen to exaggerated southern heights and try to decide whether to witness a feature film or an exemplary class - full of keen amateurs. <br /> <br /> Johansson has a one-time tolerance (ie less than usual) - although Macht is not good at all, it is a decent, albeit a bit too beautiful a boy who is believed, and Travolta looks like a landscape like ever before (a decent editor and with some help from the leader) his performance could be really touching; as he is, he is - and almost everyone else - too unlikely to ever be moved by us because of boredom or rebellion). Kara Unger is probably the best; if his role had evolved over a few lines, he could even have found the candidate for the best supporting actor. The picture is almost recorded in Leonard Cohen's style of grassy themes, decent product development and locations, and a constant reference to literary works (which has otherwise served as standard scenario reviews, such as "poetic"). some of the old pros like Sonny Shroyer, and perhaps most importantly, Soderbergh operator Elliot Davis are useful - whose fine work is undoubtedly credited for the first time to a driver who can actually study ten or twenty years later. <br /> <br /> But probably not.
