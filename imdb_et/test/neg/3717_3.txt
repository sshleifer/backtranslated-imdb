The film has strange annoying signs, strange inexplicable slapstick, and an insurmountable amount of smoking. The film has a beloved, beloved search for a woman (Jeanne Tripplehorn). Even if you ever want to read Jeanne's character, personality or dialogue, I can't really say. Except he likes to smoke. <br /> <br /> Sarah Jessica Parker gives an interesting character (who wants to smoke). Dylan McDermott does his best to look real and soulful (as he smokes). And hey, what does Jennifer Aniston do there? Oh, he's not really enough for someone to take care of him. (But she likes to smoke). <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time. I don't even know how I got to sit as much as I did. I can't even believe that I spent some time writing it except to warn others of my banality. Anyone need a cigarette?
