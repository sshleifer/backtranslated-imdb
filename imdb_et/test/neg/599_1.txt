I would have given this LESS as 1 rating if possible. The whole film should have remained on the floor of the cutting room. What a wasteful waste of time, money and effort! Let's see ... collect the most beautifully cast sheet (which of course is in direct proportion to the amount of talent they don't) ... throw the finest plot you can dig ... and viola! Disgraceful trash that should be shamed by the Director General and / or the manufacturer to put his name in. How Much Work can a Horror Musician Get? And don't use "low budget" as an excuse ... I've seen many GREAT low budget movies .... in fact some of the best horror classes of some time were low budget. If you don't have the talent and ingenuity to make a good horror movie, don't do it in the name of God!
