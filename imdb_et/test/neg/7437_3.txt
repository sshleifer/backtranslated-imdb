It was okay, but really a little disappointing because I was expecting more laugh. Given the story and the leading actor (Bill Murray), he would have had a lot more fun than it turned out. Only part of it really made me laugh, for example, when Murray lost his half control and rushed along the road at a strange angle. (You have to see it, evaluate it.) <br /> <br /> Supporting casting was something other than pleasant. Just look at the names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yecch! McConaughey's role here as "Tip Tucker" was just completely annoying. He was the worst. Of course, these people had nice moments in the movie, but generally it is not recommended. This is another Disney flop.
