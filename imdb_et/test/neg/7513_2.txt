It's a polarizing film. People seem to love it or paralyze it. I despise it. The film comes from the same context as Lindsay Anderson's Oh Lucky Man, but even though it's a masterpiece, it's just terrible. <br /> <br /> Both films take Kafka's unfinished novel - America, for their inspiration and overall ideal. America is a surreal story of young people traveling across the country. Kafka uses this character as a clean observer who does not change during the trip (although the book is about 300 pages and still looks like a quarter, so we never know). Allowing Kafka to concentrate and comment on absurd / surreal situations and surroundings. Oh Lucky Man follows the same pattern to show Britain to Malcolm McDowell and Weekend in France. <br /> <br /> Both films are also very brechtish, using different tricks and techniques to point out that it is not real, it is incredible, etc. But the difference is where Oh Lucky Man uses a built-in movie to deliver the absurdity of life and the class system, using Weekend's film to capture the ideological polemics of death. As Godard goes beyond Anderson in his Brechtia Principles, we finally end up with two fundamental characters in which we have no investments at all. We are forced to spend 90 minutes with them, but we don't care less about them. Intentionally so. But in doing so, Godard leaves us with a film that is entirely about his own message, which is given through the relentless and overwhelming symbolism on the first side of the film, and long calls on the other side of the camera. . Along with unpleasant and unnecessary scenes, like a really horrible pig slaughter, much worse than any car camera violence that ends with the car. In and out of your positions, while repeatedly hitting you head to get a message. Brecht is a problem when you sell too many viewers, you have transferred them from what you are trying to pass on. It always seemed to me to be obvious. <br /> <br /> The parts that really remain in the crawl of this movie, however, are the opposite of the extremely sexual explicit verbal description of the three in the beginning and the comic rape in the middle of the screen, which, even if it could be considered allegorical, completely destroys the film itself. and its characters that little existed first. It's in French capital F, it's painful. <br /> <br /> Instead, look at Oh Lucky Man. It's a genius. Weekend is a prerequisite. <br /> <br /> Two stars, and only a traffic jam scene and piano music, which are just gene tips, even though they actually make the end result frustrating and unhappy with the bad film of the worst worst director in the world, with them it's clear fucking good technical manager who makes the most intellectually pretentious films in the world. Somehow it is much worse.
