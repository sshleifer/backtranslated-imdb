Although I do not recommend this movie, I do not recommend reading this review despite the movie. Although I haven't given the end or most of the plot twists, it would be best to watch this movie without any prior information. It is difficult to pinpoint the main problem of Donnie Darko because it has a lot to do. In his first feature film, Richard Kelly seems to have gathered enough adolescent rage, late-night stagnants, self-justified justifications and unpleasant, banal philosophy to inspire twenty teenage dramas; they then peeled off a two-hour pack with sci-fi twists. The result is deeply irritating - for all the wrong reasons. The film tries to steer the audience on the twisted roads without knowing the meaning or meaning, so that they can recognize one-dimensional symbols and, above all, they hope that they ignore an underdeveloped plot full of incompatible loose ends, concealing the plywood of CGI effects and neuro-realism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man who is committed to therapy, misunderstood by his friends, and has become hostile and bad for his suburban life. We need to feel that he is more intelligent with his schoolmates, although sometimes it is a difficult assumption. For example, if one of his friends emerges from the absurd theory of Smurfs and Donnie reads his theory, his friend complains that Donnie is acting "all smart". But Donnie's speech is not wiser than her friend - just threatening. The only clear evidence of his intelligence is the description of his principle of evaluating his standardized tests as "scary"; but given the tendency of the director to simply classify human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), it is a substitute for a poor character developer. Donnie takes prescription drugs to combat mental problems that are not directly addressed in this film. In fact, the whole drug issue is underestimated, and one of the first options the director needs to redeem the film is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that it may all be his imagination product, is pushed into the background, making the film 100 percent fiction. It would not be a bad thing in itself, except that the "science" behind "fiction" is very shaky. The explanations of time travel are weak, at best they sound like isolated, uninformed rambling. We get the idea that the film writer once read a magazine or a chapter book and did not remember how it worked, but was sure it was really interesting and wanted to work in the movie. As a result, the scientific part depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than on the actual development of theories (at one point the teacher who talks about the time, says that if he continues to talk about it, he would be fired. No further explanation is needed). Donnie's relationship with a visitor to the future leads him to do a number of witchcraft activities. The rationale behind these measures is complex business. She damages her school, but it's okay because her school doesn't treat her as a person. His punishment for a nervous advocate of self-esteem (somewhat similar to that of Tom Cruise's Magnolia) leads to public humiliation. But should the audience believe that Donnie is a kind of retaliatory angel who is distracted by ignorance and devastation? He himself seems unaware of the consequences of these actions until the fact. In addition to these mistakes, the film is a widespread and interesting generalization of humanity. The story is set in 1988, just before the Bush / Dukakis elections, and the director touches this point during the film. However, the focus is just as far away: Donnie gruff, the blue collar voting against Bush, while her freely pampered, rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. There is nothing even far from here, similar to a political statement; just the statement is obvious. The first one is not necessary to make a good movie, but the latter must be deleted. Likewise, Donnie does not require a cordial speech that she cannot match all human feelings into "happy categories of fear and" love ", it does not require any great understanding from the public. Everyone knows that there are more than two people with emotions and a special emphasis on this fact is worthless Mr. Kelly in his film: ET, Stephen King, Smurfs, Back to the Future, Several 80s Pop Culture Symbols: Respect for Himself, a set of experiences, interests, personal heroes and opponents, allegations and disappointments that have been put together by experienced hands. People who have little or no importance at the plot (including archetypal bully, fat girl and right-hand idiot teacher) are given unnecessary attention, because the director really wanted to pack them in some way. What is Donnie Darko leaves us wondering if Mr Kelly has enough ideas left behind to make a second movie, or if he has wasted all his creativity in one pointless, confused, and inclined. <br /> <br /> My Rating: 1/10.
