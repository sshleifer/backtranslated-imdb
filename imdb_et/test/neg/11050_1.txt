This movie was terrible, simple and simple. Those who see only "movies" and not "movies" are likely to respect them and therefore feel sorry for having such a limited understanding of the theatrical shine of this movie, but I'm safe enough to say that it's boring, confident and the painfully drawn film was a waste of two hours and nine dollars. <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that it was shown by the inexplicable good reviews he had received and the coming theater thought that these reviews had to be written by over-the-elves and a group of people who shun regular movies, -I'm afraid they might actually enjoy some time. <br /> <br /> The story is quite promising - the man is imprisoned for 15 years, never knows his captain or his crime. He is then released sharply and given only five days to detect the identity and cause of his imprisoned person. But the big concept quickly breaks down into a miserable joke because Oh Dae-Su runs around beating people trying to have sex with a young girl trying to use the toilet and eating a live, twisting squid (presumably because of a dramatic effect, there's no other reason). All the time he tries to find out that this terrible thing he earned to serve himself in fifteen years in prison, and when he finally finds it, it's both ridiculous and a big drop. His nemesis, the man allegedly attending school with him when he was a young man, looks like a banana republic that is twenty years younger than his. Hey, I know Oh, Dae-Su is in prison, but is it too much to ask for an actor who looks a little closer to his age? Of all the wrong things about this movie, this seems to be the easiest solution. <br /> <br /> And the big secret - the one that held me in 90 minutes if I could have done something productive - is a joke plot line that includes incest and upper secondary school. Come on! Throw us into the bone - was it really the best they could do? Did I sit through it with stupid dialogues, excessive action, gloomy sets and free violence? (By the way - I am not at all against film-directed violence if it seems to be a good story, but in this case it seems that I was forced to look at how our hero fell off the front teeth and scissors cut off his tongue to repel me so I I thought I was wasting my afternoon gaze on looking for waste). <br /> <br /> Take my advice - do something with your time and money. Or take your nine dollars and go see the humble "movie" - what you really enjoy.
