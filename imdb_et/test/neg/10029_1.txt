Borrowed 3 bad movies to watch with my friends in my dorm room. <br /> <br /> Leprechaun 4, Jack Frost and Prey. <br /> <br /> I took Jack and Lep 4 because they are well-known bad movies I've never seen. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie because it fits the badmovies.org guide to "Find a bad movie", There is no real description, no movie pictures back, and I had never heard of it, be a winner :) <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS, but this movie is so terrible that it doesn't matter: P) <br /> <br /> It's a real bad movie, Lep 4 and Jack Frost are purposeful, it's stupid , despite cast and team's best efforts. <br /> <br /> This "movie" begins a lot like Evil Dead, even the actors are similar and have the same dress. Unlike Evil Dead, it never gets any speed. For the "Slasher" movie, it's pretty funny, 6 people will be killed in 80 minutes, but they have spread so far, it will soon become boring. The director was bored with the animals a lot. hunting, apparently with the whole "Prey" theme, but they don't do anything about the story and are quite bored. Gore is terrible. All these additional shots were to compensate for the lack of script and story. <br /> <br /> The last 5 minutes of a movie are usually released in slow motion, another way to extend it. "Climax" is such a complete joke, its a hard laugh is so bad. The back of the box says, "End the shock and haunt you." Yes, it can shock you that someone could put such a bad "wreck" on the film and "haunt" because you don't think you pay for watching this mess. <br /> <br /> "It's not a human, and it's an ax!" One person is killed in the ax in the whole movie and it is off the screen. <br /> <br /> True to 10. I love to laugh at bad movies, but it's so bad that it doesn't even have comic features. There's no bad movie night without a real character's flick: P
