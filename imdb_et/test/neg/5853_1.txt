Michael Allred's comic books, especially his work with Madman, are usually very fun. "Astroesque", the budget of Allred, is the opposite of fun. <br /> <br /> The worst action ever with a truly dreadful dialogue is a cruel cinematic experience. Pretty sure Allred understands WTF, but he's the only one. The whole confusion you look at is not enough if you don't want to look at you when you look at all the confusion, it's more of a target. 7 "comic book that ironically is mostly illegible. So if your" Astroesque "experience is not terrible, be sure to watch too big cartoons and continue to have fun. <br /> <br /> Feel sorry for Allred, who was completely deeper, I also felt sorry for the incredible waste of my time and money, please buy a copy of my VHS that is currently available on eBay.
