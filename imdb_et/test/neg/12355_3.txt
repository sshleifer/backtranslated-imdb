You must add this comment !!! <br /> <br /> First of all, ironically, you need to add a "spolier warning" to match IMDb parameters, but there is nothing "corrupted" here. There are six characters: a good-looking gal, whose A-list mountain leader is "climbing" in the area and probably all the planet's instructions (including the Everest sherpas); his lost love, which disappeared from the title two years before the party was allegedly seeking, but never found; a friend of his shop owner, as well as a guide who can be better than Sherpa but not suitable for him; a strange driver who deals with his services and says they find their long lost love in the deal; one of his companions, a computer hacker with allegedly inexhaustible expertise, at a sufficient level that Gates can ask him for advice; and his other colleague, bodyguard, who probably has an IQ even a three-digit number. <br /> <br /> Obviously, it is an unpleasant move and the secret actor's secret search is to get back the satellite that has fallen into the "Pass" and has world-changing and unique data to bring them the richest. Exactly what never appeared. <br /> <br /> Obesity, the script looks like something that can get in C's fresh writing class (but F when it is presented at a higher level), and these people worship each of the landscapes like a baby horde. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspects of this movie for me were collecting some of the other three clips or roles I've seen. <br /> <br /> First, the mysterious, undisclosed secret information reminds us of the "Spanish Prison", a A / Mameti film that surrounds a valuable business "process" that has never been specifically explained, but better. Definitely not so here. <br /> <br /> Second, the lead cookie turned out to be even more inventive, then "Rambo" when it quickly dealt with the threat. <br /> <br /> Third, I remember Steven Seagal slipping (don't forget the title), where he was half-conscious and dropped about 1/3 of the time, and completely made up another 1/3. Although I have not asked for much of my work, I have seen enough to point out that, while coma, he gave the best work he ever has, and most in line with his laconic personality. While awake, the young hacker was the most captivating personality on the screen, but the last part was not deliberate and incapacitated, and he could not emulate when he seemed to work best in the seemingly endless two hours. /> <br /> Take a thin, silly base here. Imagine that Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Martin Short are in the fourth role of compressed SNL libit. They could get a laugh when there are few changes in this dialog. <br /> <br /> The most interesting aspect of the last analysis is to consider what information might have been worth even "billions" on spy satellites for any number of peoples, and which is still worthless (according to the guru hacker) if they are just placed the Internet, with no apparent consequences? Even such a turkey should have at least a little logic. That's completely missing.
