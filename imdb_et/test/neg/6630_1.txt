Should I wait for something other than Carrot Topist? It was the worst movie I've ever seen. This is by far the worst comedy I've ever seen. "The chairman of the board" did not add humor to his attitude, but it angered me. That's right, Carrot Top is such a bad comedian that I got the rage that this man was making movies.
