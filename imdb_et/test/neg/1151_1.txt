Let me start with the obvious: anti-Semitism has been a serious problem throughout history, which is in many societies and causes the deaths of millions of Jews. Nevertheless, the problem with this film is that it looks at the United States - probably the most welcomed society ever for Jews outside Israel - as a very different place from Nazi Germany. Founded in 1943, the film is related to a man (William H. Macy) who is confused by a Jew after he is wearing glasses. After that, he happens to have several very disgusting things (he loses his job and he can't find a new one, his neighbors captured him, everybody got into a violent confrontation). Arthur Miller, a self-worthy, patronizing novel that gave liberalism a bad name.
