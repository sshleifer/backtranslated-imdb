I'm so glad I got this movie for just $ 5. Anime is expensive, no doubt. I've been watching for a while and finally saw it on sale. I took it right away and took it home to disappoint in my head. This movie was sucked. I've heard people talk about how this movie is clever and violent. It's not really that expensive or violent. I watched it three times and I think I've wasted that life. Demons get a point to be unique and kind. Sex gets a point because it's almost non-stop. Horny old man gets a half-point to horny and still sex drive. And the main character (who in my opinion has deleted me) gets half a point for the cool design of his weapon. I saw a greater connection between this film and Demon City Shinjuku. Both have the same style of animation, which is obvious because of the director, both have a flat strip of sound that sucks like an Antichrist, and both have terrible endings. Avoid this movie if you are not anime sex.
