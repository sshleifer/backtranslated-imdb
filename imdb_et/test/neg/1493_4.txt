I was very disappointed with this series. It had many cool graphics and that's it. The level of detail he went through was minimal, and I always feel that the audience was patronized - I had a lot of things that seemed to me to be extremely cool, but we didn't explain it in more detail because you didn't get it anyway. We'll show you some beautiful pictures of entertainment. "The host would make interesting sounding words like" sparticles "and" super-symmetry "without any attempt to explain what it was. We had to look at it in Wikipedia. <br /> <br /> Besides, I know quite a few superstrings (for the ignorant) and I found that their explanations were twisted and could have been so much better. They could have chosen much better examples to explain the concepts, but the examples they used were confusing and still hidden. <br /> <br /> If they had cut off all the repetitions, they could easily assemble the series into a single episode: they had to show the Quantum Café clips about 8 times, the host kept saying the same things over and over again. "It's like they were trying to get us brainwashed just to accept" superstrings are the best thing after sliced ​​bread. " It should be a quantum physics education program, not whether the US is better than Europe or vice versa! I also felt that it was part of patronizing - "Viewers need to see a conflict to stay interested." Please. Give me a little more credit than this. <br /> <br /> Generally 2 thumbs down :-(
