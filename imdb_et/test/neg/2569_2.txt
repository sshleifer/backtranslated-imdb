Wow, I haven't seen a movie that is bad because "down to fire". Wait, this is also Seagal movie. Like "On Deadly Ground" and "Fire Down Down", Seagal focuses on his environmental awareness message and how the army, FBI and CIA are incompetent idiots. The problem is that both reality and sensible plot are of secondary importance to any social commentary on gobbleygooks. Seagal is trying to go over.
