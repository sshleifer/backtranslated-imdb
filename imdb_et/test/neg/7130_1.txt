This "remake" is a complete shame: so mediocre, inexpensive and prosaic, it does not deserve more than a few terrible lines. <br /> <br /> It is also cheating with a ridiculous script delivered and amateur "behavior", you are always aware that there is a set, camera, fake, no direction, no suspended reality to allow you to story create. <br /> <br /> The claustrophobic, warm-up tiny spaces and spaces of original Japanese masterpieces (Ju-On 1 & 2) are all lost in oversized kits and spaces here. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, the moral big and unbearable suffering that both gave the original mother hopeless logic and child victims became ruthless respects is totally foolish and pointless, and scares the hollow boogie-man style. <br /> <br /> If an American audience does not want to read subtitles and rises above the lowest common denominator, preferring to swallow such a patronizing hogwash, they f deserve this pathetic curse: the film itself.
