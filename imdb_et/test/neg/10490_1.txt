It's not even lively enough to be fun. There's something out there, hanging out after a crash (turning off the screen), while government leaders are looking at (screen) and bad actors say stupid lines (on the screen), including a man who looks like Jim Carrey with a hangover. "Monster", when finally shown, looks like a "Robot Monster" add-on, but anyway, there's no monster fu. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it's pretty short. Leave it out if you don't want to take off your skull
