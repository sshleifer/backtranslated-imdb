I was able to see what was, in my opinion, another screening in the world, a few days after its opening at the Dublin International Film Festival. When I visited another movie two nights later in the same theater, I saw Brendan Gleeson, Paul Mercier and the rest of the cast and crew members on the second cams ad. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was bitterly disappointed in the movie, I did not expect any masterpiece, but the presentation presented to me, I think he did not have all the essential elements of the genre he had set up. Before I go on, I agree with two things that some filmmakers want to lower their overall expectations, that's not the case here. Secondly, I know it was based on the game (which I have not read, but it has been reported that it is not glowing literature), but it does not relieve the film from its massive narrative problems. /> <br /> My main problem with the film is the script, forget that it was based on the game because the sports comedy that it just does not work, the down and the outside team are trying to win the football cup, few are shown (if they are, it is very short) and we have no satisfaction with the achievements of our sport. By reading so far, you can assume that this is not a rigorous sports film, but a psychological study of the relationship between the driver and his hopeless team. It certainly won't achieve that, I'm not even sure if it was targeted. Any attempt to enlighten the history of any character is hackney and peripheral. In general, I found a script that was missing in many ways. <br /> <br /> I think that performances and music were good and technically, the film was well done. However, aside from the points that Ireland should expect from this stage, I left the theater very disappointed. <br /> <br /> My rating may seem tough, but I think there is a strong hope for a strong near future Irish national cinema and it just doesn't support this argument. Since Studs has become a recommended Dublin Cineworld movie (I was part of the audience that participated in this screening), it seems that most people do not agree with me, so it means you should decide for yourself about the film.
