One minute to UNTOLD and it is already the techniques pulled out by BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PREDATOR. Does that mean we see a lot of trees? We definitely want. Can we see an Austrian body blowing things up? Well, this movie is the budget of TVM, so the answer is surprising. Does anyone like these soft porn like BEDTIME STORIES? Good, because there is such a scene that resembles such exhibitions. Unfortunately, the only thing you see is cellulite. Do you like it when the black screen disappears during TVM? Great because it happens between all the UNTOLD scenes. In fact, it happens during each scene. Did you like MILLIONAIRE - CAUSAL FRAUD? Fantastic as one of the characters looks like Major Charles Ingram, a bearded beard, who tried to show off a million pounds. Seriously one character looks like Major Ingram. I was expecting it to say, "This is a bear. It can be a bear. But it can be a big leg <Cough, cough>, yes it's a big leg <Cough>, it's definitely a big leg <Cough> Yes, I Quit Reply Chris "<br /> <br /> Oh, and have I mentioned that all of the above are good bits? <br /> <br /> UNTOLD is not the worst film film I've ever seen, this acknowledgment goes firmly on the NAME DEMON, which I saw more than twenty years ago, and I think I've seen less than a dozen movies that are worse throughout this time. But it said that UNTOLD is still a very bad film in almost every aspect, especially in editing. As some other observers have pointed out, it seems that all the pieces of the film are missing, while the other bits where the scenes are put in the wrong order. This is a really bad film that deserves much less than its rating 5.1. I give him 3 out of 10 and I'm very kind
