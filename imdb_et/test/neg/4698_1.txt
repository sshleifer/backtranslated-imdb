I liked Half-Life. I'm still the fan. It was scary, intelligent, and complicated. I'm not talking about news that is one of the best FPS ever made. Maybe I'm a bad Half-Life fan, but Half-Life 2 isn't Half-Life 2. <br /> <br /> And I have a question: is this the next chapter of Half-Life ? Maybe the creators think - guard, but I don't. Where are the Intelligent Enemies? Where is the scary atmosphere? Nowhere. I believe they wanted to do a little bit of Half-Life (instead of another research center story), but they just didn't make much of a difference, they did something about Half-Life, like Quake doing it. The whole game is so ugly and unreal that it's almost gone. <br /> <br /> Although physics is really great and there were some good levels to play, the idea of ​​making a revolutionary physics-based gameplay completely failed. If you get a Gravity-gun that can move objects, you can assume that you have the right to use it as a weapon that would reverse the schematic FPS gameplay. The truth is that Gravity-gun can't be used as a real weapon. Why? Because the best thing you can do is throwing boxes and barrels that don't do much damage. If you want to hold the object in front of you, it may fall to about 3 frames. If you want to throw an exploding barrel at your enemy, it may explode in your own hands. Gravity gun does not work as a weapon. The best use is solving some physical puzzles. I ask Valve: Why? The truth is that you must use your boring, schematic FPS weapons (except the last level). If Gravity-gun were always on the last level like a real weapon, I would admire what Valve did. But not that. This is disappointing. <br /> <br /> So if you want Half-Life, you're looking for the wrong place. Maybe you enjoy it, but I repeat: it's all, not Half-Life, and not even its faithful continuation. This is the biggest disappointment of all time. Valve has shown that they can also do terrible games. They have succeeded.
