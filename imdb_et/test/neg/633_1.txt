We all know that special effects cost money, but they seem to have used the money they saved when writing the script to get some better shots. The train is probably the model of the most moving images, the helicopter is obviously computer-generated, the alien looks at the end of Spaceball, except that it is ten years later and Spaceball had an excuse. <br /> <br /> Only the smart thing they did was blurry from all the special effects to make them more difficult to see. <br /> <br /> Even the actors could not compensate for such a poorly written script, and it is quite obvious that they didn't try either Please do not waste their time. Please.
