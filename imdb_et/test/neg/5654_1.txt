iCarly is all that is wrong in the world. All the main characters, but Carly's brother and Freddy, are morally bankrupt. <br /> <br /> Sam is hurting other people by whim. He breaks the baby's locker and is forced to pay $ 100 to fix it, and he says it is "tough luck" and moves forward to break Freddy's mobile phone. He only caused damage of at least $ 300 and is more focused on food. What the hell ?. The only time she has felt guilty, she's fun at Freddy's play. And that's the only reason why Carly is starving her. <br /> <br /> Carly is "I'm perfect, all I do is great." type of girl. All he does is for his own good, and he has often shown himself only with regret. Worse still, he encourages Sami's mess. Sam destroys some Freddy clothes? She laughs. Sam ruins kids classes? He shrinks it. Don't even start humor. Laughing is played at any moment. <br /> <br /> Sam: He's not that hot Carly: Yeah, he's Sam: Yeah, you're right * INSANE AMOUNT LAUGHTER * shows humor consisting of humiliating others and saying twilight words and occasional trivial things using similar sentences. .
