One Thursday evening at 22.00, my local West Coast ABC partner gave a "Northern Exposure" pilot episode. The ABC network usually encourages "Men In Trees" during this period, but the program was preferred for a live sports event. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that both exhibitions are set in Alaska and filmed in the Northwest Pacific (Exposure Washington State, Trees Vancouver, BC), again looking at "Northern Exposure" (as well as some "Sex and the City" episodes) reminds me of how disappointed I am with the poorly designed "Men in the Tree" hybrid. <br /> <br /> Anne Heche can be a good actor with the right material. Unfortunately, his role as a writer who reaches Alaska's small town is his nerves. Perhaps because I feel that Heche has failed, I am not convinced of his "water" character. <br /> <br /> I can't help but feel that a supportive casting is suitable for typical stereotypes of originality. Hot-looking local, kind bar owner, bush driver, local police officers, dusky but good-willed radio DJ, etc. <br /> <br /> The only stereotype that may have been broken was Abraham Benrubi, the actress of the teddy bear and veteran ER, as a local bartender who loves two different women. Considering that one of the executives is filmmaker James Mangold (his "Heavy" and "Cop Land" films were the leading men who were great men), I am not surprised why Benrubi had a non-typical role. Nevertheless, I can see why there are many dedicated viewers who love "men's trees". It fits a television audience with a unique niche. I wanted the show to find its voice instead of borrowing better exhibition ideas.
