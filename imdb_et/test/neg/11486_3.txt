there have been some films in the history of the cinema that cheat the viewer, such as "hockcock" staging, alejandro amen√°bari "abre los ojos", David fincher "game" and "ausentes" ("absent"). First of all, I don't like such a movie, I feel someone is trying to pull my leg. <br /> <br /> Moreover, after seeing this movie, you don't know what happened, such a crazy movie. Kubrick's "bright" may be a better or worse film, but it is certainly more honest than this embarrassing and dubious situation. <br /> <br /> Technically, good photography, fair power, and so on, but the script is so poor that I don't know what the manufacturers started to do with that mess. <br /> <br /> This film tells that 3 men who wrote the script (calparsoro, loriga and quiroga) are lost in the cinema trying to do a masterpiece - or trying to do something for their stomachs, waiting for more personal projects.
