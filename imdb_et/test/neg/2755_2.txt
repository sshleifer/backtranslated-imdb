This movie reminded me a lot of Dead Kennedys song "Straight A's". Unlike this movie, DK becomes a hero of suicide. You want that bozo to have used his own killing instead of killing himself. The whole thing was twisted and at first you understood compassion for the film's hero, then he quickly puts his compassion. The long sequences that show the hero's face when sending a monologue are quite scarce. Avoid this if possible.
