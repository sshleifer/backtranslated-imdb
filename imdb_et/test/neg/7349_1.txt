I looked at this example for a while, only for my cousins, and I hate it! First, girls dress in the same style and have the same first letter in their name. (Come on, I could do it better!) Then the crooks (equip me), first we have a monkey with some of its (little) brain, then we have a (gay) version of the devil, the pink mountain range, the gang green gang (which is ironic, it's their name) corrupted princess (again ironic, it's her name). I also found that there is no male hero at the show. (Not that I'm sexist or anything else ...) I'd look at Sailor Moon, it's much better. If someone else wants to look at the space you are, see how to find a TV. Believe me, it will save you half an hour of torture. <br /> <br /> Rating: I give it exactly what it deserves, 1/10.
