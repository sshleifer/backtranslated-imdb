If they had zero from 10, I would have entered it. Anyone who participates in this movie should be ashamed of making money publicly. I don't know how such movies are released on Video or Pay Channel. I am Vincent Gallos disappointed. Val Kilmer was there for about 8 minutes so I couldn't get it crazy. Only the person who denotes him. It's like Marlon Brando Superman. There is no graph except for Gallo searching and finding his friend in catacombs. Why they were looking for hell gates only director knew. They should keep this movie in Moscow and burn it to keep all the homeless additions warm for the night. There is nothing else to say about this movie that all other reviewers have written. I wish I could forget this movie, that it hurts my brain.
