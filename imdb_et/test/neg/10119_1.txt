First, I really don't understand how some people enjoyed this movie. This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Even the actors seem to be bored ... and I think it says it all! <br /> <br /> But I have to give my applause to the creators of the open credit - this team seems to be a very good future. That's why I recommend large studios ONLY to open credit and one or two special effects sequences (when viewed outside this movie, it looks almost like a good movie). <br /> <br /> Better luck (or judgment) next time for manufacturers, it's ... it's "a thing!".
