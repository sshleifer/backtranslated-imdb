If you think it's nice to be obsessed with who you love, then I can imagine that this is a good rating ... but I can't imagine that this obsessiveness theme and the lack of respect for others (like Paulie treats teachers who try to help him) is something you would like to teach your children. Yes, it is bad how Victoria treated Paulie, but I guess what. This is life. Isn't it even more important to learn how to overcome these frustrations and make the most of your life? Or a lesson from the roof to teach your children? Secondly, when Mary's father didn't show dinner, and Paulie helped Mary free her anger, Mary even said she wanted her dead ... Somehow I don't think it's a good message to deal with your frustrations anger through.
