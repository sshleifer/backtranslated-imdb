28 years before September 11, another 11th September was the most important date in Chile, South America and the world. It was the date in 1973 when the bloody coup in Chile gave Salvador Allend the first Marxist President, who was democratically elected worldwide, and ended his experiment on democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palaces. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film is too prone and too nostalgic for the time of the Allende rule, which is an objective shift in the history of man and his place. Times were worrying and Allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and the world. True, he was democratically elected, but his policy fell into the Chilean economic crisis. He triggered a coup and a right-wing dictatorship followed by repression and grave human rights abuses, but he was also an ally of Castro who saw another opportunity for revolution in his politics. We never know if his trial building a socialist but democratic society would have succeeded. The film's authors take the position of Allende completely, have no opinion or position to try to explain to the other side to answer questions like why the middle class was against him or how his democratic views could be supported or supported by Castro. The tone of the comments is nostalgic and apologetic, almost propagandist. People who want to better understand the episode of this history will have to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future.
