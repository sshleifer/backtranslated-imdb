Firstly, no one will take this example seriously to anyone with a law enforcement experience (rather than an ER or EMT). Walker found himself in the US with an illegal and completely unprofessional tactic from any US police force. In addition, he is a comic book - does not act on abilities, incredibly triting lines, no character. The fact that Alex Cahill loves her shows how dark blonde really is. And Trivett is the ultimate clown of black face. Come --- if you think Walker is a cordial show without bias, then explain why JT is considered a dolt, there is always the theme of Walker jokes, never one who solves the crime and never saves Walker who should be died 50 times for the stupid things he does. While it may be true that many criminals are even more uneven than the observers who watch them (and believe me, most of the cops are unpleasant as dirt), the smarts that Walker takes will never seem to feel that when Walker is caught, it must be put to him to misery. But then, Norris produced this exhibition and celebrated it, so how did he deliberately get rid of it or even show how stupid his tactic is. Like six men waiting to be taken one by one. What a terrible series! It's rather humiliating than any hokey western, such as Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, Cisco Kid and Wild Bill Hickock, though I imagine that most of you here are too young to remember these shows. But as they show, Walker TR is the same as they show offensive and just stupid.
