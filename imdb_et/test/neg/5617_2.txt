It's a late-night cable flick, usually associated with Andrew Stevens or Shannon Tweed. Unlike most Tweed and Stevens R & D vehicles, it is deadly boring! <br /> <br /> Cut the chase. The real reason for watching this non-thriller is Shannon Doherty's breasts. Anyone who claims otherwise is LIAR! But most of her steaming sex situations seem to be all the smoke and mirrors. <br /> <br /> Note that all of the shots at the same time with his head and chest flash quickly. Frames in which the camera responds to its naked body are little or no attachment, or are dripping behind a damp shower room. <br /> <br /> Everything you look at knows what it means - body double! <br /> <br /> However, I have to admit that the finish, where Doherty is tied with a knife, closed his eyes and threatened, gave a solid fetish excitement. <br /> <br /> If you find a copy of VHS anywhere, buy! Because everyone involved is probably too embarrassed to ever get out of the DVD!
