This demented left-wing sweep eliminates Dante's great work, distorts the author's gene from any recognition, adds hateful ideology, incompetent satire and moral political commentary to every conceivable place, and deserves a place in the eighth round, the tenth Bulgarian counterfeit. Sandow Birk has kept himself close to the place. <br /> <br /> Wake up with Hell Republican politicians, Fox News helicopters and Christian Conservatives. It is, however, irregular, annoying and tricky. Nothing about Birk's dignified and heretical examination is the least relevant to the original text or is somehow entertaining, humorous or enlightening, despite being outraged on the contrary. <br /> <br /> I could have eaten a videotape and a better PUKED movie. I am sorry for two hours of my life, which I lost to look at the concept of poetry. Calliope is crying forever.
