I've been sitting less painful than the time I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> If you try to think, it's something in Guy Ritchie's flick bed ..... Think again! Production, dialogue, acting, scripting, filmmaking and plot were about the worst I've seen in the movie. My fun part was honestly finished. In the history of cinema, there has never been a better excuse to turn off the TV and get out of your life and do something better. <br /> <br /> You must work your root canal, not waste your time and money!
