French films make Marxist films or anti-Marx films - there is little between them. "Merci pour le chocolat" is the last of this genre. From the credits that tell the viewer what kind of music is being played and by whom, who knew you were in the middle class claim. It's an old man's movie that has over 40 years of age plus people. It is also led by an old man with an old team who have nothing to say about the viewer's life. The plot is not just banal, but redundant. How many movies will the plot reveal through dialogue to repeat the same message in about five minutes? Maybe the director and the participants had a low retreat? In fact, they are not a permanent plot at all. It's a mystery with holes like good French cheese. <br /> <br /> Whether deliberate or not, this film is a breeze. At least one third of the film focuses on the piano and the pretentious twadle raised in each scene. I admit that it has some well-framed shots, even though they wouldn't have been able to use that movie - it would have attracted them all! Apart from being a meaningless story, the film allows the upper middle class parade to set its values ​​and vanity in a very convenient Swiss location. The film speaks when Rodolphe Pauly tells Anna Mougal to not lock her car at her resort! Oh dear to me. <br /> <br /> Miss Huppert makes a comment on the DVD about the wrong tear for the scene. Smirking says, "As they do in an American actress studio!" I think Miss Huppert and the rest could learn well from the learner in the studio. <br /> <br /> If there is one claim that seems to be in my eyes, it is when Huppert says, “we have friends over the weekend and all the servants are away. There is no doubt that they would all have remembered not being bound by such a horrible film. <br /> <br /> Safety Medical Note. The film shows a hot water plate covered with ointment and bandage. It should never be done. Only cold water should be used. <br /> <br /> Minus 10 characters.
