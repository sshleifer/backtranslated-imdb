(Synopsis) In 2055, the wealthy will be able to travel back in time and live a dinosaur at a great price. Sonia Rand (Catherine McCormack) has developed a machine that can take people back. Charles Hatton (Ben Kingsley) has taken this technology and opened a company known as Time Safari. Anyone with money can drive millions of years back and shoot the dinosaur. Dr Travis Ryer (Edward Burns) leads his team together with a big game hunter on a floating sidewalk where they can kill the dinosaur. The travel protocol is that they must stay on the walkway and not disturb the land or the creature around them. Unfortunately, one hunter comes to humanity and kills a butterfly. This insignificant act causes a significant impact on the Earth's climate and creates new animal species. The course of development, as we know, changes with the waves of time. Travis and Sonia try to stop the process of change before it becomes permanent and the person goes out. <br /> <br /> (Comment) The movie was a bit slow and the concept of going back in time and changing things was a bit overrun. The death of one butterfly, which causes huge changes in the world atmosphere and development, is simply ridiculous. They changed the Chicago silhouette to look modern, but the new cars of the future were stupid. You can wait to see this fantasy on DVD. (Warner Brothers Pictures, Duration 1:43, Rated PG-13) (4/10)
