If you think Hannah Montana or Suite Life is at the bottom of two sitcoms, you probably haven't watched iCarly. iCarly is undoubtedly the worst show I've ever seen. From inanimate small budgets, an exhibition that is inexpensive, like last week's Chinese competition, boils down to your overheated car. <br /> <br /> The show revolves around pretty, perky and "should be" a funny girl named Carly because she and her friends are making a living web called iCarlyks. Carly lives alone with her older brother, who needs serious advice or something because she is a little cell with no brain. <br /> <br /> The plot plots are very ridiculous and unbearably annoying. But looking at Carly and her friend Sami, whether their little iCarly-show-in-a-show is even worse. Basically, they show strange images and stay on their nose when the laughs play over and over again. I mean seriously, every two seconds, it seems that the laugh does not come for some reason. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of this review? you can ask. Just ridiculous iCarly? Well, yes, but I also warn you about this exhibition. Because seriously, when should I choose between iCarly and Barney viewing? No questions about this, I would choose Barney.
