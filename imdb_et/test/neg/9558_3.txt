My girlfriend wanted to see it (that's so much) ... so I rented it. Then I saw the commendable 10 Oscar. Great! it should be good ol drama. This film had a lot of potential ... the direction and the way everything was at a great pace. But when the movie ended, I couldn't ask myself if that story was really worth the movie. Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) was extremely annoying, I just couldn't tolerate her character at all. Warren Beatty was very good in the movie, but again I found that his character was hard to sympathize with .... he went essentially like an idiot, a gangster loser. How did he want Meyer Lansky and Lucky Luciano alike? just too casual and illogical. I think Siegel was really ... but that was too much. There just didn't seem to be a real story here. Playboy, getting down from the gangster, falls in love with the woman's loser, the idea of ​​"Las Vegas" comes out. his failed attempt at the casino he is building and the lack of money his mob bosses will kill him. "<br /> <br /> What else is there? I just didn't see this big thing and it was a big disappointment. 1.5 / 4 stars.
