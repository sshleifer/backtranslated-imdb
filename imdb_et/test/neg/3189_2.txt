One night at McCool wants you to think it's a hip and smart black comedy. It pushes its "peculiar" characters and "outrageous" situations to the viewer, like an overtime worker. A precondition is a gold digging woman, called Jewel, who drives men to steal and sometimes murder so she can have all the world positions she wants. You know, this wouldn't be a bad strategy if he traced the rich guys. This movie really wants to believe that the foxy con artist will destroy the time of the bartenders and Andrew Dice Clay. Please. This big mistake in the Jewel scheme is really the only entertainment that is found in this stinker (and it's involuntary). Looking at it, it is not hard to believe that there might have been a good movie there. One night McCool's just couldn't decide which direction he wanted to take, so you just sat in the middle of the road like dead armadillo. It's trying to be sexy, but no clothes are removed from the camera, and some body head scenes are terribly pedestrian. There is one repetitive scene where Hitman asks the protaganist (played by Matt Dillon) how sex is with Jewel. It seems that Matt doesn't know, nor the viewers. Why did he meet him? One night at Mccool's wants to be funny. Sorry, the odd coincidence and misunderstanding didn't even work for three companies. What's even worse is that this movie really seemed to accompany the comedy in a dark atmosphere. Similar to sophomoric coen brothers film, but its low script could not play the nuance, nor did it get the dirty dirction sledgehammer in any kind of shocks. What the audience has left is a film that seems to be busy trying to please everyone and simply lose their complaint.
