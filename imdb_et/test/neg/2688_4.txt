This movie is truly amazing, and over the years I've become the taste of Japanese Monster films and I am well aware that early examples of this genre may be bad. But it reaches a new low as it follows Johnny Sokko's (?) Adventures, a young boy who controls a giant robot, and his struggle against the evil Gargoyle Gang, who seems to have endless terrible giant monsters. at their disposal.
