There is no humor in this loss of film. Carrot Top plays a surfer guy inventor who consistently blows the money for his silver, useless inventions. Then he assists the old boy who is divided by the road, and voila, he has inherited a big company. And so on and in the past, envious relatives, humanization of the corporation, hostile takeovers, obligatory interest in love .. awaken ... let's say this movie is virtually unnoticeable. What Carrot Top has achieved is to convince me to show on my stage.
