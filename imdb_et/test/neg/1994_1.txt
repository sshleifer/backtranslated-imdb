I just saw a stinking old boiler on TV. Best looking at the very large Dr Jurdi jungle juice at hand, this exploiting cheesecake is fun bad. (Very thin) on the plus side was Raquel in his physical head, he looks good and you see him a fair bit, because he plays a go-go dancer; he had big legs, that's for sure. Los Angeles ca. '69, and in the small parts where better things went. Veteran thesp Ron Rifkin ("Brothers and Sisters") gives the toes a cover for early performances, such as "Sailor", "fagot junkie" barman, who rattles the Raquel rats. Perhaps you would also feel the protection of weapons and guards at the hit and the current scene - this is the very early appearance of Gordon Jump, who gave such a lovely performance "Soap" as a piece of Chelief Tinkler. The "Flareup" "plot", as it is, follows the words of an exotic dancer (Welch) in running his murderous former wife (Luke Askew). This turkey is a classic production line of Hollywood mud - color image script, pedestrian direction, hokey images, edits and effects, ultra-cheesy song music, plywood kits and performances that fit. > Cast is just as terrible as the scenario. Though Raquel is able to participate in the right car, this whistling old clunker is so bad that he doesn't really have the opportunity and audience. One of my favorite moments occurs when Raquel wakes up in the hospital, sees the Vegas policeman who continues his murderer ex, and asks, "How did you get here?" - to which he, of course, corresponds to "on the plane." Oh mankind ... And you can't take your eyes off a doctor (Michael Rougas) who has one that can be one of the worst walks in the bad sad long sad history. I don't think I'd ever seen someone standing in one place so badly before. <br /> <br /> Raquel's Love Of Interest Joe (James Stacy) captures a movie with a fixed look somewhere between puzzling and embarrassing. - And no wonder. This bomb puts almost every TV clich√© in the cast book, ranging from Raquel's remarkably terrible turn to horrific nightmare editing to riding a "romantic" horse along Leo Carillo Beach. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler warning ** - Almost the only interesting thing about the whole movie is that Raquel finally gets his back and amused the title with a cheerleader. Whoever actually served this stunt - he rises like a hot wave of Yorba Linda. But even this remarkable scene is threatened by the fact that one team is moving near the end. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny things about "Flareup" that are strange compelling; I was wondering if it could be one of the worst films I've ever done. The answer seemed surprising "Yes" ... until I saw the movie, "The Big Doll House" drilled by Roger Corman's "grandmothers", which takes Awful to a whole new level. I can heartily recommend these two shutters as a double bill. You laugh foolishly.
