Director Jeremiah Checheck, who brought us great budget remnants such as "The Avengers" and "Diabolique" remake, has directed the concept of Die Hard, made - which looks like - the budget of Blair's witch. <br /> <br /> Arab Terrorists Pass by California Nuclear Reactor. But - are you ready? - Terrorists are not Arabs; they are really satisfied with American soldiers who disguise as Arabs! We find that they are not going to really let the reactor air. We are not sure what the claim is, but never. So there is really no risk. But then one of the terrorists decides to go alone and the plant really breaks because he's such a crazy one. So there may be a risk. But the army is going and all the bad guys are killed. There was therefore no danger. Oh, and a good man is being killed. Let this be a lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> If all this sounds confusing and waste of time, then you get the idea of ​​what Meltdow is watching. <br /> <br /> The script will never interfere with the presentation of the characters or even any personal information that could be heard or emotionally involved. So we remain one-dimensional: an expert-this-no-one doesn't want to listen; trigger-happy-sergeant; - Scented politicians; -dweeby-Engineers. The story jumps from one cliché case to the next formula that contains virtually every movie you have seen. But almost every step, just when we think there may be something at stake, the script begins to shine and we find out that there is really nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> Like Die Hard, there's a police officer inside, for bad men. The big twist is that the policeman is here .... WOMAN! Oh and he's also injured. But not so bad, just enough to win a couple of times. Oh, instead of Bruce Willis having this policeman, this charms are a mobile phone that works everywhere ... even under the ground! If he does not shout to everyone else, Bruce Greenwood, his jaw made of granite, will try to relieve him of the spell. He even makes fun, but we are afraid that his face may be broken. After all, it's a serious business. <br /> <br /> But most of the time, this scene is after people claim: the military expert says he's waiting for it (his reasoning doesn't seem particularly sound, but he must be a smart guy in this film so okaaaay); The White House people are challenging him; the army sergeant also says to him; Nice Pakistani nuclear engineer meets the main terrorist. The dialogue is absolutely B Film all the way and the lines like "stop on the air! STOP THE BROADCAST !!!" you may be rolling on your couch if you don't know if the characters are referring to this stupidity. <br /> <br /> Perhaps to compensate for the lack of quality of production, camera work is kept nervously in this faux. Gram style, which should give the scene instant and energy, but the way it is purposefully and practically applied is completely annoying; even pretense. Additional attempts to rob the pace are made with a meaningless and monochrome frame that is randomly connected to the main action. But it is also abusive and annoying in this Blair Witch glove. In short, stylistic tests are very amateurish. <br /> <br /> Music lives visually - it's synthetic and cheap sound. Sounds like a porn movie, but less melody and much more heartbeat. Graphic processing is also bad bad: big graphics with red lettering scream at us "9:28", as if the timeline was actually some kind of difference. <br /> <br /> Meltdown can work as a marketing concept, but it is clear that the script was a different idea. FX - part of Fox - put this cheesy production together and dropped to several million dollars. Now what I call a blend!
