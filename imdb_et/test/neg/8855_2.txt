Tough drama? Emotionally Powerful? Blah! The BBC has lost a lot of time for masterful productions such as HBO, Sopranos and Carnivale. Okay, so the budget can be much smaller, but last night, the "street" was badly behaved, predictable, unrealistic, stereotypical, unknown, and a lot of fat. TV (British TV) is not as good as it used to be, and it drops even more behind American production. <br /> <br /> The "local gangster" was no brutal violence. There was no indication that this man was crazy enough to win the man he had been holding for so long. There was no regret when he did that, and it should not be the kind of character that would come down when Bob Hoskins called his son a pan, on the "bravery" screen. <br /> <br /> I wish it was more expressive to express my contempt for this exhibition, but I am not, and although I cannot prove my point well enough, believe me when I say it was a garbage to shock television which does not give a real view of life. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
