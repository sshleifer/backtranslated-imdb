Knowing Minnesota is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It is related to a woman who is forced to marry a nasty mobile. At the wedding he meets his brother Jia. After eating a cake, they eat at home sex when they decide to escape. The other brother, of course, follows the blazing of his arms and kills his wife. Jiaa wakes up to find her body in the bath and buries her. He doesn't seem to be Jyara's friends, and they're trying to make money because someone shakes them because he saw them and his body. Such links and multiple characters die or live back, but it never comes to something that could be called good plots. The performances are terribly many. Cameron Diaz, Keanu Reeves and Dan Akroyed. Direction, dialogue, and visual effects are just terrible. Nasty and terrible movie.
