I've read all of Shakespeare's plays, seen most of them productions and even acted and some. I don't necessarily think that Shakespeare should be done in "traditional" fashion, but I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> There is nudity that is free and unnecessary. There is a grotesque that is far beyond what I believe in Shakespeare. Some of the dialogue is incomprehensible and there are elements such as singing and dancing that do not give the film any meaning but replace Shakespeare's director with self-expression. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say I'm wasting a lot of money on buying this DVD movie.
