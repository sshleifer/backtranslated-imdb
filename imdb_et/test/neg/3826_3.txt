Tim Curry was the reason why I wanted to see this movie and, while of course, his appearance is always entertaining, he is basically wasted. The rest of the majority will not lose too well in the processing of this early zombie movie with extremely graphic effects that are completely unnecessary. There is sometimes less to quote a popular axiom.
