I'm still waiting for this dark muppet movie, where we don't know how it ends from the beginning. I think Linklater could have been tested with one of his animations. This time I was intelligently not waiting for such a thing, but deeply wishing. <br /> <br /> Joan Cusack is wonderful. He moved to the level of television that was lazy with a cynical claw. Muppets had more life than it was. Disappointment. <br /> <br /> But the whole movie was Pepe Bar. I loved her. He was the only one to ever laugh at me (as Goldbergh, when God made me warm and passionate). If we do not see dark cups as at least PG: 13, then one Pepe contradictory jokes and an animal metal-head, egg-nog-chuggin person. <br /> <br /> The worst Muppets I saw that even a dull Christmas song would hit it. Muppets should avoid this on a commercialized vacation. <br /> <br /> 5/10
