The first season was good - good work and brother and friends at home. it was actually a pretty funny show. <br /> <br /> Now it is coming up again and the brother and two hot chicks are gone - and the whole thing revolves around the airline. Even the old man, who runs the company, has gone downhill - also over the top spot where it was perfect before. <br /> <br /> This and more Sarah Mason - one of the best looking girls in Hollywood. /> <br /> This happens when you let some commands show your hand. You can almost see the meeting "The old man is funny, lets focus on him, make him up and do everything about the airline ... this is the office version of the office!" Anyway, no hot chicks, no clock.
