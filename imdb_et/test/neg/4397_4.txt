This movie can best be described as a very long episode of a very sitcom. How much vaguely humorous misunderstandings can you bring in just one movie? Comments are wrongly placed, bags are exchanged, conversations are bad, people are confused, situations are misinterpreted and somewhere along the line people should laugh. Writers are really in trouble to keep everything going, so the dialogues really feel forced. If someone in this movie acted like a real person, it would all be resolved in about two minutes, and everyone could go back to their lives, but they must keep the misunderstandings. Sometimes this movie tries to laugh at the juveniles, but all of them remember you when the funny "American Pie" was. The style in which crying tells the whore (who thinks he is a foreign student) to "eat his sausage" goes forever, not one second of it is funny. However, I have to give this movie: because of the stolen money sub-block it's not as boring as it could have been. It is also ridiculous here and there, but then, unfortunately, another character goes back to misunderstanding. In general, this film is too flat.
