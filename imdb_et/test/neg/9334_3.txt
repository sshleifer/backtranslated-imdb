Unfortunately, this film and several other films from the 1950s with religious uprising, such as Robe, Quo Vadis, Samson and Delilah, depict all pagans or someone who is not a Jew or a Christian if they are morally lost and decadent. The focus is only on biblical stories that ignore the world beyond the Bible. As far as they are concerned, nothing good came from pagan Egypt, Greece, or Rome. <br /> <br /> Every film that proclaims "one true God" gives a short transition to religious freedom. The films ignore the fact that the absence of ancient Jewish freedom of religion made it a fruitful basis for religious extremism. Most of the 1950's religious films also neglect the loss of freedom that ensued after the political power of Christians in the 4th century.
