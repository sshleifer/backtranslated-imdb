I bought this DVD as part of 50 historic classics. It's hardly a classic, and since the plot was refreshed by the time it was released, it's not historic either. The actual title of the DVD is "Man" and titled "Becky Sharp's Private Life". Myrna Loy is not very convincing, although in her defense she is terribly scripted and tricked. As with many early-talking and especially smaller studio centers, the participant and the team have little skills. Loy wears a couple of dresses that are pretty stylish, but the later scenes have their own costumes and make-up. One sustainable grace is Billy Bevan, who plays one of his many fumes
