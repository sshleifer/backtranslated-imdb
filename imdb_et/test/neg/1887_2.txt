I watched this movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was terrible. Now that I'm older, I found it just as terrible. Universal could have done better. They just decided to make the most money so they could use their monsters at once. For me it was a cheap flight. These characters were able to hold their films and the actors' choice was unfortunate. Dracula was supposed to be Bela Lugos, the monster of Frankenstein who was supposed to be Karloff. Umiversal started something big and original, and thought they could hit the masses with an extremely obvious script.
