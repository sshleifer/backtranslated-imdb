On the eve of the opening of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, I was quite excited to see historical and non-traditional films. The guest speaker who opened this film created a leap of uncertainty and an underestimation of this film. The sci-fi part of the movie was very interesting and fantastic for my time, but I'm not sure if this was due to the fact that it appeared immediately after Brilliant 1928 "Wind" or when it seemed that Russian filmmakers would take after Russian novels are famous (hundreds of characters, tangled plots), but I know for sure that dramatic parts, like parts of the earth, had no sense, were boring, and I lost about twenty minutes. Maybe it was an act, but I was convinced why this film was "unknown and undervalued": it is boring, there is no plot or basic story, and action is terrible. This is certainly not a "battleship Potemkin", but I say that Russian films do not really make good efforts to make Russia's life similar.
