I was actually waiting for this movie. The ads made it really cool and packaged for action. And I heard that Claire Daines' character was arrested for the attack, so I thought maybe she would hit a lot of ass and it would be cool. WHEN NOOOOOOOO !! Their hardly had any action at all and the character was all kind. The only sustainable arm was Omar Epps, and even he didn't help much about this movie.
