Are you kidding? This is probably the worst, amateur movie I've ever seen. The casting was terrible, the behavior was worse than the terrible, and I'm sorry, the guy on the picnic at the speed of loading his plate full of food was somehow pointless and the demonic comb and the chamber pot around Drew was nothing but comic. When I was a herd witch, I wanted to believe. I read the literature about it and thought it sounded like a credible story. But this movie destroyed it. Ric White (Director, Writer, Lead Actor, etc.) takes himself a bit too seriously and I think he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves .... Make it a favor .... miss it.
