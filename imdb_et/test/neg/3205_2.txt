It's a disgrace to the name of all the lovable and ridiculous Critters saga. Why do writers feel the need to make the film intolerable for viewing all quality standards. Critters are cute and divine than ever, but deadly behavior has become a killer for a child. They are not as terrifying, terrible, some as funny and funny as they were depicted before the movies. I loved my porcupine shots, but now it's hidden as if it was probably repetitive and boring. And what about killing and not eating. I thought this movie would have been cool, but it was all wrong. Why Ug had to be evil and killed what is known as Charlie. This movie is sick of me. Shame! Shame! DISGRAAAAAAACE !!!!
