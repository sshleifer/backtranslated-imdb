If there are no dead heroes, you get such stupid lines, because this shamefully exhausting action must be seen in faith. His friend Harry Cotter records William Sanders during Vietnamese mining, but gets into the enemy's hands. Moving forward for ten years, Harry is now a brainwashed Russian with a microchip that can be implanted in his brain. His new Russian boss is Ivan, who played Nick Nicholson's nervous hat, who might add that not only is he trying to talk at once with a Russian accent, but more like his refilled teeth in Kentucky. It is even more absurd that he was also a dialogue box for this movie. Soon, Harry will come back to work with CIA CAM. He is with Barbara, a freedom fighter who has invaded the Ivan El Salvador camp and soon both will blow south of South America. Some scenes are terribly horrible in the jaws, so it's a wonder why this film no longer has a cult. One such scene is the sudden love of William and Barbara in the jungle, accompanied by the most inappropriate common background music I've ever heard. Who would be totally naked in the middle of the South American jungle? There is also a rape scene that also uses blood for the end of Satan's claw. No dead hero is always a magical master of a lottery game, because one shot brings several kills. In one scene, Harry prints his gun behind a stone and kills seven men. I had to go back and count it. It's hard to find a movie that has recently received full HD treatment from MGM. Watch this movie and see if there is thin stupidity.
