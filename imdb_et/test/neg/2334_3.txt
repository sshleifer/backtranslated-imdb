How long do we have to stay with this mistake of belief that if the director does a great, groundbreaking job, not all future work can be "as bad as he is and such". <Br>> <br /> Mulholland Drive is a case, and it's actually empty garbage. The performances are great, especially Watts and Theroux, but a good movie they may not be doing. What Lynch has clearly forgotten is that just making a movie unnecessarily complicated only when it surprises the audience. If the audience expects the film not to make sense, the film must have some substance that keeps the audience interested. Lynch succeeds in the first half of the movie, the murder mystery has been created with many twists and red herons, and then ... plopp! The story is divided into bizarre hallucinations and meaningless segments. Methinks Lynch realized how the film was confusing and threw lesbian and mastobat scenes into the audience awake and stop the men from watching and leaving. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie in preview, I was surrounded by Lynchophiles, who had no idea what was happening, but left the theater commenting on the "layers and layers" of Lynch's filmmaking. Excuse me, but these people are the same nitwits who stand in art galleries looking at canvas painted white, commenting on "the artist's courage to paint such bold work". <br /> <br /> Such films have been made because (a) Lynch trades with his previous job; and (b) because people convince themselves that an incomprehensible film is art, and therefore it must be good. I asked several Lynchophs about what they liked in the movie, and the only answer I received, which was not a broad "layered" response, was that they liked "chicks got their kit out". > <br /> Nuff said.
