I'm not breaking my surprise by mentioning some outrageous plot line, I just say that this movie suffers from bad animation, over actors, obvious tag lines? these are some of its good qualities. If you're an abandoned island and the only connection to the civilization you have, this movie will throw the fish. I can't tell you how much I regret that I saw this terrible strange movie. Speaking of this film, the horror film probably cannot be categorized as the only horror of the film is the play ability of some participants. <br /> <br /> Take care.
