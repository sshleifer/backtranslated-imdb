This film has a pretty decent FX sequence in the 1936 earthquake. The reason you haven't seen it is because the audience of the 30s was in love with "Jeanette MacDonald's picture;" where the asterisk marked its countless stories, while the plots stood completely. FX crosses the time very well. There are no MacDonald songs, and the uncomfortable addition of these songs to show his unique talent is not good. <br /> <br /> Two friends who grow up as priests and hoods can go to another machine (Manhattan Melodrama, The Departed). You've already heard the song "San Francisco" three times at the 30-minute mark. Thirty years of entertainment is usually the accumulation of irritation. Only the Grand Hotel from the decade will give up the anxiety in San Francisco, dinner 8, Little Caesar, Stagecoach, the West Coast of All Quiet, Les Miserables and so on.
