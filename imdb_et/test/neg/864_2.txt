This film was made by the largest producer in Costa Rica. Though their authors encourage it as the greatest film ever made in Costa Rica, and their actors dare even say that they did not get the Oscar nomination because of its political importance in oil (- right, right) ... Well that's all wrong. This film was allegedly based on a book on love triangle written by Carlos Salazar Herrera (the soap opera-like theme of super-clicks), and the secondary story is the oil problem on the Costa Rica Atlantic coast with an American oil company wishing to explore the region's oil reserves, but has never been approved by the government. Now you can have nice shots on the beach, but that's the way it is; something bigger than this ... it's all in the camera. Most of the participants are bad except two or three. The lack of the rest of the mindset means that they mostly act. The story is quite ordinary and a clich√© that is worth the cheap Mexican soap opera, as I said ... because the team advertised it as a protest of the oil, but 80% of the film is based on a foolish triangle of love. The script is not impressive, it is very simple and dialogues are not very thoughtful. It has also changed with some editing issues, but it is also quite decent. The director did a good job, I think he's not like Oliver Stone, but he did his job with the hands. I would like to ask him why he spent most of the money abroad instead of Costarican actor. I mean, after all, they were 100% of Costarican Production ... that's what you expect at least. The end result is not well done, there are errors and details that are not suitable or useless. In addition to being the most expensive film in all of Costarican's history, I find it mediocre. You can make less interesting and better pictures with less money. Never heard of Pi? Anyway, if you're curious about movies from Costa Rica or Central America, that's it, but you're definitely missing something.
