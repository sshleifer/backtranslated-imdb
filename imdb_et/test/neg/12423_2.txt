Heldeke! Heldeke! Oh dear! <br /> <br /> To guess that such films have been made and apparently used thousands of vehicles, it really attracts your mind. When we were innocent these days. <br /> <br /> This movie is clear. The hero is so moist that you can hear your terrible wet traces in every scene. My Lord, but he is just one of the most terrible, terrible actors who appear in this turkey. No wonder MST3K chose it. Such a story, as it is, focuses on stock drivers (who are so incompetent, you really think it's a car driver) that he gives up and "gets in the wrong crowd" Oooooh! Scary stuff. But the wrong crowd turns out to be three stooges and their "hand-to-me" slip from the biker chick. As an example of how all this is clever, the writers obviously wrote their brains to become a terrifying name for the biker's gang - when four people can be called prosperous, that is. The result? Gang is called the angels of Satan! I'm not your boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This terrible action and dialogue, along with ridiculous scenes, make for an excellent beer and chip movie. But otherwise it's the worst waste. <br /> <br /> As I said. One time it could be considered good. But today it just makes a laugh (and shines) every minute. Avoid this, except for good laughing. And make sure you are over half drunk!
