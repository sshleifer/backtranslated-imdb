My Take: Steven Seagal is obviously too boring to be the leader in the thriller, even completely bored. Remember Steven Seaga? You are not? Don't worry, there's not much to catch up with. After a pleasant crowd of pleasant films, such as UNES SIEGE and EXECUTIVE DECISION, has been seen in Seagly, Seagal hits the abyss of a bad movie. Now, he has low budget B-level cars, some of which have been made for TV's "Weekly Movie", which has lost a great deal. HALF PAST DEAD is among those who say we are dead action films. A loud and weak action film that has been sluggishly managed and lazy to write (and worse, badly acted). This is one of those bad movies that I don't have to look at before the end to find out it's bad. I didn't have the courage to kill all my brains if I wasted time with it. This is a bad movie in which you realize that the other movies you hate are not at all bad. <br /> <br /> Plot (and locale) is completely canceled from a similar picture, Michael Bay THE ROCK, although it may not be similar to a word. Both movies are summer movies and are not meant to be so serious. For comparison, even ROCK (which is not as much as lights and sounds in the writing department) has better signs, more weighty lines, better sequences, and more generally a more fun atmosphere. Although there are activities in HALF PAST DEAD, none of them are exciting. All of these are sometimes annoying and predictable. <br /> <br /> While predictability seemed to be a welcome asset in the summer movies, predictability never tasted more than fun, and HALF PAST DEAD is never really fun, many times it's just a headache (bad rap music) repeating the entire movie over and over makes me every second against aspirin). The actor is terribly mediocre, the plot is derived, without any compelling or tempting characters. The Seagale character, a secret agent sent to Alcatraz to stop the criminal master (Morris Chestnut), a very boring villain, is not excited. The Seagallian character is also provided with a sidekick (played by rap star and Rule) and a number of amigo prisoners and no chemistry. <br /> <br /> When several other forgotten vehicles (what were these films again), due to Seagale's good career, HALF PAST DEAD was killed. And the viewers are warned: you are called to feel the pain. Tip: Avoid it at all costs. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 5.
