This film is a clear deprivation of Underworld USA by Cliff Robertson. You forged yourself a few hours to invest and look at the original. I found it inseparable and difficult to follow, with lots of scenes that didn't make much sense. I am not opposed to violence against films, but all this seemed to be just a pretext for attacking one person after another, many of whom were only slightly involved. When all the others killed, I thought through the film why Frank wasn't bothering Johnny's brain. He would certainly have been and Johnny was sure he didn't act like someone he could trust. Another thing that bothers me is sex scenes; why do these people have sex with their clothes? Should it turn us on? Certainly, they didn't think they'd have a PG rating. Nothing in this film seemed to play naturally. as if looking at people in real life, instead of doing it hard and low.
