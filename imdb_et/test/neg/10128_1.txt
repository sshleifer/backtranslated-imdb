If you were wondering if Disney could deliver an exhibition of more character than Paris, more than Britney, more evaporated than Jessica and more narcissistic than GIRLS NEXT DOOR, no longer knows. The amazing thing is Selena Gomez, probably there should be a heroine. He should also be spoiled, low, vaporized, narcissistic "popular" girls at school that are no longer believable here than Hilary Duff LIZZIE McGUIRE. The plots range from recycled BEWITCHED & I DREAM OF JEANNIE to HARRY POTTER parodies. An older boy alternates as a magical genius and is unable to manage the complexity of his shoelaces. The younger boy is just one of the smart "wisecracking" brats who have been reproduced on television in New York (and with the same appeal) as cockroaches. Dad is a stereotypical stupid TV father and mother ... well, he's not totally terrible. But all at the show of ridiculous, reluctant and terribly interesting (like a bad car accident) show off Mrs. Lopez's insidious, self-satisfied, brilliant performances. And again he is HEROINE.
