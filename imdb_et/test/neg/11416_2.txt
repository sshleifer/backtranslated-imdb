"Quit If Before You" is a phrase they never learn. A typical Hollywood scenario: when the first film was just shocking, the other wasn't, wait for the third to be the worst thing that hit the screen this year. Even worse is prequels whose events have already been explained in detail. If you haven't seen the first two movies, it's not like you. It's like starting to watch the Lord of the rings or Star Wars with the last trilogy movie. So this movie is not independent. Remember the first movie about Lucian's revenge? Remember another long lost savage brother? Well, when you saw these two 5 minute moments and stuck them together, can you? 5 min prequel. But the creators of the ether thought that these 5 mins were vital historical events or just wanted to give a job to a participant, a cast and a team, and maybe also make money in this process. "I have a loot of money, I make movies for life and I'm bored. What am I doing? I know! I'm making a movie." So you get this 5-minute prequel and stretch it for 90 minutes? this is the movie. And you know what happens to the main "immortal" characters, so there is little tension. By the way, all the drama in the movie is 5 min. The only thing that made my eyebrows rise was the mother's killing in the movie. Sick. The rest was a Braveheart remix. If you want comedy, first see Braveheart, this movie. the film put me in the mood. Who invented the term "vampire vs werewolf" first? It's older than me and I got old as fast. And why do vampires look like Goth girls, while werewolves look like psycho bears? Hiding bad movies behind splitting cannot succeed. Isn't it time that we got somewhat thin poor with upright position? How can their unchanging werewolves even rise when they cut all the crumbs? And why did all of your powers vampires not lead the world? Blaa, blaa, blaa ?? What waste.
