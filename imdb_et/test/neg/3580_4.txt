'Xmas is the only movie I've seen where I can almost say that nothing happens. I felt like I was looking at a middle-class drug-dealing couple, with a baby, moving around, eating, smoking, chatting (sorry) myself, swearing through most of the movie. And I don't think I'm missing the point. I think this movie was well-targeted, well-functioning (though his wife's performance was quite woody) and the constant understanding of the impending punishment around every corner was definitely involved. But when the dust is discharged, the left is zero (only the ship's load from dropping). I didn't want car rides, gun violence, beating, etc. m bad violence. But my goodness, let us be at least somewhat deeper in all these characters (let's get to know all these corrupt officials a little better, not just show them blaming as street criminals). Why was the dialogue so minor? Everyone spoke as if they were in juniors. I believe that even this side of our human group can say something other than fu__, sh__ etc. 'R Xmas' was quite interesting, but filling was normal and simple
