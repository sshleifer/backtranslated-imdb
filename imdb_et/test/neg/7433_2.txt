I've always liked Bill Murray's films, like Lost in Translation, and the trailer of this movie seemed really good, but the result was very disappointing. Basically, Murray plays Jack Corcorini, who recently found out that his father died, and he should hear his will. He discovers that his father was a clown because he left the big shoe, his nose and his main legacy, the elephant! The only way Jack can get rid of this elephant is to travel 4,000 miles in four days and give him a safe zoo for $ 30,000. Pat Hingle also plays as Vernon. There are small, small humor, such as the front of the truck bending forward and Murray screaming, but in general it is pointless. Pretty bad!
