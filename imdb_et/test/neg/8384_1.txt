It looks like I can't find anything that would be good for this ministry. Why would you ban hell if u could ban something much more practical, like smoking or alcohol? It is also a foolish fact that his Australian program and all of England's and everyone's british accents are fake. In general, I think this exhibition is unrealistic and inexpensive.
