The icon of the Hammy cult, Conrad Radzoff (Ferdy Mayne), is dying of heart disease (not before the destruction of ungrateful assistants and telecommand directors, both of whom were not ashamed of insults). His body is removed from his mausoleum by a film student (they want to invite him to dinner). They are quite big fans. What these children (including the young Jeffrey Combs) do not expect is that Radzoff has risen to an average to destroy those who removed him from the resting place. <br /> <br /> Violent acts include Radzoff, who pulls a boy's tongue out by placing a wife on the fire, lifting the woman's face into a crushing cage, canceling one man and cremating another coffin alive. Radzoff's haunting activities surround a truly strange soundtrack and irritating fog. <br /> <br /> Troma's quiet hockey is limited to very low budget and slow. The film looks much longer than it is. The film is not really that big and we hardly see much violence because the film is often in the dark. Sometimes Radzoff is a malicious presence, but at other times he just looks really stupid.
