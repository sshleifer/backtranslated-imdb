The transfer of "Noah's Gulf" has given Hallmark (and Turner) a reputation about 100 years ago. However, there is a bright side in production ... faculty filmmakers "how not to make a movie" <br /> <br /> When there are quotes and situations in Bible literature and common sense magazines: <br /> <br /> "Ok, boys, let's saddle up. " "It's too bad that God created the sun only during the day we really needed it at night." "We're not kissing ... we whisper each other in the mouth." <br /> <br /> Wood built with "Georgia Pacific" is attached to it. Metal nails. Children are flying kites. Football player (how can James Coburn sleep after that) by selling Chinese hats. The pirates attacking the wooden Ark they wanted to capture fired a fire that shot the catapults. Glass bottles of wine (Noah was in constant librium. It was a miracle she saw that Ark couldn't build it). still prized G) Attacking biblical pirates with iron (teflon coated?). Landing on Mount Ararat after passing through Hercules. <br /> <br /> etc, etc. <br /> <br /> Special Effects ... You must see them not to believe them. <br /> <br /> The list goes on. This movie must not be missed; but if you want a full TV version, you need to call NBC for the screen version ... but only if you agree to release NBC from all responsibility for having the thing first. There is only an excerpt from the video shops (pirates, etc.), ie the video shops that dare to stock up. <br /> <br /> Marvin Cohn <br /> <br />
