So many people loved this movie, but there are some of us IMDb reviewers who found the Mirrormask amazingly uncomfortable and ass-clenchingly boring. I'm going to the last of these two camps, and I'm trying to figure out what made my toenails so unpleasantly hard. <br /> <br /> First of all, to set the record straight - I like Neil Gaiman's books. Sometimes I find that his knowledge, sarcastic, nervous humor is a bit geeky, and I actually prefer his work when he plays it directly and leaves jokes alone - but even his occasional disappearance into the "father" gag, I find my creativity and imagination to be something special. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, one of Gaiman's strongest works is the Coralini gothic fairy story for kids who have very little fun and high tension and embarrassment. His latest novels (Anansi Boys) surprised funnies and tend to read sometimes, as Terry Pratchett makes nurses (not nuns, but band). The Mirror Mask resides in a similar territory with Coralinn and when I saw the trailer's visual vision, I got a little excited that someone had been able to translate Gaiman's remarkable vision and imagination. <br /> <br /> Film, some sequences see stunning. However, visual effects are occasionally destroyed by CGI animation, which looks like a student of Media Studies. The backgrounds and landscapes are often staggering, but some characters seem clumsy, amateurs and cheap. In the early dreams, the spider is animated nicely, but the kitten who eats the book looks poorly rendered and very "computerized". Compared to the animation found in products such as "The Corpse Bride", Mirrormask occasionally sees himself as an amateur. But in Mirrormask's defense, the budget was small for such a great vision, and some effects can be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> What can't be forgiven is a stylish, static, harsh and dignified dialogue. Participants are struggling with the dialogue desperately - and there is so much that they are constantly being blocked and stumbled. The conversation has become completely unnatural, the jokes are falling over and over again, and the spoiled calls seem to be the only method of exposure of the writer. Together with the participants working on the blue screen (which always adds the Phantom Menace element) - it makes the film almost invisible. In such an unrealistic environment, the actors have to work twice as hard to believe, and basically they are not terrible. A daughter who plays a leading role makes a strenuous struggle against an impossible school education dialogue and sometimes shows a real promise, but it is never enough. The Divine-Dreaded Cod "Oirish" of Valentine's Character (with whom he is forced to spend an unreasonable time on the screen) makes this young actress's material rise. Valentine's task seems to be to explain the plot to younger viewers and add some light. Personally, I don't want her anywhere near my 15-year-old daughter. <br /> <br /> What else is this movie wrong with? Answer .... Rob Brydon. What is annoying (for us Britons), do we know that Rob Brydon can act! We've seen that he keeps the screen for half an hour (by making them "Marion & Geoff" monologues) and in the first "real world" a little movie he's good. But paste it in front of the blue screen and lose any character and become the worst am-drama ham I've seen for years. Real shame. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong? The answer ... wanky blow-bassing, sub-courtney pine saxing and unlistenable, too-high-in-the-mix soundtrack that never turns off. God, music is incessant, loud, distracting, irrelevant, and if that's not enough, then wanky bass wanking everywhere. This makes the dialogue very difficult to hear, but it can be a hidden blessing. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong? Answer .... whistling mime artist. In modern society, there should be no place for mime, except for certain secret places in France. At any moment, when the camera starts to burn, whistle, lick, and knit a yoke of idiot, I understand why the local people in Edinburgh are a little worried and anxious when the festival's time comes again. <br /> <br /> My last criticism is that the movie is quite boring. Surrealism is often boring? it requires either its audience's dreams, Zen, the host country or the audience to be constantly overwhelmed by bigger and bigger surprises. A story containing a little bit of pace that could believe and care would have given this film the emotional center it was sadly missing while the eyelids stopped. <br /> <br /> Finally, we apologize to all those who found the depth, meaning and wonders of this film. You have managed to stop your disbelief, you have seen the passing of the CGI, ignored the dirty dialogue and abysmal performances that were the result, and understood the artist's excellent imagination. I wanted, but I did not see the shortcomings of the real world that dragged it. <br /> <br /> I hope Neil Gaiman will get it next time he gets (or wants) the opportunity.
