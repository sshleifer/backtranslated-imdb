This TVM seems to be a polarized opinion among the commentators on this page, so I can solve everything by saying it is a very stupid, not very well-made television film. How bad is it? This is a teleplay that can't even decide what his name is, because although all in America call it LINDA, it's known in the UK as LUST FOR MURDER and it's usually a bad sign if a movie needs to change its name. And can I also note that this is not the language of hell, as someone else says I am honest and say the plot is pretty sound. Linda and Paul Cowley meet another couple, called Jeffries, with whom they get well. They get so good that they go on vacation (do their mind when a woman's changing) and Paul sees her wife Jeffie kill. After that, the plot hits a twist <br /> <br /> Writing the paragraph above has suddenly realized how great the potential that the story was, and I'm not saying something that would put you away. It's just that if the story continues after the events I've described, things become more unlikely and weird. Not only that, but the product values ​​are rather unprofessional when the actor plays Paul Cowley, who is annoyed by this very woody voice, while most scenes - outer and interior - look like they're filmed on a foggy day
