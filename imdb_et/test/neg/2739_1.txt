Normal terrible movie ... I won't make you a summary, but I'll put The Core, Armageddon, an evil planner military officer and one or two Solve-All Nukes and you have a movie when I call it that way. Seriously, in such films the kernels are more useful than the Swiss Army knives: <br /> <br /> the big one approaching? Nuke some places and it is over ... Tornado wants to destroy "Enter here an important city name"? Nuke "Enter another important city here ..." Vulkan crushes? Nuke it! Nuke is near to go? Nuke it! Coffee is cold? Nuke it! You Didn't Like Transformers? Nuke himself, but I can't confirm it ... <br /> <br /> Finally, how many other such movies can be done before they copy each other? I doubt the doll ...
