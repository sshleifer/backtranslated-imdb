Have you ever thought like watching a horror movie with a group of friends: "Wow, it's so cool! We'll have to hit a horror movie a few days. I'll bet it's not as hard as it seems"? Well, it was supposed to be what went through the minds of young Campbell brothers in 2003, probably right after he looked at Sam Raim's "The Evil Dead" or similar independent horror classics. However, this "Demon Summer" is so bad that it is embarrassing! These young amateur filmmakers obviously worship the horror and know their classics, but almost do not make them talented. I've seen quite a lot of terrible B movies over the years as a fan of fear, but it's honestly one of the greatest horses ever made. And it is quite sad to have it with an open heart because the whole cast and the team had clearly good intentions. The script is not very much. Hell duo just steals a mysterious book, and reading some of it, one of them mutates into a terrifying demon that will kill members of all teenage groups: dorks, hot Catholic girls, stoners, and worries. This is the case, of course, with all the mandatory clich√©s, such as a hot girl who falls for the biggest dork, etc. Performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teenagers use mimicry! They just stand there immobile until the script says their turn is to communicate. I hate it! Some make-up effects are far from perfect, but still remarkable and the soundtrack contains some of the most terrible punk songs. This movie should never be released ... I can very well imagine that it has to be a fun part of production, but it is completely imbecile and does not contain the least redeeming element. Not even a little amateur nudity, damn!
