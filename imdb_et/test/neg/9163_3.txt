When I finally saw this movie lately, it turned out that it was exactly the same ... at first glance for me ... another Hollywood CG / live-action rehash movie franchise. Nothing special or memorable. Designed to make it possible to turn to very young children and very immature adults using great comics such as farts, poo-eating, and Theodore's butt. <br /> <br /> This film is a lot less disturbing to me than it would be so obvious to Chipmunks. Even their characters, which I found, were made worse for this movie. Although in the past they all had a very special personality, they all behaved like immature, smart-alecky children with ADD, bouncing constantly on the walls. It bothered me especially to see how Simon is depicted in this way ... He should be a smart, serious nerd who acts as a "straight man" against Alvin's mad frosts. But here he's pretty much Alvin's carbon copy. One joke in the movie even means that Simon only * thinks he's smart, but actually ... and honestly, if I hadn't heard of Chipmunks before that movie, I would agree. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is another obvious cash flow, and I'm more than a little sorry to have done it. The fact that this is a "child" movie does not relieve its mistakes ... To apologize for the stupid movie that breaks down the classic franchise just because it is offensive to children, and every child deserves something more intelligent than this film.
