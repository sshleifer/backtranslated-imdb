I think it would have been at least two parts initially, and thus at least a quarter longer, because otherwise you could explain your confusion, the shortened story. I was never completely lost, but I was often partially lost and usually the motivation of the character is not clear. The film seems to have dotted points to push it into its time slot. <br /> <br /> If it were longer, it might be more meaningful, but it would still not be good. The most interesting idea of ​​the film is the war between Zeus and Hera as a war between a man and a woman, but the film falls on it, making Hera's followers rather terrible, but it is not clear what Zeus's followers do or believe. The film is also interesting because you do not see the gods and there is no real certainty that they exist. So it has a couple of intriguing ideas, but it doesn't make them useful. <br /> <br /> Bad dialogue, carton characters, and one interesting scene where Hercules and his three antagonist sons participate. Not traceable, but not worth it.
