I've seen many horrors, splashes, monsters in my life. And, of course, a lot of monster films in the 50s and 60s. When I stumbled for the first time, I thought it would come from the 60s until I feel it has been since 2007. <br /> <br /> Jack Brook's character is interesting and everything works first for a pretty devastating movie, but ... I was expecting a cracking film and not a dramatic story about an aggressive plummer. The film runs for 80 minutes and I think the first killing is after 65 minutes. Although it takes hours to explain the story, the reason for the monsters is at least 3 minutes ... we still have 20 minutes of boring dialogue and finally, in my opinion, not the well-managed splatter order. Although we have Robert Englund here, I only recommend it to really hardcore horror fans.
