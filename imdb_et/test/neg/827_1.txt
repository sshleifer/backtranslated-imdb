I have no idea why I looked at Ali G Indahouse, except that Salon seemed to think that the crime was committed when he did not name Sacha Baron Cohen for Emmy's work with the Da Ali G Show. It is a definite contribution that I will never see this example because there was nothing funny in the movie. Comedy? Torture was more similar. It was an almost stupid thing I looked at each time. I admit that Rhona Mitra was conquered by me. I hadn't seen him. He wasn't in the habit when I looked, so I think I have to look at Boston Legal one of those evenings to see how he's doing something that might be worth watching.
