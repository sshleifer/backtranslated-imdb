A low budget can be a pretext for talent for bad behavior and miserable forgery. But this is not an excuse for poor writing. It is a talent to be able to write a dialogue without being forced and mechanical. The dialogue with this film was parallel to most of the videos taught to fast food workers. <br /> <br /> I also understand that there are some exceptions to making talents if you only have 20 bucks to spend. That said, no serious director would have watched these scenes and said to himself: "It was perfect." I see a better character to act on Canadian television. <br /> <br /> This movie was a green paper, a bad example, a bad dialogue and no intelligent ideas at all. It just proves to me that some independent films are so for this reason. If you are looking for fast intimidation, rent something else. Even "Cable Clock" was less for movies. After watching this movie, I would have thought it would be better to look at restarting X files.
