The target is the story of a special agent who, after fulfilling the orders of the Turkish "Terrorists" (note that this is one of the "movies for men who love meaningless national super-patriotic crap films"), returns home to find his former wife and two The child is taken hostage. Charlie Snow has only a few hours to do what the terrorists say to get them back. And if it hadn't been someone I know actually (and probably mistakenly) out of the video store, I would never have started this big mouse stick. <br /> <br /> The film plays like any general movie story I've ever seen. In fact, those things that they break at variety events are so bad. I was half-awaiting living with the color 'home clown' on Mad TV, Will Sasso, who makes Steven Segal's impression that halfway off the screen to remind him that it was just an exaggerated action film, but now our characters are here to loot how ridiculous it really is. There were even no good fighting or action sequences. By the way, when things have been done, you would not even think that someone was kidnapped, there would be terrorists, or something would happen interestingly. <br /> <br /> Not only is this story completely and completely uninteresting, acting so terribly on wood. Just look at the part where Stephen Baldwin, like former Special Representative Charlie Snow, talks to the robbers on the phone. They tell her they have their own wife, and they put her on the phone. He says, "Charlie, help!" or something like that. And Baldwin answers "it's okay, honey" in such a dead way, you think he read the script and tried to hear the words phonetically. I imagine that, although it is such a ridiculously bad film (which belongs to the bottom 100 of the IMDb - a list that should extend to at least 250 films and should contain almost every Stephen Baldwin movie), someone could have been at least with a talent efforts to prevent it so much. Someone. Everyone. I couldn't pass by saying that everyone was reading the script. Save it, it's the only person in the whole movie who has any talent (and wouldn't have had it), Mad TV Deborah Wilson. <br /> <br /> It was the capital of the capital. If really embarrassing.
