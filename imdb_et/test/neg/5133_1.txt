I loved the heavenly beings and made it a point to always get it. <br /> <br /> So, imagine your joy when I discovered Love & Suicide while browsing NetFlix. Selecting heavenly creatures, an easy choice for my queue that went. <br /> <br /> I looked at the latter, made myself comfortable and waited. What I thought was stoning for a high school student's movie project (I laughed once or twice, just thinking I just downgraded the video) with a ridiculous preview. Dreadful, amateur direction, weak dialogue. I usually enjoy low-budget movies, there is something tangible and real about them, because they can't afford superficial things to discourage "meat" behavior, direction, plot, story. I would compare it to a student who has not studied the exam, knowing that he will fail and just put his head on the table and sleep. <br /> <br /> someone else would have a serious potential on the plot. <br /> <br /> Do not wait for magic or even the cult classic, such as divine polyester or showgirls, at least where you learn to wait for bad action. <br /> <br /> Love and suicide went worse than worse in the WORST movie I've ever seen.
