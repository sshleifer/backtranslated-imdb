The film didn't have any excitement and it doesn't have anything that keeps it in your interests. There was nothing fancy, funny, dramatic or romantic in the movie! How can a movie be romantic if a girl never gets the right man before the last time a movie ends, when the movie ends ??? Maybe part II is romantic, but someone else needs to waste your money! I have nothing else to say after wasting my time !!! There was nothing fancy, funny, dramatic or romantic in the movie! There was nothing fancy, funny, dramatic or romantic in the movie!
