All I have to say is one word ... SUCKS !!!! The only reason I gave it is that Josh Hartnett was in it and he's cool. Had to have this Klein guys beat ... stupid dumb and nonsense. At the end of this movie, you can't stand Klein and you really don't care what happens to Leelee. Hartnett was the only good thing.
