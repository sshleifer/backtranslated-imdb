Of all the E.R.Burroughs screen adjustments that Doug McClure played in the 70s, it is the most static of all. It's so static, you can taste the bundles of dust and feel the health of the lamps above. It looks like a very big budget school game or a very low budget action movie, what it really is. In many cases, it has been said that this was the last genre and I hope it was. The genre did not die calmly, but a terrible agony with lots of smoke, fake blood and bad sound effects. Peter Cushing had to be a boy again as a nut professor whose shirt would remain snow when the gentlemen had dragged themselves through the slippery hole of Allworld. What he did was to participate in this mishas and carry it so bravely. <br /> <br /> The picture was taken completely at the sound stage and now accompanied by a trendy, now intolerable synthesizer, which is the main anti-attraction of this film is a cardboard monster. Yes, there are always such monsters in the adaptation of Burroughs, but they rarely manage to be so ridiculous, helpless or insignificant with any credibility. In some cases, when high-scenes scenes of Mr. McClure's hero attack the creatures, you can almost hear the empty, hollow sound of his head beating triplodactocryptosaurus. Fortunately, the animals exploded and went to the flame when they went and fell. Indeed, when a film (and genre) pulls to the finals, it is really much unmotivated to explode. And the lovely Miss Munroe loses her underworld accent. <br /> <br /> The triple bill, currently on the market, includes this movie plus two others - The Land That Time Lost and Atlantis warlords. The first two are quite strong entries, especially the first, with a lot of money invested and sometimes even an exciting script. Don't expect any of these movie features. Drink with bites and laugh shamelessly what you see. After all, the creators were not ashamed.
