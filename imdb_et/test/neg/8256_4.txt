I bought this movie because I thought the cast was decent and I like Jennifer Rubin & Patsy Kens. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that this is not a high level. Stephen Baldwin makes his character sluggish from time to time and times. In some scenes, Patsy Kensit is so, but not too convincing and the supposed poem he brings in a certain scene in his room is completely pointless garbage. Mrs Kensit is definitely very sexy and sexy here, but at last I think Jennifer Rubin is the best in this movie. Mrs Rubins Character is first innocent, then sexy, because she plays the stupid character of Stephen Baldwin (Travis). The supportive frame includes Adam Baldwin (not with his most famous name cards) and M. Emm Walsh, who has appeared in many films, and also noticed Art Evans, one of John Mclane's allies in Die Hard 2. There are some nude scenes with Rubin & Kensit, a little bit of action, but it is definitely not a quick move or an intelligent thriller. There is a specific scene when they are in a car that is going to commit a crime, and Stephen Balwin's character has sunglasses and when you see him again, he is painted around his eyes, etc., sunglasses appear later when they leave the crime scene and the police are acting, very much obvious error in editing. <br /> <br /> If you have fans of either woman or Baldwin, you can find something here, but others should lead. This is a reasonable but unremarkable triller and is not worth more than a few dollars if you want.
