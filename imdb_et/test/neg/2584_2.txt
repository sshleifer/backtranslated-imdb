This is clearly a French film. It is a group of young idealistic / revolutionary / anarchist people. It moves very slowly. Long takes. LOng closeups. For a minute or more dedicated attempt to illuminate a hash / opium-filled tube. The long time the group turns around and burns. This is a black and white film. The subtitles were white, so about a third of the time they were unreadable. (Why do they do that?) I went out after about an hour and three quarters when it turned out that this picture didn't go anywhere, slowly. I wasn't the first one to walk out. It was the first time I went out of the picture for a long time. (Well, maybe another.)
