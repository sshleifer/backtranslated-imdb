A few years ago, I saw the smell of Green Papaya, the same director. My feelings for both movies are actually the same: beautifully shot, but terribly slow and boring. I saw this movie sneak in preview and I stayed after half an hour. It couldn't be any more. How can you make an interesting movie about people who constantly talk to each other about how happy they are and how perfect life is .........? I had a fantasy about the forgotten American G.I., who is still driving around in the jungle of Vietnam, who didn't know the war was over. How he suddenly appears on the film and begins to clear his M16 on the characters of the movie. Their red red color would be a beautiful contrast to all the green plants in the film. Time to leave!
