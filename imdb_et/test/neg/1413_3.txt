this film, although it can be considered a proper comedy test, is not what the previews did. the first half is made up of a typical robin Williams, who stands up from the material, although he did not really make many voices; He was always one liner and hitting punchlines ... somewhere during the election there is a problem with the computer program used in the election. here is where the network 3 arrives ... the woman who contributed to this program wants the truth to be said and the evil corporation wants to put her up ** spoilers ** her boyfriend even helps them though it is not even this movie would be could have been one of the political glory (maybe with a crowd during the reign), but it remains a grave made by too many chefs
