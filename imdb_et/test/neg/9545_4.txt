Am I the only person who thinks that the entire US forensic and scenes community must strike for their faces forever. The Rookie cop is first a crime scene where his backup is so slow that he has time to send a child who found the body to a local store to buy a disposable camera. By the time she returns (there are still no older policemen, SOCOs or other help for Jolie - that's New York, isn't she?) It has started to rain and she can only take evidence of work after she was stood in front of Amtrak to stop the scene from disrupting. <br /> <br /> I want to know the name of this camera because the photos were so incredibly detailed that the pictures were not distorted! Fear continues: - not in the film itself (pretty common, what I fear), but in the character of Lincoln Rhyme played by Mr. Washington. This man is a very dedicated forensic examiner who has years of experience and has entrusted work to an untrained policeman, a beginner, who instead of highly trained but invisible local crime scene examiners, who will continue to find very clearly placed tips. move them before taking them, thus polluting each object and making it impossible to create DNA profiles. Was it a bright idea now? I know that it should be possible to suspend disbelief to a certain extent, but those who say that this film is intelligent must be perfectly capable of thinking about finding this film credible. <br /> <br /> I've made this movie 4/10 for Denzel Washington's great action and Miss Jolie's lips, the only ones that need to give up my incredible!
