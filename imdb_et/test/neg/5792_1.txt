That movie hurt my face. I don't understand ... things just happened, inexplicably, and they usually resulted in someone breaking into the song and dance number. I don't understand how people praise this movie. There are B-movies and then there are B-musicals, and then Rockula. <br /> <br /> The songs made me want to lead the main wall. The only sustainable arm is that one of the musical explosions is a music video that relieves the pain, but can't justify it. The most frightening part of the film is Toni Basil's dance-dance, accompanied by his strange song. But with the bright side he can find the notes he is looking for, unlike pop music Rockula (aka Rapula) and Mona ... wow. So, if you want to ask life for about 90 minutes, check out this movie. If you hate your life, then buy it.
