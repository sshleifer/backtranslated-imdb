I've recently gone to the cinema to see the new version of 2007 (Teribithia). After that I went to the library to rent an older version to see it again without having to pay it again. I must say that I was very disappointed! I found that the older version is both horrible and brilliant, including Jessie, saying, "I know dad, but I hurt so much inside" when Leslie dies. It was quite awful and I didn't think the pain was much better. I was amazed at all the time, saying that they were not surprised to change it again. The story is great, but believe that I spend the money and look at the new version if you see the old one that you may never experience the real magic of Teribitia.
