I had somehow succeeded in doing this whole movie, but it was puzzled when entertainment was completely lost. My friends and I are HK movie fans, but WOW. This movie is everything and I mean everything the film shouldn't have. Underdeveloped and stereotypical characters, the way over-exaggerated, cheesy special effects, talking robots, no less than 20 double leg jumpers, impossible situation, uncomfortable gag and jokes, prerequisite of primary school, meaningless killing and too long material work . Throw in the fact that Gen-X Cops was a decent film and this movie becomes even more difficult. Just if you have an entertaining idea to watch this movie ... away.
