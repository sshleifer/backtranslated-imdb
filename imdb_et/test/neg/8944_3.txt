Early talkie function based on popular performance. Murder has been committed and a number of people are hiring the media to conduct a session to see who is the murderer. Although the lights are off, there is another murder ... so it's someone in this room. <br /> <br /> The following is the obvious, boring and colorful secret of murder. Most of the cast part exceeds the ridiculous degree. They act as they are on the stage (where you have to overdo things) and it seems silly on the screen. Most embarrassing is Bela Lugosi (two years before "Draculat") who really overpower this as a police inspector. The static direction of Tod Browning (who was always overestimated) does not help. <br /> <br /> Only for Browning and Lugos graduates. I'll give her 3.
