I saw this movie last night. I usually do not comment on good or bad because I think movies are like books because everyone has something and everything is different, tastes different, yadda yadda. This movie was bad. Finally, I thought it was testing my patience. How many women really see and live in this way when they hit the "rock" and if I could just borrow money from my mother and live my dream of fashion design, life would be great! I was a nice chick for girls (my dear hubby likes watching movies together and I knew it wasn't her thing), something light and sensual, but it was a bad movie. We are intelligent and interesting film observers, and this film was not so. Annette Benning is a great actor. Bad. Bad.
