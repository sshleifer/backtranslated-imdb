After Frank Kress (who played Abraham Gentry), the appearance of Henny Youngman and the last seconds of the film, there was nothing particularly good about this film. Why is it currently rated 5.3 and some reviewers worship outside me - the film is 99.44% crap ... and exactly what I would have expected from director Hershell Gordon Lewis. In the 1960s and 70s, Lewis knew that he made a series of incredibly low budget films, such as BLOOD FEAST and MONSTER A GO-GO. In recent years he has been baptized as "gore father" and has many fans - fans who ignore the injustice of their work and only focus on how some of his films were groundbreaking. But besides the liberal use of the fake and the real courage, his films are clean and they do not believe his film results are 9 and 10. It would be like a velvet painting by Elvis in Louvre! <br /> <br /> The movie is a very dirty assassin that takes place with strippers. When I say terribly, it is very bloody and sick in 1972 - even though today's standards see special effects surprisingly flat. So, while some very deviant and cruel murders take place in the film (I don't want to explain them - they come from the very sick and disregard the particularly sick women), at least they don't mind you because they were doing so badly. It is evident that in many cases they cut rubber dolls and dummies. But in order for them to do some illness, even if they are unrealistic, it is pretty disgusting and shows a lot of resentment. <br /> <br /> The only hope in the movie, as the police are all idiots, is a man named Abraham Gentry - whose manners and vocabulary are very close to David Lochary, an actor in John Water's earlier films. Although his behavior is bad, he is so tempting and funny that he was interested. He may be pretty funny and weird, it's the only movie he's ever made! It was also strange that so many women wanted her - especially because they just didn't look like her type. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the movie people, they are cretans and idiots who might not act. In fact, I was hoping that MORE would be killed - they really came! None of their behavior was the least plausible and apparently the director never directed a scene - most of the scenes in the movie were worse than any of Ed Wood's masterpiece PLAN 9 FROM OUTTER SPACE. In fact, the film is the only prerequisite for many women to appear in the film that they want to take off their clothes. Now I know it sounds a bit, but most of them were incredibly unpleasant and looked like drug addicts who drag their next fix. When these women take off their clothes, people in the crowd give them money to put it back (How Youngman should say it in the movie)! But given the Lewis budgets, they were probably the best actors he could get. <br /> <br /> In general, a slippery beak that can be worse than most of the director's films ... and it says a lot! It is violent (but stupid), anti-female (treats them like meat and things to be damaged) and is completely incompetent from start to finish.
