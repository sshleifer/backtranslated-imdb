Great acting, excellent product values, good direction. <br /> <br /> However, the script starts with great pace and interest in the first half and then leaves the other half. The first half has a clear character and motivation, but the other half leaves many questions unanswered. <br /> <br /> The conflicts that are raised are convincing, but the follow-up is weak. For example, we are very confident that Rudyard Kipling is pre-war, but we do not know whether this philosophical attitude will change during the film. <br /> <br /> This is the picture that I want to find in facts in history books. I don't feel like getting a clear idea of ​​the movie. <br /> <br /> War depiction is accurate from the heart, though the lack of women's enthusiasm does not reflect the hysteria of war in Britain. Maybe it's historically accurate; Like so much in this movie, I just don't know.
