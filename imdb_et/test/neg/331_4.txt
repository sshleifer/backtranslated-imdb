I bought it out of curiosity. How did John Carradine (who died in 1988) and Cameron Mitchell (who died in 1994) made a film in 1995? Thanks to the untold movie, the film material that has probably been sitting on the shelf for about ten years can! You can say that the movie image used to capture these scenes does not match the "Jack-O" movie. Ed Wood's curse lives. For both Carradine and Mitchell, it is good that this is exactly the kind of film you would expect from both filmography. The same applies to Scream Queens Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith. <br /> <br /> The appliance is at Oakmoor Crossing in Halloween and some, beer-dropping teens will break the grave. The result is a friction killer and a big plastic pumpkin! He (it?) Goes after Kelly's family for revenge (and kills others who get their way). Father opens Haunted Garage neighborhood to child. The son (the son of director Ryan Latshawil) is one of the constant, puzzled facial expressions of all his scenes, and one of the fun, badly acting dramatic scenes in the grave. At least she is a child. Mother's eyes pop out when she read her dialogue. There is also a tedious woman who shows things that are phonetically pronouncing their entire dialogue. <br /> <br /> So what about name players? You can see Stevens, Wildsmith and Mitchell briefly on the TV screen (they are used for timing). In Linnea, the role of a nanny is greater and she does exactly what she gets. His enthusiastic performance helps a bit. There is also one where laughs, as an ultra-conservative couple who looks at the Rush Limbaugh clone when biting the TV. A woman slips on a carpet and stabs a toaster with a knife. He is the result of an electric shock and the end result looks like a flamed Muppet. <br /> <br /> All and all, fun! I was not bored!
