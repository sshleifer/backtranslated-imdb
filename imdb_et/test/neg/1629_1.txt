Even MST3K couldn't make this painful, long, and ultimately mind-filled drive funny or fun. While most of the bad movies and their own are fun, it's one of the few videos that literally uses the word bad. <br /> <br /> This element, which makes it so spectacular, is not a lack of story, but the fact that SOOOO much of the background is cramped in the first half hour that it is completely ridiculous and harder to track than on the road while driving without lights. <br /> <br /> The film's hero, Ator, is nothing more than a film for this energy-direct energy dash. Softly dressed and sporty "PÃ©cs like melons", as Joel said, belongs more to the gym than here. <br /> <br /> I recommend it only for dying and I mean hard-working followers. If you have an enemy, recommend them to this movie. If you do, I'll praise you. You should be able to do something through it.
