I had this to watch a DVD, I thought I could see some kind of biography o painting Goya, but the movie was everything except Goya. This film speaks of a young woman who was taken away from her family by the Holy Inquisition, allegedly because she practiced Jewish rituals (just because a poor girl did not like eating pork!). The rest of the film concerns torture, humiliation led by a bad script (can't believe it is by JC Carri√®re because I couldn't believe that this cr ** was led by Mr Milos Forman) who focuses on a religious person and a young woman and that is all. Ah, and there is Goya, I forgot to play a completely peripheral role - it could be John, Paul, Peter, Manuel, Joaquim, Jose or someone else's role. Very disappointing - one of those films that is forgotten forever (if it is not yet). Rent a "Rose Name" if you want a movie from the Holy Inquisition. And I don't know what you should rent if you want to watch a movie about Spanish painter Goya. Perhaps a good caliber director, not Forman, needs to do it. PS: Spanish painter, Goya - the role of the lost title in the plot - is depicted by the Scandinavian actor, making this film even harder. Maybe next time we should send Javier Barden to play Norwegian painter Edvard Munch!
