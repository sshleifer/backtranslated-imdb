Where to start? I think only three other films have led to IMDb review and all of them were positive. Like it is ..? <br /> <br /> Pleasant, intimidating, tragic, embarrassing, catastrophic, foolish, irritating, totally, and completely awful. Don't forget to release theaters. I think I'm literally in shock. <br /> <br /> I'm not a snob. I didn't expect a nice movie or an intense character, but it's really fun. We just have to demand more movies we see. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Like black death.
