I honestly thought this film would be cheesy, even though I liked Alvin and Chipmunks for the LONGEST! I was very wrong. THAT WAS SLEEP !!! It's been the best movie I've seen since October! In my opinion, this is a movie that everyone should keep during the holidays! Enchanted (I was thinking anyway ...) was terrible, the Golden Compass was fine, but the end was pretty messy for his Dark Materials fans and I Am Legend, I haven't seen it yet (or National Treasures 2), but it looks good. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give away anything, but this movie is great for everyone, especially kids!
