PATHETIC !!!!!! The film starts with a little interest in the plot, but IF the audience gets only a few minutes of restlessness and snacks, or breathe fresh air outside a closed dark hall .... <br /> <br /> Looks like watching a 1960s movie, where the colors were dull, director's debut, and acted by high school students! The film revolves around America's high-profile actor, who is trying to recreate movies by acting in one of the so big Indian films. His behavior is a real sad thing, which is welcomed by the delivery of inferior dialogue. <br /> <br /> OverAll: I don't recommend anyone watching this movie. You still want to watch: then try to watch it at home when a TV channel transmits it, believe me that it would be fun because this movie doesn't get any ads or sponsors. <br /> <br /> It is better to wear aspirin, u may need it if you can't find the remote control to change channels! ps.s. I have no idea if other observers even watched the movie? I made and wasted my $ 10 ticket!
