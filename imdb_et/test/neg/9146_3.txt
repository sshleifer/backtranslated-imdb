This film is still a great director for Budd Boetticher and a beautiful, but not yet dreamy actor, Nina Foch, one of the other reviewers, the nature of a B-film. It's not just good. And a wasteful assumption and overactive mist machine is wasted. <br /> <br /> Basic piece - A nose that has left her nerves because of her war time is a nightmare. She encounters a resort with her husband, where she breathes in nerves and realizes she is in a dream, even though she has never met her before. In the meantime, it turns out that our silly guy works as a spy and gets closer to a secret, hush-hush mission that must not fail. <br /> <br /> Of course there are Nazis. And plot holes. And smart people who are most likely to run in completely unnecessary scraps so that driving time can be brought out in one hour. Finally, the film will become a competition between which the group of spies may act more foolishly. If the FBI and OSS had behaved like this, we would have lost the war '42 '. <br /> <br /> The film itself has a pretty solid picture (despite the fog's best efforts) and acting - as it seems in many Columbia Bs TCMs that have recently shown - is curious. It is less stylized than what you could find in a similarly budgeted Warner Brose movie, but also less fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Boetticher's strength is, of course, a factual style that allows strong stories and acting in his Randolph Scott western to come up. Perhaps the problem is that this style does not work when the script is insignificant and the actors are tired of their five-year film according to the schedule of the year.
