Of course, the concept was already done with Alf and Charmings: push modern society into one or more non-local characters. But I loved both exhibitions and watched them religiously until they ended in 1990. When I found out about Scorch, I was really very promising about something new because the 90's new TV didn't impress me yet (but at least Star Trek: TNG and Simpsons were still running. It was terrible, but given the ridiculous dialogue and totally unbelievable writing, I can't blame them too much for what they were supposed to do. The entire production work of the exhibition seemed too low for a TV status. That would be right in the 80s. The second episode was not so bad, and I started to hope that if he took his step, this exhibition would improve. Unfortunately, my videotape could not record the third episode I played, I never saw ha and the series disappeared from TV listings after that. All I have now is the first two episodes recorded from VHS tape.
