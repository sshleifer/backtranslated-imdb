Bronson took the money and ran the film; he must have house payments like me! This small film in Mexico reminds me of some of the stinkers from the Italian sea. I heard I don't know if this is true, but companies are making these films abroad for tax purposes. I believe it, because otherwise you would make this movie, it was definitely not making money. We had a whole host of these Canadian stinkers because the government gave tax relief to the film industry. I don't know if it cost other countries like Canada. Anyway, to the subject, this film is badly made in every aspect, I believe they grabbed Charles Bronson to sell that smell; it looks very fake at the end of the dead body. 3/10
