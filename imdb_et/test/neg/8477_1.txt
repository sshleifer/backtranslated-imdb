Mask's son is a terrible film. I don't like a child and I don't like a dog. Jamie Kennedy and her husband are a lovely couple, but it can't sit through this garbage. Even in just 88 minutes (or so), the movie couldn't end fast enough for me. The only real laugh begins with Ben Stain's short look. That's it. The rest is just repeating the first movie. In fact, it's just an insult to transformation. Why did this follow up? This film costs millions of dollars. Why am I sitting through a movie with a child and a dog who deliberately tries to drive his father mad? Jamie Kennedy is talented but she has nothing to do with this movie. I can hardly be nice for this movie. 1/10
