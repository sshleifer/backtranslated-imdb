Well, the first thing I saw after watching the DVD box was "The Best Scenario" and thought it would be a good rental. WOW, I was wrong! I'm sure there was a good movie at one time, but after the incredibly bad performance and the value of producing "video games", it looks like a throne brother on the throne. The first scene determines the overall atmosphere of the film. In five minutes you can ask yourself, "What the hell am I watching?" The amazing sound that makes every song similar to Rob Zombie's "Dragula" makes it an unhappy crap for a ridiculously bad movie. Side Note # 3 is the most romantic quote in the movie - "I think you're the final destination."
