It's amazing to think that this movie came out just one year before Star Wars, but it looks like it's a million years behind in complexity and special effects. In fact, the direction and design of art (a nice Victorian spacecraft) is not bad; This is the monster costumes that are most ridiculous, recalling the "Rubber Wash" monsters LOST IN SPACE TV show. An evil cave makeup reminded me of some fabulous old TWILIGHT ZONE. <br /> <br /> The script is stylish, and beyond Peter Cushing's comic relief, the actor is too unhappy. This movie is recommended only if you really enjoy the bad narrow SF. And music ... yikes! Terrific 70s experiments with synthesizers that don't fit with the film's time period and sounds like someone playing with a mini-stick and a 2-ball tape machine.
