Leon Errol excels in the double role of Uncle Matt Lindsay and Lord Basil Epping, but I have difficulties with the "Mexican Spitfire" series because they are all erroneously created to create identity and have been pre-telegraphed. Errol is funny because it's stupid Lord Epping, but I would have preferred many more and more repetitions. <br /> <br />
