I have to say that I was surprised when I found several positive comments for this turkey (urgently needs a feather transplant)! I give it to 1 because I think the idea of ​​making a movie about a rock'n'roll wild man - Jerry Lee Lewis - is honorable, but it's a disgraceful display of such a trash and the "killer" doesn't deserve it! It's a good thing that he was late for his career ... said Elvis had destroyed his career with six sixties movies, and that could have been the same for Jerry Lee if it came out about 15-20 years ago! It is based on Myra Gail's Lewis book and it is a shame at first. It is a bad and inaccurate story about his life with Lewis and there are many better books about Killer that could have made a much better and more interesting script. Add a number of actors who don't know if they're in drama, comedy, or a bit of both! Otherwise, exquisite actor Dennis Quaid will propose what must be one of the greatest actors in many months! He moves around in the picture, talks about his "god-given gifts" and, as a spectator, he would like to show it on the screen! Dirty gestures and funny faces, and Jerry Lee had to know Friday when he saw what he got in this really terrible movie. The rest of the team is almost as bad as Winona Ryder, who makes her the best when she gets a dirty line. It's "Grease" all the time and whenever Jerry Lee rides around in Memphis, his cabriolet with radio in the car, the whole city dances about this music! Everything in this movie is like comic artists of real people ... wildlife self Sun Records Sam Philips! And it's a shame! A charismatic and interesting artist like Jerry Lee Lewis deserves better, and I hope he took $ 500,000 from the deal and told the company that he was f ** k himself ... twice!
