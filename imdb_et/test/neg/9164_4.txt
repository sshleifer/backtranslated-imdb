As cute and divine as they are, the story of the three story camps just doesn't seem to be enough meat to keep it for one and a half hours. I thought the first half-hour of this movie was worth watching. It was fun, he had a few laughs, it was full of energy. Then it somehow lost. I wouldn't even say it was lost because it seemed to me quite steep. The fun was gone; laughter disappeared. My daughter also noticed it. He's 4 - he laughed surprisingly several times in the first part of the movie, then his laughter stopped. Perhaps it took too serious a tone - an evil filmmaker who worked in patches of death. Anyway, something happened, and it wasn't better. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is trying to talk about how things started (Alvin, Simon and Theodore). Everyone knows the Christmas song. Here we discover how they met Dave and started. The film is still being updated, although their true origin has been seen at Dave Street in 1958, the year when animated singing rodents were first created. Jason Lee did a good job because Dave's and chip's voices were also pretty good. David Cross as the evil Ian irritated me bluntly and I couldn't understand Claire's character played by Cameron Richardson. He added little to the film. This is a movie that can be viewed with children - this is probably a movie you would only like to watch with children. It gets me 4/10.
