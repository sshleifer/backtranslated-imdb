SLOOOOOOOW, a lukewarm, poorly-produced 70's schlocker made today's titles moore cowvincing; nevertheless, this film is worthy of smelly and edible, as it is not a steadfast, lacking direction, and foolish 70s clothing (unfortunately, MooCow, when Adidas clothing was all the rage ...). It has the same feeling that some of the better 70's sci-fi fashion lovers have received, "WestWorld" and "Logan's Run". Although an interesting assumption (rich people clone themselves constantly to supply body parts to keep them alive in theory forever), the film makes a mistake when we get into Richard (Tim Donnelly), a clone that is both boring and irritating at the same time. Donnelly's cavity does not help but fits the rest of the pain. Even B-lights such as Dick Sargent ("Bewitched" TV series, "Ghost with 1,000,000 Eyes"), Keenan Wynn ("Dr. Strangelove", "Dark", "Laserblast") and Peter Graves ("End of End" " "Killers from Space", "This Conquered the World") only provide jazz appearances that have been produced, staged, and edited by a number of noblemen, not surprising that "Clonus" can't scare anyone, No less attention! True to say that the poor flick does not have anything that even loves - even if you want to see somewhat bad, 70s of jokes made by Greydon Clark joked. "Clonus" is no bonus, MooCow says even the MST3K version is yawner, so go on with your risk !: = 8P
