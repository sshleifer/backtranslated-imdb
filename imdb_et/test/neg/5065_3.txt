The controversial German journalist Jutta Rabe, who himself got divers to the Estonian wreck, put this stupid "thriller" together to save his investments. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is of course always observable, but he has only three scenes. He gives his material great - as you can ask a professional. Also, the chief driver, Jürgen Prochnov, is sometimes very good. <br /> <br /> The rest is still bad. An actor who plays the secretary of the Swedish minister (or whatever he was - he doesn't feel painful) is extremely bad. <br /> <br /> The script has some nice ideas and the story is really interesting. However, the final scenario should have been rewritten a few times. Some scenes are just ridiculous - especially end scenes. <br /> <br /> The film is almost 2 hours, which is about 45 minutes too long. It has been very interesting as a 60-minute TV movie. The hallmark of the two hours is that of pretense, bored, stupid and silly. <br /> <br /> Jutta Rabe may be a good journalist (her idea of ​​transporting military items using Estonian government from Estonia to Sweden has come to an end recently, when the Swedish army officially announced they were actually using the ship, it's a wonderful film producer Director, writer and actors suck more. /> <br /> I give this movie 3/10. I would have given it 1 if it wasn't because the story is sometimes interesting, then Donald Sutherland is in it and he is real Film material. <br /> <br /> But we don't even see the boat sink! What kind of movie about the ship that swallows?
