Bare Wench is another softening parody of the Blair Witch project (I think there are about two dozen things). It has 5 very attractive women (including Nikki Fritz, Julie Smith and Julie Strain) and one dorky boy whose only purpose is to offer comics. <br /> <br /> Okay, so I mean "Cool Very beautiful women who have soft porn lesbian sex with each other for 10 minutes or so. It should be a good one." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the manufacturers blew that. In this video there is nothing that qualifies as a sex scene. There are a couple of wrong starts, but most of the activities are only women who portray the camera. I think if the producers had spent the money on women and spent more on removing clothes, they had no money to do anything. And I think they used all of their distributed nudity too early, because at the end of the video there is a huge amount of meaningless dialogue that is obviously used for some reason other than timing. "You are a liar! No, you are! You're going to the dungeon! Not going! I think we should go home! Well, I'm not!" It continues and continues and continues forever. <br /> <br /> There's better stuff than that.
