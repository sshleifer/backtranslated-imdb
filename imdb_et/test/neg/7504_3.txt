In the near future, a dark stranger can walk to some South American city with zombies. Our stranger, with a friendly face, is studying the harsh realities of urban life. There are two groups of people; higher classes who live safely behind the city concrete walls by the national police at the right price. Then our friendly face is the inhabitants. These lower class people live with zombies. Only survival tools are traded with the goods they eat during the day, with the police in exchange for food sticks. Our stranger discovers why his world is a plague of zombies. It was based on a new diet that reduced carbohydrate craving. Humanity's desire to bring fat has led to a decline in society as we know it. These tablets increased the desire for protein, ie meat, even a pet bottle. However, there was another serious side-effect after the deaths became stronger again with the name of the protein, namely the human flesh. <br /> <br /> What I think is an imaginative introduction, I felt this film perceived some invented material. What better way to explain the cause of zombie races than today's idea is that people want to sacrifice to change their body without the effort of the gym? But the imagination of this film soon stopped after that exposure. This movie falls into the old trap “I can't imagine what the world is like in a society of collapse”. When you watch this movie, you will not be able to access the other world when you look at the (original) viewing of the monkey planet (original), alien, mad Max or Texas Chain Saw. In this film, the substitution society defines people in orange and green. Leather jackets for color and charity goods. In this substitution society there is no hardness of life, but whole faces and more prepared zombies. Movies should allow you to escape, not to remind you that you have to leave your wardrobe and go to the charity shop for old clothes. <br /> <br /> Forget some pathetic acts or overwhelmed zombies. This movie fails because it is too polished, too pleasant and too predictable. I've been watching such movies since the early eighties. If you go to this kind of movie, I suggest you look at movies like Dawn of The Dead (original and remake), Threads or Fulci Zombie again to see and experience this feeling of despair in a devastating society.
