They call this movie "euro trash horror". Well, it's not horror. The film takes place in Europe, so yes, it is the "euro". Trash? Ah yes, that's the trash right. <br /> <br /> You know you are a great movie when the DVD at the beginning gives you text on the screen that apologizes for print quality. look. Wait for cracks, odd cuts, and the movie doesn't fit on the screen. In addition, there is a sound - at first I thought I was watching a dubbed movie. Then I realized that lips carefully see that no, that is, the sound quality is embarrassingly bad and in sync. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is quite funny - an old, confused woman named Dr. Bannister kills a scientist with her youth formula. I don't give much, because when you see an "old woman", it's obvious that she's under a thick, poorly applied make-up layer. Anyone with a pointless joke, seeing fake old age, knows what's coming next. long wig hair! Zounds! <br /> <br /> When I say the old woman is hidden, I mean she's corn flakes glued to her face. The film does not try to explain how corn flakes arrived there. There is no attempt to touch any of the characters for this. They have never developed further than finger dolls. <br /> <br /> The two police officers who are acting on our anti-hero are just migrating, probably confused about the simplest clues. A killed scientist worked on a youth serum, an old woman is gone and we continue to run for a young woman - how do these pieces match? What does all this mean? One policeman sweats a lot and makes his face with a cloth. Another smokes a pipe. That's pretty much all we can, characteristically. <br /> <br /> Dr. Bannister (crown, now beauty) goes in a strange costume and then takes them out so we can see his meat. He's got things with men. She gets a neck throat with a younger nightgown. He's going to Geneva so we can see the lake from there. He's a bit of a water ski, then he takes a wet suit to expose the strange beaded bikini. She removes her clothes again in strange ninja costume striptease. <br /> <br /> End? Well, without giving away anything, it's just odd about the summary that makes about as little as the rest of the picture. This is something the writer comes up with when the director awakens him at 4 and says, "Fast! We need the end of the movie! What's going on?" <br /> <br /> The writer mumbles something awake and the director runs with it. <br /> <br /> What is this movie good for? Some of the music is fun and fun. This classic 60's organ music that is so funny is enough to make you laugh out loud. There are some strange seduction scenes, bizarre dialogue, funny moments. <br /> <br /> It's very bad that it's good. I managed to look at it from start to finish without having climbed my eyes. I think it's a praise, different.
