This is the worst film I've ever seen, right from the start, right down the hill, with cheese music score, poor performance and complete absence or real story. Even for a B movie, it's just terrible. After reading some good comments, I thought I'd keep an open mind and look at it. But all the bad reviews were so correct. I do not fully understand how someone would have enjoyed it. I'm a big Sci-fi fan and it was as much as I can swallow. Make sure you prefer to move to another movie. They are many other better films that deal with this topic. YOU ARE Warned.
