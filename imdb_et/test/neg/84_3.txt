Seeing this movie titled "Stupid Teenagers Black Die" made me believe it was some sort of fraud. Later I discovered that the original title was "Blood and Guts". However, both titles are misleading. It's not a scam or a serious spray film. This is something that is not in both areas. A group of teenagers participate in a terrible house and then kill. It seems familiar, isn't it. Well, this movie does not add to the endless stream of similar films. And it's badly done. Because of the lack of light, the whole film is grainy. Now this effect can be very effective, but it is not so. The young cast does not work too badly, but the director has no idea what to do with the actors. In many scenes, the actors are clearly looking for instructions, but they are too late. This can of course also be an editor error. The characters are unreal and the story just stinks. Sound is sometimes terrible: conversations are uneven, but when loud or shouting, the actors are really white. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's still a bad one. For me, 10 out of 10.
