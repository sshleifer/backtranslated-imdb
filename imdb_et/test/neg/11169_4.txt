These days, Asian horror films are one of the best in the world in terms of their atmosphere and the reflection of today's society. It's not one of those movies! Instead, "The Record" is a mediocre film that is very well derived from American films, such as "I know what you did last summer" and "Scream". The plot is familiar - 5 teenagers accidentally commit a terrible crime but cover it up. A year later, they are abducted by a maniac with a knife (a sterile mask of a hospital and a properly hidden concealment of an orange jumper). It doesn't help teenagers to be a generally unlikely group (this is one of those movies where killer motives seem quite reasonable) and there are numerous fools to keep up with. The film's direction is inconvenient, MTV is more affected by the current Asian horror movies (such as "The Ring"). However, the last third of the film is not too bad, offering some decent temporary scenes, although there are probably too many "twists" in the end. 4/10
