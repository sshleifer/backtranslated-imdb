Eugene O'Neilli 4 and a half hours in 1927 Play on the screen in less than two hours. The combination of the symbolic dialogue and the Gothic melodrama is not very outdated, and the pain has difficulty, especially Norma Shearer Nina and Ralph Morgani Marsden. Clark Gable, like Ned Darrell, gets better, but mostly because he is a dirty character that is not given to other philosophical motives that are better suited to the Gable range. If the plot is on the quadrangle of love and the audience adapts to the voice command, the film becomes even more enjoyable. Another problem here is the technique used for azides. The stage stopped action, but the actors spoke to their audience. Here they are made as voices. You think it would work better, but because the action is no longer frozen, the actors are forced to stop talking and grimacing the camera to match the emotions of their thoughts. It is hard to watch this movie and not think of Groucho Marx's fun parody version "Animal Crackers". These shortcomings are accompanied by some censorship caused by censorship (Nina's promise is soft and it is not mentioned that she plays a more central abortion in the game) and an evil score (not credited) that sounds like a background music century turn. O'Neill called this film a "dazzling rap in the condensation and idiotic censorship", and while "Strange Interlude" is far from as big as his later "The Iceman Cometh" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night", it was definitely better than that.
