Unfortunately, this movie is not very good. But is it really important? We all know the basics of the story and it has nothing new. But I love the low budget horror & sci fic camp classics ... so I'll forgive it. Only what someone remembers about this movie is that little Leonardo DiCaprio made his debut in it. He did it well. Some did not require great acting skills, and the direction would probably never give her any chance to offer it ... Little Leonardo DiCaprio was very cute ... and so was the girl. The movie is fun if you like the horror & sci fic camp classics and you've experienced watching them.
