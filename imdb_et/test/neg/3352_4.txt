I had never heard of ONE DARK NIGHT until someone mentioned it recently on a horror board and read it, I got interest in participating in Meg Tilly and acknowledging that it was the beginning of Friday 13. VI VI: Tom McLoughlin, directed by JASON LIVES. Unfortunately, it is sad to say that this is nothing special. Assuming this is familiar: a college girl must live in an old mausoleum at night until morning to join a corporation. This girl is a young Meg Tilly, like Julie, who wants to prove to her loving, caring boyfriend Steve (David Mason Daniels) that she can make her brutal, binding former girlfriend, Caroli (Robin Evans) corporation, whatever the tactics she draws, to see him fail. With Carol's power, Kitty (Leslie Speights), always with a toothbrush in her mouth, and Leslie (Elizabeth Daily), who doesn't want Julie to cause such problems. Although Leslie insists that Julie leave alone if she stays in the mausoleum, Carol and Kitty intend to torture the poor girl. Meanwhile, Steve is looking for her while Julie, Carol and Kitty meet evil they can't imagine. The recently ill body of the "psychological vampire", whose telesales were dangerously powerful, is trying to empty them. vitality. The only one who can help these girls is Olivia (Melissa Newman), the daughter of a dead man, who has the same psychic power she has. <br /> <br /> I think many find it exciting to have unusual evil that threatens girls in the mausoleum, that's definitely different from what you usually see in the slashes that were out now. Like Adam West's character (he was Olivia's cynical husband, who found a ridiculous idea of ​​his father's power), it was a very difficult time for me to adapt to a sticky plot and I never found anything in the movie to get exciting. Mausoleum for me was never that horrible (..they actually does not reach the same type of unsuccessful quality of PHANTASM) and the bodies used to attack girls are ridiculously convincing (.. there is one big scene where the body's face melts) . During this time, I have a soft spot for low budget movies, but I can never find a reason to participate if you have this unsatisfactory dead body that captures electrical bolts from your eyes, causing other bodies to release their crypt, obey their master. It's just too stupid to take it seriously. Carol is your typical blonde bitch who wants to punish a beautiful girl looking for a flame. Steve is your typical, clean and all-inclusive boy, beautiful and gentle, becoming a hero who tries to save his girl from any embarrassing forces. For the small budget director McLoughlin's reward, it is trying to use all the tricks of the book with the audience's excitement, using a number of odd-boogie effects, such as corpses that continue to young girls, chairs that shake and shake, doors that close themselves. The film obviously has fans and I am glad I had the opportunity to see it, but I was a little disappointed that ONE DARK NIGHT was not the spooky place I was hoping for. Adam West has a very small role to play, as the husband, who hopes that his wife will get out of his depressive state, is a father who has nothing to do with him. Melissa Newman is anxious Olivia, recognizing that she must stop her father once and forever, or else she will continue to receive maintenance. Donald Hotton is a companion of Dockstader, Olivia's father, who informs him of what he was. I wasn't particularly mindful that Tilly's performance would have been here (.. she was mostly scared most of the time), but she got the chance to prove her beyond that point. This is undoubtedly valuable for those who looked back at that time, because for nostalgia purposes it can attract films of this age.
