Begrudgingly gave him 3 - one point for each Fonda, Stanwycki and supportive casting. <br /> <br /> Never see it before - I look at it right now and it has just arrived to the point where Henry Fonda is wearing the threshold of Babes. When I continue to look, it is easy to see if Fonda and Stanwyck can pull it out of the truck. But after reading the comments from other viewers, I am not very optimistic. <br /> <br /> Open ski scenes were enough to take me out of lunch. Voice transmissions were obviously made in the sound studio, and editing between external frames and close-ups was terrible. I don't know much about the technology of this era - but I can't believe there was nothing they could do to make it more credible. <br /> <br /> My second intimidation was when Fonda wiped out and (I think because of the extreme speed of movement) he is at the forefront of snow until his torso - Stanwyck pulls him with obviously staged difficulty - and (I imagine that he is such an experienced doctor) to react at all to his seemingly unconscious state and to his hip position. <br /> <br /> Look, I am perfectly capable of stopping my unbelief, but I did not overcome the fact that he had just forced a man into a possible head injury and that he might be paralyzed during his life. Not my idea of ​​a big yuks. <br /> <br /> So when I finish this comment, we've just seen Kirki's first jealous outbreak and Dr Hunt is off to make an appendectomy! I'm not sure what I hate more - script, background music, or story! Argghhhh! I've finished. Game over. Click the button.
