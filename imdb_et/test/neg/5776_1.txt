Looking at this cover before I looked at it, my expectations were not high, especially since it was one of the other dirty horror movies that were busy (like Junior). <br /> <br /> Alright, not only this movie has meaningless stereotypical signs (rich shower bag, slut, sheriff, local who knows what goes wrong in town, etc.) but has such godly dialogues, acting, guiding and cg Effects. The Jeremiah stone guy was fun. (* SPOILER *) I will never understand why he was holding his finger off when he kept this chick hostage. <br /> <br /> The film's premise is as cruel as the other bugs. What I got from it was Jeremiah Stone during the Gold Rush and the notorious expulsion. He had a gold color, (* SPOILER *) and gave a curse to everyone who went for his gold before the locals rescued him when he killed a girl, but not just his survival, but dropped his finger and ran away. So, nowadays, this spouse's morality about this gold mine and, of course, they warn the locals about forty nose curse. And what do they do? As expected, you ignored the warnings and the golden search. They get gold and all s ** t continues. Fortunately, (* SPOILER *) can cut off the female head. <br /> <br /> That's it. When you look at the film cover, you can tell what movie it is. It's just so terrible that it's fun. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 stars out of 5.
