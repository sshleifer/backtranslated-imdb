I have to say I wasn't impressed at all, probably because I was expecting this movie a lot more. Maybe the emphasis on religion or science or the idea of ​​life, not just a few lines. So, if you wait to think of something after seeing this movie, don't do it. It is more psychological than philosophical. I vote 4 because it cleans up a bit and because I have great respect for BBC documentaries. There are a couple of very interesting scenes that really made some sense. It was a great idea to include this movie related to evolution theory, too bad that it was not the main topic. Ah, I just forgot to say that for more than 1 hour the movie is quite boring and kind of cruel.
