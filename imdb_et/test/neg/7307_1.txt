A really big step forward in the perfection of painful cinema. <br /> <br /> All this movie is bad. Action (if called), lighting, sound, script (if any), editing, direction, camera work, are all cruel. No element is well done. If I thought it was deliberate, I can give the film some credit, but I can't believe people made this horizontal film. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth buying and screening for your enemies. .
