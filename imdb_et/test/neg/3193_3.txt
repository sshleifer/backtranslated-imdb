Converged perspectives can be a good idea in some movies. Here's the complete mess. <br /> <br /> But the whole mess starts with a story: the boomer of the video clip wants to shoot a light comedy that has a dangerous noir female. He is proud and no man could dive and climb and his toes sucked. He is more materialistic, looking at whether he would melt in his mouth. <br /> <br /> The film will not let you imagine: being smart / funny / good looking. Phalocretinism at his best. Please only white trash.
