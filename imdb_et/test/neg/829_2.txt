When I went to watch this movie, I didn't say I had great expectations. But just that I had a weak hope that this full-length feature would have at least some of the "Da Ali G Show" on the television fun and smart. <br /> <br /> But as you might expect, it can't translate a half-hour TV show into a 90-minute movie. The film had no appeal, and he used the toilet and sexual humor of the juveniles. Basically I'd have to get it halfway down, but I was pretty foolish to think that it could somehow improve when I was wrong. I loved this example, but I hated the movie. This movie is only for those who have fun with fun trees ...
