If you thought it was incredible tomorrow morning, wait until you see it. <br /> <br /> So, most catastrophic movies usually require a 1 billion event, complemented by other things. In this case, even two huge storm systems are connected. There are enough now. Oh, but hold up, no, "the event" is sabotage of the power grid and subsequent destruction. <br /> <br /> Next to throw elements of human interest - in this case cheating spouse, psychotic weapon for boyfriend, rebellious daughter, hacker who has the point of proving senator who tries to put on the agenda, reporter who tries to "resist" with man , and pregnant women who are stuck in the elevator. <br /> <br Finally, add a handful of tasting events to add excitement. <br /> <br /> Jeez, when the director tried to fit any pointless line, wouldn't have less time for the real disaster that Jeez, if you can't even model the truck convincingly, shouldn't really take your fingers, exploding power plants, Las Destruction of veggies or oil stations. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet gathered the horror of this movie, just let me add that all three bad guys are killed separately and completely unhappy in unreliable ways that tend to be more moral in good filmmaking. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with the first month of film students who wrote jaded, hackneyed, clich√©-soaked scripts, but for God's sake, that doesn't mean someone has to make them into movies! <br /> <br /> It will make you unlikely to be unlikely 10.0 The Apocalypse is not so terrible. Avoid both of them.
