Before I saw this movie, I realized it would be a low budget movie. But even with these low standards, this movie is not cut. <br /> <br /> The problem is not so much that the filmmakers had a small budget or had poor performance, writing, management, sound, music and editing. I thought it was all bad, and that's it. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this movie is that it didn't even do a good job in guts and gore. Most of the activities take place on the screen and everything we see is infections that look very counterfeit - even by the standards of low budget films. <br /> <br /> Indeed, there is no excuse that gore is so badly done. Peter Jackson did a fairly low budget for "Bad Taste" at about the same time and he was somehow able to make much more convincing guts and gore than this movie showed. <br /> <br /> Fault in almost every level, I can't recommend this movie to anyone. Take it clearly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
