This program was shown early in the morning, SPACE, a cable sci-fi station. I'm surprised that someone would pay for it or forward it; it is incredibly amateur. <br /> <br /> The entire exhibition is a series of short monologues or scenes made in a set that looks like a closet with wall-mounted circuit boards. There is little consistency between scenes and graphs. A typical scene revolves around some flat jokes or special effects and is only a minute or so long. Dialogue makes no sense and special effects look like Photoshop filters. Actors are all adults, but I have literally seen that high school plays with better writing and sets. This program is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Perhaps every scene works interstitial; filler between ads. Stringing all scenes makes material restrictions very obvious.
