What Wes thought it was a tear? It doesn't work well for any other job, but again it seemed that it fell after A Nightmare On Elm Street. It is visible through its follow-up 1.Invatellation to Hell 2.Chiller 3.Hills Have Eyes II 4.Deadly Friend 5.Serpant and Rainbow 6.Shocker all these movies were either mediocre to our mess it wasn't until people Under Stairs that he got his breath back and began to hit again. Chiller does not have any of Craven's usual and none between him. The only good scene where an old man has a heart attack on the stairs after his work.
