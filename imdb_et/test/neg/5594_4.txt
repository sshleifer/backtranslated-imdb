First of all, what was the first thing I ended up with after this movie was "Why 8MM 2?" Because I saw the first one and what was it about the first film plot? The only thing that was similar was that the couple had to go to the porn industry and it wasn't even needed on the plot because after you see the end I don't break it just didn't make sense <br /> <br /> Diplomat and her fianc√©e is in Hungary and note a woman who is naked in the pool area, she is very attractive, so when they see her in the club, they decide a little fun and you have a steamy threesome. But things become extremely intense when the diplomat sends them pictures of anyone who has a thing, fears that it may go public and endanger his career, pay the boy who sent the picture, the diplomat freaks and "kills" the boy, leading the murder case. She and her husband decide to find a girl with whom they had a thing, but things become deeper and darker when they go beyond what they got. <br /> <br /> What could have been a decent thriller, turned into an inexplicable and not thoughtful film that was sad. As I said, the title is not really the first connection, so don't let it do. It's just a sexual thriller that doesn't make any sense, but it's only good for those nights because, frankly, it's one of those movies that is so close to porn that it can be labeled with a soft core. <br /> <br /> 4/10
