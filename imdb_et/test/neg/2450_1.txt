I noted in the box "contains a spoiler" when I say something that is a spoiler, and does not understand that I have said it until I read it again after posting it. So that's just in case. <br /> <br /> Anyway, back to review this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie skymoviesel earlier this afternoon and with the description Sky gives you (these people have to be acidic), it sounded pretty good, but when I got it about 30 minutes, I was shocked. This movie is, in my opinion, the worst manuscript and actors / actors - ever. A young girl who falls in love with a L.A boy after about 3 hours is really a stupid, flat character with a tedious, plywood-like voice and hair. -.-. Then she is a lover who is an idiot and is also very plywood. In fact, they fit with each other. Then the boy's mother, who is on vacation with her and surprise, surprise - she is a doctor and - oh my god, wait, there are no doubt surprises! The island suddenly has a virus and knows all about viruses! = O. SHOCK HORROR! Yeah, of course. Lol. Then this crazy religious boy who continues "erbs" or something, and how the Lord knows all. All the people on the island love him, but in fact he is stubborn, arrogant, steroid-pumped (you really have to watch this movie just for the scene where he leaves the sea after swimming, his head is small and his body is MASSIVE, it's fun) who have had too much to drink. <br /> <br /> Anyway, after all these strange signs, including a rocket rider, a religious boy finally gives a doctor and he takes a blood sample and gets a direct job of finding this treatment because he has been dramatically rescued for some reason, all " erbs and God ". AND OH GOD. YES, THERE ARE OTHER Surprise! You may never be sure what! Just in history, 11 minutes before all the people on the island actually die, including his son and his girl, he finds a cure and injects everything, and that's all solved !!! What a pathetic movie. I thought I knew it would sound obviously the end of the first time I started to watch it, but I actually would be good and some sub-blocks are somewhere, but not, it was just boring and dry. /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. You arrive like me - stunned for 3 hours and then demanded an hour and a half that spent your life watching it back.
