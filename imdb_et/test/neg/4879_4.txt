This is a really mediocre film "Buckaroo Banzai" in the vein. The cast runs like "Mad Max" and they share the fun they don't want to share with the audience. Wheeler-Nicholson is one of those guilty entertainers who are happy to be in the movies, but he's not worth the rent. Space Maggot starts fire and burns 4 voices.
