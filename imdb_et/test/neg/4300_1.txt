Wow. They told me it was bad, but I had no idea. <br /> <br /> We have started a tradition. We found one copy of this movie and we're just transmitting it from person to person. Anyone with a film will look at it and then pass it on to someone else who is considered to be a unique, creative and dreadful movie. Hopefully it will travel a few times around the world. <br /> <br /> It's painful. Really hurt. It's so bad that it's funny. Well, okay, sometimes it's so bad it's funny. But for the most part it gives you the feeling that something is inside your brain to suck. <br /> <br /> Wow. Look at it, then forward it.
