This whole movie is just so terrible that it's a complete mess. The story is just so stupid that I can't believe someone actually sat down and wrote about it and thought it was a good movie! Action is most likely the worst of any b-movie made. I've seen a lot of sci-fi-type b movies and some of them are really pretty, some of them similar to Venus - they should never be done. <br /> <br /> Some filmmakers think that just because they put something together and somehow got the filmmaker on the shelves that they have achieved something - that it is good and people should watch it. This is not always true and certainly not true for Venus. This movie loses all accounts: terrible action, stupid sample, very weak special effects, tougher costumes, non-realistic dialogue, bad direction, etc. You can just say that this movie only took about $ 20. there's too much credit! I urge you to stay away from the train car movie for your benefit!
