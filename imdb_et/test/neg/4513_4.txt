As Frank Frank is committed, I remember being so excited that the game was made for television again. This means that as long as I saw it ... This film is a great example of how the role and leadership play such an important role in creating a sense of purpose. CENTRAL's role in CRUCIAL is that this type of production ... shows that AUNTIE MAME and MAN OF LA MANCHA are totally dependent on the charisma of the leading actor. And this film is being destroyed in the leading role of Melissa Gilbert. There is no one-off that Mrs Gilbert is even approaching settling down with an Anne-sensitive, mature spirit. Gilbert is "white bread" ... throughout the film ... the only time I was close to tears was reading the most strange line at the time of reading: "I'm still convinced that people are really good in the heart," says Gilbert so in haste, so he was not convinced that he could have broke well and had the same effect. The film and dance legend Marge Champion was a coach for this production - she would have to pay back her salary! Despite Mrs. Gilbert, who destroyed the DIARY, other performances satisfy most of the special praise to Joan Plowright as Edith, Scott Jacoby as Peter and Clive Reville as Mr. Dussell. Maxmillian Schell has no deep-seated soul and spirit, such as Otto, as well as the role of director on stage and film (Joseph Schildkraut), but he's fine. Doris Roberts and James Coco, like Van Danns, are relatively superficial in their parts - they are delicate and bombs, but again on the surface. This may be due to the fact that the pace of the project has been too hasty (as noted in previous posts) - this movie clock is 45 minutes shorter than the movie version - the difference due to the dramatic effects of breaks that probably need to be distributed for the appropriate MOOD story. This is not compulsory viewing, especially for young people who learn Anne Frank for the first time on their original film version and / or even better, for ANNE FRANK's TV production: TRUE STORY, which plays with Ben Kingsley, the closest thing to recording Anni's heartbreak and reality ! Note: Especially terrible is the fact that Melora Marshall, who plays Anne's sister Margot, is not included in the opening certificates with all the other members of The Secret Annex ... she is on postcards with Miep players and Mr. Kraler. If I were Marshall, I would be GREAT!
