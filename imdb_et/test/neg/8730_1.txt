I sat through it on television, hoping for the names it deserves ... but dear Gussie, who thought this script was worth producing? The basic idea is great, but filling is terribly bad, with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes, the end that is almost ridiculously melodramatic and poor Rock Hudson, passing through it in a reasonably confused face. Looks like a bad B movie in the 40's ...
