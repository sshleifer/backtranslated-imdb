It was the first film banned in the USSR Hollywood action style. It's not even near Hollywood movies of that time. The plot is childish, the pointing is so. This movie was successful because it was the first of its kind in Russia. Although I looked at it several times, I have to admit that it was naive and I didn't like it. This is not the best example of the Russian action film. It's just the first experience.
