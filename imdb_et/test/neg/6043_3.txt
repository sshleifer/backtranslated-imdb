OK, we have 4 city electricians who find the mini-nucleus reactor, turn it on and fall into a parallel universe where the giant spider queen also lives in a parallel universe that was able to switch to some of her relatives to take over the land, but unfortunately she is the only one left? If so, why not join the rest of humanity and hunt for it. Also, what happened to the military couldn't somehow beat a few billion plus rounds and why hide in the basement when much more defensive places were needed. Not to complain to the city staff, but how do they know what the mini-nucleus reactor looked like and how if they didn't have a parallel universe, could they reopen the reef? Sorry, but there was nothing pleasant about the movie
