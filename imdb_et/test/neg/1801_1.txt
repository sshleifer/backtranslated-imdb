The Joseph Conrad novel, Heart of Darkness, was a vivid sense of description that made this book amazing. When I read this book, I had all the scenes that were pulled out of my head and I knew how each character looked. This book had many pieces and when I finished reading this book, it seemed that the puzzle was finished. After I finished reading Dark of Darkness, I watched a movie that was a mistake. The film cuts out so many important parts. For example, in the novel, Marlow, for a very long time, these rivets came to fix her boat. It was a great source of nullity. In the film, this part just went out. The film added more parts that were useless and pointless. For example, when Kurtz spoke to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz grabbed the monkey's neck and killed. What was the purpose of this scene, except to make the audience attractive? It would be like a script writer did not even read the entire book and just put the parts he read in the movie. If I hadn't read the novel before I watched the film, I would have been confused. The book was amazing and it is really classic in American literature, but the film could have been shamefully put on the worst picture in the Razzie Awards.
