Such a film puts me in the work of professional actors. I think filmmakers are generally too harsh for professional actors and are willing to support them for the least reason. Just take a few minutes to "Cheerlader massacre" and trust me, you can change your views. Razzie would be a compliment to almost non-talented participants. But then again, this is Jim Wynorsk's film. Wynorski is a popular leader in these very low budget B movies (worked with Roger Corman in many cases). The problem with this movie is that it is actually trying to develop a plot. And if you have such characters as the actors, they read the letters on the map, how should I care? Wynorski's "Bare Wench 2" didn't try to develop the plot. He just tried to make a soft pornophob on "Blair's Witchcraft". It was fun and was great. "Cheerleader Masscare" is not fun. There are a couple of mandatory female scenes, but they are a little and far away. So it's not even worth the erotic level. I have to say that the worst scene is where Nikki Fritz walks across a bridge that starts to collapse. First of all, his character did not have to walk on the bridge. Secondly, when the bridge starts to pass, instead of trying its best to overcome it, it simply stays there and acts helplessly. And on the top, we don't really see the bridge collapse, because the filmmakers made this $ 2 budget !!! Unlike many B-horror movies, it's actually boring. And that makes it the worst of the worst movies. One of the few bright spots was Lunk Johnson, who is probably the most natural actor of the film (though certainly not more than half-decent). He was a funny "Bare Wench 2" and he also had funny scenes in this movie.
