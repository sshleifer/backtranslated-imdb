I looked at it on Italian television as a boy and I remember that he loved it - with a view to mixing live activities with animation; but at the same time it was universally erected ... and after that I have to admit that the critics were right! <br /> <br /> What needs to be wonderful for a child's eyes is actually very badly done, not to mention the fantasy adventure of being boring; deadly, both stars (former '' Angry Young Man 'Richard Harris') and the director (action expert wolf) are not against the material! At least Michel Legrand's score (by the writer Don Black) is usable - if not inspired exactly. By the way, British-Belgian co-producers include several famous persons (Julian Glover, Bessie Love, Murray Melvin, Robert Rietty, Vladek Sheybal, Graham Stark and his latest film), Michael Bates. <br /> <br /> Although Jonathan Swift's classical novel (the giant Gulliver becomes the main feature of war between two small neighbors in the country, and in the event of escaping the giants of real giants) comes here, this is done at the strictly kiddie level (stereotypical signs though) , fortunately, a little comic / romantic invasion) - which makes the whole company somewhat meaningless, beyond its intrinsically experimental nature, as Max and Dave Fleischer had already made a great full-length copy of the book in 1939!
