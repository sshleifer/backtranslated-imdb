OK - to say that some California colleges have a film class. And some dudes were only recorded for filming girls and they gave them a camera. And then they were drunk / stoned / or simply with a fool to actually use the camera, and they turned to their grade. AND RESPONSIBLE. <br /> <br /> This is my only explanation. Good God, they left a date and time counter during that time. The picture started on a new scene before the sound and forgot the plot. Obviously there was one and they had to talk about it when the 3-hour introductory sequence was over. But I'm glad they did it because I would never have looked at it. <br /> <br /> Stop it.
