It would be unbelievable that someone could have imagined it unnecessarily and then get it. The fact that it is actually on TV and advertisers' PAYING is related to the service is that it is outrageous. This belly fight for child programming is almost too vile to comment. I've burnt - yes burned - all the Barney tapes that people gave to my son. Finding this terrible programming in my library was an unpleasant surprise. And where, tell me where they get these mystery actors? Ask your parents to make sense? These children start taking drugs before they are teenagers. Geez. The last insult is that I have to add this extra line to the review to get it into IMDb.
