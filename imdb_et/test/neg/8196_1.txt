One night on an independent channel that was part of a wall-mounted movie show, it was a monster. Although tempted to turn it off, we looked at this bitter end, hoping to see some redemption value. Unfortunately, there was none. Absolutely nothing. The quality of the movie was cheap; the soundtrack was muddy; editing was ridiculous. Then there was little rescue work. After a few minutes of the nature of Cameron Mitchell's doctor talking about his patient, the viewer is tortured with no plot, miserable writing, abysmally terrible action, and total lack of cohesion and continuity. The rotten cherry on this messy mess was the most amazing "special effects" and "makeup" to even shame the screen even on television. The main character stumbles through his role in a dynamic rubber mask and a pair of dishwasher gloves that seem to be stuck in rolls and rolls. Perhaps the coverage of bad lighting and gag-worthy film quality was trying as the makeup was tenth. One can only hope that at least one deliberate decision was made during this hopelessly amateur video. Seriously, some three-year-olds could have done a better project. At the end, poor Mr Mitchell returns (if he desperately needs to pay for the money!) And comforts some of the nonsense that should link this pike to the AIDS epidemic. Please save you and your loved ones from this inhuman cruelty. It was so bad, even the Mystery Science Theater 3000 couldn't save it.
