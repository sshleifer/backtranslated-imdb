This movie was probably the biggest 2 hours of life. From opening 10 minutes I was ready to leave. The clich√©s there created you on the face and the plot was not only predictably stupid, but filled with more holes than Swiss cheese. I'm considering digging this lost for 2 hours and $ 6.25 with I'm now watching movie waste. The T-Rex must be so that they have moved in their graves.
