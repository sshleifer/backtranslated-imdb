I just stopped watching this movie and found a lot of time wasting little or no redeeming factors. I really do not understand where all the positive reviews came from - the animation is dirty and unrefined, the plot has no sense from an objective point of view, and there is no sense in what is trying to pass. as an intriguing and stopping movie. I've never read a book, so I can't tell if the film was faithful, but like most movie adaptations, it's trying to crash too much in the shortest possible time. The result is a sprawling and illogical story that doesn't let you really understand or deal with characters at all. All in all, I felt completely separate from the characters and the plot that I couldn't take care of what happened to them, and the only way I can see how this animation can be considered beautiful when your usual standard animation is the Scooby-Doo comic.
