Well, you know ... Rutger Hauer and Robert Patrick are both really good actors. But WTF with this movie? The story was flat and the script was just terrible. The poor participants didn't have the material to work! <br /> <br /> The DVD cover invited you to a flight crew flick. Waiting for something like Top Gun ... Huge disappointment! The action of this movie is so cheap that makes you dress up. Antenna scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other film sources that have not been made for this film. And they didn't even care about brands or fighter models, because the audience's self-evidentness doesn't notice it. <br /> <br /> As I said, it was flat. It would have been very interesting for the writer and the director to have a little effort. In a nutshell, B-film seems to have been made in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> I am very sorry for the actors who put their names here. They must definitely be ashamed.
