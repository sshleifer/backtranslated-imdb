"The evil spirit takes over the girl and spreads the panic in the Louvre Museum," all I think is a summary of the movie and the movie! What I think is one of the films ever made in French history in French or non-French films! <br /> <br /> Nothing is good here except for music (credit only!), some moments offered (Sophie Marceau), and of course the final of the movie. Not because it ends with what seemed to be countless years ago when we looked at CRAP as perfect as one magic CGI job that was too good to be true! <br /> <br /> By the way, I want to change the graph summary to be like this: "The bad spirit takes some movie artists over to making tough movies". Just like this for sure.
