Anna Christie (Greta Garbo) returns to her father Chris (George F Marion) in 15 years. He's the captain of the boat and he's staying with him. During this time he will meet Matt (Charles Bickford) and fall in love. Matt and Chris don't see the eye and Anna has a secret to admit ..................... <br /> <br /> What a boring story .. .... it starts badly with George F Marion and Marie Dressler, who play coffee in bars. The scene continues forever and they are both terrible. They are also difficult to understand. In fact, it's hard to understand the whole cast. I became part of the whole dialogue between Bickford, Marion and Garbo because it is incomprehensible! Garbo is obviously something special because he is drawn to him every time he is on the screen and his presence gives this film 4 stars that I have given him. But nothing really happens - it is a boring story with terrifying accents. You're doing well awake.
