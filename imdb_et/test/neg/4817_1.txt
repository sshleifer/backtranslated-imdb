Totally brain-dead maker in the Philippines. It belongs to the filipino film regime, which attempted to broadcast itself as American films on the international market. After a rather dull start, the film takes off and never disappears. In fact, this is the hanging of the worst films in Chuck Norris: The American prisoner in Vietnam has been temporarily washed by Soviets who implant a microchip in their brain, so it is programmed to kill the Pope, then the US president. One of his old friends (playing the B movie stalwart Max Thayer) is being sent to stop him. Totally ridiculous scenes, dirty action (Nick Nicholson's presentation as evil Soviet leader is a must-have!) And an incredible plot of one of the most exciting images ever given to the public.
