British television director Alan Gibson's "Dracula A.D. 1972" qualifies as one of the least applauding entries in the Hammer Studios series on Bram Stoker's immortal blood. It actually represented for the first time after Terence Fisher's memorable "Horror of Dracula" (1958), which Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing fought against each other as mortal enemies. A few years later, they changed the same roles in the final Hammer Dracula: "Dracula Satanic Rites". In addition, it was Hammer's last Dracula, where Lee appeared as a notorious fangster. For the record, "Dracula A.DD 1972" was the seventh Hammer Dracula. <br /> <br /> The 1872 exciting prologue prepares you for something other than what the rest of this frustrating horrendous crop yields. The eternal rivals Count Dracula and his nemesis Professor Lawrence Van Helsing are literally at each other's throats, located in London's Hyde Park for a runaway opening scene that makes everything else look relatively antimicrobial. The carriage runs together and Dracula appears on a half-wooden wheel with broken spokes attached to the chest. Of course, Christopher Lee must grab the gripped wheel of his body, but the pictures are striking enough to pass through the gathering. The count expires and its opponent Van Helsing. But one of Drakula's disciples is catching up with the county and hitting some vampire ashes to hold the vial. <br /> <br /> The Don Houghton scenario has been operating in London for a hundred years in 1972. meet a fragrant young man, Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame's No Blade of Grass), who loves to hell with the group, blasting parties and leading the British police with their opponents. Alucard is one of the descendants of Dracula's servants. Now Alucard has a count and his dehydrated blood. Alucard chooses the vision of a consecrated church to organize a black mass. She is inviting her trendy friends, including Laura (super sexy Carolina Munro, The Spy Who Loved Me), Gayner (Marsha Hunt), and Jessica Van Helsinki (Stephanie Beacham) to take part in this black mass because it offers them something else. Not surprisingly, they raise the count and the evil bleeding sets eyes on Jessica. Meanwhile, after discovering Laura's body from the blood, Murray, a Scottish yard inspector (Michael Coles, "Doctor Who and Dalkes") is asking for help from Van Helsing's modern successor Lorrimar (Peter Cushing). Dracula wants Van Helsinki to take revenge when she is her granddaughter as a bride. Lorrimar tracks down Alucard; They fight in their Chelsea apartment and the young vampires are drowning in the water. Remember that flowing water is as lethal for vampires as sunlight and crucifix. Van Helsing finds himself in Drakula's abandoned church, where his daughter is waiting for the count. Van Helsing and Dracula tangles. Van Helsing casts water on Dracula's face. The vampire gets into an open tomb, whose contribution is waiting for her and she breaks down again. <br /> <br /> The main problem with Dracula AD 1972 is that we don't get enough from Lee, even though we get much more Cushing than Van Helsinki. In addition, the scriptwriter Don Houghton keeps Drakula confined to the church and never lets the vampire go to the city. Despite its low budget, "Dracula A.DD 1972" would have been much better. The scene where modern Van Helsing has to sign Alucard and write it back to Dracula seems almost ridiculous. You would think he knew about this in reverse. If you are not afraid of horror movies, it will make you fun. Sometimes Gibson gives us an excellent close-up of Dracula, whose eyes are hidden, and it is about as scary as the cooler gets, and it doesn't speak much.
