Before the days of home video, Stan Laurel's pre-Hardy comedy "Kill or Cure" was known - as far as it was known - just because the film "Laurel and Hardy's Laughing" by Robert Youngson contained some sequences in the 20's. " Youngson knew what he was doing: the best giants "Kill or Cure" brought his compilation untouched, the remainder remaining on the floor of Youngson's Cutting Room only for a slightly funny comedy. <br /> <br /> Laurel is represented by a commercial traveler, the patent exchange was called by Professor IO Dine's Knox-All: this name is the funniest joke in this movie that doesn't say much. I must point out that this film dates back to 1923, a ban. While refusing, quite a few Americans bought pathological drugs when they had (ahem!) 'Medicinal properties, so - if Knox-Al contains alcohol - Stan's work in this film is less desperate than what he and Ollie were famous for' Big Business' selling Christmas trees in the summer. It's too bad for this movie that it's not nearly as funny as "Big Business". <br /> <br /> We see Stan (but don't listen to him in this silent movie) that gives you a frenzied sales talk to someone who seems to pay attention ... until we learn that they stand outside the deaf spirit, and that man is deaf. The naughty woman comes out of the gates: Stan tries to get his attention quickly, grabbing his fingers. Of course he is not deaf, and he asks him immediately with an umbrella. I found this sequence offensive, not because it involves deaf people (deaf people are not the butt of the joke), but because it violates the very common misconceptions among hearing people that they can communicate with the deaf, but simply with their fingers and making the Charades without mark the language with very difficult grammar without learning. <br /> <br /> It is even more fun that this movie spinster has a pet cannon called Rudolph (like Valentino), and there is trick photography that includes trick photography to allow a person to hide his body from a narrower object. I've seen this device on several cartoons and live-action movies, but "Kill or Cure" is, in my opinion, the earliest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Stan Laurel, an ever-appreciated actor, here is a bit of a physical business worthy of Chaplin or Keaton, where he transmits his emotions and changes in his behavior, walking away from the camera with his back. However, Laurel never became a first-rate comic until she joined Oliver Hardy to form the largest comedy team. 'Kill or Cure' barely determines 3 out of 10.
