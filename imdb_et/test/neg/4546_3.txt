I've all walked dead, but I think walking, dead dead is still certain. Unfortunately, cooling didn't help me think about it. It's really slow if nothing happens in the first 45 minutes, changing the "movie zoom" button several times. By the time the well-designed zombies appear, it is too late and the director (the two will be filmed) has no idea how to shoot them. Haggerty, Blair and Donahue all look tired / embarrassing / recovering in some way. I give the film credit because it precedes T2, which ends with freezing the dishes in liquid nitrogen. The Shriek Show DVD offers an extended promo track from the day that lasts 8 minutes and I would actually recommend that you look at the flick as a whole.
