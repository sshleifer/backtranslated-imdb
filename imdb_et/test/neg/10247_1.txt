This picture hit the screen of the movie on June 6, 1980, playing with Stephen Machti Sergeant Thorina, Captain Avery Schreiber Comelius Buttina, J.D. The picture starts with the infinite roaming room of the police, looking for criminals. There the ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown spacecraft. Entering Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz when they try to find out who belongs to an unknown ship. If they can't, they will call Captain Comelus, who will instruct his team to fight back. Enters into a fantastic Dorothy Stratton who plays the role of Galaxina, a man-made robot. Now some thought about this picture. This movie was stupid and this is one reason I can't get into Sci-Fi. Once you arrive at Sci-Fi, you would have noticed that laser sound effects were borrowed early from Sci-fi, called Battlestar Galactica, which appeared in theaters in 1978. Sci-fi movie, performed in 1966 with Star Trek. Now because I bought this movie, Dorothy Stratton. She is proud of her one piece. I think his talents were wasted in this picture and he should never have been involved in such rubbish. Connie Sellecca was also considered for this role and her talents would have been wasted. In the picture alone, I give this movie a nuance and Dorothy Stratton that I give her ten funny cards, although she doesn't deserve such a trash. If you like such pictures, you can get a DVD version of Amazon.com
