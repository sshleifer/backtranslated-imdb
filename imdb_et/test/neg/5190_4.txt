The film starts with the most intelligent joke and goes down there (pun). After that there is a lot of potty humor and a sexual situation. Beautiful women were the best part of the movie. The Swear-word Puns are not meant to be the centerpiece of the idea, but they try it out here. The struggle between two local city groups (richies and poories) is an old tried and true setup, so how would that be wrong? Well, there is no reason to envy the "riches" or any reason to know the poems, so we can forget the central plot. The humor of the situation is all a teenage toilet or sexual, but only garners grabs, no real stomach smiles. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves comedy for this movie is the humor of character, offering some rhythmic settings to the blind, and the owner of a black bar offering humor "street" or "hood". <br /> <br /> OK, forget the jokes, there must be some killer snowboarding because it was a business company. Unfortunately, there was only a 4 second back program that could be inspiring. The rest were all B-class tricks or worse. The great moment when the main character rides the "goat", the human-killer trail, gave one fiery, where a little avalanche eats a stuntman. That was the best thing about boarding this movie. Every serious snowboard fan is disappointed with the quality of the movie stunts. <br /> <br /> As far as the technical aspects of the film are concerned, the soundtrack was the average that surprises as these snowboard documentaries are regularly filled with high quality stories. You can edit a lot of mistakes, and even if the ski slope is hit, most "landscape" shots could not give you any real size feel. In general, it is worth looking at whether you have managed to turn your brain completely off and you like silicon breasts. Even then, you don't remember anything two days later. <br /> <br /> Snowboarding is still waiting for the final comedy, you would definitely want to watch a snowboard documentary.
