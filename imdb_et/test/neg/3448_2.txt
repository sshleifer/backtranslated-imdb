Two stars <br /> <br /> Amanda Plummer looks like her father's young version, Christopher Plummer pulling, staring in this movie with Robert Forster - who really should have put a little shoe on this rock ... <br /> <br /> I've never seen Amanda Plummer with a good movie. He plays these slightly nervous characters in movies that aren't quite built up, and he does it again. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have two young women, nurses who are not like the smallest ones who are asking themselves to be questioned along the way. <br /> <br /> Amanda's character Sandra has at least a good reason to let Dr Jake (Robert Forster) pull him up. He has looked out of the track and his car has been pretty much destroyed. <br /> <br /> Warning - Front Spoilers! <br /> <br /> However, when we pass, we realize that Dr. Jake is no longer playing on the deck when Amanda is. He makes all the decisions on the flip of the coin. <br /> <br /> When Dr. Jake and Amanda reach the motel, we only see a maniac car and what Amanda does, but enters a carriage at his station and begins to beat. What his motive was to do is never clear, because the man is probably dangerous and may try to kill him. One might think that the last thing he does is put himself in such an uncertain situation. <br /> <br /> He not only strikes, but finds money and takes it. <br /> <br /> Soon after, we will have a number of things that will not add up. <br /> <br /> Dr Jake, with his passenger Amanda, comes out of the gas and two of them give up their car and start walking. It may be thought that crossing the desert would have checked its gas meter - it seems very unlikely that it would allow it. Later he is seen driving the same car. When did he or she take the car back? <br /> <br /> Dr. Jake tells Amanda she knows she has taken the money. Now how would he know that? He didn't see him as far as I knew, and he didn't tell him he did. <br /> <br /> Then we have the symbol of Santini (David Thewlis), the man who was driving the wagon, give them two lifts and I will serve if he does not know that Amanda also took the money. How did he know that? <br /> <br /> It loses credibility at the worrying speed we're going to go on. <br /> <br /> When Alice, Amanda's sister (Fairuza Balk) gets into killer clutches and decides to throw her coin of fate - I think she would be very careful that the coin she exchanges for the trick would be a trick coin - but this is probably not the case. <br /> <br /> It will destroy any credibility that this film may have.
