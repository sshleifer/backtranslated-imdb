I am relieving that later reviews have become sour - I read all the positive feedback, I began to worry that my understanding of movies (and life) was completely different from any other in the world. Everything in this movie called me wrong ... characters, dialogue, manipulative soundtrack, hard story, all that. When opening each scene, I thought, "People don't act like that." It is a relentless heavy hand and maudlin. In some ways, I think the film is tempting you, or pretending to like it, because it's serious and about real people and is facing problems. But the man, it really didn't work for me.
