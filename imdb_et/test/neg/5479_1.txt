It could have been the best game ever! But game makers just screwed after 3 murders and end! This is a combination of Persian Prince, Hit Man, GTA and Age Of Empires II (Saladin). <br /> <br /> Yes, these four games mentioned above are considered to be one of the biggest games ever made. br /> <br /> You combine these four and get this game !! It has all four aspects, such as acrobatic skills, stealth murders, open world and HISTORY! In the first three killings you will feel the biggest game !! But after the third, things seem so repetitive that we hope GAME has come to an end. <br /> <br /> I have played it on a computer and the computer version has terrible errors and stupid missions. is pointless. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone. It's a good game, but take it for XBOX360 or PS3. Don't get it on your computer. <br /> <br /> Finally, this game came from a Persian prince. Certainly the manufacturer is hot, but the game is not hot and it is no better than the four above mentioned games!
