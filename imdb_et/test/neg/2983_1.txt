It was undoubtedly the WORST movie I ever see, but when I started, it was just like a bad car wreck on the side of the road - you can't help yourself, you just have to look. My eyes !!! Operation was terrible, production was terrible, filming was terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible. I was delighted that the priest had been cut, he would have loved that he would have done himself because of his own POOR. I mean suck to act for the tenth power. I would have been delighted if Chris had changed a lot of them before the TV. And what was that hell about hell?! I sincerely hope that no one will be paid, I think if they are paid, they will have to be paid to never try another movie project again. It was just a big garbage that I was embarrassed to say I just had to look up to the end. Don't look at it, it's about an hour and a half of your life, which you never come back to, and then you have to spend time registering on this website so you can write a comment as I am doing, what you need to do as a catharsis to survive watching a movie (and I use the word "film" loosely here).
