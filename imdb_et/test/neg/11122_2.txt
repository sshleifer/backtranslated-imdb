Well, the Sci-Fi channel keeps these turkeys down ... and they look worse every time. As usual, good actors, such as John Rhys-Davies and Giancarlo Esposi, can entertain as amateurs, you can imagine what is exhausting, wasting your time wasting. The only semi-decent thing is the creature's rubber equipment (blinking in such fast blinkers that you don't really have time to see how fake it really is). Dialogue ... plot ... when this "movie" (and I use this concept loosely) was food, then Jack-In-The-Box would be a gourmet food compared to it.
