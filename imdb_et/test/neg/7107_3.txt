The movie is very fast moving, odd and colorful, it's like Mad Max at speeds with tons of colors and makeup. Also very cartoonish, as said; here and there appears a drawing order. The plot is also very funny, but I believe it is too. What really makes me crazy about this movie is the characters, they are painfully irritating, especially Rebecca, played by Lori Petty, she is really annoying (I believe she is the most irritating creature I've ever seen). Editing is also annoying, very MTV stylized. Another thing missing from Tank Girl is an exciting adventure. Nor is humor funny. However, it has some nice visuals. <br /> <br /> But many people love this movie, most of them are women and it's not at all strange because this movie is about girls' power. is a real chick flick and the best example of a movie of anger / love.
