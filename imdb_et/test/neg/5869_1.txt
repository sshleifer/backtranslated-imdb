After reading the other comments on this site, we weren't sure we could criticize this movie because it didn't seem bad enough. But 2 minutes of the movie we knew we were for another flop. No summer is without ice cream, but this film served as a melted, sour, crushed ice cream cone (you know, one that leaves you sticky and dirty and looks for a wet sun). The biggest problem with this movie was the plot. What was that? It seemed to be a psychotic ice cream man who traveled around the neighborhood. That's it. Nothing else happens. First of all, what are the qualifications of an ice cream man in this mess city? 1. Spend several years in a ridiculous mental hospital known to man. This hospital suffered clowns, graffiti, counterfeit plastic sunflowers and oversized syringes. 2. Have a very bad hygiene and face to scare the kids away. 3. Make sure your truck is equipped with separated body parts, roaches, and don't forget the eye whites! <br /> <br /> The participants in this movie are pure B-Movie caliber. Unlike the unknown bunches, who's besides Macaulay Culkin's trailer trash! Even her bratty charm doesn't save it from kick pants. There was no murder or no reason in this film. The whole concept of the movie reeked! Who would kill an ice cream man while driving? Gangsters? Fiends? Vanna White? Who? We are still fighting this issue. <br /> <br /> Who was responsible for the wardrobe of this movie, he should immediately wear a blacklist of Hollywood. Did they honestly think that a pillow under a child's shirt would make the audience believe it was really greasy? Did they forget their hands, face, feet and all other body parts? Secondly, this film was made in 1995, but the wardrobe seemed to have been chosen from the flat 80's, which is proved by the brother's white, high-heeled horse tops. <br /> <br /> When we were looking at this shotty production, we've both developed serious ADD cases. We found that we were leaving room to walk without purpose. At many points, this film is found to be T.V. watching the empty wall behind the set was more interesting than the actual film. We were stunned that this movie didn't reach 100 in the bottom. Later we took the tape out of the videotape and left it on the black to melt like a regular ice cream cone.
