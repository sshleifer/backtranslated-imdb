This is a family movie that was broadcast at my local ITV station at 1.00 a couple of nights ago. It may be a strange decision by planners, but REAL HOWARD SPITZ is a rather strange film that is strange because it doesn't want to disturb its audience. Come on, there's no kids who are more than sadism and that's why Roald Dahl was so popular with children. It also explains why DOCTOR WHO was such a successful exhibition worldwide. In this scenario, you will just die for a cellulose fictionist to make the children feel nasty, but that will not happen. I'm not advocating child abuse, but seeing how Howard Spitz would lose his clothes for babies would have made the film better. Can you imagine how much the KINDERGARTEN COP would have been worse if manufacturers had gone all the computers? I mean, if you make a movie that focuses on a child's author who hates children, shouldn't the story show or say? <br /> <br /> A big part of the problem is with driver Vadim Jean and you feel he does not know how to handle the material that is bad news in the movie. As someone said earlier, the soundtrack is random and Kelsey's grammar is very wooden. I think she was trying to play it in a dead pan as it shows she is famous, but it doesn't work here and there are many scenes with quiet ridiculous corners of the camera that seem involuntary but very disturbing. But at the end of the day, the main problem is that the potential is lost because nobody wanted to listen to the feelings of the viewers
