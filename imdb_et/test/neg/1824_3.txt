Lana Turner (Fredda Barlo), who plays beautiful lips in a beautiful Italy, meets with older singers and prince Ezio Pinzaga (Mr. Imperium). Two in love, enjoying a real Italian countryside. Sadly, Mr Pinza is summoned to his royal father's death bed, leaving Lana in horror. Twelve years later, pr. Turner is an Los Angeles actress who starts filming to fall in love with the king. Turner is romanticized by co-star Barry Sullivan, who wants to marry him - then does King Pinza re-enter his life? <br /> <br /> "Mr. Imperium" offers a tired story about the sex symbol Turner and the debut bass singer Pinza, who appeared for several decades with the New York Metropolitan Opera. Pinza probably earned his MGM career after appearing in "Pacific South" (1949) with a tremendously successful performance. The cast album and Pinza's golden "Some Enchanted Evening" single sold millions. Supporting wheels Marjorie Main, Cedric Hardwicke, and Debbie Reynolds make the film even more wasteful. <br /> <br /> Mr. Imperium (1951) Don Hartman ~ Lana Turner, Ezio Pinza, Barry Sullivan
