Thunderball and Never have two of the biggest box offices and never a surprise to the Empire Strikes Back hero Irvin Kershner. Klaus Maria Brandauer seems to steal the show when Bond's mission turns more of a Hollywood romp in the midst of a revealing plot (sometime around when Basinger arrives). But Klaus Kinski? I still think that casting Largo does, or, as is apparent from both films, breaks the story. The worst thing is the attempt to spread aging and the very hairy Connery as a sex symbol he actually was in the 1960s. The 80s were mainly a slip of bonds, but only your eyes are a great title. Sometimes, when I have to spend some time during the holidays, watching this movie often at Bond's re-launched festivals, I think the best attribute of the film is its score and I'm not going to be soft. 80s jazz.
