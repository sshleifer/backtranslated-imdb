Michael Caine's vehicle. It's pretty well written and there's some OK, but really, it's crap - not funny enough, not scary enough. It is an unpleasant modern cocktail thriller. <br /> <br /> I like the premise that even in the broken moral rear of East London, people do things for the right reasons. The surprise result of the first struggle for Caine's old school Billy Shiner has promoted inflammation in her paranoia. In the second half of the movie, he is behind the shelters to deal with the first disappointment. <br /> <br /> My biggest disappointment was the inability of director John Irvin to make more of Shiner and his Lieutenant relationship. / Filial substitute Frank Harper. British Tom Sizemore understands Harper's role well, while people around him have ignored it. Damage. 4/10
