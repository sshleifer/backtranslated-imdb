Terrible scam: a controversial movie, Teddy's winner in Berlin in 2003, Mil nubes de paz turned out to be a fiasco. Actors are all talking (well, they're not exactly actors); the film tried to be a great bet, but it gets into a dubious bet: it remains the superficiality of the two calls and the boy whose lover is lost; it has no purpose: nothing to do with the homosexuality presented in other films (eg before Night Falls (2000), Julian Schnabel). Technically, the only thing is photography; otherwise, the camera will be placed in a strange corner (to make it "cinematic") and the whole film will work in a black and white atmosphere. The film is so terrible that it disturbs. I mean, it's good to be pretentious if you have the talent to support it. Or maybe it's an art-cinema that it's incomprehensible. The story flows slowly, slowly, slowly. For me more form than the essence. Great Edition? That was good. Great direction? Don't think so: the film is weak. It was an interesting project. Shame. This is a mistake. One star out of four.
