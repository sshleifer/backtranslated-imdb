The movie was over half before I realized what was going on. It's a dog's breakfast movie about four families of thanksgiving dinner. Clich√©s and stereotypes fall apart. If all this is over ten hours later, it seems like it's ten hours - you're puzzling about what it was. I don't want to see a movie dinner table. That's enough in my family. The turkeys seemed pretty good. The rest gave me indigestion.
