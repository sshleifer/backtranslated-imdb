I don't really know why so many people love this movie: maybe it's funny, OK, but it has completely destroyed one of the best novels. As the author himself said, this film has betrayed the book: not only is the story really cut to about 1/3, but all the symbols, all the complexity, everything is lost to children with a very 80-year fantasy / adventure movie. Today we have influence, directors, new book attention: I hope someone (Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayao Miyazaki ...) will one day lead the REAL Neverending story. A great dead writer, a great book and many lovers of literature deserve it.
