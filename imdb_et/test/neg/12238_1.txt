If it had been Jack Black's leading actor, I immediately stayed away from this movie. In fact, he makes some movies good than this movie. This movie should be filmed as a 3 to 8-year-old comic and it would have been much better. It is nothing more than the stupid skittles of other films that are put together to make one big mess. The film looks like it was beaten in about a day without thinking at all. There are a few times where it seems that perhaps the turning point is a film, or the film actually has a plot or at least a story, but the sculptures you enter will destroy the whole movie.
