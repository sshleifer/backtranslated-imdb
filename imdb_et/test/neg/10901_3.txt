Young couple on the road looking at their business and having random sex in their car during the daylight. But suddenly they are threatened and terrorized in an old and rusty truck. Where have I ever seen this assumption? Oh yes, now I remember we've seen it once and about nine hundred and ninety-nine in other cases were much better than "Rest Stop"! This weak and terrible new film even insults the intellect of the weakest horror fans, because it does not contain one original twist or memorable trick. It is very sadistic and disgusting, but every teekill-slasher is now sadistic and nasty so it is no longer a real surprise. The absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large number of holes in the noisy plot and meaningless areas. Writer / director John Shiban is well aware that ultra-thin main features were not nearly enough to fill the entire film, so he fills his movie like a Thanksgiving turkey with a weird and pointless cushioning material. Nicole's boyfriend disappears in abandoned and dirty rest spots in California. Slaying his character immediately would not lead to a very long film, so he will later meet a motor vehicle family with vision (?), Where he talks to the previous victims of the kidnapped killer and has deep emotional (and boring) conversations with a police officer who simply does not die, though Truck ran over him twice! The dark sub-lines never move anywhere and they are certainly the most pathetic and desperate attempts to stretch the length of the film I've ever seen. Instead of all the nonsense pads, Shiban should have paid more attention to tension building and make her control marks a little more enjoyable. Jaimie Alexander's character Nicole is a tedious and pointless girl and you don't care whether she is living in an ordeal or not. His boyfriend Jesse and the policeman are both losers, and their cruel death was still not painful enough when you ask me. I read exactly three sequences, including torture and free distortion, that were nice and exciting enough to bring a sadistic smile to my face. It's still too little for today's horror movie. Basically, "Rest Stop" is simply an unhappy attempt to get into the success of films like "Wolf Creek" and "Hostel", but looking better at the originals. This was the first film of the new Raw Feed movie. They promote themselves under a new name with great fear, but they have to come up with something much better than "Rest Stop" if they want us to believe it.
