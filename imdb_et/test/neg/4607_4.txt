Excellent cast, who does his best with a terrible script, inertial direction and some of the worst scores I've ever heard. More weeks of TV movie than serious drama. What's sad when you think the source material is very serious and very real. The filmmakers decided that instead of building drama and character, it was better to show the most graphic and violent bits and hope that the audience would be shocked by compassion and care. In my opinion, one of the sharpest forms of customizing the film is.
