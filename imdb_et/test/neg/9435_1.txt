From the beginning of this movie it is easy to say exactly what will happen and who will die. It's about 4 women and a man on vacation. It was done in the late seventies of the ultra-Nazis, when blonde women were allegedly ultra-American survivors and the brunettes were all worthy of death. <br /> <br /> This movie, like other people of this age, refers to it and the viewer knows it. There is no secret or intercourse. People despise, but everything is so predictable with time prejudices, it's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Five people get into two wild young characters and go with nuts. Everyone is nuts, so the director-writer team can justify their Nazi propaganda. <br /> <br /> For some reason, this guy has attracted a blonde who doesn't really look much and ignores the super hot looking brunette so all heterosexual men go over. It should be remembered that in the 1970s, the films were meant for women and not for men. <br /> <br /> Totally nasty and completely frustrating.
