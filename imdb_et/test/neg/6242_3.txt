Now I know why this movie can be bought so cheaply in video stores. I was curious because he had three more big names, one of the B-movies that the video probably can't even give away! The answer is that it is a film that attracts a very limited audience: over 50 crowds with very liberal feelings. <br /> <br /> Who else looks at Robert Redford, Willem Dafoe and Helen Mirren, the main message that "cheating on your wife is fine as long as you still love her." It's a nice "feel-good message" here, especially at the end of this strange robbery story. Who wrote this script ..... Bill Clinton? <br /> <br /> I say "strange" because the kidnapper is the most beautiful kid (Dafoe) you've ever seen, except at the end. He often connects his hostage (Redford), which no kidnapper would be threatened with, has casual conversations in family matters, and so on. It's all ridiculous! Well, L.A Times says it's an "intelligent thriller." Ha ha. Well, this confirms what most people know about L.A Times. For those who believe it and have not seen it, I will not hurt it with the giant holes in this story, especially at the end. The fact is that it is an insult to anyone with intelligence. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you can't fool all people because critics have not yet understood. Here's another movie they're saying that they were bombed right in the box and in the video store.
