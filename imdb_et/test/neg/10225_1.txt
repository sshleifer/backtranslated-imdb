Take clich√©s and add Steve Guttenberg. It's really as bad as you would expect. Sheriff Tom Palmer (Guttenberg) and Anna Montgormery are trying to make a futile, intuitive, winning football team. The lack of originality and direction is quite difficult to preserve any form of this film. Despite my reservations about Guttenbergs' ability to act, I can definitely say that the coach of rival teams is actually worse than Guttenberg. This type of story of subjugation that is fighting the top of the road has been done before and better than this "movie"
