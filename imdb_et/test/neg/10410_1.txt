Are you kidding? Music at this show was SO LOUD, which was often not even heard in the dialogue. And the music wasn't great. Does anyone know what Jake's mother said when she walked in the door? And the fungus cloud seemed quite close to so little immediate destruction. Anyone who explores the effects of nuclear waste before it is written. I felt that a lot of sit com players were sent in and didn't know what to do with a dramatic dialogue. And what does Kansas do know about Soho's purchases .... wouldn't we have a better line? Tears missed and woke up with confused loud music.
