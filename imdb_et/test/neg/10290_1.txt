I'm not sure who suggested monitoring for me, but I think I have an idea: one of "Fat Guys Movies." The person said they were amazed at how big it was and said it was one of the goriest / troublesome movies. (I paraphrase and do it only through memory, so forgive me if I was wrong.) In any case, I decided to look at it. So I blame my misrepresentation by looking at one of the most terrible, predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen. Strangely, I doubt I've ever called the movie "stupid", but it was the first word that came to mind about one-third and I thought it was the end. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Unbelievable assumption and reactions, incredibly brain-dead characters (can blame writing or actors, or I blame both) and immensely bad behavior. I formerly believe as Bill Pullman's US president as an FBI agent. (Of course there is a reason for this and I am going to do it partly.) And if I can't imagine the shocking "twisting" in the first 5 minutes, then you have to come to the theater late or come to the room to see it late. Don't worry, they talk to you every five minutes about "twisting". <br /> <br /> In a picturesque city or the most depressing city in the world, some successive killers have emerged. But the story is even more! Some dumbasses and corrupt policemen want to blow the tires out for their entertainment. Could there be more? Oh, yes, there is a family, maybe not, but there are four people, one boy, one girl and an adult couple. The girl says she sees things much less with conviction than Cole sees dead people in the sixth sense. It must be more than I mentioned! This makes the movie interesting! Adding as many sub-blocks that may / may not have been developed is the way to go! Okay, so I'll continue. We have the silly FBI agents that made me laugh. A couple of giggling drugs who are first shocked by their dealer's OD, but then robbing. A Gosh-productive grandmaster cop who must be a comic relief who always fights angry / suspicious policeman. And finally, (poor, poor) Michael Ironside, who didn't call his speech, barely bothered him. <br /> <br /> None of these works. They all talk about the various tensions or setbacks of presence and believe me, you lose all the feeling of care after the first many sub-blocks. In addition, the reaction from some of these characters is the most shocking. I think I mainly refer to the police, but mostly the girl who lost her family and barely flashes. <br /> <br /> This stupid, stupid movie smells. It is barely pleasing to suggest it, unless its exposure is limited to Goosebumps Northwest. And what's the title? Supervision? Oh, I get it; this is because it was used on 1/50 subfields only for film interviews. Because it's so casual, it's also called COP CAR, BULLET, or COFFEE. Just stay away from this terrible mess.
