I waited a lot for Mr. Amitabh Bachan on the role of SARKAR, but I'm disappointed. Being the direction of Ram Gopal Verma, I wasn't ready for such a movie. Sarkar should have a strong character, but the film shows that Amitabh is too dependent on the power of others, not on her. Tamil is a film Nayakan based on GOD FATHER and Kamala Hassan has taken the lead. The film is well directed and the power remains to Kamala Hassan, not to his son. Amitabh Bachan seems to be too helpless in the film, and she just takes it all in place. The film does not show the strong influence of God the Father.
