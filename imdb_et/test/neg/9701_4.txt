Let me start by saying that I adore the book and loved the A&E minisums. I was hoping to love this movie and I was absolutely ready to allow him a moderate artistic license to interpret and shorten the real story. But this film is not like the original book. If only "the names were changed to protect the innocent", I would have just enjoyed the movie, as just an inaccurate, periodic piece. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the name "Mr Darcy" was put on the label that is emotional and weak, giving "Elizabeth Bennett" a hoyden, nervous, often tearful, who doesn't care about the rules of society, and "Mr. Bingley" a wide-eyed slip of the completely destroyed idea that the director had ever read Jane Austen's original story. <br /> <br /> There are some real moments in this movie - maybe 10 minutes are really great. Charlotte's explanation of why he accepted Mr Collins' proposal begins beautifully. She is 27 years old (hopeless spinster age), she is becoming a burden on her family and she is not romantic. He just wants a "comfortable home". But the beautiful dialogue is spoiled when it bluffs: "Don't you understand me, Elizabeth. Wouldn't you dare to meet me!" and tears are running. Later, you see Charlotte's kowtow at Lady Catherine de Bourgh, which was not as described in her book. Another good moment is when Darcy catches Elizabeth in her home when she is traveling around the dance and uncle. It was well done in the A & E series, but the film version of Keira Knightley made the audience feel that this moment was very humiliating for Elizabeth. Very nice. <br /> <br /> The end also showed affection between Elizabeth and Darcy, which was not shown in the minisers. I really appreciated this scene just because I like to see a happy ending, not just knowing it happened. In total, however, this film removed the nuances that were an integral part of Austen's pride and prejudice. The characters literally speak of Austen's dialogue and modern phrases and spoken language. This version is clearly marked with information that was only referenced or suggested in the original work. Yes, time was a problem. It's just a short film, yada yada. But changing the superficial love story of a complicated and beautiful book is ridiculous. Some have commented that they loved the moment when Darcy saw Elizabeth for the first time because it is so obviously the "first sight of love." Love at first sight? Ah? One of the best aspects of the book is that Elizabeth should not be a traditional beauty and Darcy loves her for her spirituality and vitality ... she literally "loves her." <br /> <br /> This version also had a moment (during Darcy's first proposal) when the two screamed each other, leaning closer ... and closer ... and almost kissing ... but they suddenly step. Ugh! What a sad clich√©. They are angry and disgusting with each other, but so appealing that it doesn't matter that (at that time) they don't like each other? Ridiculous! <br /> <br /> Testimonials were all so far out of the book that it was really like another story. Mr Bennet was pleased, Elizabeth usually acted as foolishly as her younger sisters, Charlotte was emotional, somewhat unintelligent and desperate for her home - unlike a smart, slightly strange woman with common sense depicted in the novel. The relationship between Jane and Elizabeth is simply topical, not the deep-seated love and admiration they should have. All of this could have accepted the little interpretation of the novel, but I refused to accept anything that, in addition to many many historical inaccuracies, did. Miss Bingley walked hardly dressed (her dress looked what other fabrics wore). Elizabeth walked down with Netherfield and let her fly everywhere. The family was lazy for about one morning, although they had to be booked in the mornings (or invited to their home). Elizabeth walked outside her barefoot barefoot. And in a terrible scene, Bingley walked into Jane's bedroom and talked to her (and sounded like an idiot) when she was sick. Most people would feel like these are small points, but I just wanted to either A.) a historically accurate movie, or B.) the exact presentation of the stars in the novel. Director / writer / who sacrificed punctuality, fineness, and a good story of love at first sight. I can admit that those who have not read the book or who do not know the social conventions of time could feel the film very simply and there is nothing wrong with it. I just couldn't overcome my desire to see a movie with more than two beautiful faces.
