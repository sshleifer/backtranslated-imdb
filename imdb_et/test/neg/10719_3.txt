This movie was perhaps one of the most irregular and unforgettable films I've seen for a long time. To be fair, I did not expect a revolutionary comic, but I waited at least for entertainment. Would I have been disappointed with such low expectations? <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey, perhaps my favorite actor (not sarcasm), made this film a little more than tread water. He seems to have temporarily returned to his funny face and created a character that was no different from his Liar Liar Fletcher Friday. This new character, Dick Harper (one of Fletcher 2.0), is a badly modified and unlucky whip. If you find yourself smiling, if you look at this merciful and essentially boring character, it is most likely because Carrey is trying so much to bring him the third dimension. Carrey's extreme pose becomes humorously uncomfortable - and eventually sad. <br /> <br /> Make Leoni as Jane doesn't offer Abbott anything more than Carrey Costello. I find Tea Leon refreshing and underestimated, but not in this case. Jane Harper could have been easily played by every actor from thirty to forty-five, and it is this non-specificity that makes Jane's character unusual to look at. He simply does not define any other attribute beyond the general theme of his film, which seems to be ... Wait, no, this movie has no topic. If you do not read the "Big Business Is Evil" theme. I thought it was more given. <br /> <br /> Richard Jenkins and Alec Baldwin both provide incredible (though tired) supportive performances, but neither person seems to have really invested in the role they play. It is very clear that Alec Baldwin made so much effort to play his dirty C.E.O. when he puts sandwiches (which he seems to have done a lot lately). <br /> <br /> A mild tangent, but has Alec Baldwin played a role in recent years that hasn't demanded him to be a powerful jerk? <br /> <br /> Anyway, take my advice if you haven't seen the horror for yourself: save your money. That's what catches HBO in a few months. Dick and Jane are here, but not fun.
