Susan Slept Here's the big screen of Dick Powell's swan song performer. Of course he directed some more movies and often appeared on television until he died. I'm sorry he didn't go out with his performance Bad and the Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Frank Tashlin has made so many better films, I'm still not sure what he was. The premise is completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is a screenwriter who wants to do more serious things than what he has written. He had the idea of ​​film juvenile delinquency for both two friendly police officers Herb Vigran and Horace McMahon for a deposit of 17-year-old Debbie Reynolds at his doorstep. He's not really a bad child and they don't want to put him in the system. So they give him Dick Powell during Christmas. <br /> <br /> I mean, is there anyone who can't see the problem? The term jailbait comes to mind right away. In addition, Powell is a girlfriend, young and sexy Anne Francis. Why Debbie Reynolds is out of my competition here. <br /> <br /> Susan Slept Here's an Oscar nominee. The song Hold My Hand, sung by Don Cornell in the background, was called the best song, but lost to Secret Love. <br /> <br /> Powell and Reynolds have some funny moments together and Alvy Moore as Powell facts and Les Tremayne when his lawyer laughs. <br /> <br /> But that's not enough.
