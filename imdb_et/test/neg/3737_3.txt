First, I think casting and acting were great. The problem is story. In principle, there is no narrative story here and so there is basically no film here. Larry McMurtry has made Lonesome Dove and I can't injure the original, although it may not need a sequel. He made Hudi Paul Newman, one of my favorite films. Mellencamp should be a national singer, but the only song I sing about her is the old Buck Owens song. The film is a big thing about growing chicken. Mellencamp's character has a good husband, and she's totally stupid to stray from her. Driving a sliding cage is completely stupid. Maybe people do it for fun in some countries, but I've never heard of it.
