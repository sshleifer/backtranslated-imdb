Although this series, and especially the mini-film, were very important at the time of release, I think that this series as a whole was actually quite poorly written with mild pain. Heart-related issues are very well illustrated, but it is difficult to relate and understand the film's problems when the actor and script are not convincing enough (especially when watching a minifilm). <br /> <br /> I also don't think this minifilm or series has tried over time, because now many scenes are pretty ridiculous. Problems are still important, but the gypsy boys are unable to fully assist in understanding the British problems in the 1980s.
