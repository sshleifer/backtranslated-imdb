This film, which was a bit flawed, was completely fun. In about half an hour I was in Be Cool, I started the setbacks of Hollywood Homicide. But guess what? It's worse. Even the dance number is bad. I like most of this movie, so I feel bad about writing this negative review, but I feel obligatory. Rock, Andre 3000 and Vince Vaughn were in comedy. No one else decided which movie genre they were acting on. I know Travole badly because he brought the same Chili Palmer to this movie. He was completely consistent in this role, but this film is so different from the original that it is like a painful thumb. I gave this movie 4/10 because I like the actors so much, but the movie has a conversation about a particular song that is so asinin that I couldn't believe the performers actually said. If you want to go to the movies this weekend, there should be some Oscar competitors. It would be a much better way to spend your time.
