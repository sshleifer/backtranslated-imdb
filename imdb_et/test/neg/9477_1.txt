this is a terrible movie. this is the past. First, the only ones twins care about is how they see and what boys they like. they are in 7th grade. not to say that I am a bride or something else, but it sends the wrong message to girls of all ages. pretty and popular not everything. but that's what twins do. The plot is even worse. The girl's grandfather just happens to be an ambassador to France. She has a co-worker who takes girls around Paris and meets two "cute French boys" motorcycles. they fail to make the boys really like them. ETC ..... they meet in the process with a supermodel and get married to strangers whom they think are cute. do I need to say more? this movie can be cute for 8 and 9 year olds. twins play ditsy losers who want boys. it makes the girls a wrong idea. the film is not great either. I don't recommend it to anyone. I'll give my passport to the right 2/10
