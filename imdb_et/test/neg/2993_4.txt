This film speaks of a depressed and emotionally constrained person who is far from relative in his apartment in Istanbul. As time goes by, their relationship becomes more and more tense until eventually it starts to yell home - who doesn't work and doesn't seem to be looking for a job. It's actually the biggest part of the movie. The problem is that although emotionally narrowed and depressed people are very pulled back and non-communicative, they don't make a very satisfying movie. This is because, mostly, he (and his room) looks into space and says nothing. I think all of these smooth moments could have been shortened to make a 30-minute movie - I wouldn't have thought.
