Comparisons with the original series are inevitable. This is a shame Diana Rigg left the original show in the 1960s due to the mistreatment of manufacturers and MacNee probably regretted it as much as any fan - she hasn't said how long this show should have lasted otherwise. Linda Thorson was a substitute and her episodes continued to preserve the quality and aspects of almost all of Rigg's episodes - no Rigg / Macnee chemistry. The New Avengers should have stayed on the shelf - the falling Macnee, the annoying Purdey, and who the hell this guy Gambit. Humor was also forced and bad - I only looked at some episodes because it was all I could look at, but I think I got that idea. Try as many opportunities and deeds as it is almost impossible to re-form the old show's new format or movie.
