A badly made political maker. Incorrectly photographed, behaved and directed. Each scene is under-filled, including very few images taken during the day. No matter what the location is. There is no fire at a major White House conference, and the only light is a dark blue that is filtered through a window. China's primacy organizes such an intense chiaroscuro earth-breaking telephone conversation that he should think of Homer's bust in Rembrandt's painting. Honest. It would be like a tiny spot of attention and otherwise it was in the dark. Slow-motion deaths are now mandatory for any thoughtless film. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider and Maria Conchita Alonzo play their role, but Scheider is rarely on the screen. Other performances are dismissable. With a short tight skirt, there are real oriental women who carry a gun and are entitled to a Bond film that has emphasized the childhood spent in Nebraska Basset and who should have stayed in the model he probably started. Anyone who played a cruise ship survivor's agent was likely to be the part where he saw most like Johnny Depp, not because of talent display. Chinese cabins, representing both Taiwan and mainland China, worship and laugh when they threaten the heroes. The script is quite terrible, reused from other better movies. There's a lot of shooting on board and virtually all winds start. Two-thirds of the mileage, the ship explodes in the series of anticipated fireballs. The film is then divided into two parts. The first part, the second shootout, this time in the water park store. The second part, an exchange vice-president, the current president and an oily Chinese premiere, was raised both by "Dr. Strangelove" and "Fail Safe". We launch our missiles involuntarily. They are launching their revenge. We cannot convince them that our launch was accidental, although we offer to help them destroy their rockets. There's even George C. Scott / Walter Matthau's general who claims that their "nuclear weapon" can't be beaten with ours, so we should hit them with everything we have. More firewalls. <br /> <br /> The end does not come too fast.
