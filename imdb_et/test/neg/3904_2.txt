After losing my 2-hour life, I watch this movie late on television, went back and read some IMDb materials to remind me why I was watching it for the first time. In retrospect, the only thing I think is the genre I generally like. But this film was a waste of effort. It will fail at every level and see it as a comedy in IMDb that really leaves me at a loss. I can't remember more than a couple of women. There is more laughter than the last person in every episode of law and order. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Too many interactions between characters didn't seem to me any reason, so it was very unlikely / unbelievable. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't nearly free for bikini frames, what can I say? Avoid this movie like a plague. Or record it and just post it on bikini images. Don't even spend $ 1 to rent.
