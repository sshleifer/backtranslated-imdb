The Stranger story somewhat reflects the 1969 film "The Way to the Sun" (author: Gerry & Sylvia Anderson, "Thunderbirds" and "Space: 1999" celebrity). The parallel universe of Earth is a prerequisite for both films. But there is a difference. When the world "stranger" has a totalitarian regime for breaking civil liberty, the "journey towards the sun" only showed a real world of reflection, where handwriting, paths, houses, all kinds of machines and, of course, internal organs were all in the opposite (or mirrored) order. So the similarity of parallel Earth is the only connection between the two films. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the television series "The Land of Giants" came to both films before 1968-1970. a world that was almost parallel to the Earth except that the planet was inhabited by giants who were 12 times larger than the people who landed there. The idea of ​​totalitarian government to capture and retain "small people" was similar to "Stranger's" assumption more than the "JTTFSOTS" assumption. Perhaps because, like "LOTG", the series "The Stranger" was left out. If it had turned into a television series, it would have been the "Fugitive" sci-fi version, with the stars Glenn Corbett flying weekly, hiding in different places, etc. BTW, a stronger script could make this movie a contributed.
