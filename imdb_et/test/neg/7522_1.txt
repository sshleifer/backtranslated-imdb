After reading that about an hour ago, watching this movie became a sad disappointment. Just as he did for the Egyptian prince, Simon managed to somehow manage a script that took out all the drama and mystery from his source material and transformed it into a homogenized mess. Now I'm a mammal of cheese and camp, but that movie didn't make any sense. There was no joy in one performance or humor. There was no excitement and this silly bookend with the addy-like filby who threw his hat into the air was the last hacking. I felt very corrupted when the movie was over and I still refuse to believe it was only 90 minutes when it went forever. I was wondering how the studio and the director could have had such a terrible script OK, but then my friend put me in the movie exactly as it was and I said wow that sounds good but what happened to the movie.
