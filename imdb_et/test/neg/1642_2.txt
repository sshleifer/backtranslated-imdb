I mean, you just love the Italian film industry. Someone came up with a film of offspring ("Road Warrior") and the Italians were busy for years after one hanging. Then another successful barbaric film ("Conan") emerged and the Italians were busy ... eh, see above. <br /> <br /> Apart from countless theme options (one of my favorites is Umberto Lenz's "Barbarians" who celebrate Paul's twins, the Ator series was created. And this, second, is probably the worst (or best, depending on your point of view). <br /> <br /> Ator is recalled by his old teacher, who has discovered some kind of nuclear energy it is, of course, protected from falling into the wrong hands. ‚ÄùThe old man sends his daughter to Ator and after some complications, Ator, his tie Tong and the girl came back. a castle that has fallen in the meanwhile to some criminals (of course, to the old class of the Ator), somewhere along the hero trio forgets this plot and destroys the worshiping cult of some giant snake for that fun (not before some virgins are sacrificed). loses its mood and kills a wise teacher, our heroes remember their responsibilities, invent bundles and grenades, and save the day. <br /> <br /> Include: For everyone (especially O'Keeffe) terrible action), incredibly fun "special effects" (you just have to adore the snake fight scene, which must be a sort of "bride"), badly staged fighting scenes, numerous continuity bugs (Ator flies two different climbers during climate change, its observation, but an example) and a general understanding of history (cavemen, "civilized" barbarians, castle builders, all thrown into one movie). <br /> <br /> If you, like me, are committed to bad movies, this is one of the things you can see, finally ROTFL. For documents: The third part filmed by Malta is actually quite observable. <br /> <br /> Considering Joe D'Amato's other efforts, this is probably his most entertaining film because he has certainly not been able to provide watchful horror or erotic movies. But I have a firm belief that it was completely random. <br /> <br />
