Honestly - this short movie sucks. The mannequin used in the necro scene is pretty well done, but still fake to see the viewing experience. Unearthed DVD is crisp and clear, and I have not made my thoughts if it helps or hinders it. If the film was a bit grainy, it could have added some "creepiness factor" to what was going on. I have no idea why this film has as many hypotheses about the subject as it is, but frankly, NECROMANTIK and VISITOR Q are more shocking to the necrophilia than AFTERMATH. All of this is about a movie about loneliness and other deep philosophy of bull ****. It is an expensive, beautifully filmed turd. It's not that shocking, it's not so nasty. if you want to watch it - rent it. I give him 3 the fact that many people do not make explicit films about necrophilia (we should definitely have a greater choice); Filming is good and he has some "gore" (when you look at a rubber-looking doll to get cut open it is considered gore ...) but other than - absolutely nothing goes its over-hyped confusion. On the other hand - GENESIS - Cerda's "sequel" to AFTERMATH (now available as a "double function" by Unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film that really shows what good director Cerda actually does when given the right material. Although I do not care about AFTERMATH, GENESIS is so well done that I will forgive Cerdale and will definitely follow him in the future ...
