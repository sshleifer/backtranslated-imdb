I felt compelled to write this movie after joining IMDb because I thought it was the worst script I have seen for a while. <br /> <br /> The film's behavior / direction / other areas are fantastic. I love brad Pitt with George Clooney. It works. The desperate seal was still in the first film. My question is how did they exclude this script from the compilation process? I thought not only did the plot not develop like a sidewalk racing to the end of the bicycle, but it twists? (can I call it) was so incredibly stupid that I wanted to demand the return of the ticket cab. I've never felt it to have been played and used throughout the movie. At this point I was expecting something similar to the first film (good chemistry, good example, good direction, amazing plot) to find that they have taken their 8 dollars and looked at it. <br /> <br /> The part I still get is that this movie is now over $ 125 million. <br /> <br /> All in all, I felt this film offensive to my intelligence. I still feel the only part that writers have focused on Julia Roberts like Julia Roberts. This movie made me sad and angry.
