This is one of the strangest things on television. It is located in the incredibly underdeveloped Midlands, with its beautiful name Leatherbridge, which seems to be the toughest place in the country. It has a bar with no visible employees or customers, a university with no students, a police station without criminals, and doctors' surgery with more doctors than patients. The story is disgraceful - every episode revolves around a strange medical problem that works with a variety of brummies who can never actually act, and for some reason, the doctor always gets around his house, solving his problem. Real entertainment for the value of this pure comedy, but I can't believe this is really a serious drama. Bonkers.
