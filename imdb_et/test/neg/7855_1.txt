I found this movie randomly and I wish I wasn't. <br /> <br /> Why make a sexually rude sequel (and some gore when a man is dead) from a well-known children's film. Do not take young children to see this title misdirects you, it has nothing to do with the original snow white, except to steal its characters. Better not worrying about yourself, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I couldn't look at it all, poor (compared to Disney) with a cartoon and not a plot, except how to completely confuse the classic film made me want to give up and leave.
