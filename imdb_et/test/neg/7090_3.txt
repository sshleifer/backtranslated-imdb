"A clear day you can see forever" is nothing more than a new era of "Pygmalion" / "My Fair Lady": the professor is trying to make a common girl a woman of the upper society. This time, instead of using language skills, the professor tries to do this by hypnotizing and regressing the past. <br /> <br /> You know that music has problems when reviewers constantly mention kits and costumes before they mention the plot and music. Songs are instantly forgotten. (Not "Get me a church time", I'm afraid.) And the plot goes somewhere. Gertrude Stein's paraphrase is not "there" here. The characters go through the story without point A to point B. Professor Chabot says several times that he gets to Daisy's concerns, but he never sees it. <br /> <br /> All meaningful avoid conflict. For example, the time comes for the University of Chabot to demand that it complete the reincarnation of its study or give up its job. Now there is a conflict! Does he give up his career in Daisy? Unfortunately! There is nothing about this development. The scene or two years later, the university changes his mind and tells Chabot that he will continue his work. So many conflicts. <br /> <br /> Talent was definitely collected for this film: Director Vincente Minnelli. Written by Alan Jay Lerner in part. Cast Yves Montand, Bob Newhart and Jack Nicholson. And, yes, yes, starring Barabara Striesand, who was at the top of his game at the time of his career. <br /> <br /> But it all falls. Lerner's attempt to restore his greatest success, previously mentioned as "My Fair Lady", is the same failure as Daisy's attempt to revive the size of his past. <br /> <br /> Much better choices.
