What a waste of time to watch this movie. Poor picture quality, bad sound, bad performance and certainly not real facts. The deputy "girlfriend" did as much as it did the sheriff that it was more comedy than horror. The alternate tries to call the emergency number by calling 911 ... PROBLEM ... 1957 that the emergency number does not exist. This is just one example of outstanding contradictions. <br /> <br /> The "scary" aspect was weak. Just not so terrible. I saw mental disorder in depicting my character. <br /> <br /> Sorry ... it just doesn't get it !!
