It was the worst film my wife and I ever saw. The only concession is that we didn't pay to see it in the movie when we borrowed it from a DVD shop. Just - There is no piece worth mentioning (I only looked at it 5 minutes ago and I have already forgotten), double actors played badly, and if it was, I think comedy, which I still have to laugh. In fact, the only laugh that we got out of the movie was that we joked with each other that we agreed it was really terrible. <br /> <br /> Just this movie was totally pathetic and I warn others that they won't waste their time. National Lampoon Triad Version, Rating 0/10.
