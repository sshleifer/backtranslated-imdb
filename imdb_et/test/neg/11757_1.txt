Yes why? Among the filmmakers that appeared in the 80s and 90s, Gus Van Sant is one of my idols. There are others, some. Steven Sodebergh, PT Anderson, Tim Hunter, Danny Boyle, Martin Donovan, Harmony Korine, Wes Anderson. Idiosynocratic, slightly repetitive, but consistent, surprising, unpredictable. Their names make the TV turn on, make a video store or even buy a ticket and cinema. Van Santi "Psycho" gives me a break. Why? I'm thinking. One multi-year classic shoot was shot. The color was fluffy, performances, cruel. What was Vince Vaughn? Was it a parody? Bad joke? What the hell was that? Anne Heche as Janet Leigh? Who dressed him? Viggo Mortensen with a cowboy hat. Viggo is a great actor, but in that case he could not forget John Gavin and when Julianne Moore was introduced to the world through this performance, there would have been no "hours" for him, maybe "minutes". So, here I am, a bad job for one of my idols. The question remains: Why, Mr. Van Sant? Maybe, according to President Clinton, because he could. I'm afraid it's no excuse.
