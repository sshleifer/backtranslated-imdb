Why voted for the best picture of 1998? It must be the best movie ever. It does something like Citzen Kane looks like a complete mess, come on, Citzen Kane wasn't even colorful! I love this movie, it has to be the best movie I've ever put off. I'm still shocked that it was NOT DESIGNED! <br /> <br /> If 10 is the highest, you can give it, I'll give it to 20!
