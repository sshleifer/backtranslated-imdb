Jefferey Dahmer was one sick man. There is not much to say about him, which has not yet been said, except that many documentaries and films made of him are probably better. It's ridiculously cheesy. It's so cheesy, the man who posted the whole movie on youtube, added some comments to make the viewer laugh. with the young man's dahmer, he just wanted to be friends, finally in 1991 with the man he wanted to have sex with. <br /> <br /> I didn't bother to watch the whole movie. it is basically a documentary that shows all the attacks the dahmer pulled out before he got caught. And since this film was made in 1993, one year before the companion was imprisoned, Dahmer's death is not shown. but it would probably have been both cheese and cheese cheese. <br /> <br /> 1/10
