Czech cinema travels through the dark times ... this film is a tangible proof. Apparently, Slama wanted to make a mediocre documentary about the foolishness of fantasy people. A young and healthy boy who does not want to work and prefers to live in a decaying tail with an unpleasant alcohol aunt. Because of the idiotics of the tonic, who simply can declare "Father, I don't work in the factory" (I really want to know why); I understand the condition of his "house", but I can't really dig a terrible mess. Limited sentimentality everywhere. Why didn't Monika send her boyfriend to work abroad? Young Czech couples do it very often. And take someone else's kids to a devastated barn ... it's too much. <br /> <br /> An irresponsible mother (a malfunctioning Geislerov√°), a naive and stupid boy (Tonik), a foolish and confused girl (Monika) ... Yes, someone has already said it - a badly targeted and acting soap opera. Actors like Martin Huba, Bolek Polivka, Tatiana Wilhelmova and Simona Stasova did their best, but unfortunately it couldn't save the whole piece.
