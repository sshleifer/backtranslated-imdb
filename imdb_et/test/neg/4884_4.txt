It is very interesting to find another reviewer who had exactly the same reaction to this film as I did: it was much better than I was 10 or 11 years old. <br /> <br /> Looking at it more than 30 years later, it is still fine, but it was only a little in my interest. What seemed so funny at that time was just a little amusing. For example, in one scene, Trinity walks along and burns his revolver behind him and kills two men even though they are still. In fact, he doesn't even bother to look and see if they are dead because he knows he's hit the mark. Yes, yes, right. <br /> <br /> There is also a lot of dialogue on wood. Sorry, but 35 years later it is not so well aged. <br /> <br /> Although it has been a long time since I've seen it, probably the better Terrence Hill movie than it would be My name is no one.
