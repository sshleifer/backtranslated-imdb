Barbara Payton is the assumed sexy young warm Chickie woman of the owner of a geezer plantation, somewhere in the jungle, located in a cheap studio in Hollywood. Raymond Burr carries his tool with the top button, which is empty, as the head of the hunky chunky plantation, whom Mrs Payton wants to join together. There's another girl, a peasant slave thing that Burr was buggy, but he has given him an old heat deposit, so a mandatory fist of old voo-doo hag brings with him a good spell to pass him and Payton's tramp. I was only partially looking at it because it was really terrible, so I couldn't even see the star of the show --- what I think is a gorilla that someone's voo-doo hag put in or ..... who cares. I'll give it half a letter from a possible ten. It's not even campy, just very bad.
