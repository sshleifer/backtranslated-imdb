I'm a paranormal fan and I love Ghost Hunters, so when this show first came out, I decided to try. I could barely sit through an episode. The exhibition is so obviously staged. I mean the fire, every episode is that someone is in possession or accompanied by a demonic force trying to kill the family. Another big mistake is that these men have never broken anything. When I look at Ghost Hunters, they find evidence and try to refute it, and if they can't, it's evidence. At this show, they find a voice or video and they are very ghastly about it. It completely destroys their credibility, unlike TAPS and Ghost Hunters, who really know what they are doing. Honestly, if you are interested in paranormal and want to see an exhibition about it, check out Ghost Hunters.
