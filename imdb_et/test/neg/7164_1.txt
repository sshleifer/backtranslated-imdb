Such films just encourage me because they do not deserve funding that allows them to reach their DVD player. This film is ambiguous in its jacket-blurb and even more impenetrable in its election choices (why is Mrs Song's romantic interest? Do they just want an Asian woman there, or does her convincingly sensible sign actually give this "message" story a fresh perspective)? Approaching this film is very little and even less when the story evolves. But a good lesson in the process, I realized that boring pain is that the entire casting agent can deepen, the incredible character doctrine is the result of the brain-fart of writers, and the story is amorphous and troubled by uncomfortable references to capitalism, materialism, and postmodern world. At the end of this movie, just before I nodded in the last two minutes and missed, I realized that "Everything is Green" is the product of "Connections" - someone with very little talent knew very little about someone's leadership skills, knew someone who had no marketing sense (but many disposable ego) and jumped out of this dull and ineffective attempt with a mad and humorous feeling. And this is what is the worst thing - how many endlessly better scripts were handed over to this almost non-slip route? Leave this movie closed and feel good.
