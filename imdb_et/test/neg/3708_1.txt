The sin of how these things are done, but then we would never see what the best "Dummy scene" was ever filmed. Ahhh, the beauty of the Bigfoot flick with a small budget, you lean to see the beauty you look at. As I said before, it's never the best dummy scene! The words cannot express it, you have to see it yourself. Wonderful lines like "smells like decain meat", "Thems man ..." (You know it when you see it) the creature makes Blah, Blah! the sound and the scene where the child gets shot, make you cry (laughing), you can scroll it forward. He has a chase of a car, a chase of snowmobiles, a folk song and a Disco song. It doesn't stop there, looking at the credit that a friend noticed in the "wardrobe offered by K-Mart". Do you ask how can you even get credit and then watch them? I can explain this to some kind of shock to the brain, you are so mentally exhausted that you can't move and I think you have to know who was behind the confusion. All of this must be seen, especially if you want to punish yourself mentally. His possessor!
