look again at all 3 series and don't look at this movie, the trailer is completely misleading and the 3 weakest characters in the series stretch out for the most painful 2-hour life of the 25min TV episode, a really horrible movie. tubbs and edward are in it for a few minutes, micky has 1 row and his flag just rolls the same tired old punches as well as the briss accent just about 5 times changed to a ton of extra-action films and really a couple laughs they seem to recycle 2 hours, and honestly, this series has been completely destroyed by this godly piece .......... batman and robin are all forgiven
