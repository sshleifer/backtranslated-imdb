These two leaders, the Englishman and the Aussie, who are filming the story of the American Civil War in Romania, have no sparks between them, are absolutely unbelievable as lovers and completely inconvenient. There is no story, no testimonial, practically anything to separate the eyelids from this infinite drilling. Renee Zelwegger, also hopelessly unsuccessful, looks at the fence posts, but at least looking at his embarrassment, this comic relief. Nicole Kidman is ten years old for the role and has no idea what's going on. Any Romanian extras could have played the role of Jude Law moor. The only requirement is to travel to the forest looking for a fool to see that the parade of guest stars steals the exhibition. Not that it is important because all the letters of the guest were completely unnecessary because they did not outperform the so-called plot. And like everything that wasn't enough, auteur felt it was necessary to throw some of the spinning, vortex, kung fu horses. What was that?
