"Eaten Alive" goes a lot easier than Ruggero Deodato's "Cannibal Holocaust", but it's also a lot of sillier film. I mean, sometimes it can be unintentionally fun, but the plot is so pointlessly idiotic that it was impossible for me to lose all patience. The tough guy Robert Kerman (Cannibal Holocaust) is with Janet Agren (hell gates, an unbearable accent here) to search for New Guinea's jungle for Agren's sister, led by a religious cult (Ivan Rassimov). On the way, they witness (sometimes true) torture and some cheese-fused cannibalism. Like the director Umberto Lenzi, the film is so overwhelming that it's hard to take seriously, but if you enjoy more than a few unintentional laughter in the trash, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> 4/10
