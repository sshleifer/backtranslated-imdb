I do not deny that I have enjoyed watching Japanese horror movies, but everyone has to go back to them again if you have seen the same thing over and over again. Grudge. Audrey, as her mother insisted, gets her sister back. But when he arrives, something strange happens to his sister and then his sister is killed. He wants to know what a curse is, and later the photographer (Eason) joins. On the other hand, there is something for the family and three girls, but it seems to understand it too late ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I don't see three girls. an international school appears in films because they are not a (real) related story. The reason a woman who keeps fear kills people is still not very clear (I think they just talk about the same things I saw in the grief). And the unexpected appearance of Audrey in front of the boy is undoubtedly odd, which I think is an attempt to make a story about the family. Slaughter scenes are absolutely mixed in the ring and in the Shibuya cover. Operation would be another bad point. As a Hong Konger, I would really like to support Edison Chen's first effort in Hollywood, but as a movie lover, I really can't find any points to support bad behavior. Other actors like Dad, though he just appears in a few scenes, should have done better. The film's atmosphere is good, especially when I only looked at it in the middle of the night. except that, like me, you can go to kill some time. But if you like such Japanese horror movies, you should look at the Japanese version.
