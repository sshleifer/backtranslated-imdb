After watching this movie on Saturday afternoon, I couldn't really understand why so many people liked it. It was not "warm-hearted" or "wise"; it was just all other "unsuitable people joining holidays and despite their ideological differences that learn something about each other". <br /> <br /> Characters are a stereotype in bouillabais - we have Black, Spaniards, Jews, Asians and homosexuals - and they never do anything except what everyone expects in such a movie. The black mother declares that it is "all right" when it is mentioned that there is another black sign in the church instead of helping to prepare dinner (since all black lovers love the church), the Spaniards seem to be able to greet each other or make exclamations, lesbians do nothing but can and kiss (and one of them carries a bandanna. Because all lesbians dress like Ani DiFranco) and Vietnamese family has a video shop. L.A. Imagine that. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is called "What is Cooking" because every ethnic family feeds a different version of what they think the Thanksgiving dinner should be! Black mother wants onions and macaroni and cheese, spanish tortillas are shown to the Spaniards, Vietnamese family have deep frying rolls; I'm surprised that there was no Manischewitz bottle on the Jewish table. It is all shown by the "musical assembly" of the time-honored tradition of playing Surf's "Wipeout", swapping the instruments used in the melody to reflect the respective cultures. Isn't that so cute? Anyway, when the director has finished all the different ways, he tries to show the inner humanity that we, like every race, part of religion and culture, are inventing incredible and too dramatic conflicts for every family involved. It would be a plot killer to mention what these conflicts are, but be sure they are really surprises, ie when you are sleeping in the first half of the movie. The topic of "family disgrace" works quite strongly. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you are a person who enjoys those new fangled movies that emerge around the stories of improbable characters, well, this movie still doesn't like it. If you want food to be widened around the table, you need to put it on your Netflix queue. But if you like stereotypes and clich√©s, make sure you ask for it during Christmas. Or Hanukkah. Or Kwanzaa.
