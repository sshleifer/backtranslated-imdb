TWINS EFFECT is a weak film in many aspects. The only good element is that it doesn't take you seriously. Moreover, it is not really a movie, but rather a tool for selling two stars of the movie, popular pop idols in their home country, Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> The film itself is poorly designed and worked. The direction offers some foolish martial arts, which is strange because the CEO (and allegedly co-organizer) is Donnie Yen. Like many Hong Kong films aimed at teenage audiences, the main "actors" like twins (two films that celebrate this movie) and Ekin Cheng have so many bad music to listen to the audience to believe in certain scenes. funny, smart, etc. The final conclusion: it is all empty. Even as a fan of Hong Kong movies, it's a bad film. Not funny enough, not serious enough, and simply generally too haunted for your own good. <br /> <br /> Of the 3 in 10. <br /> <br /> (Go to http: // www. nixflix.com for a more complete overview of this movie and other foreign movies)
