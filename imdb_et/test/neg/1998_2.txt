I like Casper in my movies, a real credit for STARSHIP TROOPERS. But box cover for this video of SSOOOOO mi-sleds tenants. In my local video rentals are waiting for people (PERHAPS) Borgi like a vampire, and instead they get bad again with Lon Chaney. It had great potential and fell very flat. I think I could have written a better story and a screen. Why is it in every scientific literature, do they (cast) constantly refer to the solar system as a galaxy? Are none of these scriptwriters or authors awake in the science class? This is my pet, but the solar system is one star with planets, the galaxy is a whole host of solar systems. It's like a reference to the coke of a coke as the gross amount of six packages. Makes sound even.
