This movie is interesting for fans of the famous rock band "The Band" in this singer / keyboard Richard Manuelis, which appears in several scenes. It seems to me that the film may have been shot some years before 75 years, judging by Richard's appearance. Interestingly enough, Jones later worked with The Band on Levon in a much better film "Coal Miner's Daughter". Anyway, you really need a special reason to overcome this harsh viewable movie. Unfortunately, sensibly sensitive Manuel suicides. I've never heard of how he came to the movie. Four out of five members of the band would appear in another bad film "Man Outside".
