You know, after the first couple of Chuck Norris films, I got to say that Golan-Globus produces the film even when I voted in the middle, despite the credit or title. What's more, I can say that it was Golan-Globus within minutes of the screen time. Something about story-building, foolish relationships between characters, craftsmanship, wood (random terrible performance), scene tempos and rhythms that made Albert Pyun look like John McTiernan, paper-thin plots, and soon-to-be-out choreography ... Golan-Globus has been around for years incredibly consistent in style, theme and point of view. <br /> <br /> What you can say must work for them because they have literally produced dozens of movies. You go to one of your productions and you know exactly what you get. And it's not brain food, people. <br /> <br /> "Ninja 3" is another piece of hackers in the long line of GG sausage factory products and offers a typical limited enjoyment to filmmakers. palate. You have Bad Ninja, slicing policemen and criminals and someone else who gets your way. You have a good ninja, you promised to stop it. You have a Westerner who is being mixed, so that we Americans can identify with him (or in that case) and be sure "we can still win those irritating orientas in our game." You have a love interest (who is usually the worst actor in the movie), with the hero of the hero. You have your endless attacks, murders and torture by torturing men, while the arrow or star sign is not convincingly out of your eye, neck or chest. You have your Beefy White Guy / Bodyguards in Suits calling Ninja's "B * tch son" and throwing a circular house to get him his hands. You have the ultimate confrontation between Good Guy and Bad Guy, which lasts 20 minutes and seems to stop like a RoadRunner comic instead of reaching a climax or resolution. <br /> <br /> Ninja 3 is a bit different, because the plot is surrounded by a ridiculous sporty type held by Bad Ninja, so that he kills a lot of police and criminals and cheerful white bodyguards under his charm. But all the other elements are both formal and Kabuki or Noh. <br /> <br /> I thought Lucinda Dickey was quite pleasant in this movie. She is nicely muscular and curvy, has big cheekbones and some moves for a sporty ooomph, and you can actually stop the belief that her character could make out of the movie. He can carry this thing almost, but not quite well. One more start for his participation and good energy. <br /> <br /> Of course, Sho Kusugi is here and he dominates the movie for the last 10-15 minutes. And just to show you how the tertiary and forced GG movies, the director and the editor cut the last climatic struggle between Koshu and Bad Ninja, where there are many reactions from Dickey and his boy. easy expression of input. I'm serious ... for all the emotions and reactions they show to the procedure, you might look at a sea turtle at the Marineland Aquarium. I can only imagine how Dickey had to feel when he saw the finished product - he probably wanted to deliver the editor through katana for real, as these reaction shots see him as a complete idiot. <br /> <br /> An enjoyable waste of time ... but it's definitely a waste of time. Perhaps, if you are a fan of Sho Kusug or even a fan of Linda Dickey, it's worth it for you.
