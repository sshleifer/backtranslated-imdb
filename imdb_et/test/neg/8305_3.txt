Low budget, but still scary enough to take interest in another Frankenstein story. This film is also known as LADY FRANKENSTEIN. The fresh fresh Tania Frankenstein from the medical school (Sara Bay) arrives in her father's estate to find that she is still in front of her old tricks. Baron Frankenstein (Joseph Cotten) is murdered with his own creation, and now his daughter decides on a tradition of family life, creating a lover. It's closer than a terrifying melodrama as a nightmare. Supported forms include Mickey Hargitay, Paul Whiteman, Paul Muller, and Herbert Fux. A rainy night can increase the atmosphere. Still having fun.
