I haven't watched every jacquard episode. It was a little fun when nothing went wrong. But after watching Jackass # 2, I liked Bam and Dunn. They had a nice attitude to the jackass of the movie, so I thought I'd tune in to La Bami. The boy was wrong. Seriously, you could link a couple of 2's, offer them the same budget and contribute to losing something more creative on the screen. I mean, C'Mon MTV! At 23:00, where most people are tuned, you give us that garbage. <br /> <br /> Everything seems so forced. You do not know these signs because there is no attitude at all. You can't judge Bami or Dunni or anyone for that. If it were just a little tiny idea. Something we don't forget as soon as the next picture goes. <br /> <br /> Finally, they manage to create a good shot and you like what's going on. You sit there, just waiting for your reaction, and then some jerk closes the scenes with two flat sentences and bangs. Was it close to this picture or what? If I had been there, I'd like to laugh and laugh. Do some crazy things and let my adrenaline pump, but those guys ... Just write stupid reactions. <br /> <br /> Yes, they get a few jokes from the public with cheap jokes or gigantic jokes, which I think is a waste of money. Many many normal people who were not taken under the Jackass Wing could have a more fun script in their heartbeat. Or impress with the work of the visual camera. Even spontaneous wannabe cool guys without a script would do a better job. MTV can bring more soothing material to the screen. You just have to fool this fool of the exhibition writer. <br /> <br /> Some scenes really need a little bit of courage and thus 2 stars.
