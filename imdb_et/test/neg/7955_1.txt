Pathetic NRI Crap ..... Complaint to anyone who is not an Indian ... This is an Indian cinema WORK that has been done from the worst NRI trash ..... The story is boring and clich√© (how NRIs are and westerners watch India ) ..... go if u want to be bored of death. <br /> <br /> The film is handled by widows of fate in India before independence. Much of this is true even now in remote rural areas, but not to the extent shown (perhaps due to the film of this period) ..... <br / > <br /> There are many other Indian movies run by very talented directors who are worthy of tasting. ..It is for sure miss ... Instead, look for a documentary or search for information online if you are really interested in the situation of the downturn in India. <br /> <br /> I wasted my time.
