Secret Service Agent Jay Killion (Charles Bronson) is destined to protect the presidential election of a new lady (Jill Ireland). She is a very hard woman and Killion has her hands full. He is the victim of many murder attempts led by the President's Chief of Staff, who wants the first lady to die. This film offends your intelligence not only with the story, but also with the lack of realistic places. For example, in the scene depicting the inaugural parade, the first lady, Rolls Royces, is an interchangeable agent with Killion and without president. We also know Washington DC, like the weather in January, and not just the "top coat", but even 70-degree palm trees and sunny weather! (Probably filmed in Hollywood, not in Washington). This movie is a joke. It's not worth your time.
