For some time this exhibition seemed to be 24/7. Then it was probably the second season, or any other such terrible exhibition, of the two most fabulous and imaginable people ever filmed. All the other comments are self-contained by these two haggise and airheads. They can't be said much less than what everyone else has said. <br /> <br /> I doubt these two women have souls, and more than likely they did some Faustian Bargain to get their lizard mouth. TV series. Does fate protect the human race from exposure to Ghastly Girls!
