Originally, I wrote a sarcastic, wretched review of this pathetic manure, but every time I submitted a review, I got "it contains a very long word that is not allowed", as well as the misspelled words. <br /> <br /> Now that the word that was judged too long was never detected. After several attempts to get rid of the words forever, I was surprised to find that the IMDb site is politically sensitive and automatically rejects certain words. was foolish or racist by itself.But after the elimination of all the longest words, the same message was repeated over and over again; <br /> <br /> Computer police are everywhere.
