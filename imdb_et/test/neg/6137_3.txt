When I got it together with the rest of the Marx Brothers box, I found myself the most disappointed with most of the opera. This stinker is a proline that is the worst I have ever seen, the smart lines are out and the character is strange. An example writer in this game is so stupidly stupid that television is not difficult to solve and to try. <br /> <br /> Like Marxes, Marxes seems to be doing better when outsiders lead the devastation and it is much better if they have at least two or more. The material here is obviously written for everyone and it is actually a waste of Marx talent. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10
