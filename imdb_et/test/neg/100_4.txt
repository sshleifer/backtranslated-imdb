I was waiting for this movie. Reliable actors, interesting plot. Great atmosphere then ????? If you try something that is meant to encapsulate the meaning of life. First of all. I know this. OK, I didn't expect the directors or writers to really know the meaning, but I thought they had provided flakes to grab and treats to add fire to the fuel. they almost did. Things I didn't get. A woman who got lost in dark places and a lonely car park alone - without forgetting the consequences. Big puzzles that fell on the road. The promise of the original so-called criminal knowledge. I had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the relationship. I realized and get a foolish foolish and I find Adrian Pauls role decisive and penetrating and then ????? Basically there is a story and a script that is good to the point and this point was the last 10 minutes or so. What? End of ideas! It's such a pity that this movie had to shoot us so badly. It may not understand the meaning and I really did not expect the writers to understand it, but I was hoping for an intellectual, if not a spiritual ride, and I got a journey
