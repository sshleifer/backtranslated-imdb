This movie collided. There's not much more to it. The final struggle looked like Walker, who took my grandmother, not a supernatural demon with a strength of ten men. I found the ads more interesting. Plot twists and jokes can be seen a few miles away. The only quality of redemption for this movie was that it ended. Avoid it at all costs ... if you don't know the bad Chuck Norris movies.
