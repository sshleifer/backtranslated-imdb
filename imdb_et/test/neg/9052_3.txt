An Asian assassin strikes Niagara Falls and New York victims before he rides the car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden Janet Agren, who gave a fun "South Belle" to show that she was from Alabama) finds a link between the killings and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and examines. It brings him to New Guinea, where he promises a slippery guide (Robert Kerman, ie American porn star R. Bolla) $ 80,000 to help his sister find. After he was afflicted with the jungle full of bloody cannibals, they finally found Diana, who is controlled by Jim Jones, the Jim Jones cult leader. Jonas does typical mad guru-style things like passing the LSD, initiating a group suicide, threatening to kill someone who treats him and rapes Agren with a giant dong immersed in cobra blood. Every time he sees for some time, the character looks right or left and sees a passionate scene that is lifted directly from JUNGLE HOLOCAUST or MAN DEEP RIVER (both were directors Lenzi). I'm pretty sure they will use at least two CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST scenes. Here are the scenes for killing animals (gator, eating live snakes), plus some nudity and castration. We, Lai, show that he is giving his breast implants another workout that plays a widow who has come from three of his brothers in law on the ashes of his freshly ashed man. Mel Ferrer briefly appears as a professor and is not given much to do. So, MANGATE VIVI! you get quite a lot of promises, filled with all the nudity, dead animals, and the bad taste you expect from one of these titles, so if you're a buggy hound, always look at it. Personally, I missed it in the middle and just wanted it to end. The original version (heavily cut), published in 1985, was titled "EMERALD JUNGLE" to deceive people into thinking they were actually renting John Boorman's EMERALD FOREST. It was also called DOOMED TO DIE and CHANNEL!
