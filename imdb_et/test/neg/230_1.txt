Bruce Willis, as usual, does a great job. <br /> <br /> [Warning: You may be considered a "spoiler"] <br /> <br /> Although my friend thought it was good, I watched my movie all the time I thought when it ended. After seeing such a great patriot as "The Patriot" and "Chicken Run", I was very disappointed with Disney's "The Kid". <br /> <br /> Willis plays a medieval man with a tough and realistic attitude. positive spin in people's pictures (he is an image consultant). An unknown child appears. Yes, it's her, but younger, and even Lily Tomlin sees her. At this point, I am reminded of the cross between the poor "quantum leap" episode and the bad flick travel. <br /> <br /> Kid and Willis are going through an attempt to find out why he is in this period. They see it out. They will meet Willis when he is older. Never, when he never goes over exactly how old Willis installs them between time periods and starts them together, how did he get to the beginning of how he came to realization that he needed it, and so on. br /> <br /> Basically, it is a very tired, unoriginal, uninspiring plot with some big players. The good news is that the "Kid" actor is far from being as annoying as he is on a television trailer.
