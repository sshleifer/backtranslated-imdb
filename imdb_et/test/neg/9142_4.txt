What a disappointment! I've enjoyed Jon Cleary's books on Scobie Malone, but there are few similarities between him and Malone. In books, she is an urban detective who is committed to her husband and does not participate in reality. For the film, the character is flavored, a butt that uses his fists and is not nasty to jump into a gorgeous girl in bed, although what he and other sex interests of the film see are not familiar; Taylor was 39 at that time and his face began to swell. <br /> <br /> But its character resistance is remarkable; he travels from Australia, apparently goes directly to the commissioner's house (rather, inadvertently, inadvertently arresting him at the time of his arrest), saving him from murder (fighting in the process), going to a single casino with a girl, leaving for another and sleeping. So much jet lag! Back to the home of the Commissioner (showing good knowledge of the streets of London), he bounces bad, but is still in the mornings! It is also noteworthy that the commissioner limousine has a windshield and the headlamps are miraculously repaired within minutes of the murder attempt, and one character has sensitive confidence in the exact timing of the clock-activated bomb. <br /> <br /> The best thing is Joseph Butler's contempt for Malone. And at least the movie doesn't let you travel in London, although some scenes take place during the Wimbledon Tennis Week.
