Committed Stars (Heather Graham) with (Casey Affleck) and (Luke Wilson). Its story is Joline, who has decided to find her former husband who is in the midst of a life crisis. <br /> <br /> The devotee was not at all what I thought was lacking in comedy, which was finally a genre. It was out of stupid and unrealistic, Casey Affleck gave a reasonable result, Graham's recent roles are lacking in gloss and it is not healing. <br /> <br /> Graham's last role was blessed, which I also misled and didn't like at all. <br /> <br /> Pros Adversely <br /> <br /> Some predictable, unrealistic, bad acting and not comedy movies!
