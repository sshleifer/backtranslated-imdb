It has been several years to be fair, because I looked at a bile dedicated to cellulite, called here on Earth, so forgive me if my memory of the film is a bit sketchy. I stick to the main points that interrupt the soul of the unhappy viewer. <br /> <br /> First Scene: Chris Klein, after he was out of school (because he looks like seventeen years old-- yes, very believable), gives me what I expect his mischievous morale call ... field. Let me repeat it for you - in the field. I think we should move a combination of shame and eloquence that it cannot express. Klein has cardboard cutouts and facial expressions. He's a decent cardboard box, but a little more. <br /> <br /> The Second Scene: After some joy and teenage pyramid sweatshirt, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett will do some harm to the local diner for which he is forced to recover. Of course. Because who would better help with the construction work than any random moor who fell into it / burned it first. Better yet, let's assume that the random moral moves to Josh Hartnet's girl, Miss Sobesk, the girl she loves ... delivering her equally wooden line? Three Scenes: Chris Klein's character is the character of Leelee Sobeski and decides to name his different parts of the body after the east coast. My soul is crying. Really how does this scenario prove to be good? Certainly, you have to dispose of several million people when you say that their home is equal to Miss Sobeski more ... with feminine areas. Secondly, by naming your breasts after New York and New Jersey, there is some confusion about whether Miss Sobeski is actually disproportionately disproportionate. <br /> <br /> Fourth Scene: Leelee Works. He falls off. It gives him ... knee cancer. "We always knew it could come back," says his father (?). Right. Knee cancer. Interruption. Maybe I missed something. As I said, it has been a few years. Certainly I missed something. Don't I? For God's love, tell me that the girl did not contract KNEE cancer. <br /> <br /> What you just heard was my soul dying.
