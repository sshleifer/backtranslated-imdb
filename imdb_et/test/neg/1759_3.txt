I found that the first 90 minutes of this film are very interesting, although some parts of it were ridiculous (i.e. the character of Philip Seymour Hoffman). The last 60 minutes were terrible and I started to lose interest in the film. The last hour lasted forever, it seemed. <br /> <br /> The film has worked nicely and I see why Rene Zellweger won the Academy Award because his character was so interesting. The film is also beautifully filmed and the story is emotional. But I found that the message is bad: it is not surprising these days in Hollywood. In this story, Inman (Jude Law) destroys the Confederate Army during the Civil War. His reason: his girlfriend leaves her and wants her home. He is also disappointed with the war. (Can you imagine if every soldier in a similar boat left the army in two world wars ?!) <br /> <br /> But this film is, of course, perfectly acceptable. What's more, what liberal filmmaker has it ever been nice to say about the US military? To add their left slant, they represent a vigilant-like position, which, as a result of desertification, becomes a sick killer with cold blood. Well, in the world of movies, as we know, good as bad and bad is good ... and only liberals would depict deserters as heroes.
