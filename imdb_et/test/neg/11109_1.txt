This is one of the most terrible scary movies I've ever seen. I had to think about whether John Ryhs-Davies was just bored and wanted to make this movie. Th Chupacabra looked like a junction between Sleetak and the lost land and the creature from the Black Lagoon. In addition, they would have had to use someone who was a little smaller because the legend of Chupacabra is much smaller. All in all, the movie was so bad that it was funny. Why couldn't the bullets and power outage stop Chupacabra, but the captain's boxing daughter's daughter does OK? See if you are at home or you feel good and need a good laugh.
