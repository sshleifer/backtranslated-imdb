I can't believe I'm wasting my time with the commentary - but this movie is weird. When 20 different directors were present for the different parts of the film, who had no idea that the other directors were filming, this is quite a result that I expect. <br /> <br /> I also think the scenes were different - things don't always look like the order. The film works as we should already know about half the characters. <br /> <br /> And in this movie, Steve Guttenberg tries to make mania, a-la-Robin Williams comedy. Ewww. And the whole assumption that a lot of children are responsible for ex-con does not seem realistic on this day and age.
