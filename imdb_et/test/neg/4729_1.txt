Against my own better trial, I went to watch this movie today and I wish I wasn't. Awful. The first AvP movie looks like a classic, it's bad. These guys put Paul WS Anderson out as a master storyteller. In fact, this is what I'm expecting from an alien and / or Predator movie if it was made by Uwe Boll! This movie attacked me and the Lord knows only what appears when Ridley Scott or HR Giger were forced to look at it. I don't understand how a fan of any franchise would like this movie. <br /> <br /> Really, I don't know where to start. I mean, the first AVP was poop, but it was at least half an interesting story and device, and sometimes a real tension. It didn't take itself too seriously, and it could at least be half-enjoyed by "just leaving your brain at home". But it seemed to me as if the people behind them thought they would make the next horror in the masterpiece. In a dark room or in a corridor where horrible music was played, there was a "tight" scene that basically hit you out, saying "now be scared". As James Cameron once said, you can't say you are afraid that you only have to lift your senses. The men who made this movie were obviously not paying attention because they tried everything in the book to force you to fear, not to let you come to that level. It's a clich√© of online educators to say, "God, I was bored of the movie and felt like I left," that's exactly what I felt, even in the middle of action. They took this movie completely seriously, which removed all the opportunities to enjoy. Even the gag of how governments do not lie to their people was played without irony. <br /> <br /> As far as characters are concerned, I knew that a person is completely meaningless for it. a movie, but seriously when they start to be on screen at least for those who make SOMETHING, which is relevant to the story. I don't care about this man whom his dream boyfriend is beating, I don't care about a mother who is "my daughter doesn't know her, boo-hoo!" (a pair of night vision goggles as a gift? Give me a break!) or the liberated offender just tries to make a decent life and show an example to my brother, which man. Hell, even mandatory hot-chick-in-panties at the moment was more common. I feel they were waiting for the audience to be so much fun, and see how the busters come out of their children, the expectant mothers and others that are all out. I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Then we move the movie star and very little to write home again. Were foreigners well designed? I wouldn't have a clue because you never see fucking things. Everything you see is one of the mouth, head, tail or truly failing cg contour that climbs the wall, and barely enough to actually work that it is actually an alien before Mr. "I created Marilyn Manson and NIN music videos, think I'm doing the same the thing here "editor goes to it with a slice tool. Also note how hackers always put their films at night and in the rain? Hmmmm. Predator could have fought with giant sea monkeys for all we knew! Yes, Predator was more impressive this time, and I thought some of the new weapons were cool, but it was. Because also when Predator sounds like a lost world dinosaur? There were a few things I liked. One of them was the use of sound effects and music from the original texts (I also started to hit "Get to the chopper!"), Although other references were stupid (the main name was Dallas, give me a break). I also liked the visual FX of Predator's vision, as well as how the hybrid alien looked (surely beat him up from the resurrection). But really, these are the only positive things. <br /> <br /> In general, I found this film to be ugly, pointless, offensive, and above all offensive to the original creators of both creatures. The fact that they have opened the door for another leaves me almost depressed. <br /> <br /> If they had any grace, they would remove Dan O'Bannon, Ron Schusett and HR Giger from the credits in this movie. They have not done anything to earn it.
