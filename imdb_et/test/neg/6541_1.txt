Most movies are dirty with high product values, it is dull without high product values. What sets it apart from a lot of terrible movies. As bad as this movie was, I have to respect Kathryn Aselton, who believe that if it is given the right script, it may well get a good result. She plays Emily's girlfriend with a multi-year Doofus Josh, who often refers to her as a "Dude" or "Man" in a non-ironic tone. <br /> <br /> But this is the case, Emily is a semi-believable sign, which means that Rhett must soon be added to the pain to fight this almost incredible character, where the man is even more uncomfortable than Josh. When we first meet Rhett, we learn that he is "deep" because he saves the lizard, which is PROOF, that he sees the world "uniquely!" Rhett then shows Emil a tape and, with Emily's unbelievable moments she does on this lizard's amateur belt, WOW believes she's reacting again without the irony of sarcasm even indirectly. /> From the opening scene you will be warned that the camera's work is dirty, we will open Josh when shaking when he tries to win viewers by acting in GOOFY! oh how this main protagonist is free that he acts on GOOFY! haha. This movie could almost be a case study of how BAD movies can be (and how FAR bad movies can get in the festival, I mean, this movie seemed quite awesome compared to most of the ring movie. br /> <br /> I believe SXSW gave this film a small prize (south to south, why do you encourage them, its only cruel). But here's where I compliment this movie, it's the best mumblecore movement. Keep in mind that all other mumblecore films that are suck outside of faith and generally contained grotesque nudity and incomprehensible bad behavior, but still are good to be the best. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the needles yet, but it seems like they've made some progress, the preview made it at least sensitive, even if the Puffy Tool preview couldn't really hide the fact that it was going to suck. I've come out of the topic here, but Rhett can't be seen by a professional actor at all, as Josh probably isn't an actual actor, but a director (or a brother of the director, there are some mixed messages). I think Rhett was a friend of someone and they said why you don't play Rhetti, Rhett is the name and character of the actor, probably that the actor and the character are the same as I'm wrong When I shave Rhett a raccoon out of your face, you would probably say he was attractive. So Rhett, Emily and Josh attacked Puffy's board for Rhett and Joshi's father. Some things happen along the way, more bad behavior, bad supporters, dirty camera work, test of importance. This film would not have been bad if it had not been so shamelessly profoundly self-evident. <br /> <br /> The whole thing is amateurish if you can watch this movie without paying for it, for example, if it is on television or rent a library, then consider looking at it just to see if you like this super cheap style of film making. I like what a duplass does when it comes to making a movie that has nothing to do with it, but I want them to make a movie that anyone would like to see.
