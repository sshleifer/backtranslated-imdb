I should agree with the previous reviewer: this movie is a fantastic animation, but it has problems for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot holes are large, the dialogue has hardly explained the plot concepts ... MAIN PLOT POINTS are not even fully explained until the movie's last five minutes. The characters are obvious but do not explain the confusing points of the film. There are signs that open up and that are important stories that are never explained - most of them have names that are mentioned only once *, and that is extremely confusing for the viewer. Don't waste your time with this movie. If you don't laugh and how DUMB is.
