My friend and I rent this movie and in the first 5 minutes we had no idea what was going on. It seemed that it should have passed within the first 15 minutes. It was a terrible movie, my little brother could have been a better actor than some of the ones in the movie, and the plot (if you call it) was full of holes. Never would I recommend this movie to my worst enemy, but someone I really like.
