I wasn't going to look at O12 because I didn't like O11. I thought O11 was a nice but somewhat boring film of bank robbers with a meaningful arsenal. Anyway, I talked about watching O12 one night and I regret it a lot. The plot is not only boring but also meaningless. I don't even know what it was. I left the movie after 3 quarters and got coffee with another girl who didn't like it. Much more joy I can tell you. But even the men who finally ended up told me that the plot was still terrible and useless. My advice: Don't look. See Team America (fun btw ;-)) and forget about the twelve. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the most boring and pointless peace of mind has been on the screen for years.
