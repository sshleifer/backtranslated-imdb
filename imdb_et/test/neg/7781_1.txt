If you want a complete waste of time because pulling the tape out of your belly button or wiping the wax from the ears or deepening the tile is your idea of ​​carnival excitement, then you don't want to miss it. br /> <br /> First, forget about the VHS cover. In this movie, the body does not see the body as attractive (ie Indian girl). Someone else commented that someone who is submitting a cover is not the same girl and I agree. Kate is the most exciting thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> With that in mind, I bought this 99 cents of VHS in K-Mart and three minutes, not 40 seconds of the movie, I knew I was ripped. <br /> <br /> I stopped watching it because 1) I paid 99 cents, and 2) maybe it was likely that this turkey had some more hair. <br /> <br /> Not. <br /> <br /> Good Mourning, Fonda. I know you did it in the job, but it's up to you.
