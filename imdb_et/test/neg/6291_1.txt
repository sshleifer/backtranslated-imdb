The film is an adaptation of the Japanese story by the esteemed author Yukio Mishima. It just does not make the transition to a reliable story of the British and Americans. Cutting the ship through the waves and a small route line that fills the maps while their letters are heard in overvoice. The film is so inclined that I even pushed through the scenes of sex and masturbation, which are not passionate or erotic. The film gained a notorious dimension when Kristofferson's wife left her during the film with Miss Miles for extra-curricular activities. I think they enjoyed sex scenes, but that's not the same for the viewer. <br /> <br /> No characters available. A sexually disappointed widow is unlikely, a little boy is despicable. Kristofferson is friendly enough, but he does not only have the skills needed to function, although perhaps we do not want to deal with him in the face of his ultimate destiny. <br /> <br /> A little boy, he's going to a bad crowd after his father's death, and they help him somehow resist the life of his mother. Now this is really a bad crowd. They just don't shop and smoke, nibble. They slip the mickey cat and vivisect it. This is shown in detail. Of course, this is just a practice for them to do the same thing with Kristofferson! <br /> <br /> So the movie usually moves slowly, without touching the characters, and if something happens, it has failed. <br /> <br /> The end is just as unsatisfactory as any movie you ever see. <br /> <br /> All of this could have made sense when the Japanese locality and cultural context were preserved. As it is, it's just insecure. <br /> <br />
