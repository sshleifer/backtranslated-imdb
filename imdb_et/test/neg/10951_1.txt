First, I'm a fan of big movies. Class B is always a good laugh. Unfortunately, this movie is just bad. I dressed for a party for a zombie and my face looked better than this film. Particularly at the beginning, the big boy just looked like a boy who had drawn his face with a pen. <br /> <br /> The actress is so bad that I don't have to comment. The effect is also extremely amateur, with obvious blood pipes when they shoot blood directly from the back of the zombies. <br /> <br /> It also seems that many people who comment on this movie are trying to increase their rating. Anyone who doesn't have a finger finger would appreciate this movie over 5/10. Frankly speaking, it is a disgrace that people working on this film increase their ratings. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to avoid this movie, it is not worth wasting 90 minutes of life. <br /> <br /> Absolutely terrible.
