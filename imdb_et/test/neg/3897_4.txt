The scene at Fircombe Beach opens up, although it is fun in itself, but unfortunately it provides a metaphor for the film - uncomfortable and washable. In fact, it's not as funny as most of the other Carry On series, but perhaps because it doesn't really bring much fun. This is a fair contribution to the title likes by Benny Hill fans, but those who look for attractive women in bikini and mini-pants, although they see it, will probably enjoy some other title, such as "Do Abroad" or "carry on the jungle" more. The emergence of feminism in the early 1970s is used as a plot of equipment that seems to be quite self-evident.
