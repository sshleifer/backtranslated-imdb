There is nothing good to say about this movie. Read the revolution for this hell or another of his writings. Abbie was often left as a clown-prince of the 1960s, but he was a man of ideas who used his intelligence, sense of humor and pop culture and his proud personalities to draw attention to his ideas. Too often, the media focused on people, not on ideas, and that is the problem with this film. Later he lived under depression. But this flick is like the version of Abbie's National Reviewer. He deserves a better one. If you don't know Abbie or her times, this movie won't help. <br /> <br /> This movie is on. I'll give her zero. <br /> <br />
