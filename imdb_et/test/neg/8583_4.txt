For the horror movie, it is a criminal boring. Some memorable, terrible bits can't really compensate for a bad script. Very little coherence is achieved, and the film consistently transcends one of the basic ideas (killer cat) until it becomes repetitive - and things become even worse if the cat is constantly captured from the perspective of the cat.
