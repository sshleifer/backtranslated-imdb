According to http: //blog.ifeng.com/article/2737487.html, one film actor Carina Lau was forced to appear for free in this film. He was the victim of a notorious robbery shortly before this film was made, and subsequent photos of his trouble were published in a magazine that has since been forced to close and sent to the publisher. The actor denies that he was attacked, but the film leaked to the network, which allegedly showed him that he was raped. (The Hong Kong press, which is honored by him, has mostly refused to report this incident, but some articles will appear on Google.)
