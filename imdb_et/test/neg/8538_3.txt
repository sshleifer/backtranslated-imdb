First, editing this movie consisted of one big mistake that I didn't understand how it was lost - you can consistently see the microphone in and out. When I saw it for the first time, I just said "well, mistakes happen" and brush it off. About a tenth time it started to be incredibly irritating and disturbingly funny. If you haven't seen the movie yet, try reading how many times you see the microphone; can be a pretty interesting game. <br /> <br /> Movie. This movie started with a pretty "ghost" story; but the plot spins at the end just ruining it completely. You start watching the film, provided that the TV ads suggest that the haunted house consists of ghosts that can only be seen by children; especially small children, which makes it even more insecure because they are unable to effectively warn the family about the impending danger. Open scene did a good job of misleading the audience that it would remain a prerequisite for the film. ** (SPOILER) ** The film begins with a family that is accused and ultimately killed with invisible force at home. The idea that only children see these ghosts is triggered when the daughter asks her baby at the beginning of the movie that she tells her where "it" is right before "it" grabs her and pulls her to yell in the basement. The young boy also feels this "invisible force" that kills his mother after hiding him under the bed. After killing his family, the boy tries to run and hide to throw it away. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie started with a terrible movie where the family would be hidden by "invisible power", whose only hope of survival would be based on two-year-old surveys. It began to destroy the film less than half as the daughter began to see the ghosts; completely destroying "only children see" the illusion that ads and the opening scene present. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the movie wasn't actually "destroyed" until the plot ends. A person who has assisted the family will grow a farm who is responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the film. Suddenly, after being attacked by the shadows, the man clicks and tries to kill his mother, daughter and son who have a psychotic breakdown, in which he believes they are his family; what he died at first. <br /> <br /> The whole plot twisted just a whole list of unresolved issues and left me wtf. First, why were the family souls left in the house? When the director went to the approach of Ju-On (The Grudge), where the family, after a terrible death, worshiped the house and killed who enters, why was the haunting stop after his father was "stuck" by his family's ghosts? When the ghosts only wanted to kill the man who killed them, why did they attack the new family? Here's another one for you. It takes several months for the seeds to be sown until the plants fully bloom for harvesting. It tells me that a man who initially killed his family, a man whom the ghosts apparently bribed for the whole film, had lived for six months. All this time the ghosts could not kill him? <br /> <br /> This film contained a lot of fear of the clich√© "movie of fear" and the obvious combination of other horror films. But I say that this movie can still be pulled out well, if not at the end of the plot. It's just like they just ran out of their budgets and just threw the end. Because this film would have been successful, they would have kept the "only children see them" as a prerequisite, and ended up with a family that barely escaped or was initially killed as a family (would have opened the door) with a possible sequel.
