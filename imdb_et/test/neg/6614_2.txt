I looked at it very terrified and my fear was justified, it seems. What was this movie? Knight? Season? Players? What? It was all over the place all the time. There was no tension (sorry, we all knew Bobby was going to throw curses and things out), but the fine actor Brian Denehy has met with anger and gave zero tensions. Cheaply shot like a MacGiver episode. Contrast this Thanksgiving main room with the work of HBO Don King's "America Only" to show you how to make sports biopsy, warts and everything. Note that ESPN promoted hell out of it and never showed it again?
