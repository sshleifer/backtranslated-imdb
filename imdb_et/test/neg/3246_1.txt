Hi, this is the worst film I've ever seen in my life. On the day I watched this movie, I had a high fever. But still I watched the movie with a lot of patience. And after watching the movie, I felt repentance. Because I wasted this stupid movie after 3 hours. I could have rested rather than watch this movie. And I was really surprised to see actors such as Sunny Deol, Akshay Kumar Aftab and so on. <br /> <br /> I don't understand if directors can't find a good story about film making, so why do they remain directors? Why can't they sit at home and spend time at home? <br /> <br /> I ask all directors to have a good story if they don't want to send a nice story to the target group via mail or media, newspapers, radio, etc., if they don't. I will apply again to all directors, please do not make such films.
