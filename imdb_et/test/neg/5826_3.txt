First of all, I should like to note that I loved Winnie The Pooh as a child and I really enjoyed the Tigger movie, even though I am in my 20's. <br /> <br /> But this movie was so bad that I was ashamed of being a young fan. <br /> <br /> OK, OK I know this is a movie for kids and it's not for any other people like me anyway, but that's my thoughts on the movie for my other people. age. <br /> <br /> The main downfall in this movie is itself a heffalump, it must be the most annoying thing I've seen in a child's movie (maybe even more annoying than a young child in Monsters Inc). It has the most annoying voice and talks about singing stupid things and even more foolish comments, I know that Pooh movies aren't exactly high, but it was offensive even for 2-year intelligence! <br /> <br /> Second - Where was the story? The previous Pooh outing was the least - yes, I see it was the reception of a different person in your heart, but it really ended and I felt like I was watching a 5-minute comic on children's TV. br /> <br /> I have no children of my own, but if I am going to show them a quality film such as Tigger Movie, Toy Story and Nemo (though they are too kids for me). I see how they would be very fond of small children. Not so terrible with this movie. <br /> <br /> And another thing - NO ENOUGH Eeyore! He should have his own movie!
