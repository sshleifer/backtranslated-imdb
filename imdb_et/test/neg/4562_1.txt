I think if you like watching the dudes, you can "pump" to the outrageous sizes, that's right at your alley. Otherwise it is an exercise in egos. I don't have to do that. Anyway, it is of historical interest, I think to see how these muscle positive and brain-negative wedges got this way (before / after / between steroids), but otherwise it doesn't affect many men and like women, I am not so I can't say.
