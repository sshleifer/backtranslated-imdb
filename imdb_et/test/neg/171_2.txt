Oh God! It can be a very interesting movie and actually it is. I would like to give it 5, but I will give my vote to 2. Why? I saw it in the theater! Watch this movie on DVD or on TV! Shooting is really NOW !!!!! It keeps the shaking constantly, totally tasteless! <br /> <br /> It's very painful to see this very interesting movie in the movie theater. You have a fast hospital and you have to make a great effort not to tear your neighbor's seat! <br /> <br /> It's really a shame "cos, the story is edited in a nonlinear way, which is quite rare for the documentary (and a very good idea!). <br /> <br /> Watch it at home!
