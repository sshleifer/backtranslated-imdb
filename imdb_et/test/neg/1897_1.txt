God, I hated this movie! I saw it in a hidden preview 13 years ago and I still have a bad setback. It was undoubtedly the WORST movie I ever saw. It was badly written, poorly targeted and (surprisingly weighed) badly acted. I'd rather throw the roof razor into sharp studs and then peel my skin when I sit back. Do you think I didn't enjoy it?
