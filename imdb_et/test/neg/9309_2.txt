This film was a bad film. The plot was poor and the comedy they "tried" came out badly. Accidents seem to be well established and predictable. I thought the actors were trying to some extent, but for this movie it was so flat that it could only go so far. One of the worst films I've seen and don't recommend to anyone. The only accident with Mr. Accident was that he was released.
