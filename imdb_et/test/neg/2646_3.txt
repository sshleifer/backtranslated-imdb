Although it was a well-told story, I found it too unpleasant. The main issue is child abuse, which can never be seen. Add a drunk wife and a small child to GD that not only - and this movie turned me off as I saw it. <br /> <br /> Here are also two small boys picking up, another unpleasant viewing experience. The story of realism takes swan diving when one of the boys fly home with a plane! Give me a break! <br /> <br /> The only positive, enjoyable part of this movie is to see a beautiful, loving and touching relationship between two young brothers, played by Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello. In the next few years, the latter became familiar with the great roles of face in Jurassic Park, Shadlowlands and Wild River. The wood, of course, did not hit it much before the decade later, but it made it a great trilogy in the Lord of the Rings. These two children and the stories from Tom Hanks are the only aspects of the film that I liked.
