I'm a secretary in the video shop, so I'm trying to see the movies we put out every week. I have no problems with it; Actually, I feel it's a privilege. Not so with this movie. . . After an hour and a half of our hero who was hit by the scene and rebelled, I really wondered if they were going to the point. I felt I should pay for it to look at at home. And if I knew there was one more hour that I should endure, I could have quit it right away. I don't care about the characters, filming was remarkable and Ford made the kiss look. Even the score was inconsistent. What waste.
