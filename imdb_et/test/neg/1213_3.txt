I was pleasantly surprised by this. It's actually quite interesting and interesting. The cast is strong, even Dan Cortese. Brooke Shields has come to his actress. Black and White must be really free, because I have never seen him in such an ordinance playing the usual character. If it is marketed correctly, it can be a medium-sized blow.
