STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Danny (Mel Raido) is a lone factory worker trying to get his work and be a good father to his two daughters after his mother's dirty divorce (Maxine Peake.) But after she had worked with her daughters at the men's club, she uses her dance class to take a look at Louis (Colin Salmon) and her wealthy men who train in a boxing box / free weight section and train yourself for a tougher, more confident person. Before long, he has taken the philosophies of Louis into his heart and joined him as a nightclub concierge, as the 80's disco faze strikes ... but when Sparky's (Scott Williams) companion tries to evade drug trafficking, everything becomes pear-shaped. <br /> <br /> Like Robert De Niro's film A Bronx Tale, there is no greater tragedy than a waste of talent. The club game writer had a good idea and talent to make it a movie ... but without it seemingly able to put it into some kind of coherent film. <br /> <br /> Brummie had some shooting locations (especially at the end of a pub outside Moseley) quite simple and fun on the spot ... but the cinematic look of the twilight is actually a downfall of things. Some are really poor, such as the leader actor Raido, who has an ubiquitous uneven accent, and the hammy script, which has a wrong connection dialog, has bigger problems for the film. More well-established players such as Peake and even the favorite of Neil Morressey have been excluded from the very small support elements, while the catastrophic Raido and Ronnie Fox flat layman are central. Williams makes a poor man's sick boy Trainspotting, leaving Salmon and Shaun Parkes seemingly the only remaining performers, because of the excess blood splattered violence (which is the general trend of Brit flicks)! Really missed the opportunity. **
