What was on earth? My family and I just created our life for 2 hours for this garbage !!! There were no plots, no tension, but a lot of boredom !!! My kids can make better movies with our video camera. <br /> <br /> But we just didn't get a movie point ... oh wait, my mom did. He was the only one who liked it for the following reason: "At least a movie without cars" ... If you are looking for a warfare with no fight, it is still interesting and engaging and has a strong anti-war message, you should look at "Trench". <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie 10 out of 10 because it's good enough in the afternoon and I'm too nice ...
