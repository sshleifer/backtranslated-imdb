This movie is all that is worth making movies. The main actor surprises her audience because she doesn't act at all. We have to look at our blissful breath for almost two hours. Jokes are all flat I never laughed when there was a Saturday night with 5 people who had a beer laugh, and then put it on and you felt that all the heat and color was empty. The movie ended and the mood was destroyed, so we all went our way, destroyed the night! OK both pros and cons. Pros, beautiful places in Hawaii, look good on bluray. None worse than ever; You can say that everyone involved is just thinking about payday. Predictable poor plot. Near-zero development. Forced jokes that fall gradually. Many boys from the penis, which are fair, work better and have more charisma. Are all the makers of this film hanging their heads in shame and keeping their cunning manhood cheap.
