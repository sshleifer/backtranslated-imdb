Although the film has a pretty stylish look for a very low budget indie, that's not what I'm looking for for a movie. There were no signs I found sympathetically, they all seemed to be totally losers. All they are trying to do is too hopeless for me. Reviews refer to Puffy Tool as a black comedy ... comedy? Brother Rhett behaves like a rescuer of an institution. When Josh talks to his girlfriend Emily about his brother, he almost sees Rhett not playing with a full-fledged man. However, Josh Rhett's "wedding" and Rhett met a couple of hours before. Some of the characters on the roads were some interesting. But for me, the most telling thing was that people walked out of the movie ... and I saw it free screening.
