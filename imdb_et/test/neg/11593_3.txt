This movie is fun, which is better than looking at two creatures with each other? GIANT cgi versions of animals that fight! But I need one of the weapons used in the film. Because they probably use fraud. Count the number of techniques they use before ... o Wait, it's right if they never need to recharge. Regardless of how many shots ... it's fun. <br /> <br /> The sound effects of Komodo film vary from tiger to ivory. Oh and did I forget to mention that these GIANT Komodo dragons are obviously hell? Because somehow, even when the actors look at the beast's origin, they are surprised when it comes out. <br /> <br /> If someone dies, you can say it comes because they're all against it, they put their hands on the air and overcome to save themselves ... it never works. <br /> <br /> The ultimate pearl is that these scriptwriters' brain is just gland knowledge. With "facts" like both creatures are amphibious comments like "helpless animals", they are just full of fun facts.
