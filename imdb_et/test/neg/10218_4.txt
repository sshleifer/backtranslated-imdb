This formal film (a hero's girlfriend marrying a villain) just didn't move fast enough, considering some of the story's circumstances. Scott seems to be too old at this age and too many times his character is turning to decisive action, emptying scenes. He reacts weakly to the death of some of his hands; he escapes from the Knox gang, hiding himself from a full-blown rainbow; his escape to high countries and John Russell's action seem superfluous, as is much of the film. The plot could have been tightened. <br /> <br /> High points in the movie: See "Tennessee" Ernie Ford without singing "Man in Saddle" without a mustache; Alfonso Bedoya too short scenes for a cook; high country color photography and fighting with John Russell.
