"It's like this city is able to suck its brain directly from its head." -Patti <br /> <br /> Patti (Christina Ricci) is a sarcastic teenage girl who gets bored with her too middle-sized city. It is boring until the woman is kidnapped and she finds what she believes is the position of a poor woman. Now, with his valuable "D.C" cat. and the failed FBI agent (Doug E. Doug) must find him. <br /> <br /> This Darn Cat is a bad movie. It's pretty stupid and has humor that often falls fairly smooth. However, it has some talent buds. Doug E. Doug was cool at Cool Runnings. His Senga production was really funny. Here he is wasted as an outbreaking FBI agent. However, he has a good scene when he imitates the cat. Micheal Mckean plays Patti's father. His character must be the most sensible parent who ever lives. This bad guy is his precious cigar crushed, he can be arrested for picking up his own cat, and his ridiculous wife gets caught and STILL is not angry at his daughter for all his troubles. I want my old man to be like that. The only real good result is Christina Ricci. He amuses himself with the constantly annoyed Patti, but his occasionally bad dialogue draws his report. You can also recognize Peter Boyle (Young Frankenstein, Everybody Loves Raymond), old lady Wings and Cliff Cheers. This is a film that all these actors will probably forget. Even a cat is not very good ... I really can't recommend this Darn Cat in 1997. Some small children (under 8 years old) can enjoy it a bit, but everyone should look elsewhere. If you are looking for a good Christina Ricci movie, I offer Addams' family values, sexual contrast or a sleepy cavity. If the fun family movie is what you are after, try the snow day instead. <br /> <br />
