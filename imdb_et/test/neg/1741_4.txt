Uzumaki, which means "spirals", reaches this new wave of Asian horror movies, such as hits such as Ring, Ju-On and The Eye (two of them are remakes .. and many more like Dark Water and Tale of Two Sisters)), does not match the horrible supernatural thriller element that is so characteristic of other films, the only thing that remains is weird and not tim Burton or David Lynch's kind, but irrelevant and boring. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, there is a girl, another boy who is on her, her best friend and a father who is obsessed with Uzumakis! Everything that happens is about Uzumak, people die and you see Uzumaki. So okay, it goes with it, I'm having fun with the spirals, it doesn't seem like the characters go anywhere, but I play together. We know that the city is cursed in Uzumakis, people start to yell at Uzumaki and the point is in Uzumaki everywhere, the film is a disaster, do not know where to go, except to show you the strength of Uzumakis !!!! !!!!! There are some cool concepts when a mother cuts her fingers because she sees Uzumak on her fingerprints, but then there is another scene she hears about her husband (outside the grave!) Tell her she also has a ear in Uzumakis, they were talking about the scene was just ridiculous, not even cheerful fun, there are also some (little) cool visuals, such as a collection of father in Uzumakis and a girl with hair in Uzumakis. But from the context, it seems that it was taken out of the Fruit Snack van, where eating the Uzumakis fruit snacks is so unbelievable that your hair turns into Uzumak, now that it wasn't suddenly bad, has Snail Men .. or ManSnails failed? ? what ever?? and you know why? right? Because their choirs have Uuuuzuuumaaakiii? It was only enough time to stop the end of the climate, and by that time I was friggin 'uzumakis .. uzumaki here, there, sure, look around, how many Uzumakis do you find? If you want to see a movie about spirals, see PI (3.1416), you will find some pretty cool concepts of life meaning and Dark City is a bit of a spiral thing. <Br>> <br /> This movie could have been a music video, it has already accumulated a cult and that is why I was forced to see it, but after that I am not sure why people think it is great. I was really disappointed.
