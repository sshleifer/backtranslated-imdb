When I heard the man leader said, "It's madness!" one more time I would have been barfied. The film is one big clich√© where counterfeit "grinds him under his jug". No male in this film guarantees quality; reminds me of strongly politically oriented messages in the Soviet era. I couldn't even understand why there was an attraction between the drivers, and I couldn't wait for the end.
