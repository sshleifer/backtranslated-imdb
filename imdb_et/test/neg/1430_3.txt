Dee Snider is a villain in this movie and his bad behavior and excessive breaking is destroyed for me. The whole movie seemed too serious. He tries to achieve the "Seven" dark atmosphere without good action. The film highlights the "subculture" of the city's industrial stone / tattoo / body art, and we hope that the size of the man's nose ring will make us amaze (fear?). I'm not a film expert, but the script and action in this movie is just terrible. Dee Snider looks like a villain, but her eyes are terrible. I do not recommend wasting this time if there is nothing else.
