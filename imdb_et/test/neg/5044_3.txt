Gargoyle begins in late evening in 1532 in Romania, as the peasant girl (Daniela Nane) runs her horse and trolley, holding her company down as she falls down from attacking clouds above the living Gargoyle and attacks her. Sometimes a castle is described where the local villagers and the angry mobile of the priest can stop Gargoyle, or they think ... Cut today's Bucharest, where two CIA agents Ty Griffin (Michael Pare) & Jennifer Wells (Sandra Hess) are planning to negotiate a rich American ambassador's son to return safely over their kidnappers. Griffin loses his building on the roof of one of the kidnappers, but finds great blood vessels and visible signs of what happened to him. At the same time, Dr. Christina Durant (Kate Orsini) and her colleague Richard Barrier (Jason Rohrer) are renovating the church when Church worker Gregor (Mihai Bisericanu) tells Richard that he has found some ancient remains, two are exploring and finding a cave with many slippery cocoons and one very angry and very alive Gargoyle, who doesn't waste time killing both of them. Griffin & Wells is in case they are lost and soon realize that local priests, named Father Soren (Fintan McKeown), are planning to flood the world with them ... /> Compiled, co-produced and directed by Jim Wynorsk, his usual pseudonym Jay Andrews Gargoyles is another masterpiece of Wynorski you can add to your credit, not. Wynorski, Ion Ionescu, A.G. The Lawrence & Bill Munroe manuscript is crap, unexciting, boring and as easy as you can. To begin with, I would like to know if there was only one Gargoyle who put all these eggs on, because I'm pretty sure he wouldn't have made himself pregnant. How did it stay in that hole for 500 years? What does it eat? How did the priest know that it existed? Why didn't anyone else ever think of it? Why did the priest want to flood the world? To manage it? Gargoyles doesn't bother the world and then some priests just let this king hold and when they did what was left to rule? Like the men written for Gargoyle, he doesn't think he thought he did it well? Regardless of how I look at it, no matter which one approaches it, no matter which angle I try to figure it out, no matter how many times I try to throw a square. , loses logic and isn't so big to start anyway. The characters are boring and clich√©s, repetitive and non-fulfilling, when the film as a whole is a real tree. People are doing illogical things and everything that happens is far from comfortable when the priest tries to convince Griffin that Gargoyle is there and one suddenly appears and attacks them. A cave full of caves is Aliens (1986) that is embarrassing and the end was flat. The little big Ferris Wheel at the fair was funny, though the boy scoffed at the high boys' fear and forced him to go to it. <br /> <br /> Director Wynorski reduces the film footage of other films In fact, Gargoyle's best scene is traveling through Bucharest, but it was taken from Jean-Claude Van Damme's feature Maximum Risk (1996). There are no shocks, fears or atmosphere. Special effects are terrible, CGI Gargoyle looks like it belongs to a computer game and has little interaction with living cast members, there are a lot of scenes from people looking for heaven and trying to appear wretched. It is not even worthwhile to make things traceable, there is one terrible decapitation and it is. <br /> <br /> Technically, the special effects are terrible, but otherwise it's satisfactory, Romanian locations are suitably Romanian. Gargoyle went straight to the video and shows it quite cheaply. There is not much work to do, Michael Pare, a person who bypasses personality, makes dull heroes. <br /> <br /> Gargoyle has a nonsense movie, it doesn't work for everything a decent creature should strive to achieve. 90 minutes total, if I'm worried.
