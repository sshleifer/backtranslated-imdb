To be honest, how hard is it to make a good transformation? Probably pretty hard! I was so excited to see it because I loved the original, and my friends go and see it and tell me it's actually sucking. Well, I see it finally and I was so disappointed. Ok, the shower scene was more realistic ... that's why I gave it to 3. Otherwise, she was sucked. Vince Vaughn is doing a terrible job with Norman, he's just too tight or something. I don't know, it was just terrible. Don't look at it!
