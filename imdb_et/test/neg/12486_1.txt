I'm a big fan of Zack Allan and I was disappointed that he only got one scene in the movie. It was also my favorite scene where he seized the character's weapons and dropped him down. Unfortunately, unlike the third room and the soul river, most of the operations took place from the station. I don't care about Garibaldi after the first three seasons and I think Sheridan is fine, but not Sinclair. I like Lochley, but he only had a limited time. If you like Crusade or Space Battles, you should enjoy it. Personally, I can only give it 1/10.
