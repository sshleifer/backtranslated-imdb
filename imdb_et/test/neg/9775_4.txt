This horror story takes place in the Namibian desert of Africa. The Canadian system analyst, Zach Straker (Scott Bairstow), is sent to the diamond mining company. Although he hates field work, he finds himself with a rescue worker in a truck that is open to the sand dunes and whipping in the open desert, blowing sand. Four diamond discoverers are found ... discovered in their scattered bones. In the long cold desert evening, a shape-changing monster appears. Zach and his colleagues are frightened when their truck is closed and members of the unit die terribly one by one. There is no character development; not to mention dialogue. The desert on its roads is beautiful and without giving away ... the creature is as old as the desert region. Rachel Shelley, Warrick Grier and Patrick Shai are also cast.
