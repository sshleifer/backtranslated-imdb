Well, 1st out, I haven't seen the silence of the lambs yet ... but I think I'd be sick if I had seen it before. Not for the terrible violence, but for the lack of everything else. Anthony Hopkins was very good when Hannibal and I really believed he was as psychotic as he was playing, but from the audience around me, the film was full of "Silence" clich√©s that didn't get me losing points. where others smiled while on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now I heard the film was very tough and when the director wanted the nations ... he did it ... but only in 2 sequences? I want to say that if you want it to be tough and I mean so hard that you want to play this movie ... you need more than 2 sequences .. I can see it whenever the film needs to change to the cinematic art that ultimatley takes you to another place and time or goes over the top spot (which most of the time is done with bad taste). But this movie was sitting on my seat and sleeping at times. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore are movie stars, right? Well, except for Hopkins, I didn't know that. Who cares about a stupid Italian police officer? I didn't define. So, really, there is a big hole in the film that talks about a man who dies anyway. I mean, come on ... who cares? <br /> <br /> In short, the movie is good if you want to see a lecturer and Starling, but if you really want a good thriller. you can jump once and maybe twice. Depends on your level. <br /> <br /> Thinking about how much money this movie will bring ... it is probably another "Hannibal", and this movie will probably not miss the video until the fall. If you need to see it .. wait and save $ 3.50 - $ 4.00 and get this video. Don't spend big bucks on this film.
