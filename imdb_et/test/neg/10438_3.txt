A similar story that has been done many times before, and it was not an improvement. <br /> <br /> 15 minutes into it, and you should pretty much be able to turn it off - the end was deja vu again. <br /> <br /> The only moral I have seen about it is: - stupidity + criminals are not equal successes - if he screwed you before, he will do it again
