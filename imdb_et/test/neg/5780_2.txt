Alexandra Maria Lara: Very beautiful and attractive woman, but not a good actor. In all the films I have seen him, it seems to me that he is just as accurate. Is it DOWNFALL, NACKT, VOM SUCHEN UND FINDEN DER LIEBE and now WO IST FRED! She is always (playing?) A young, good-hearted woman who is a bit naive and doesn't know how to deal with her. He probably has a repertoire of five different facial expressions, which he works richly. I personally find it hard to believe that he can play a mysterious and slightly unpleasant character because it's not just here. So he is familiar as a neighbor's pretty girl he is, but he's not ready to sniff yet. Til Schweiger: Same! Movie: Foolish. Because it was an American film, Adam Sandler would have a big role I don't like. I was not offended by the fact that this is a film with disabled people, I thought the jokes that came from it were not funny at all. I smiled two or three times, but when I was halfway, I was just bored and annoyed and wanted to finish this flick.
