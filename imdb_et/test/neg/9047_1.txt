Snore gore. I saw this terrible, stinky, precious, junk in the Cameo movie house (now Crobar nightclub) in Washington's Avenue's South Beach in 1980s or 81s. I was 17 years old and my three friends and I laughed at this terrible, big, trash. The theater was on its feet and mostly snoring and sleeping on the spot. They didn't get anything angry. The worst ever acting. These actors deserve the Academy Award for the worst and I mean the worst roles in cinema history. Joke was, theater was another Mi Mi Lay (at least name!) Stinker ... barf city. That's enough. If you are under 12, you may get some chills. Over 12 years of age you will snore after the opening credit. It's just amazing that someone spent a penny on making this movie. And I think it's considered a "cult" classic. YUK !!!!
