I looked at this episode with great hope after seeing it in the list of so many people's "favorite episodes". I do not boast in any way, but from the outset I realized that they are in some kind of ring fabric / can look at these types of characters with great eyes. While the whole episode is "Who are we?", "Where are we?" Between the episode (which I unfortunately had already thought out), I have to say that the different types of characters and their interactions made the episode interesting enough. Although the story may be harder to guess if all of them were (toy) soldiers.
