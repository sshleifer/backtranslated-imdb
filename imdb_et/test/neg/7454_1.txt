This is by far the worst thing I've ever seen on film. My uncle's home movies have more talent than this piece. The summary of this scheme is basically that these twin-kick-boxers play some kind of hospital survival game with a man and his personal army. The man is a very cheap paper machine looking for a hand. <br /> <br /> It is terrifying in this movie. There are changes in the scene when the hat is falling. For example, at least 30 seconds we see a man who moves himself, which adds something to the film. This is the worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life. I don't think this movie will get worse than it already is. I'd describe that I want to be Chuck Norris's action film went wrong. And I hate Norris.
