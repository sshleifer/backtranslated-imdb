My friends and I've just finished previewing this new Australian movie. Anyone who was in the cinema agreed what the idea of ​​this movie was? There was no good story to follow, no characters were developed and the plot seemed unmotivated. I find it odd that this film, which is likely to cost millions, was financial and made. It does not give the drama community any purpose, it does not add the Australian cinema palette. It was a waste of time, creating this droll-unemployed job and more time should really be used for work-shopping scripts and good stories that don't create such confusion. Hugo Weaving and Rose Byrne were fine, but the bad script prevented them seriously. The character of Pia Miranda was unnecessary and abstract from the plot and her lines were the best. A real waste of talent. Sustainable grace was Geoffrey Simpson's ACS cinematography, which, like most Aussie films, was great. <br /> <br /> Come on guys, think about it next time. <br /> <br /> 4/10
