EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (Cameo: Jon Stewart as itself) Strengthened the "sequel" to "BRUCE ALMIGHTY" with Carell's retractor ensemble, Evan Baxter, who left the TV as his worshiper. The ripped hands of Congress are full when God (Freeman repeats his sacred role; Jim Carrey wisely kept away) demands that he build a ship like Noah and have fun (or should be). The Steve Oedeker, Joel Cohen, and Alec Sokolow's goddess sitcom-y script is completely flat and only Carelli's friendly person crosses his ineffective Evan into a human being. The end result is a lot of bird's claws and general swelling (probably $ 175 million for CGI F / X). Sykes steals the exhibition as Evan's sarcastic assistant. Sacrilegiously unfunny.
