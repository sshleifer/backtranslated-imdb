I saw a big screen in reality. I saw it as part of a double function in the early 1980s (not remembering another movie) when I was in my teens. The film is bad, bad. Embarrassingly bad. The effects are cruel (you can clearly see that the cable pulls the black girl through the floor). There's nothing frightening about that. Actually, I laughed at the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The story attempted to create this great structure when we finally have to see who is responsible for all the evil cases and seeing booming Victor Buono, who is as frightening as Twinkie. Seriously, what do they think? Buono, who was a criminal in Batman's TV series, is one of the most annoying actors ever making a big screen of grace, and I just can't imagine anyone being afraid of him. <br /> <br /> ERIL is all but forgotten now (for good reasons), but it is actually a very funny movie and I wish I could see this turkey again to see that the black girl is pulled all over the room by invisible force visible cable.
