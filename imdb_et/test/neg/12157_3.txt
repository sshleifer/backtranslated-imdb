Waiting for this movie for a while. In the first day of air in Turkey I watched it. It was completely disappointing for me. I was going to watch a historical movie, but it was fictional on the screen. First, the main character of Cengiz Han was depicted, a great conquest, such as soft, calm, even loser. You don't know the power of the movie. Historically, his war machine was conquered in the years (even more) in the world. To do this, Cengiz first connects Asian tribes. But in the film, this loser man is in a poor person and in the second scene he tells the armies. War scenes were incredibly weeks. In the final battle, the Mongolian rider used double swords on his sides and created an enemy. :) As a result, I and my friends just laugh at scenes. The Mongolian army means the Mongol archery. You can't see this in the movie. Another sick thing was the use of fantastic elements in the film. I do not want to go to the scene depicted as Cengiz as a prophet. In film integrity, we can say that it is acceptable. However, when the old monk saw the future and went to find Cengiz Khan's wife after Cengiz gave her a mission, it is really funny. When a monk died in the desert, Cengiz's wife feels it dead and finds the body on the continent. Are we talking about Asia? We laughed again. There are many more things to say, but I don't feel that this film has more value to talk about.
