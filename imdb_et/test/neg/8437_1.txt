This movie begins as comedy. Almost it seems that actors read smart cards, especially at the airport. William Smith plays "Caribe", a hunter's role that is quite twisted and corrupted. Smith seems to have always played a rogue like "The Ultimate Warrior" (1975) and "Frisco Kid" (1979) to name a few, although in this movie it seems a ridiculous role to be ridiculous. This is one of those films where meaningless things happen only to fill the screen time, such as a sequential girl at the beginning of a girls' sequence and a long silly motorcycle. I'll give this movie 1/10. I would have liked to see this movie "Mystery Science Theater" that would have been fun.
