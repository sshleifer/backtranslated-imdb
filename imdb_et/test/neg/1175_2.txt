Ed Gein: The Plainfield butcher was founded in the United States in Plainfield, Wisconsin, in 1957, when a single Ed Gein (Kane Hodder) lives on a farm after his death after his mother and brother. Local police have had many robberies to deal with, and when the local bars Sue Layton (Ceia Coley) grow, something unpleasant is happening. Ed is a violent sexually deviant man who kidnaps these girls and murders them, whether the police see the truth in time to save Eric (Adrienne Frantz) Sheriff's (Timothy Oman) daughter ... <br /> <br /> produced and directed by Michael Feifer it was an attempt to recreate a horror movie about real events that surround Edward, a notorious serial killer, and turn out to be a real mess. Actual Life Ed Gein had died in 1982 for only two murders and was inspired by several films including Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Deranged (1974) and Ed Gein (2000). the worst Gein movie ever. Although Ed Gein was something real beside this film, Gein has never been an accomplice, none of his victims were involved with any investigator, there was no victim of a car accident, although Gein retains his name as other people have changed names, the abduction and murder of the two women depicted here actually it was four years in reality, but this movie takes a couple of days, and although Gein is shown here as a large number of muscular man. she was dirty, thin, old and pretty short. Like the factual drama Ed Gein: The Plainfield butcher is worthless and pure entertainment is not better than a deadly dull pace and I feel the character is boring and if he didn't kill anyone Gein is shown to be working or just walking around and it's very boring. There's no relationship, because we know who the killer is and it's just a tedious wait until he finally catches up. There is no real attempt to get into Gein's mind with those who do not give him more motivation than the hallucinations of his mother. </p> <p> </p> hang a meat-hook, there is really a poorly edited Gein scene that cuts off the legs, there are ordinary body and skull cans that are around, as well as some blood, but here's not really much excitement. The film was obviously bleached to bleach many colors because it is not black and white from time to time, I personally think that the lack of color makes it even fader. <br /> <br /> Probably with a budget of about $ 1,500,000, I don't really see where the money went very forgotten. Although it's set in Wisconsin, it was filmed in California. Kane Hodder is all wrong about Ed Ge's role from a physical point of view Hodder doesn't even look like Gein and he's pretty bad when he just looks at a camera that makes a lot of stupid faces. br /> <br /> Ed Gein: The Plainfield builder is a mess and it's so simple and straightforward. For real drama or pure exploitation, it's a complete beginning to end and nothing to suggest.
