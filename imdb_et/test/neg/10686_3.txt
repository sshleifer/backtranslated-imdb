Animal eating (geek) scenes were not as bad as you might think. After watching Mondo Cane and Mondo Magic, these scenes are average. The toughest thing was when the man dropped his head off the mouse. But they were so quick and few that they didn't bother me. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the movie was just interesting. I always like listening to stupid voices. They don't sound like what you think the actress / actress sounds like in real life. I liked the bright colors of princesses. The strange looking flaws were cool. The youngest princess seemed really young, almost 14 or something. Fighting scenes were not as long and boring as most fighting scenes, so it was good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
