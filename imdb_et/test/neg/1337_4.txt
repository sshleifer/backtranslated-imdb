The renewal of Clare Booth Luce's game and the 1939 film is a great disappointment. Casting women is great, most single scenes work, but nothing hangs together. There is almost no correlation between the scene and the scene, as the film is partially made and then assembled in a vacuum. A recognized story about a woman who is dealing with her husband's infidelity and how to help and prevent her friends is less shocking right now, when divorce is so common, but at the same time it is as timely as she would have liked to have all the pieces together Because, as it is now, you don't feel really drawn up. Wait for the cable.
