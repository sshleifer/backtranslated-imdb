I love John's work as a singer, but seeing the movie was boring and "not worth it". <br /> <br /> I thought he was doing "ok" to do his job. When he says, "Your attitude to being" with a man ", to his companion, I smiled at his face movements ... or the lack of it. <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie if you like John's music, but not the Saturday night video. <br /> <br /> If you love your music, this video has a little music, but not a lot.
