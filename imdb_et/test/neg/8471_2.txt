I looked at this cooking session a couple of times before I wanted to pull my hair out. Just one question ..... Who can't cook to eat with a normal meal in 30 minutes when all you need is at hand, already packed, sometimes pre-cut, and you have very little to do with some greens. Also, almost every TV show is cooking for 30 minutes and most of the cooks do their preparatory work (except Sandra Lee) during their show. Oh and yep .... they also do a full meal. <br /> <br /> Love the commentary of the hated man in the commentary. Add "DE-LISH" to my list of badge words. <br /> <br /> Then you have the obvious ... Loud, a gregarious woman who is truly her best audience. He laughs at his flat comments, gravel too many times, because he wants to convince us that he is as good as he thinks. <br /> <br /> NO, he's not the "sweetest thing." She is a 40-year-old woman who is not DE-LISH.
