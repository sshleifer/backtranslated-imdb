The author of Gipharts is a good and humorous book (of which Ik Ook van Jou is not the best), I was expecting this movie. I'm not stuck in the cinema, but after seeing it on the TV, I'm very happy that I bought it against the video. With a good book, they managed to make one of the worst films in Dutch film history. All the good parts are left out, the story has changed, not in favor. The whole humor is cut out. What's left is bad behavior, a dramatic, non-consistent film that I never want to look at again. work better at Giphart's topper Phileine zegt Sorry. Go see it!
