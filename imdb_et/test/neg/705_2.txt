First, let me start by saying I am Laurel and Hardy buff. I've read every book printed on them and I've seen all of my available movies more than once. I even took one chance and called Stan. He was very kind and spoke to me for over ten minutes. I followed the letter and wrote a letter to me. I still have this letter. <br /> <br /> This movie contains some good comedy moments, but Stan and Ollie are not in their usual form. Stan was seriously ill during production and seemed worse than ten years later. I think it's worth seeing all Laurel and Hardy films. <br /> <br /> But the ultimate opinion of this movie comes from the great Stan Laurel. Quote her: "This movie should never have been done."
