I can't believe it! I thought it was a good sequel when Jim had a child, but instead there was a movie with scenes of dirty actors, fools and fools. It should be "shrap t" in the movies "on earth". Thanks to God, the same director hasn't done it because it's so stupid that some of the cups like the will were not funny, not pee and not dancing! I laughed at how stupid a person did it as Homer Simpson was doing a movie about a donut! I wish someone would transform the woman's sons as such a plot! The mask guy (Jim wears) and his wife have a son who is a normal child. When the child finds another mask, he also became a mask and the mask boy tries to get his mask back! That's very nasty, so I'll give it one out of 10. Fu * king sh * t!
