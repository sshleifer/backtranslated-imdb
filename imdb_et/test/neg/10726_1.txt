Oh, my lord, what they thought about it. It is not only frantic, but worse, a very good original trash. Jane Fonda, believe it or not, actually turned to it in fulfilling her life. Even better than where he plays whore in his second life. Maybe he's just a flat good cramp. At any other time, wow what a waste of time. But he and Segal are competing beautifully, so if you even got a little funny with this child, try to catch the area it beat the mass. <br /> <br /> Because there is very little that one of them is, these horrors. Something in this baby is far from funny, except maybe a few moments when Dick and Jane swell as butterflies and kiss for kisses ..... and uhh ........ oh my lord, is that? Well, it looks like. <br /> <br /> This is really a bad movie.
