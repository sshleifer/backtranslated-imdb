Where do I start from the confusion on the ground, what is Darkhunters? First, the script is one of the worst to find your way to a movie or television screen, and it can only be described as a ripped off of the poorly rated Stephen King. At one point, the allegedly daunting dark red Jack claims that Carol, a girl who is helping a man he is doing, is as annoying as a "burger bat". I would like to laugh when I did it up-IF NOT! So ridiculous is how Carol originally came to see how people die. The cat gave it to her when she held it during the car accident when she was a child. Secondly, the horror film has no tension or danger. This may not be helped by the fact that all operations take place during harsh, wide daylight. Not very atmospheric at all. <br /> <br /> Third, the actress is really terrible, Pinion proves once again that she has to speak in her mother tongue to be even credible. Jeff Fahey is obviously an autopilot, but how to blame him when he runs through the disgraceful Humphry Bogart impersonalization as Barlow (Marlowe-Barlow? We get the fun that's just not funny). Credit should go to Susan Paterna, an actor I didn't know, she will do her terribly, what she owns, and put others, more experienced actors into shame. <br /> <br /> explained how a person understands what Van Husen's character says to him. Obviously, he has some degree in a foreign language. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, one moment is well done, a car accident with Susan. Sfx is completely believable and if it hadn't caused this fun story, it would have been commendable. <br /> <br /> All I can say about dark hunters is that the British horror never returns from its infinity when such films are continued and displayed. Avoid this movie like a plague, although the plague would be more scary. <br /> <br /> Darkhunters 0/5 <br /> <br /> p.s. The hints of other reviews that the film is too intelligent for some are honestly fun. This is a weak defense when some say "you didn't like it because you didn't understand it". Letters for my name give you no fool.
