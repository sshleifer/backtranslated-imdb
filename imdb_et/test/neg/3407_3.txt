I love watching good gorylo. Unfortunately, SOLANGE is certainly not one of them. It's long. Very long. The story is sticky and makes little sense, even if it is very obvious. The script spends so much time on killing and girls, but it doesn't kill the killer at all. It leaves a big gap: we can see that we see eleven young women showered together, but we can't reset why the killer decided to kill these girls. Yes, what happened to Solange is terrible, but we are still in the dark, when, why did the [boring] killer decide to go through the attack of these safe girls. It's all so clear that I didn't get it once. <br /> <br /> As for the film's appearance, it's boring again. Nothing is memorable about this. Actors? Bored. Script? Excitingly boring. The terrible love relationship between the teacher, the blonde and the student was really embarrassing. What planet do they live on? Music? Bored. Skip it.
