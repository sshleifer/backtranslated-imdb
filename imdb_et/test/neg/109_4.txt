Ben (Rupert Grint) is a very unhappy young man, the son of his unhappy married parents. His father (Nicholas Farrell) is a prince and his mother (Laura Linney) is ... well, he is a somewhat hypocritical soldier in the army of Jesus. This is only when he takes the summer job as an assistant with an unpleasant, eccentric, one-time celebrity, and now forgotten actor Evie Walton (Julie Walters) that she finds herself in the fashion of Harold and Maude. Of course, Evie is very unhappy and only when these two sad bags find each other that they can throw their mutual misery and defeat their luck. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is horny and sentimental and very predictable, but it also has a hard side, and Walters, who wanted to sleep with this type of stuff, is great. This is when he puts the madness on one side and finds the character's characteristic sins (like beating the bottle and throwing the sink) that he is his best. The problem is that he is the only interesting sign of the movie (and it doesn't come from a script that doesn't do anyone). But Grint isn't just unhappy; he is also a bit drilled, while Linney's starch female is completely one-dimensional. (However, he has an English accent turned off). The best thing to say is that it is easy to enjoy - with an emphasis on light.
