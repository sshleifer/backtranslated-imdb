It was not a very good film, where there were quite a few, and the effect was mostly bad. But there were some funny moments, but most of them were not funny. The most fun part of the movie for me was the part where the little boy fell in the wheelchair (this is not a funny part) What kind of person do you think the boy will fall out and yell at his big brother, the brother will run and the way the boy runs , it is so funny that it is all a stumbling block and I really had to roll it back several times so I could still laugh. so if you are looking for something to rent but just can't find anything, check it out and check out the current part.
