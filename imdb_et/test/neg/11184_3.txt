The price of a dream - and some dreams can be too expensive. <br /> <br /> This is the reason for the low rating of this viewer when viewing only the translated version of English. <br /> <br /> It made the whole movie poorer than the story I had hinted ... <br /> <br /> ... and other comments suggest that the subtitled version would be better. <br /> <br /> But some plot elements were left unexplained, leaving an unfinished feeling. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​"is there a series to follow?" <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it was no longer (at least at this stage).
