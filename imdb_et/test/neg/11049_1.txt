This comment is mainly intended to alert people who may be attracted to this (temporary) high user rating, which I think is fairly understandable. The reasons I did not like this title are: <br /> <br /> 1. The director must have doubts about whether to make a Jackie-Chan-type flick or a dark Oedipia tragedy. As a result, the film falls between two stools by genre, because tragic and comic elements are contradictory and void, not as a harmonious whole. <br /> <br /> 2. The motifs and behaviors of characters are inconsistent and convincing. Unfortunately, the psychological truth and logic have disappeared. <br /> <br /> 3. Absurd pouring. I do not blame the participants because it is a difficult thing to create a persuasive character acting alone when the script has little logic. But why is the obvious age difference between the leading two actors whose age in the film cannot differ by more than 3-4? <br /> <br /> 4. For me, the movie was a poor entertainment mainly because of point 2. When you finally learn why the main protagonist happened, it makes no sense. <br /> <br /> 5. Some movies other than entertainment are thought-provoking. Having seen this film, I began to wonder if the idea that the director tried to provoke was not that incessant relationships could be wholesome and enjoyable. I can't finish any other construction. <br /> <br /> 6. The film is full of unnecessary violence. Violence in film (and elsewhere) is good if it serves an important and worthy purpose. Goals can be different and I don't want to enter this broad topic. Let me just say that I do not dispute violence in films such as "Saving Private Ryan", "Christ's Passion" or "Pulp Fiction". In the "old", scenes of torture and suffering are longer and more graphic (or phonetic). Why? I do not know. Personally, I have no satisfaction with the teeth extraction with a hammer or hear the man cut off his tongue with scissors and then see him smother his blood, and so on. <br /> <br /> 7. The film reminds me of some Japanese porn manga when it was fixed to incest and young Asian girls' panties, urinating, etc. There seems to be a minority who actually enjoys such a thing. If you are one of them, you can enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> In short, I do not recommend this movie either as entertainment or as a "mindset". If it's not stupid, it's nasty. Don't waste your time.
