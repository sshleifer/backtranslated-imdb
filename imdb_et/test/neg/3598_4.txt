When I heard that they did, I was happy, because the first film was pretty good at a little short side. <br /> <br /> But I remembered some of the Disney Obstacles I watched earlier (im looking at you Little Mermaid 2). <br /> <br /> Anyway I looked at it and unfortunately I was very disappointed. The best thing is that the animation is great. This is really a special poleer that "right" Disney movies have. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the rest are disappointing. The story is serious all over the place. One moment it changes something, it becomes completely different and then it becomes completely different. It reminded me how Family Guy's film was like 3 separate episodes, turned into a movie. <br /> <br /> I laughed maybe once. Kronk was very funny in the original film, but it's not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie if no one gives it for free. <br /> <br /> 4/10
