Comparing this movie to Almodovar is an insult to Almodovar. The best thing I want to say about this is that he is desperately trying to be like an Almodovar movie and fails. The script is terrible, the characters are one-dimensional and the performances are high school drama quality (except for Marcia Gay Harden, which is pretty good considering the material she has to work on). In addition, cinematography absolutely does nothing to convey Gaudi's architecture or Barcelona's infectious charm. If you like the fine, sinful and darkness of Almodovar movies, exclusive comedy, you won't find any of them here. Spend your money on anything other than this celluloid residue.
