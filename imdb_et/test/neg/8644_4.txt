William Petersen (this C.S.I boy) has a small unacceptable role, but it is the best part of the film. His character goes through a smart ass and tough, and it's a fun surprise to see him. He has a range that allows him to play almost anything. After 5 minutes, it just looks cool. It leaves you with the hope that his character will appear in the movie again, but after 20 minutes you give up hope. The film itself is quite poor. It's worth looking at TMN or collecting a library, but not much else. Too much of this reminds you of L.A. Confidential, except that if this film begins to become complicated for itself, it will be so loose, it will lead everywhere, but where it should be. 2 out of 5 stars
