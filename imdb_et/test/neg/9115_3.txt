The "Animal Nature" setting is brilliantly simple and full of unlimited potential for an interim agreement: harried salesman Jack (very loyal to Lance Henriksen) is in trouble in the form of Adria (Eric Roberts), who appears to be accusing against Jack. Oh, and over a million dollars have been stolen from the casino and someone called "Hatchet Man" demolishes people in the desert. Sounds good, right? Like "Hitcher", "Psycho" answers. One or both men are secret and nothing is as it seems! Unfortunately, the writer-director Victor Salva (the celebrity of "Jeepers Creepers" and "Powder") does not have enough ideas to continue the film, the scenario does not create tension or tension (poison about what is said to be "thriller") and the underlying homo erotic tone adding seems to be inappropriate. Henriksen highlights an unusual, not-real-time Everyman (even a sporty grass), but Roberts is about as dangerous and scary as "Death Wish 3"; we have never been sucked into the place where we are actually dealing with what is going on, and the conclusion slips into an improbable territory (I thought it was "Fight Club" again, but I was wrong). Damage. The "wildlife" could have been something else ... nothing else.
