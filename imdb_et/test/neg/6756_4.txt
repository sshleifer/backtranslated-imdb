Several catastrophic films can be before we get tired of them. Come on, we'll see them all over the Discovery channel all day. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comment that the first part of this movie is just a soap opera. The great prophet's grandson makes a prediction and everyone starts to destroy his surname. The evil mother persuades her husband to sketch her lover she wants to meet. Do you believe it? The husband wants to approve a new wife! At the same time, a lover is in love with someone who does not have a woman, but she sends her a pack. <br /> <br /> Now that the soap opera is over, an earthquake appears. /> <br /> Special effects are really good, but duplication is bad. That's why I like subtitled movies. The actors are all very experienced and have won many awards, so you can see some of Japan's best repetitive stories. <br /> <br /> But the soap opera story comes back to the end of the kitchy.
