The best film in the world is not? That was an underestimation. I personally didn't like this movie. Not because the story is not because of graphic violence and nudity. Nude hadn't really had it, he didn't do anything, except that girls went through harsh times and apparently naked they were even more confused. But one of the films I hated was that it was so dark. You couldn't really do what's going on. I think if it wasn't so dark and you saw where they were, it might not be so bad. Everything you know is in the basement somewhere. You don't see any house, the way, the killer in it, everything you saw was half a face for about 5 seconds. I want to see some things in the movie. It gets boring after 20 minutes of pretty darkness and everything you see is a flashlight or wall. Then you hear the girl. I didn't miss what was good about the movie, maybe a break between the first 10 minutes of the movies ... but not how the movie ends, but the fact that the movie is ... I see something in this movie, but some are naked bodies and different flashing lights. But honestly, it was Saw, which corresponds to the Blair witch project. Both high-end movies and both are enlightened to find out what's going on. Forget this movie when you see .. if your blind person ... you want to rent it to hear the screams when you get into it. But then again, if you're blind, you probably won't read it either.
