I have to say that this is not very good. Polly Bergen is good in this movie. The rest is so. I'm gay and frankly there are so many clichés at this time that it's just sad. We started to watch it and then turn it off, so we decided to have fun with the rest of the movie. But everyone said that the main idea of ​​the film is good. If it had been rewritten by less understandable lines and better actions, it would have been really good. All over I wouldn't want that. In additon this is coo coo thinking line is so flat. Besides, the hairdressing salon is funny because it is so bad. Lesbian sister in the room with them, when they try to get it, is so strange their sad.
