I love cheesy horror movies, I think the dead life and bad taste is great and I think the dead party massacre II (which is not even related to this movie) is fun. But this movie is completely bowed, I didn't laugh, I didn't even enjoy it. You see all kinds of mistakes that aren't even campy. The best shot from a scene where a woman pulls out of a window is where she smells like a head on her head? Give me a break. <br /> <br /> Don't try this thinking that is related to the series of bloodbaths in the dream sides. It is terrible and I have no idea how it was distributed. Rent it with a fake name and burn it, do all the others.
