But I still enjoyed watching him, so I gave it instead of 3. Some other majority members (such as Michael McKean) are really slumming. The cat itself is somewhat amusing. In addition, the film is a clich√© that culminates in a far too long car. (This is also that the film becomes unnecessarily raw, being a "family" by then.)
