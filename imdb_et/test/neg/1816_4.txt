It's the first and as far as I can say that the only completed "Heart of Darkness" has ever been released. Before launching "Citizen Kane", Orson Welles released some test material for the "Heart of Darkness" version, which was supposed to be filmed entirely in what is now called "POV", where we would look at the main character Charlie Marlow; he would look in mirrors, windows, water, etc. The "POV" technique was used, not too successfully, in 1947, "The Lady in the Lake", where Robert Montgomery was starring Philip Marlowe. Probably the coincidence of the two "Marlow (e)" characters is just that. Of course, Francis Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" was based on "The Heart of Darkness." <br /> <br /> The short-lived novel "The Heart of Darkness" by the British writer Joseph Conrad, who was born in Poland, first appeared in British literature The magazine in 1899 contains one of his favorite music, the captain of the ship, Charlie Marlow, who also talks about the story "Youth" and implicitly says the story of "Lord Jim". Marlow, who is temporarily out of work, decides to hire a river boat, related to the personal belief of King Leopold II of Belgium, the brutal exploitation of the resources of the Republic of Congo with the brutal exploitation of resources. Marlow travels from London to Brussels, writes with his company, and has said that his mission is to take a boat to the Congo to a distant hinterland led by one of the company's most productive representatives of the colony, the German name Kurtz. The Kurtz station's ivory, latex (for rubber production) and other shipments have ended, and Kurtz has not come to the word for a while. There are rumors that he has "gone native". Marlow must investigate, take the necessary measures and draw up a report on return. He crosses the West African coast to the Congo estuary, staying for weeks when he is forced to repair his boat at a business station in the coastal areas and finally he finds himself at the Kurtz station. River, heat, vegetation, wildlife, insects, people, all suffer from their endurance, imagination and mental resource. He thinks Kurtz is sick, half-hearted, and near death. Kurtz's final meeting and death are almost anti-climatic, especially since Conrad is so unclear what really happens that we are leaving it for ourselves. This is a novel that closes the book endlessly with discontent, but still respects the story of this amazing atmosphere. <br /> <br /> This "Heart of Darkness" was filmed in Guyana in Central America, standing in West Africa. The best thing is when the novel is in the greatest position: in fact, the first world in the suburb is showing us, which would look like a boat trip along the tropical river. But the rest of the film was forgotten. Tim Roth does his best when Marlow, but so much about the plot, testimonials, and characteristic relationships, is acknowledged that you don't know why they were bothered. If the goal was to change Conrad's story, why didn't they leave it alone? It is unreasonable to assume that when a movie is made into a movie, no compromises will be made, but so many changes were made that I had no cinematic justification that you didn't know if we were just dealing with incompetent scriptwriters and operators. Most of the disappointments were John Malkovich as Kurtz. He was completely unsuccessful and just slipped his role. Everything about her is wrong: Her appearance, her style, her voice, accent, everything. A better choice would have been someone like Bruno Ganz (unlike Malkovich, the actual German, like a character). <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing product and I would recommend it only after you read the book if you want to depend more on your imagination to get a visual image of a boat ride up to the 1900 Congo River.
