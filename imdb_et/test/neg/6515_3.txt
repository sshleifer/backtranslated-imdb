My age: 13 <br /> <br /> James Cole, played by Steven Seagal, is sent to assistant Jim Campbell, played by Keenen Ivory Wayans, to solve a series of killings that the victims were crucified. Since Cole has arrived, she notes that the killings have changed a little and thinks she is another killer. It becomes personal when his former wife is killed and Campbell finds her fingerprints on the body. Campbell explores the mysterious Cole and finds a very shady past. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Steven Seagal. I enjoy action movies, but he's the worst actor I've ever seen. This movie is not at all fun to watch, incredibly stupid, and the natural occurrence of Steven Seagal is obviously terrible. However, Keenen Ivory Wayans is not too bad. The only redeeming thing in this movie is from time to time a good activity, although most come around because it is extremely stupid. The plot of this movie is absolute gibberish. I don't care at all. The whole glimmer man of Seagale's character in the past was stupid, all the mafia struggles and struggles in the restaurant were for almost any reason. Make a note of this movie. <br /> <br /> Australian Classification: MA 15+: High Level Violence <br /> <br /> Rating: 35/100 (fairly generous)
