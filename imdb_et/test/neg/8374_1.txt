This has to take into account the worst films I've ever seen. It was not just funny. My wife was asleep. I think if you are the kind of person who gets in the eye of the dog, he can do something for you. If you think the comedy film has humor on it, then you're frustrated if you can't find an English radio transmitter who says f is a lot of fun. Club removers kept their underwear so that there wasn't even a little nudity to alleviate boredom. What was happening at the club did not make sense at all. There was a lot of mumbling under the nature of lead, with whom I had no compassion at all. Mena Suvari was hardly in the film, probably there, so people would think it was a serious attempt to make a movie. The bad guys were not convincing and suffered as many threats as the dead sheep.
