Okay, I haven't read the book yet, but I have to say the token was wrong. How can I say that such a thing has not read the book you asked? It's easy. As a viewer of this miniature, I grew up with irritated wizards, gestures, and the look of Fannie Price. It's one thing to be a good person, but it's quite another to be a mud creature who doesn't want to see anyone's face or any other way. In addition to Susan B. Anthony's profile, she seemed decisive that no one else looked. The scene where Edmond puts his heart out is looking for him all the time, forcing him to do the same. As a result, it was just uncomfortable and I just couldn't understand someone who fell in love with him, not to mention Henry or Edmond. Many have said that the book is true, if it is, I find it hard to believe that Jane Austen would create a character like her leading heroine. It is possible to create a sign that others have put up and succeed in earning their trust and endearment, but depicting this character in this minis just didn't do it for me.
