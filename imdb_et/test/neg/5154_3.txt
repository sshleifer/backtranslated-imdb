My mother took me to this movie when I was about seven years old, which was thirty years ago. He had no idea that the family film would be so violent. My clearest memory was the pain of the boy's father's face when he was killed and killed. This picture haunted me for weeks. I had learned that I lived in a world where a person can push my father at any time. How can I stop them? How could my father protect himself? You have to realize that this tickling is not a seven-year fantasy. It is as real as the witness of the actual event and has no child's innocent mind. It is sad that we still do not understand the impact that bringing our children to life has on our children and our society. If only parents protect their children from the images of violence with the same force, they will protect them from nudity and sex images.
