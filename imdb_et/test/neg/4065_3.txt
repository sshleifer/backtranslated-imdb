I've seen three more movies that are worse than that, "Plan 9 Outerspace", "Side Hackers" and the dreaded "Blair Witch Project". There are so many technical flaws in this film that, regardless of whether the film is a proper plot, it is not plausible. <br /> <br /> Let's start with AMTRAK, which has no cars between the walls and the handrails. The killer rides behind his victim as he moves from the car to the car and just pushes him out of the train. <br /> <br /> In one scene, the killer kills the woman's apartment. He wants to smile to kill him, so what does he do? He turns his stereo up! When I heard my stereo suddenly louder, I was worried. She kills women, throwing an electric hair curler into the bath. I was surprised that the five-legged electric haircut can be ten feet and it is still connected. In addition, the apartment is modern enough to have a ground fault in the bathroom, and the victim was still under an electric shock. <br /> Boeing 747 is one of the most famous commercial aircraft on the planet, so this part is surprised by me. First, the cabin was not close to the real 747 and the second was not on the top floor of the plane. I was amazed at how the pilot and the co-pilot (where was the aviation engineer?) Walked right along the spiral staircase and headed toward the airplane. <br /> <br /> I was also surprised that the balls would not penetrate the aluminum serving trolley (good for our hero) or the bathroom doors, but would penetrate the ceiling, causing a fuel stream to escape through the small hole body. Ah? Looking at three men stretching the track 100 meters less than a week was also amazing. <br /> <br /> Didn't I check if it was a weekly movie or something? It was terrible.
