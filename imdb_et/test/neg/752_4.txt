Usually, Jane Austen's BBC productions are pretty good, but Norther's monastery is just strange. What did they mean? This film has a few Austen charm and ironic gothic novels, which Austen is so gloomy about. Not only that, "Gothic" sequences are sticky, up, and honestly stupid. An actor who plays Miss Morland is badly cast without a clear appeal to attract eligible bachelor studies, and although I rather liked the crazy Peter Firth than Mr. Tilney, he's not a bit of a novel, even if the dialogue is directly out of the book. Robert Hardy as General Tilney turned to his somewhat terribly "ham" performance. This movie was so strange and strange that I just looked at it just to enjoy it as amazingly wrong.
