My wife and I couldn't even finish the movie. Indeed, it was quite painful. <br /> <br /> First, historical accuracy is not so much about the events themselves, but about the ridiculous one-dimensional character of the characters. For example, Augustus takes the burden of power only with great reluctance. Indeed, he is depicted as being a great humanist and democracy democracy. <br /> <br /> Second, bearing! My lord, the dialogue is terribly bad. I remember the soap opera my mother looked at when I was a child with a better dialogue. Continuous exposure and puncturing grates on ears like nail plates. Ugh. (Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit, but the dialogue is really bad.) The HBO series of Rome is better than the reason that its characters were at least plausible, regardless of their historical nature. <br /> <br /> Rome was wise enough to find out that they could not play epic scenes. The creators of this movie didn't. When Caesar attacks Munda, the battle scene is practically far away. <br /> <br /> I mean that costumes are all right. Sets are good, although their CGI backgrounds can be a bit of a bit off from time to time. Sound is bad, albeit in terms of duplication of music, burning work and many side signs. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's not quite worth it. As a historic great, I hoped for an alternative approach to Augustus as HBO Rome, which I think could not "feel" as well as Cesar or Antony. Instead, I should have stopped reading.
