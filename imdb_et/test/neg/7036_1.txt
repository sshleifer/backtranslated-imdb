one of the worst movies I've ever seen but extremely funny (not for purposes). Every scene that has nothing to do with; aircraft, romance, script or actors are in trouble. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all pilots, it's so bad that you should laugh at the movie at some point (see also Airport 79: Concorde, for the same reason). <br /> <br /> Someone else, avoid this movie like a plague (except of course B-fans) <br /> <br />
