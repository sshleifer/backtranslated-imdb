I didn't look at it as little as I was. And I think I only looked at one episode about railways because I thought I liked the trains and still. Even then I thought it was a baby show. I mostly looked at Arthur. The songs are rather weird. And I don't think it's education. They just sing some nursery rhymes. It's a stupid show, all the adults who like it are crazy! If you want to see good kids, check out something about Arthur, Mister Rogers neighborhood, or even a better Pee-wee playhouse. I thought Sesame Street was boring when I was little but even better than Barney. Believe me, this exhibition is pretty stupid, there are other kids who are better than that. I see a lot of comments here that many people don't like about this show. Now there are some mature people. I hope they will take the exhibition air quickly.
