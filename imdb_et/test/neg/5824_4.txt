I think Purvis will start homosexually with "Gone With The Wind". If so, sorry, Tag, it didn't happen. Nor did it happen to homosexual "sexploitation". I think I'm confused; what are we trying to do here? Much as I would like, I just can't get to where I care about those stars. This film is effective for capturing the taste of decadence living in the south; it does nothing to explain, enlighten or promote my understanding of gay relationships or the conflict that the protagonist seems to have.
