Just looking at it today at TCM, where other reviews were here. <br /> <br /> Sorry I was the only one who found Davis as a weak actress who had a really terrible attempt at an Irish (Irish-American or otherwise) accent. As he is a star, it was hard for me to miss it - especially since other reviewers have said it was his best results. <br /> <br /> Another particularly awful Davies performance was "Marianne" (1929), which I also watched today. In this film, which has been given to 9 out of 10, his accent switches between the (right) French woman and the strange combination of Italy and Switzerland. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, one hour of bio-Davies by TCM - "A Captured Movie: The True Story of Marion Davies" (2001) - says film historian Jeanine Basinger that "one of the things Marion Davies's sound is "It does include bio comments from fans (do what you want). Davies was a very attractive young woman and all accounts had a great life in real life. <br /> <Br /> And since some of his anatomy was added immeasurably in his realistic search for Joseph Cotten's character, which meant the meaning of Kane's last word in the big "Citizen Kane", he made his place in the big stories of Hollywood history. <br /> <br /> But I think Welles & Mankiewicz has this right mostly by faxing a real article "Susan Alexander". <br /> <br /> Don't bother voting whether you agree or disagree with this post because I really don't care less.
