I worked with this cruelty ten years ago. Fortunately, no one knows this because I didn't make the final paragraph. And when I saw a movie in the theater, I was glad! My agents were run by (probably for the first time) filmmakers with nuts, wrote the script daily, and changed their agreements with their agencies so often. Later, they told me that when they returned to California (we shot at Atlanta), those "professionals" had 4 1/2 hours worth of video! Even edited up to 90 minutes, it is at least twice as long as needed. I found Hulk Hogan surprisingly charming, but otherwise - a waste of movies!
