What do you do with all the material that does not make the final editing of the film? You can set it aside when the director's cut or expanded version is released one day. You can sell it as a stockpile for another movie. You can just wear it. Or you can collect it, collect more and more from every movie you make and then use it to make another movie, disregarding coherence or meaning. Throw this narrative with a very primitive skeleton and create numerous opportunities (well, excuses) in your cellular molds nest. Excuse the absurd nature of the plot in an abstract way, shaping it all in the sense of a horror film director, and you have a terrible movie. This can only be done with a few days of shooting. And idiots like me destroy two hours of my life watching it. And then come here and try to warn others. The whole chain of events is one big waste of time.
