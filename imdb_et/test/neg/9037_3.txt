Another movie that makes The Beach Boys' story worse than it is. I especially remember this scene when Brian says he gives up on tourists and other boys call him a traitor. I didn't happen that way, and as the movie shows, some scenes have reacted too much. There's no need to play The Beach Boys because a lot of things happened anyway. The sad thing is that this movie gives the wrong picture about boys who are not so familiar with the group. Hard-core fans like I knew it wasn't a real story, and that's why I gave her a low rating. If you want the truth, I recommend the documentary Endless Harmony.
