What's more, Mr. Costner has taken the film much longer than necessary. Apart from the terrible rescue of the sea, of which there are very few, I was not interested in any signs. Most of us have ghosts in the closet and Costner's character is realized early on and then forgotten much later when I don't care. The character we really care about is very bright, all over Ashton Kutcher. The problem is that he comes out as a kid who thinks he's better than someone else around him and doesn't show any signs in the closet. His only obstacle seems to have overcome Costner. Finally, when we are out of the way for this stinker, Costner tells us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is forced to be the best, without being concealed in advance. There is no magic here, it was all I could do to turn it off after an hour.
