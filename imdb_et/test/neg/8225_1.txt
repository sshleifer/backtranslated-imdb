The country of the garden has to evaluate the most vivid and pretentious films of all time. The plot is simple, involving a younger man who returns home after his mother's death and love. But really, the plot doesn't matter. What is important for Zach Braff - writer, director and star? is that he is able to hang up all the necessary indie or arty films from the plot. That's why we have endless cute and peculiar characters and scenes that don't exist because of plot or character development, but just give the film artistic credibility (Ã  la Wes Anderson - or Braff hopes). Unfortunately, and somewhat surprisingly, Braff hasn't fooled much at IMDb, but also some critics who should have been more aware. bad movie. What really makes a stallion is a Braff script. He just does not have the writing skills needed to wear this film, and the dialogue and characterization are exhausting. Braff often has to use dashed symbols and insignia to achieve what he can't write. For example, we see Braff's numbness of character in his indifference to the impending air crash (it cannot be processed on the plot and must be done in a dream!), Later he will be returned. against his circumstances, shouting into the bottomless abyss (life = bottomless abyss, very wise Mr Braff). These two scenes must be the most ridiculous and viable on the cinema screen. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the action is passable, although no material is needed for the cast material (which I mean the script), and I admire Natalie Portman for her efforts for love - so badly written and unlikely she is a little more than a meaningless doll that Braff is shaping her fantasy woman. <br /> <br /> Braff probably took 3 years to write Garden State Manuscript (3 years to write this bad script - he's really inept!). Hopefully it will be a while before he makes another movie.
