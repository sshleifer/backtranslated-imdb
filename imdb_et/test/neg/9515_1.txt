When I voted against this "1" movie, I noticed that 75 people voted with the same voice out of 75 people. This means that half of the people who voted for this movie feel it is really terrible. I saw it for a long time at the film festival and I had this impressive performance impressive. Cinematic art is invisible, the sound is bad, the story is cut and pasted from many other films, and the acting is terrible. This film is basically a displacement of three other films. NOT USED IN THE US.
