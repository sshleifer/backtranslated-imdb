I saw this movie two weeks before going on a snowboard, so for me it was just in my mind during my vacation. The film has some sweet snowboarding skills that take place in the movies of the scenes. These moments were great, a bit like watching extreme sports channels. Unfortunately, this story was fairly terrible, generally well, with quite a little pain. This film is probably comedy, at least trying to be comic, but it seems that comedy and story were written by a teenager. There is no story about any depth or purpose, and comedy tries to be many times more than a small movie. It may be worth renting to see snowboarding, but then there are a lot of movies that are totally dedicated to snowboard stunts and that don't have a UN-jokingly written story.
