OK ... it may contain a spoiler ... but who really cares? Do not waste your time wasting your time on this trash. There's no redeeming quality in this movie ... and I say it as a complete fan of the "Holiday Group" movie. I loved Cousin Eddie's character from other holiday clips ... but she only works as a supportive character. Do I blame Randy Quaid for the failure of this movie? Not at all. I think he's a great actor ... but this movie is not a cohesive ... the pace is off ... it's just plain. And the actor who plays "Third" ... Jake Thomas ... was just terrible, probably because of the lack of direction. I don't know why ... but his whole character pulled me out. Some people say it's a terrible movie because Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo aren't in it ... it has nothing to do with it. The script that directs, acts ... special effects ... everything is a train wreck. Orphans. And kittens. Oh ... and the train ran over the old people. Please, no matter what you do ... away from this mess! I call it dirty because it changes the name of the Franchise Holiday.
