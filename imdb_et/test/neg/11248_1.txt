This film was completely hidden and forced. The central prerequisite for this film was mainly the number of stereotypical black people sitting around the hairdressing salon, changing the painfully failed repartory. I did not laugh at one time throughout the movie. I could have been sitting in any hairdressing salon in America and I have heard this banal loose, and maybe I can even come with a good hairstyle. I don't understand why this mess got positive comments, much less, why so many people have wasted money on it. No character here was funny or caring. I really don't care if an inter-rival amusement park would cause Nappy Cutz to stop working. Don't waste your money on it, people, because this is the only way Hollywood can stop breaking the Shambol parts. 1 * 5
