I just saw it at Madison Horror Film Festival and was disappointed. Some shocking, funny moments (hollow Carla, Dreamland urinating harpy) and two competing interesting spaces (similar to the New Nightmare with faith that bring to life a mythical character and the lost road where the man lives with his fantasy head) but they had long movements and inconsistent plot developments. Just because you use the framework of dreams or the state of the spiritual fugue, it doesn't make Lynchian. You need convincing visuals and horrible imaginations. <br /> <br /> Positive things: Dr. Maitland had a real comic timing and all the girls were very cute. Carla's father, Chalmers and Ingrid Pitt saw they had fun. And at least Tom Savin saw how he remembered his rows and we didn't see if he just read the smart cards. <br /> <br /> I get Hammer references, but it seems the director realized that the script was snoozer and just added some shocks to try and laugh, no matter what material he could put together. But they don't work because they are too little and far and create a contradictory tone. Condense it within 30 minutes of all the fun parts and you may have a short surreal well, but skip the length of the function. It's not "so bad it's good" it's just "so bad that it's boring".
