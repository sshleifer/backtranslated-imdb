This exhibition can be described most accurately as TV Bubble-Gum: it is chewing, it has a good taste and it lasts long. But like Bubble-Gum, it may leave a bad taste in your mouth after some too much chewing. <br /> <br /> This exhibition contains very simple questions that simply appear as games like finding a Hangman Simple Phrase or a short list. Callers are contestants and someone can play. <br /> <br /> However, the questions are very simple. Techno-music, which has become a continuous loop, is pumped into the background. It never seems outdated, but it never shows again. The hostess, whatever it is, is extremely pleased, pleasant enough to look at and make very fun facial expressions. I'd rather enjoy this British woman. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this show. It is easier and unreasonable, although it may be fun if there is nothing else.
