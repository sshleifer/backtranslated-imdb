Like many other Western historians from Pennsylvania, I was very much looking forward to this very famous PBS program produced by the Pittsburgh WQED. But I have to say now that I was somewhat disappointed. On the positive side, I believe that this film was a fair deal to explain the main issues and to describe the events of the so-called French and Indian war. Above all, this position of the Indians was somewhat new and quite interesting, although it was definitely too time-bound. On the positive side, the mixture of narrative and operational states was well done and somewhat better than many of these typical documentaries, which consisted of "expert" interviews and pictures (la Ken Burns). On the negative side, many battles had a somewhat staged look and many important aspects of war were ignored. Most of all, I was very disappointed and disappointed by the little importance of Forbes' successful 1758 campaign against Fort Duquesne compared to the previous failure of Washington and Braddock in 1755. Above all, I was somewhat incredible about not mentioning Colonel Henry Bouquet, a Swiss mercenary in the British service, who was most responsible for Forbes's success. Finally, I could not believe that the battle of Braddock, which started again in 1763 at Bushy Run, was a complete struggle that, thanks to the result of the Pontiac war, was due to the same Colonel Bouquet, who certainly must be one of the most successful British commanders of this war.
