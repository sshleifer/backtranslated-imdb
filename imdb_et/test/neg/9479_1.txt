This movie sucks so bad. It's funny to see what is the bad story where two peacocked American twins who know nothing outside their school can come to another continent and do unimaginable things. It's just so stupid and so strange. How do they just find the two French men, hit them and finally they can, without knowing anything? It would be more realistic for the boys to take them away and rape those that would have happened in such a situation. As for a little where they drink from the French president, it's bad. I don't think he was too happy in real life. Everything was too easy for the girls to do, and they could really be in trouble in the film several times when it depicted real life. <br /> <br /> My rating: 0/10
