This movie was terrible. I thought it would be OK, but it worsened and worsened. From the start-up scenes, it seems that it is moving towards another secure predictable rom-com, but at the moment it arrives home it simply breaks down. No characters are deep, and the only person who was incredibly close was Tom, though he was so disturbed by the way he was so easily disturbed. The dialogue is ridiculous and the structure of the film is almost non-existent. In an offensive comedy test, the writer / director introduces a new character or event in virtually every scene, none of which is realistic, making it very confusing what is happening. The plot is hardly an excuse for the film: the man likes the girl, the house sits at the father's home to get acquainted with the girl, the house is destroyed, the girl gets the girl. Complete waste of time.
