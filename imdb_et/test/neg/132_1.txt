Let me start by saying that one in ten is too good for this movie. It is unfortunate that IMDb does not have a tenth of a star ... I was watching this movie abortion in the middle of sleeplessness at night, and that was an absolute rubbish. The plot was terrible. Operation was terrible. The film was totally boring. "Malachi" looked like a shadow with Alec Baldwin (Shadow is endlessly better than this). Eve was so undeveloped and two-dimensional that she didn't even pay attention. I didn't even know his name was Eve. Don was interesting when he held his mouth. "TWIST" (if you can name it) was ridiculous and pathetic. When it came, the film had done such a frightening job to skip or affirm any character I just thought, "Who gives S ***." The only thing that made me even the eyebrow of this film was that med. the teacher was Dyson in Terminator 2 (also a film that was a mild year before that massacre.) Anyone who participated in this film should be ashamed of wasting 90 minutes of people. No wonder no actor in this film has ever made a fruitful career. All in all .... This movie is so bad, I feel dirty and need a shower. The worst film in history, Gigli was better, Prom Night (remake) was better, and I dare say it saw IV was better ...........
