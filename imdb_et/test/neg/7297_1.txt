Are you looking for a movie for your Turkish Film Festival? ROLLER BLADE SEVEN is on the list of my top ten films. The plot, the story of the apocalyptic roller samurai warriors, is a contraction of everything that refers to everything from STAR WARS to SEVEN SAMAURI. Operate fluctuating everyday sadness. The scene where the villain bullies the old master is embarrassing for a ridiculous woman. Frank Stalone's Black Knight resembles too much John Cleese's Black Knight in MONTY PYTHON and St. George. (Advisory word, Frank: If you tend to go to such a movie, your career is over.) I started with this small stink bomb at a low cost cable channel and I couldn't stop watching. It's like watching a train break, you just can't look at it.
