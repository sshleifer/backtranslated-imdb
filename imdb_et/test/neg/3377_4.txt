Having already seen the original "Jack Frost", I didn't think "Jack Frost 2" would be as absurd as it was. The boy was wrong! And again, A-PIX movies have the ability to show incredibly bad material, even worse than expected. I believe this is the first A-PIX sequel, and this may indicate what to expect in the future: more A-PIX queues. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see without a smile, especially when the later parts of the movie, where Jack Fros's descendants (who are mostly eyes, hands, mouth, and sharp teeth), start killing people with a typical comedy dialogue and foolish voices. They are shown as dolls (with a movable stick) and computer animation, which I have to say is a lot of fun. Computer animation surprised me because the first "Jack Frost" had no such effects. <br /> <br /> I would recommend before seeing it (both of which would be advisable to watch with a group of friends) to make it amusing and because it would make more sense ("mind" is a relative concept). <br /> <br /> Now only when there was "Uncle Sam 2" ...
