Where do I start? First, the story sucks. Wonders, effects, suck, I think I'll start the story. Komodo vs Cobra story: number one, it doesn't explain how or when Komodo and cobra even got there. Or how it was created. Functional: TERRIBLE! It seems that the director just pulled a couple of people out of the street (this is probably what he did). And the last, and certainly the least, effect: they are so terrible that Komodo doesn't even see a commode, just a dinosaur that looks incredibly unrealistic. Water does not move even when the cobra appears. All in all: terrible hunting, don't even think about renting it.
