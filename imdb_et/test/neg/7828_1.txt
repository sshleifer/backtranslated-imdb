Tired, dirty dreck. The chemistry between Argento and Madsen was just as exciting as the wet donut. Their dialogue was extremely uninteresting. The story was confusing. Functional forced. The cinema remained unused. Lazy and pointless. Kim Gordon and his character had no reason to be there. Nor did anyone do that. I wouldn't have given two farts to one "character." Their emotions skipped and jumped like a junkie who hates his heroin. Blank and boring. Why do I need to write ten lines here? I think I took it with the first three words. But obviously not enough. I think this is the last time I barely wasted time criticizing the film. Anyway, I saw "Clean" and thought it was also quite ineffective. Again, I didn't care about the characters, whether they were living or dead.
