SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love movies. I've seen many movies. I didn't think I'd ever see a movie that I really hated. The mask's son destroyed it. The mask son is so bad that I don't even intend to make a detailed comment as usual. Actually, I'm not even going to write much. I think everyone should know that this movie is terribly awful. And poor Jamie Kennedy. He was fantastic in Scream, but now this movie! It also captures the SMO-CAN film and makes it a buggy child's film that even children don't like. This film also consists of a very rude humor. Like a nose woman. She has a nose in front of her head and if she sneezes white stuff she pulls out of her nose. There is also an exorotic parody. Yes, the boyfriend has an adult parody. Maybe they thought adults wanted it. Frankly, it made the film even more cheesy and raw. <br /> <br /> Here is the basic, stupid plot. Tim Avery dog ​​gets an amazing Loki mask and becomes a dog dog. When Tim pays more attention to a child with special powers, Wiley Coyote becomes a ripoff. Then Loki takes a wonderful surprise against the child and Tim and Lok really have an exciting animated fight. Tim wears a mask. It's all happy. Too bad this movie is terrible. Overall, the mask was a mask with a fantastic Jim Carrey film. This is basically not. Please, please do not rent, buy or download this movie. I made a terrible mistake in hiring it. I don't want you to make the same exact mistake. I feel horrible that I couldn't write a detailed comment, but really what's there to comment on? <br /> <br /> 2/10 I'd give this one, but come on, it's basically a movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended movies: mask.
