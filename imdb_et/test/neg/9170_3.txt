In essence, this is a terrible movie that has some features that can redeem it or not, depending on how much you want them to. "Opening" on the big screen for the "Red Green Exhibition", the filmmakers filmed the rustic charm carefully, erected in the Possum Lodge and its surroundings for over ten years of value to earn a shamefully photographed "theophone". The "big" musical score of the faux-Hollywood and a deeply boring storyline that is not decorated with good enough to make it entertaining even after the most mediocre episode of the television series. <br /> <br /> Having developed most of Possum Lodge's screen members for most movies and requiring almost all involved to be bad at Harold (who is the hero of the movie, who is stubbornly red is nothing more than this role). leader Harold's offender), the only performers who really shine are Patrick McKenna and Peter Keleghan as Harold and Ranger Gord, who give their small screen characters satisfactorily on the big screen.
