Only the people I would like to recommend this movie would be both blind and deaf, although I am sure that the saddle doctor will get out of it. There was nothing in this film; some acting, terrible music, terrible script - just the power to suck your soul fortune. Maybe you might ask why or how I managed to sit through all the one-and-a-half of pure innocence and that is a fairly difficult concept for me. First of all, I had to hurry up and down because the film's progress was very difficult. Secondly, I only did it without knocking my hand to get something to die to make friends with moral support when the plot became particularly slow. The problem was that I was proud to finish it after thirty minutes, and it was a deadly mistake on my behalf. I usually like movies to end up with you, but all that ... ... your peace of mind after that movie doesn't look.
