... if only Disney stayed away from it. Look, I think this film has some potential. Well, the main character of the situation is not the least. Take out the whole Jordan Cahill thing and you have a decent movie start! Of course you also lose more than half of the movie, but well. Not so much loss. <br /> <br /> So here you go: you take a typical, preppy, suburban teenage girl (Danielle Panabaker, who is actually a decent actress) whose best friends are many, mostly over the "pop feeling" (I assume this is a direct quote from the movie, the film is almost always associated with that particular phrase, called Jordan Cahill. Except, of course, TPSTG wants more life. Enter the character of Brenda Song, a complicated person who is just what the TPSTG needs (frankly, I don't care about what the character's name is, I like the better abbreviation). Two new friends went to see Jordan Cahill (one to despise, one for fun) and they come out with their mobile phones. Hijinks followed, and everything turns out to be right in the end. <br /> <br /> If only Disney or this big movie studio didn't have such a low opinion among 8-14 year olds. Or maybe when the 8 to 14-year-olds wait a bit more for their targeted movies. It's a sugar-covered mess like that that makes me more than a little insecure, more disgusting (a little memorable movie "High School Musical").
