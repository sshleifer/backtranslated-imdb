If Carson McCullers is believed to be one of the most important literary indicators of the 20th century, it seems he needs a lot of talent to destroy one of his stories, but this movie shows that it can be done! How do participants show their way to managers? With wooden, unpleasant, atypical, completely un-synchronized McCullers' written poetic compassion, I created my jaw with horror and disbelief that such a film mish-mash would ever have found financial resources and supporters. The only redeeming qualities are somewhat good ability to act (although it is said that Vanessa Redgrave seems to remain permanently the same, no matter what she plays), and some good cinematographs in places, but otherwise it is bitter, bitter disappointment and it should and should have been a modern masterpiece . Simon Callow should put his head to shame and act!
