Kristy Swanson plays the elite list who should have attacked the TV reporter for the bad guys, but when he sees this poor man playing at home, he decides to splash the whole project and the life of the TV reporter has been saved. The life of the deputy is involved because the people who wanted it to kill the reporter, now want his mission not to be dead. This is the basis for a film called the ultimate sanction. <br /> <br /> Highest Waste We see beating Swanson's character, killing and killing men much bigger than him. And he's always one twenty steps ahead of a group of murders who, for some reason, can't take this super-shooter. If one woman loses and beat all these men, it makes the movie so amazing. It's too predictable when you see that Swanson's character wins anyway, making the movie boring and inert. <br /> <br /> Kristy Swanson is a decent actress who was always sexy and easy on her younger days. The Sanction Sanction is not one of her best efforts.
