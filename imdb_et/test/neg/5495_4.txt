I went to this movie that wanted to like it - it drove a film festival a year earlier and boasted all the stars. But (and you could say that there was a "but" this film's failure. Sarandon's and Walken's remarkable character is destroyed by editing and supportive pain. Turturro's performance is weak and most comedy goes beyond. Repeated puppet messages are meaningless and some scenes are completely out of the way. the immaculate stage, several sediments, and some comedy colors actually work out. Unfortunately, they are overshadowed by scattered, inconsistent scripts and some bad actions.
