Some directors take 2 and a half hours to tell a story, David Lynch takes 2 and a half hours to put together "clues" and the strangeness of his brands, but there's never a story. No plot. There is no progress of the characters (unless you find that there was a "progression" of fraud). It amazes me how someone can call Lynch's garbage, but if beauty remains in the eyes of the viewer, so be it. Lynch's film and television work in the 1980s came out as "avant garde" and "alternative". Twenty years later, like "Mulholland Drive", the 2.5-hour David Lynch masturbation work arrives. It's embarrassing. I have finally seen a movie that takes my top to the worst. At least people rubbing "Godzilla" and "Rodan" didn't give them "art".
