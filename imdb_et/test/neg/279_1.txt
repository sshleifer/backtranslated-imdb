I had read the newspapers in this movie and I have to say that before the 12th ocean review, my expectations were very low. I really enjoyed the first movie, but this offspring is one of the worst movies. I would appreciate it from the worst movie I've ever seen. Why am I saying this? First, there is such a thin story that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like a perfect action thriller. Fragments, which can be called a "story", are held from time to time, but most of the time the film simply moves without purpose or ride. The whole story seems to be forced and the story surrounding the script is even more forced to become a farce at times. <br /> <br /> Participants show up but do nothing that deserves credit or evaluation. Most embarrassing are the leading ladies (Roberts and Zeta-Jones) who either play or are very simple. Damon, Clooney and Pitt are not brilliant either. Frankly, I really do not understand how they would like to be involved in anything as bad as this film. <br /> <br /> === May contain spoiler ==== Camera and editing, a sigh where I should start. There are many unnecessary camera movements that make the experience painful. Combine this with extremely inaccurate editing and start looking for a wooden spoon to get out of the heart. Especially the scene where the whole gang is moved out of the car by car. Increasing the camera for every person gets boring and if you are number 3 out of 12 you will know: wow you are cool and you can make simple zoom effects - NO. I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) who plays Julia Roberts should be funny, but it just becomes very embarrassing and you turn to avoid confusion. Bruce Willis. Why? Please explain it to me! WHY ??? Make sure they do all the teeth when you're at it ...
