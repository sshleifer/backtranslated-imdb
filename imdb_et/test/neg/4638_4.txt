The First World War is a shiny, sepia-toned makeover, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, consistently alert to "Very Long Engagement". The style of the Jeunet brand consists of a mechanical, almost clock-shaped narrative, decorated with fancy chocolate box production values ​​and flavored with faux naive humor. This is an approach that worked quite well with his previous picture, the romantic fantasy "Amelie", thanks to no degree to the unimaginable contribution of Audrey Tatou in the title. The Jeunet method applies to a rather worse material because it is modest. <br /> <br /> Tatou grows here again like Amelie. He is Mathilde, an orphan who lives quietly with his aunt and uncle in an idyllic rural area, deciding to follow what got his child from the more expensive Manech (Gaspard Ulliel) several years after he lost his war. Manech was one of five soldiers who in 1917 punished Bingo Crepuscule for self-harm and sent a punishment for non-human land. He's supposed to have died all except Mathilde, who loves to find him. The film follows Mathilde's screaming effort to find out what actually happened, and when he deepens deeper, he finds a sad and even shocking story of high corruption and inhumanity. Mathilde must filter facts from different contradictory, overlapping or incomplete accounts that appear to be Manech's last hours. <br /> <br /> All this should be dirty and thrilling, but it is more often confusing due to the visual and verbal confusion that Jeunet pummels his audience. There's just too much going on at one time, including an intrusive narrative that won't let our story and characters do anything for us. Without an informative overload of momentary rest, I felt I was not allowing room to ponder Mathilde's quest or room to communicate in my own circumstances. Jeunet's incredibly busy camera spirals and circles that take care of their finely-crafted output from any surface contour, but can't just penetrate the story. The result is a deeply infinite and worse grotesk. World War I was a particularly dark hour in human history. Imagine creating it again as a Belgian painter who is a picturesque ad, and you have the dimension of this movie.
