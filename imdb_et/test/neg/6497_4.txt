I saw this ego-centric "effort" in achieving an epic film in several Russian family members. Five people gave 5 different reactions to worship Mikhalkov up to cynicism. <br /> <br /> I saw a film that looked like Mikhalkov took a lot of "Canal +" money, put it in some of his (and other) pockets and changed the project over to cinema students. I read at least 4 different styles in the movie. It is not the same director who is responsible for these different scenes. Contrast them to yourself: <br /> <br /> · Cadets polish the shoes with the dog. <br /> <br /> · Train Station scene (goodbye to Andrei). <br /> <br /> Outdoor Panoramas. <br /> <br /> Ormond speaks through the keyfob. <br /> <br /> Primary attempt with the Grand Duke and then Chase Scenes to sing Andrei back to Figaro. <br /> · Garden Order <br /> <br /> Julia Ormond is faster than Superman. Studying late in his transfer, he will say goodbye to Andrei in one minute in Moscow. <br /> <br /> Russian natives felt that Russian life was a "caricature" and not a history. They called it "tourist postcard" Russia. <br /> <br /> They were all proud that the Russian director / producer / fixer had been able to "penetrate" for a "long time" and be able to spend more than $ 30 million on other people's money, but maybe put a little at the time of filming in local pockets. <br /> <br /> If you want to "think" you have seen this movie. Drink coffee before you go.
