This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I'm hardly awake. Functioning and the plot was terrible. I like B-movies, but this film has nothing to laugh at or think about. OK, at the beginning there were two or three funny moments, so I have to get this movie out of 10. If you really want to watch it, check out the first 10 minutes. After that you will get more frustrated while running the movie.
