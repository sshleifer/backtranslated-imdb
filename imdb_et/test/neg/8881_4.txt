then the other side of this movie is hard to follow. I got the first part of the Spanish Inquistion, but the film remained with the French government for many years in Spain. The film does not fulfill what happened, and I don't remember that much. So, the film gets confused. The film begins when Ines, the daughter of a rich merchant, is accused by the church of Judias, especially of his father Lorenzo. He is put to the question and forced to confess. Even the wealth of his family cannot buy him out of prison. His father forces Lorenzo to sign a confession, saying he is a descendant of Chimma, hoping to get Ines. All this is why the Church condemns Lorenzo, who runs to France. <br /> <br /> Then the movie will jump over many years and the French Revolution will be in full force. Ines released from prison. It was a very good job for Natalie Portman to look out for it. She finds her family dead and is looking for Goya for her help. He tells him he has a child in prison. Goya creates a meeting between him and Lorenzo, who is now French and power. He's a father. Goya sees her daughter and tells Lorenzo who decides she's the best to send her to America so no one can find it. But before his plans are implemented, the British will join Spain and Spain will demand power, and now he is persecuted. This part is not well mentioned in the film. It's like a movie shows it happens in one day. <br /> <br /> END OF VERDIKT: The film is good until it leaves several years after the investigation, then the film assumes you understand what is going on. Then I just got confused.
