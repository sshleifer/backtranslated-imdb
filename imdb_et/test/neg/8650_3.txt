This film is very modern and progressive. That's about 75% English. It is aimed at multiple English-speaking young audiences. The basic piece is similar to DDLJ. Action is below average. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they depict the wrong picture and set a bad example for young people. Tanisha is shown in a drinking bottle or tequila shot about 5-6 times in a movie. The director does not even admit that he is an alcoholic and has a drinking problem. Throughout the film, he only carries bikini heads, whether he is at work, on the beach or at a wedding. The heroine of this movie makes young people feel that this behavior is acceptable. The film deals with gender equality. But equality should not be the same mistake as doing the right thing right. If men are shown in the movies as chronic Casanovs, it does not mean that women should have the same behavior. The name of the move is that the fun part of the movie is not affected. Not even in Canada, women dress up or boys behave as they have shown in the film. This is certainly not a reflection of Indian society or even of Canadian society. Maybe they should have a disclaimer at the beginning saying: â€œAll the characters and events in the film are imaginative and do not reflect the real culture of the cities and states mentioned in the film. The only good thing about this movie is length, 1.5 hours, thanks to God.
