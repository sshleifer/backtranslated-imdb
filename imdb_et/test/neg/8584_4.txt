Predictable, clich√©, incredible, boring ... what else to say? It is just a cast caliber that saves the redeeming qualities of this expanded mess. Oh yes, and entertaining end zone antics. <br /> <br /> But wait for eleven to highlight the clock as the result is as predictable as the one who will compete with the Globetrotters / Washington generals. <Br>> <br /> I was already the second good before I thought they should be PRO teams we look at (everything is covered with vintage Padres brown). And Cameron Diaz's characteristic imitation of young Georgian Frontiere was poorly prepared on the page. (Not your fault, Cameron. Would you like to go for dinner?) <br /> <br /> That's enough - I'm just a bead because I was expecting this movie. Rent a long yard instead. <br /> <br />
