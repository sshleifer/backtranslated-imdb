The only good thing about this movie is that I now have the film on the worst list. The stop is at the end of the spectrum, where I can compare all the terrible movies. Indeed, this film is the worst, the worst, the whole movie that I wanted to do is pull the hair out and hit the writer and someone who made the film. I'm a soldier and I spend my valuable downtime watching such films. These people should feel terrible, they had to look at it before they came out, and they had to chase laziness after they noticed that it was weird. I'm so surprised that this big country is giving them another. Frankly, this is the first time I've ever commented on a movie, I had to tell the world, not waste my time. Delete this movie from the face of this planet. It makes us slow down for people.
