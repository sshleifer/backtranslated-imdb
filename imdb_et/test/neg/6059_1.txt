Eh. I watch it in the movie class because someone recorded it and brought it in. I had been waiting for a half-hearted attempt to portray myths of Hercules, and as its ads seemed serious, I waited for something that was half-decent. <br /> Ten minutes of the movie I realized it was CRAP complete. In the film, the only thing that is half-right about the myth is the minimum. Parents, half brother and labors seemed to be right. In addition, the rest of the film seemed to be a gigantic inaccuracy. I'd say it wasn't much better than the Disney version of the movie. The Disney version was made for small children, so it wasn't too serious. This sex, violence and nudity film was clearly meant for an older audience, but the story it contained was almost inaccurate as a Disney movie.
