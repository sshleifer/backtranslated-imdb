I found this terrible disappointment! But I've added a better variant to this item with a similar style. <br /> <br /> This "Felicia Journey" is interesting. It has a drama. But it's full of stereotypes! <br /> <br /> So this ONLY serves a decisive temperament without worrying about fairer justice and justice and truth, in addition to the black n 'white judgments that fit 30 seconds of "NEWS" ads that give our multimedia experiences everyday, especially news bulletins that are true or misleading in such images! <br /> <br /> It's so big that it reminds me of the Little Red Ridinghood fairy tale! Let us consider innocent young girls who do not have the identification to overcome the guard's interviewed boundaries, but release without evidence that he was looking for his "Romeo" who did not give him the address VERSUS, which was a miserably intuitive lack of substantive flaw. "a helping hand" who kindly applauds him for the unlikely story of his layer! <br /> <br /> It seems to suit managers and leaders that no one has faith or prayer with God, even during their despair! <br /> <br /> So in these early settings there is a lot of guidance and talk about what's coming! A nightmare that reveals the nature of matter without a fairy tale resolution, without truth or integrity or reliability! ... Then one twist and it is over. What a disappointment! If you want to see ANOTHER HIGHER FILM that explores similar topics with a lot of credibility, a much more powerful overview, see 1983 Paul Cox / Norman Kaye's "Flower Man" !!! <br /> <br /> Unlike here, you are not disappointed!
