This film is very familiar - the confusion between the arts and reality in the lives of the participants. There is nothing particularly novel or interesting about this subject, and it is actually quite boring. The last scene is especially annoying. Seeing that the viewer sees "moving" on the screen, seeing me, "Who do they think they're joking?" <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, there are some good performances and interesting scenes, especially some of the less important characters. Ben Gazzara plays an old and lightly touched actress, who gets hold of the entire police officer when he arrives for his arrest. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken plays surprising again. Remember his character "The Continental" on Saturday night; an aging euroras satyr who put a young woman around the furniture and trying to bring her to bed? He makes an identical turn in the film, hunting his young (male) catch around an antique table and driving him with champagne. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was as enchanting as irritating, but mostly irritating.
