I admit that this film is provoked by the photos of Charlotte Lewis, as well as a comment on the IMDb bulletin board dedicated to him, calling it a "great underrated film". And so I got a heavy copy of my "Dial Help" copy. <br /> <br /> What kind of waste. <br /> <br /> Nothing other than cheap-made blood and gore-film with a ridiculous assumption I don't even repeat with several telegraph sequences (for example, when we see how Lewis fed his fish, we know right away what later). This movie cannot even be recorded in Lewis, with its beautiful dwarf skins, large and light brown eyes, full and pout lips and a stunning line. Lewis fans would be better than Bare Essentials, Sketch Artist or even Golden Child.
