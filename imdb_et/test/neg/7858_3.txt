Henry (Don Ameche) rises to the entrance to hell and speaks his biography to His Excellency (Laird Cregar). The story focuses on his relationship with females throughout his life and especially his relationship with Martha (Gene Tierney). At the end of the movie, we cut Henry and His Excellency to a very predictable end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is nothing to say about the film because nothing happens. His sentimental story about one man's life and its very boring. I watched it with my girlfriend and dad and we all thought it was garbage, despite the Lubitsch touch. I shouted more than 15 times. Hugo (Charles Coburn) is good when he is on the grandfather's screen and there were some funny moments of dialogue. The color made it an excellent speculation, but it was not enough to save the plodder from the rejection board. In the same form as "His Wonderful World" and "You Don't Get It With You", and so it is not surprising that it was nominated for an Oscar. A story about ordinary people, none of whom are interesting and have no interest. Bored, sentimental and the biggest wet nail end I remember ...
