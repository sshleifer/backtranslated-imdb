Let me know how people can describe this adolescence as a film of a young man. It is true that there is a gun and a bottle and a mansion and lead is a private eye, but it does not make the genre, people. This thing plays like the revolutionary TV police exhibits - a lot of bloody beating and weak continuity - with a dash of Chinatown's memories that have been thrown away. Pretty hard to watch after the first 10 minutes. You want a modern feeling, see something by John Dahl.
