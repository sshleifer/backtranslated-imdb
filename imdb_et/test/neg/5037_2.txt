From the epicenter of the cultural world, four working class teenagers tried to change the world of music through music and fashion. It was the last attempt to do this in the last century and they failed. Before the dust was cleaned, the band manager and owner of the SEX store, Malcolm McLaren, spent the money that Sex Pistols had earned on their motive for their role. The movie was called "The Great Rock 'n Roll Swindle" (a hint) and it consists of very few "The Sex Pistols" that actually play music, and quite a lot of McLaren footage that effectively invites audience idiots. <br /> <br /> Cod-surreal nonsense, where guitarist Steve Jones is McLaren's tail detective, is rapidly disintegrating, so he and drummer Paul Cook can fly to Rio and spend time with "big train robbing" Ronnie Biggs. Prepare yourself for three very uncomfortable men who dance the horrible irony-free version of the "Belsen gas" (the story of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp Jewish killing) and the second song that sang with Ronnie's deaf twinkle that contains the lyrics "God save Myra Hindley, God save Ian Brady "(lyrics that Johnny Rotten should have been unpleasant). Sid Vicious scenes are little and idiotic. Jumping out of bed with a bat bat bat to sing the biker song of a bad boy in the 1950s. Playing the theme of "Punk Nali", trying to turn Sidi into James Dean. I'm surprised that McLaren doesn't take Siddy's death too. Redeeming scenes in Sid are Paris and My Way is a notorious performance. Punk rock is right there. A flashing adorable audience before they are all photographed. No movie needed, just watch this clip on YouTube. <br /> <br /> Julien Temple's much better (and more enjoyable) 2001 documentary, The Filth and Fury, gave us a more balanced / honest look at what appeared in 78. But there were also several scenes I would have wished to see in Swindle (since Fury was basically the same material reediting). One was animated Sid with Sidi's voice; "You f * cken betta wat'ch out, well, or I'll cut you open," something still appeared in the 7-inch - the fragment was shown in Fury, but I don't know what the context originally appeared. Was it in the original printouts but was removed after Sidi's death? Was there more? Fury also illuminated the film "Who Killed Bambi", which would have been the original plan of "Hard Day's Night" McLaren. It played as a member of the Sting (!) Gel New Romantics group and saw the devil's sight more entertaining than Swindle. <br /> <br /> Sod Swindle, t 'is a scam. If you need, rent Filth and The Fury and enjoy the music as a world changing policy.
