I can't believe I did a "season pass" for my TiVo, they probably had a good preview or something. I can't imagine it. After about 5 minutes of sighting, I was wondering why I was watching it. This is definitely not the reality and some of the worst behavior I've ever seen on television. this is real. ACTION .. (if you call it) is terrible .. The only one who is almost 5% decent is the girls who want to show the viewers, though they should be much nicer in this train wreck ... if they had more rows, they would probably change my thinking because they don't have the talent. This is obviously a very low budget production with 'players' who are probably very cheap. There is no way they can do anything else. Someone needs to direct these people to catering. Maybe they could do it. Oh and by the way, Parco P.I. no more space on your TiVo or TiVo season passport list. Definitely the worst show I've ever seen.
