I bought this "movie" from the 3.99 binin gas station for one reason: Billy Drago, one of my favorite actors. He is terribly horrible and good, but it stops. The film itself is a black, cheap, terrible attempt in the west of horror, and never manages, and never doubt, the successful joining of two genres. Drago's acting is so bad that I wanted to put the cushions on my ears, the production values ​​are non-existent and the script, I don't even know where to start. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs if you are a deadly Drago fan like me. <br /> <br /> Terrible, disgraceful unforgivable.
