For the film that was most visible in his home country in South Korea from most of 2004, it was a great disappointment. Shows that Hollywood is not the only place where people can make too emotional, melodramatic movies. The length of the film was over 130 minutes, but it didn't really happen, and everything that happened was pretty much what was expected, the plot was so transparent. In this case, if someone was Korean, it could get more, but for me it didn't do anything. Suffice it to say that when it comes to Korean cinema, the plot turns between the northern and southern parts of the peninsula. South Korea decides to recruit and train an elite murder unit from sentenced to death to kill Kim Il-Sung. <br /> <br /> The annoying piece doesn't bother me much if the characters are good, but unfortunately this is not the case this time. These are stereotypes and most of the action is mediocre and too often above the top, as it tends to be in the Korean cinema. Many assemblies take too much time and characters remain distant, one-dimensional cardboard cuts. They would have had more time to create characters and less to show us how hard and cruel training and soldiers are. <br /> <br /> One thing that reminds us is that less than two lies are still wrong.
