Wow! This is a movie that should be on television in the morning at Cinemax for all those insomniacs (the lord knows they're probably going to be bored by watching this movie) A terrible actor, the killer is pretty scary, I've seen carnivals who were more horrible, clowns. In this movie, there are many unnecessary skins, pseudo-porn scenes that are just creepy in more than a million ways, a gawdy soap opera style script that really hurt the film, and the director really had no elegance for every genre he was trying to create with this movie. I saw a group of teenagers with older camcorders doing better. I don't think it's part of me who could recommend this movie to anyone ...
