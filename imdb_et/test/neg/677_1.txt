This is by far the most fabulous, idiotic, madly stupid exhibition that EVER has been in the air and it comes from someone who remembers "San Pedro Beach Bume". - And there was one episode of the fire where wannabes had to develop "walk". The final result was directly from Monty's Python's "Silly Walks ministry" sketch. I couldn't laugh hard enough. <br /> <br /> Then there are bank banks all over the place (like laughing all the way ...). He must be the most disturbing feature on television, as Rosie O'Donnell left "View". As if modeling had done great things for mankind. Please. I've never found her attractive and I can't find her intelligently when she has her mouth open. <br /> <br /> Somebody has to talk to these people's clothes about a healthy diet and actually look like real women.
