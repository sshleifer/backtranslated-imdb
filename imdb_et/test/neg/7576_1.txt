One of my co-workers suggested this, which means that it was one of the most frightening movies he'd ever seen. I checked it with my girlfriend and gave up in 50 minutes. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I had a long talk with my colleagues (we are still friends!). <Br /> <br /> This movie is as original as the last movie starring Steven Seagal. This brings something absolutely original to the table. The harsh parts have been made thousands of times before. <br /> <br /> The biggest fault is the painfully slow pace of this movie. Periods between fears are wasted in a totally useless dialogue and a lot .. something .. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 Molotov cocktails
