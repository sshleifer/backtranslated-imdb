A group of environmentalists are traveling to the island to discover a secret lab that tests animals. When they arrive, they discover that they have to be late. Apparently, the government made a test of the scientist's attempt at Komodo and yes, you thought it was a cobra that made them grow very big. I'm not sure that this movie is really necessary or served as an explanation because it is almost identical to the Komoda, which also sucks. Computer effects are the same comic as ever before in the Komodo like a dinosaur that really got to my nerves. Like Boa vs. Python, it's not worth seeing this movie, and it's just as fun to watch as it's a hit. Avoid!
