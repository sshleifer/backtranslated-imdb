Well, now that all the directors and relationships of the director / production company have posted their comments after they see it at different festivals, I think it's time to show the comments written by people who actually saw $ 10 for that. Like director "Dear Jesse" (the only one of his films I've seen), "Loggerheads" suffers from a lack of focus and too many ideas put together in the indie budget. I swear that this man may have a better game of chance. I was expecting the different plot threads to come together, but they only grabbed the obviously hidden places that were obvious to everyone, but to the closest viewer. It was like watching one of the lifetime TV movies that had been put together at the old "Carol Burnett" exhibition. Maybe an enterprising male boyfriend can see it and then shout: "Hey ... I remember all the chicks we went to last year ... one of the adoptive parents ... the one who is the gay boy. .. the man of the Christian housewife we went to THIRD chick clamps last year, so now we have to look at Terminator 4! I think it is necessary to do something to make the actress familiar, but what is Bonnie Hunt doing in this flick? She is not exactly known as a dramatic actor , and this "performance" attempt does not get to Mr. Oscar's door. I mean (talking about Lifetime Original Movies), Valerie Bertinelli and Farah Fawcett were not available? Mrs Hunt has always come to me, maybe she should have played another mother ? I wish I would have chosen "Capote" to fill my weekly Gay-themed Indie Allowance..o well, maybe next week. I think it's a good reason why Capote plays tons of theaters across the NYC Let the distributors believe in this flip to ensure that it runs in the opposite direction if you do not trust this review!
