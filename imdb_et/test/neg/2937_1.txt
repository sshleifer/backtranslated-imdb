I found this movie to be extremely homophobic ... the main character doesn't know he is gay until he realizes he likes Barbra Streisand and has a hip-like wrist !!! I was so offended that after screening the Toronto Film Festival I went up and spoke to the screenwriter about filming this film. This is a film that GLAAD must work to ban.
