OKAY. Well, I think it was worth my time sitting around this * time *, but I'm not following it again. There are many things about this movie that irritated me. <br /> <br /> First, man ... I hated these characters. I had the same problem with Sidi and Nancy. It is a difficult time for me to rationalize spending fairly long after the signs that I really don't care about and can't relate to. It's not that the actors or writings were technically bad; it was that the characters were written so that I was disdainful of them, and when the film went, I wanted to almost see that the sky was falling on them. And this leads me to another problem and the question that I think is at the heart of this film: Is the intention to simply document this generation and the kind of bohemians who were (I think) traveling around the 60s in Europe? Did you want to criticize them and sheep? Or was this film a warning? The final evaluation of my film depends on this question (ie determining whether there was anything salvagable here). <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that these characters are really unlikely and it is difficult to really sow or happen to them. If it was some kind of statement about this generation, the film becomes a bit more tolerant. It is clear that Schroeder is not a kind of geriatric body, so that as he moves here, there is more weight than saying countless stupid AIP films set against the 60s culture. minimally, this movie has two things going for it - first, the soundtrack (probably). I like how Cymbaline is used here and others have mentioned it because it is at the forefront of the film. I think if you are a fan of Pink Floyd and you want to see it for this reason, you won't read something you read here to still look at it (it doesn't stop me too). The curiosity of listening to Pink Floyd in the film may be enough to just barely get it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is a nice landscape. Ibiza looks like a nice place. Maybe I'm just sick of watching Los Angeles, New York and Chicago movies, but European movies that take time to show us Europe (beautiful or ugly - mostly beautiful here) are always welcome. <Br>> <br /> But I don't see any specific genius here. There is no revolutionary camera work, not even a moral, tonic, message, sensitivity, or plot that has something new to say. Perhaps it was revolutionary in this area, but that it comes from Schroeder, a film that criticizes the mindset that at least partially made its films marketable. In this respect, this is an honest film; there is no glorification in the surges of the 60s here, perhaps something you can expect. In fact, the depiction of the symbols of this film closely reflects the modern cultural memory of this generation (somewhat distorted, in my opinion). <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, fucking nudity and sex here; something new when you watch such movies from this time period. I think it was considered novel or provocative or something at that time. I don't find it offensive or troublesome (doubt if you too); rather, it just prolongs the annoying working hours of the movie. In a particular way, this particular use of sexuality in the films of time (especially in European films) has become a bit cliche. But I think you can't blame them in retrospect; they were able to "give up" this particular decade and I think (here I think) the existence of such graphic sexuality was a political or social statement in itself (that is, sexuality was part of the life that this generation was not all strange as their parents). <br /> <br /> Should you watch it? If you're a Pink Floyd fan, surely ... I think it's worth a look. In any case, Valley is a better movie. I went to this movie, waiting largely for what I got. If you usually don't watch such artificial, avant garde movies and don't know what to expect, it is annoying hell. This is a normal healthy reaction :) <br /> <br /> If you're not a fan of Pink Floyd, I'm not sure why you're spending time here. I noticed that one of my colleagues who left the commentary enjoyed the movie a lot, so maybe I'm missing something. I don't need boys who are working slowly to propel fire, special effects, explosions or something like that to enjoy the movie. But I need some sort of handle - I need to find something pleasant for the film, and generally I have some sympathy with the situation of some characters (denying that some new movies are working, camera-work and so on). There is nothing else here except for the excellent performance of Pink Floyd. What is * just enough * to allow it. At least, if you're a Pink Floyd fan, you'll like Cymbaline, I promise.
