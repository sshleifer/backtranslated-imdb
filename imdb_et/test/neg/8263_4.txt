I agree with most of the above critics. What's more, I was shocked by the presentation of gay scenes with a homosexual couple. Why? because although they - the director, the manufacturers? There were no compulsions to present different heterosexual couples for the most passionate reasons, including nudity and French kissing, and all the nude contradictions in bed, totally unnecessary for their length and story, when the moment began to show the same experiences with homosexual couples, they dare to go so painfully in hurting , almost between scientists, with two very nervous participants. In fact, the makers of this film found homosexuality in UNNATURAL, because one of those characters says in some scenes. What is the difference between Spanish cinema !! I remember being in an Italian cinema in Rome for designing a film by Almodovar and I was totally surprised that the Italian audience did not react fully, they were afraid to react! when in Spain people fall off their seats, laughing in all risqu√® situations and fabulous Almodovar wit and elegance. Obviously, in Italy, there is a dark force in its history that prevents the free expression of some very normal and natural emotions. Damage. I have to add that I was quite surprised to find that the same letter was commented on by another correspondent. It is very bad and dangerous if we cannot restrict others' opinions on certain things narrowly. Where is freedom of expression? I do not know if this censor approves the changes I had to make in this commentary, and I hope he will not receive the same treatment from the same narrowly judged judge. Damage again.
