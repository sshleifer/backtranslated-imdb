Caddyshack Two is in itself a good movie, but compared to the original, it can't be worn. Robert Stack is a terrible substitute for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while the funny just can't compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is funny, being the only sign of the original. Most of the other characters in the film are about the original (eg Henry Wilcoxon), except for the hysterically funny lawyer Peter Blunt, played by Randy Quaid. Every line he speaks reminds me of the original humor, especially his office scene (I'm not going for oral suits or movements. I find out where you live and come home and took your door off ** * Baseball bat, make a fire chippindale, maybe roast that golden retriever (arff arff arff), then eat it .Your new BMW is your tight **! Do we have an understanding?). However, offsetting your small role is Dan Acroyd, who obviously does not replace Bill Murray. His voice is irritating and everything he does is not even funny, it's just stupid. In general, Caddyshack II is a good movie, but compared to a fantastic original, it can't be cut.
