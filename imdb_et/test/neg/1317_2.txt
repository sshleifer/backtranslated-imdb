Oh, but it's weird. One good actor after another changes in a regrettable dialogue in an unfortunate way, which must be an incredible pedestrian direction to be considered acceptable. I like Robert Carlyle and Joanne Whalley, one of my favorite actresses, Tom Courtney is able to force well, and David Suchet is the most honest professional, but they're all surrounded by a fish-like gin. I swear that Courtney was inebriated with painkillers or both. Was there a good result? Well yes, David Hood, as a younger underground engineer whose husband was washed, seemed to take this thing seriously and give him credit for it, it can't be easy if "everything is losing his" so it speaks , or maybe his scenes came under the director's instructor (if there was one), I just don't know what those people did in the movie, what was that poor (except billing, probably) I can't say how disappointed I am in them. WANT YOU TO YOU! <br /> <br /> All the third positive positives apart from David Hood ... yes London air transport was largely underwater, very well done, and artists' responsibility deserved a better job than fine work on such a slump. when you give the expression forgiveness, because the few people who see them do it on a much smaller screen than the best. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? why are British filmmakers trying to mimic such characteristically-eyed, tabloid-like genres as a disaster movie and then worse than Americans. Dirty realism, character integrity, catching up with real emotions in a way that makes you feel and take care of ... Family, Spring and Port Wine, Get Carter, Long Great Friday, Trainspotting .... Don't get me wrong, I like a little revenge hockey. Actual "Italian Work", Tom Jones Adventures; But if it should come, Carry On Camping was a more realistic drama.
