As much as I like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I wondered again why a good movie is? This version did not usually have Marta's tension and passion. It was a clear rip. Maxime Foerste was more convincing than hurting a child who healed with love. I couldn't believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck played this role. Unfortunately, Zeta-Jones would have had to find another one she could have (she also has other roles she has.). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but happy Italian. Aaron Eckhart seemed quite passionate. This version was pleasant but blissful. <br /> <br /> The love between Mario and Marta was perhaps predictable, but satisfactory. The therapist added an interesting color that didn't seem important. I liked it when she finally said she wanted to come back, but the movie was before she came back. I mostly have Martha at home. Every time and then I look at it again.
