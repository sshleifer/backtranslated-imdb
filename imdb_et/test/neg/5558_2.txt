Of course, all this nonsense question "Does the genre itself refer to when a teen comedy really needs a second parody of the movie?" The amazing "Scary Movie" (I and II) took the formula as far as possible - "No other teen movie" really adds anything intelligent or shocking. <br /> <br /> The plot, based mainly on teenyfloss teenflic 'She's All That', walks with a trembling line between paradise and respect ("John Hughes High School"). Everything from "American Beauty" to "Varsity Blues" is mined for references. The result is ultimately an unfulfilled viewer experience. "He's All That" The negative side of giving a carbon copy of a plot is that we all know where it is going. And if we didn't, the jokes would be pointless. <br /> <br /> There are very few suggestions here. The symbolic brand scene (eruptive toilet) looks bad here at all "feel-good" references. There's a sense of humor - the song is funny and the odd line is to send the audience. It stinks, don't look at it.
