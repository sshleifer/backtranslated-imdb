The material is bad .... the script is terrible .... at best, acting mediocre and music telegraph, what scene should communicate like a kick in the head. <br /> <br /> Give it even ... Yancy Butlers is not warm enough even in half scenes to save it. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that people are talking about Yancy Butler ..... considering what I'm here and a few other things I saw him, he has no depth or presence in the stars ... and he the behavior of the external screen shows that it knows it too. <br /> The last thing is where was it? I don't know external.
