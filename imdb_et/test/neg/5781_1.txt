Don't be afraid of someone who loves this movie. They probably breathe too much color as a child. I so refuse to revive the plot. O yes, there was none! This movie is a real definition of what Hollywood creates for people who don't want to think about theater. Do bad guys win? Will the good guys win? Who cares!
