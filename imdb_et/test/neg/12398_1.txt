Imagine the most cliche flying b-movie horror plot that you can. Add more plot holes than a plot. Is it 10 years old. Is the behavior of A-level drama students really bad with US accents (Isle of Man)? Result: double film. Throw Samantha Janus off your clothes (make it on the cover) and probably sell enough copies to make a profit!
