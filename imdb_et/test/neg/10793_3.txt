Absolute cellulose adventure in jungle woman genre. Lousy audio fortunately hides a stupid dialogue. And this is a terrible talk about people who don't speak English. There's no adventure here. It is a jungle adventure with cliffhangers and one wildlife attack that happens to backfire. <br /> <br /> Three pale faces of tricks in the African desert and meet the warring human hungry tribes of the Amazons. These wild women have only developed from rocks to the point of inventing makeup, footwear and underwater hair removal technology. Despite their despair against "spouses", women demand that they fight men and burn the weaker. <br /> <br /> The only interesting thing about whether it is young women who have been stained with animal skins is cleverly designed as swimwear from 1951. A lot of wrestling and bad dancing mixed with the movements of the 1950s strippers. No nudity or noticeable violence. On the other hand, you may move on a strange local song in the days.
