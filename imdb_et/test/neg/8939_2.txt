The most obvious mistake ... terrible, terrible script. This film had a potentially good story, but it was destroyed by poor dialogue, continuity problems, things never explained, sprawling shocks, sub-lines that didn't go anywhere, and just stupidity. Not to mention Sandra Locke's terribly managed leadership. Not even two big shows would have recorded this movie. So it is not important that Devon Gummersall and Rosanna Arquette give terrible performances. The thing is, they're better actors than you think this movie. The best of the arquets, Rosanna arquette (Silverado, after hours, desperately looking for Susan) has fine moments - like a big scene at first when she painfully pulls out her handcuffs, but gives her overall weak result according to her standards. And Devon Gummersall (Dick when Trumpets Fade and brilliant My so called life) is much worse by acting without the convictions or emotions that are forever. But I do not blame the participants who have had good roles with other roles. The script is terrible and a bad direction won't help. Make me benefit ... avoid this movie.
