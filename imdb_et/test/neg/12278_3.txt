Tony Curtis and Skip Homier both wear black, with white finishing fabrics just before and after the swim and tank blow. Young stars should be too hard on their feet. If the real Navy had been on the mission, they would have been boots. In the first scene, they took down their leggings just before their little trip to find a farmer. When they went to the area where they dug the fox holes, Tony and Skip are wearing fighting boots, then later when Lovejoy and Curtis got into Framer and his daughter Tony wears "Tennis shoes", but hey is black. A movie about a real story, but do they really need love for interest?
