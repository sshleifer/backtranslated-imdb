So I give it one star for true quality, but I'd give him eight and a half to enjoy. Incredibly strange sex comedy and vigilante-thriller hybrid, "Young Warriors" is just such a bad film that you usually expect to hit a video movie, but so rarely. It starts with about half an hour of nervous hi-jinx, jokes about sex and juveniles of Shenanigan (including the martini of a martini that must not be believed). Then the younger sister of the main game arrives from the gang rape ring attack (this is an undesirable scene that keeps me from 10 entertaining values ​​- rape is not entertainment!), And the main character gets the rest of the sex crazy. Brothers to help him in his quest to clean up the city, find the responsible cyclists and kill someone in the light of the criminal offenses they get along. <br /> <br /> This is fun, fun fun, besides a very unpleasant rape scene and it is important to watch serious bad movie fans. Trust me - I've put on these things and this is one of the best. Highlights include an excellent library visit, a fabulous flashing slo-mo shootout in a lousy bar (with a hit on his leg that is quite impressive), a couple of decent slum actors (Richard Roundtree, Ernest Borgnine), a couple of semi-famous recognizable faces (Lynda Day George, screaming queen Linnea Quigley) and a couple of famous people (Chuck Norris brother Mike, member of the Van Patten clan James). He even has one of those great "What have we got?" Type of moral lessons to the end, although the turning point comes when the vigilante fratboys of a couple of children robbing the robbery of a toy gun. I've always wondered why this was a catalyst that got hero thinking; After all, whether they were children and not hardened criminals and whether they had a real weapon or not, they still robbed the store, so as far as I can tell, it was just another job our vigilante frat boys, right? Wonderful things. Highly recommended, just don't blame me if you enjoy it despite yourself.
