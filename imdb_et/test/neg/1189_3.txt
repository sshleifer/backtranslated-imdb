If you followed the series and love too much, then I will be disappointed. I went to the cinema with a group of die-hard-league fans and we all agreed that this movie wasn't as funny or dark as the three series. In my personal opinion, it was a money spinner. Writing was structured and confused with the plot - not to confuse what he was trying to do. It was the worst sensors' feeling, which is much more talented than my pathetic criticism. I hope that at least the league can be honest enough in itself and admit that this film is lower than the excellent three series. I do not buy it despite having most of the over-talk.
