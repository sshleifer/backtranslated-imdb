I have not understood the chosen title with the film. This is another collection of monsters like FRANKENSTEIN HOME. Not a very masterful plot, but Universal had to capitalize again. <br /> <br /> Dr Edelman (Onslow Stevens) is either very ambitious or up the ego department. He's on treatment to keep Larry Talbot a wolf. In any case, Count Dracula falls to get a vampire repair. And rounding off a good doctor's experiment is the recovery of Frankenstein's monster energy. Along the way, dirty medical blood is with Dracula. <br /> <br /> John Carradine plays Dracula again. This time he is more convincing. Lon Chaney Jr., as usual, is the spiritual Wolf Man. Glenn Strange is a Frankenstein monster who has very little to do. Lionel Atwill and Martha O'Driscoll also have role-playing roles.
