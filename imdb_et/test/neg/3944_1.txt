I can say that it would be bad on the trailer, but I was able to rent it to attract the DVD box. Boy, I was right. <br /> <br /> Also, the DVD version is very blurry and unclear for some reason (in terms of video quality). They seem to have filmed the whole movie with a 20-year-old camcorder, it looks so bad. I really did not like the plot and after watching the film I was very let down. I'm not saying any spoilers, but it is said that the end was so bad that I laughed, it was done so many times before. <br /> <br /> The whole story seems to be something that came out of high school English paper. If I had to confirm one movie as the worst horror film I've ever seen, it might be just that. I can't believe they actually released that movie. It's not really a rent or penny for someone's money if you don't want to laugh at the expense of the movie.
