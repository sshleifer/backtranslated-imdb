The Sci-Fi channel thinks it's Sci-Fi; shame. Big Bugs, Snakes, Mythical Beasties, Forward and Forward, They Stand. <br /> <br /> Some Universal had the brain to add BattleStar Galactica (new, good) and Firefly for a short while in their line. I know they know they are different from all garbage and extremely high quality sci-fi. <br /> <br /> A few years ago they were in the way they were all high and powerful, making productions that were not just for us, lame-o Trekkies. Thank you so much, Sci-Fi! You know, you made the movies so bad that even Trekkies didn't watch them, so you achieved your goal! Fire Serpent, Ice Spiders, Manticore, Larva, etc. And a huge relentless crap storm later and they are still faster than the latest influenza viruses! How do they do that? Why they do it, I just don't know. How they can't ignore these comments, comments, blogs, and emails, don't know, but it's clear that they don't think much about their audience or care about our opinions! They think this is what sci-fi fans want! You think that one or two good productions would slip somewhat somewhat when this green light breaks this holiday. At least they use the Misfit Toys collection; several weekly players' films were once in Science Fiction and now need money. I love you and I hope you get a better job!
