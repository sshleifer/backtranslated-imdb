This film is nothing more than Christian propaganda. It started as a good sci-fi movie and then works on a syrup sweet Christian theme story that is completely interrelated. I had to turn it off halfway because I felt it was renting. The Catholic Church has officially stated that foreigners are NOT contrary to faith in God. <br /> <br /> The film is nevertheless fun, but the dialogue is incredible, writing and showing are mostly rubbish and all this movie is mostly to avoid stinker. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers obviously did some research, but then you quickly realize that only paranoid religious viewing just needs to break and inject. a valid interesting topic. If you are an avid religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels, you will love this movie.
