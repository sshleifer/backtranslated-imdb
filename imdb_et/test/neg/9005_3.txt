"The Thomas Crown Affair" is a terrible remake of a non-very good movie that can only be used in topless shots of the former supermodel Renee Russo. <br /> <br /> That's it. The plot is void, Pierce Brosnan called partially, and Dennis Leary (as usual) plays a tedious Irish policeman, but I couldn't take away the beautiful Mrs. Russos. The staircase has a sharp love-shaping scene, a terribly sexy ballroom, a topless beach scene and a roller bag. Oh, and there is a painting stolen from the museum, and the catamaran gets sunk. <br /> <br /> We hope that other leaders will admit Mrs Russo's supernatural attributes and cast her more in visible roles.
