Last night, in the history of the international channel, this film took three hours, including ads. But it seemed for three weeks. It was not an inexpensive, static, and unintentionally funny image of Dresden's bombing. It was not that the film had almost any context surrounding World War II. It wasn't even that the bombing itself had often appeared as something other than a great uncomfortable joke love story. No, it was a characteristic character of a tree that wondered the story of this life. Oh, and the fact that when the movie is possible, Dresden is this movie. Perhaps the better title would have been DRESDEN - AS URIAH HEEP, with experience. <br /> <br /> This is especially the last point that irritates you. Was the Dresden bombing a war crime? The makers of this movie believe this. But typically in the emasculated way that the Germans have come to approach World War II, they can not bring it to say without braying about "peace" and "more wars - everywhere" as they are the mother of Teresa. And what is typical of the German-language attitude, especially against the British, is the "british" struggle to load all "guilt" on Dresden for one person, Arthur Harris. <br /> <br /> Did I tell one person? Well, not quite. At the beginning of the film, the leading nickname is Anna, with whom we should all express compassion. "Shoot the Americans!", He shouts, looking so far away from the bombs. And a few minutes later, the voice of the radio warned the intonists about the "bombing of American terrorists" that the Germans are being inflicted on. <br /> <br /> Note the word "terror". I understood? It's really Americans behind the inhumane targeting of German civilians. Whatever the American strategy for almost the entire European war, the "precision" of industrial and war products was a bombing. Whatever they were, the British were eager to bombard civilian targets in Germany - before the Germans even targeted English. No matter how the Americans bombed during the day, more people in the process suffered than the British in targeting accuracy targets while the British bombed civilians at night. Whatever the Americans are, in essence, defeating and screaming at the RAF's real terrorist campaign. It doesn't matter that most American officials, from FDR to Geneva Dolittle, would be targeted at civilians, while Churchill and his generals could not wait for it. <br /> <br /> No, DRESDEN, both Germans and Britons, except "Bomber" Harris, is an innocent doctrine, incited by the Americans. And only the ability and ability of a German sister and a drowned British bomber pilot can adequately explain the "truth" of cruelty. Right. <br /> <br /> By the way, for the younger and probably less readers of the IMDb, the first and so far only great literary effort was to give Dresden a thoughtful voice to the pacifist novel Kurt Vonnegut - America's racing in Dresden during the bombing. I think the German ZDF didn't find a sister for Billy Pilgrim.
