It was the most unrealistic movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can't believe the writer and director didn't see almost all the movies look like SF. <br /> <br /> For example: <br /> <br /> 1. The killer is unable to stay cold and rise up quickly after 10 hours. <br /> <br /> 2. You won't get an electric shock through a water pipe like in a movie (believe me, it's my domain) <br /> <br /> 3. With 10 minutes, you can cut 10 tubes very easily. Suppose the chain was made of steel, but the water pipe was rusty and it was made of iron. <br /> <br /> 4. When you try to cut your leg with a prey, you need to get to the bone (at best, die because your charter fails). <br /> <br /> And there are other examples.
