It is sad that Schwarzenegger was the best thing for this production, especially given that he was not yet his own, and was still as harsh as the priest in his dialogue. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's not as bad as some critics say, but it's not good either. It is fun and plays like a poor Conan line cousin, making it a controversial, uneven, and poor job. And when talking about the poor, quality is terrifying because of the era when it was filmed, but that's not the only reason. <br /> <br /> This story is even worse, even on the Conan line, but moreover, it loses itself "Red Sonja must dominate with a strong strong Schwarzenegger" and forget the goal once it was. <br /> <br /> It's a fun, but low budget, guilty - "B" five way. <br /> <br /> This price is 4.2 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
