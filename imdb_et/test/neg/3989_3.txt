The film is visually stunning: the dusty interior of the church and the illuminated oven, through the drizzly street, and the locked garage that is the climax of the film. It also has a great sense of time in the 1950s (opening the film) as well as in the 1960s. All performances are top-notch, especially as the psychotic preacher of Mathew MacFadyen and Gerard McSorley as the father who fears his son with intolerance. It is a pity that the story is so ridiculous. First of all, by focusing on the relationship between Gabriel (McFadyen) and his family, he cannot fully demonstrate how he has been able to influence the community so much. In the church we see five or six characters on the front and two or three on the back, but the rest of the congregation can also be dummies: they have no sign of hearing, touching or dissenting. from him; nobody tells anyone or not if he stops the procedure, but nobody accepts or condemns when Caroline throws him over; The situation that brings the stone thrown through the pub window has been mysteriously solved with the onset of labor pains. Secondly, it seems that Middletown (which is not really a city but a small village) seems to have some important services, such as the police and the fire department: the murder can only be carried out by a crowded family member; the inhabitants look at the inferno that threatens to settle in the whole city as if they were in the cinema. To do this, everyday things like telephones and newspapers are strikingly absent, the rural community is strange about farm animals or wheat fields, and the most intelligent of all the "typical" centers of Northern Ireland is only one Christian community - even a few Anglican do not mix. Even if you are willing to stop the disbelief, this story is pretty tough, A.J. Cronini melodrama. And music? Well, it's beautiful in the first two minutes, but if the same four chords are repeated within 90 minutes, it becomes more than a little irritating. My advice: Check out this sound.
