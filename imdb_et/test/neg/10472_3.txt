In sweet water, the ambitious company Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) builds in the wilderness in the midst of the Katonahide protest. When three workers locate some Indian relics and bones locally in the Indian Ocean, they accidentally release a giant skeleton like Bone Eater and their bones are intimidated. Half-breed sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) a.k.a. Running Wolf is responsible for investigating the loss of staff that Krantz forced to arrest the demonstrators. But the beast eater attacks and kills other locals, while the Chief Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) is looking for an ancient Tomahawkit capable of destroying the evil creature. <br /> <br /> "Bone eater" is a flat and silly film that has one of the most ridiculous scenarios I've ever seen. The characters and the situation are not well developed and things happen without any further consequences. The conclusion is probably the worse part of this flick, a typical white North American Bruce Boxleitner, dressed like India (a story, his grandfather was an Indian), cutting his own wrist (why? And where's the blood later?) And turning the ax bones eaterly. chest, destroying the monster and his last hope that the story will improve. My last question: does the bone-eater eat the bones that happen to the meat and clothes of his victims? My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Devorador de Ossos" ("Bone eater")
