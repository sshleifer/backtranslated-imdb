Yeah, that's what I felt after watching the movie. Operation is below average and special effects are terrible. In fact, the worst I've ever seen is. This is a very low budget movie. This film has no chance of scaring, it has no horrible or scary moments. Mr. Bone Eater was a more funny creature for me. It could have been much better, but well, they didn't have a big budget. The film doesn't convince you to watch a horror movie, lol. I would call this movie The Time Eater. I'm sure you would have much better movies / etc. Keep watching if: 1. You have nothing else to look at. 2. You can watch it for free. Not at all worth renting.
