If you are insomnia and you can't sleep, I recommend this movie for sure. If you rent it for another reason .... DONT! .... this movie is one of the slowest moving turtle-motivated movies I've ever seen. The only reason I rented it was that my brother wanted some strange and strange reason. I can't even write about this movie anymore ... SEND ME TO MY !!!!!!!!
