The development of films based on actual events of cryptology or supernatural events has always been a challenge for directors and screenwriters. You will soon have to reconcile the reported testimony, contradictory sources of information, and Hollywood creativity to create something that the audience can get. Unfortunately, none of these things seem to SASQUATCH. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a traditional movie clip when a team from a research team flies somewhere in Cascades. From there, the team of investigators disappears and, despite attempts by law enforcement officers and local rescue partners, they will disappear for some time. When one of the passengers travels, infrared images are sprayed onto the screen (la Predator), which suggests that the legendary Sasquatch is the cause of the fate of passengers. <br /> <br /> Cue Harlan Knowles (Henriksen), CEO of BioComp Industries and Father of one of the accident victims. Knowles brings its search and rescue team together with an explicit mission to find their daughter and the rest of the research team with invaluable technology lost in the accident. <br /> <br /> After Knowles' special rescue team is assembled, the entire movie moves along colorful characters, whimsical cinematography, and a completely unigiginal plot line. I had to literally fall asleep during this film because it was trying to scare me away from my mind. Henriksen, alone, was the only member of his own, who did not compensate for the lack of depth in all the other letters. The over-effects of sound were also annoying; Basically, I didn't know if I was watching the movie Bigfoot or grizzly bears. <br /> <br /> The plot was not all that big. It was too underdeveloped because the viewer is mostly subordinated to typical fear music found in any similar genre. Of course you didn't have to be a genius to find out who would pull out all your clothes in the middle of the movie or who would be the first unhappy soul to get by Mr Sasquatch. As for the good points, there are none, and so I gave it to 10 out of 10.
