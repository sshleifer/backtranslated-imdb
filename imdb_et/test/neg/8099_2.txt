First - nick-623, Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941, not in 1942. They didn't have to predict the bomb attacks. <br /> <br /> Second - did anyone notice the six industries / lawyers / whatever was short of time? They were killed * before the * operation! Third, how can I see hell without seeing the Lugos booth? Fourth, why didn't the Japanese kill him just to put him in jail with a comfortable companion and his surgical kit? Fifth, oh, what is it? This movie has some interesting moments, but by the time they explain what's happening, you've probably stopped. If not, you don't care.
