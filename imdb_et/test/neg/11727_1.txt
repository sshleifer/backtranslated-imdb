It was badly shot. Quick work seems to be the last minute casting obvious. Writing is very weak. Good for the stage, not for the movie. I'm bad for Andrew McCarthy. He is a very good actor who has not played a good role lately. This role was not for him. Maybe it was joyful to have it. This film will remain in the festival circle.
