When you watch this DVD disc - they tell you what they've tried here - they repeat the Bible story about the good and the evil and try to announce it to the main film audience. In today's society, like us, this is the place where the film fails. There are too many sheep in this movie. People are too empowered for such preaching today. <br /> <br /> As far as functional, guiding and technical functions are concerned, they are OK. Chuck Norris is actually an angel, because the unpredictable appearance of Norris as an angel is no longer absurd as Tommy Smothers was in the 1960s.
