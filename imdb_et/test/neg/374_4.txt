Although the story is good and depicts what I expected from Sam Elliot, my DVD copy contained almost unbearable sync problems. The dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the lip movement across the film. <br /> <br /> So I would be very careful when I buy a movie DVD without checking the problem. <br /> <br /> I would also follow the recommended censor classifications, especially regarding language and drug use. <br /> <br /> This movie can become a silent classic police clip, and I can recommend it to future viewers with the warning signs above.
