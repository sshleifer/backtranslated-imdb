"Book II" is not a film, it is a sermon. This nauseous, sickly, and almost intolerant false function is likely to act as religious propaganda, but it has no entertaining value than any George Burns wisecracks. Louanne plays a little girl whom (ahem) God asked to place an advertising campaign to help people believe her again. Not really, it's a story. This is the burden of the old cloakers, who have too many self-evident "explanatory" religious waffles, but hardly any decent dialogue and certainly no even magic or magic approach. "Suck on 34th Street" it's not. Suzanne Pleshette breathes a bit of life into the dirty concrete that is quickly erected in concrete, but the pudding-like script and brown Louanne dumps quickly send it to the fiery depth of your knowledge.
