The street gang is brutally murdered by a boy-tired boy's sister who sends a young man's sudden psychotic rampage. He and his mates kill half of the city to bring their sister back. <br /> <br /> SAVAGE STREETS was released a year later and was more interesting. Linnea Quigley, who plays a costly role in this movie for a boy's sexy (and short naked) girlfriend, also played in SAVAGE STREETs. <br /> <br /> This movie is a subpar, although it offers enough escapade entertainment and free nudity please your target audience (myself). <br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated for strong violence, nudity, language and some sexuality.
