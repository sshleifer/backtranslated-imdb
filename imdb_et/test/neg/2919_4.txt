Although it is not always a classic comedy, it's a pretty good movie to see if it gets rainy on Saturday morning, where there's nothing else. Cobb, an American who comes home after growing up in China, where his father was a missionary. He has come from China to his homeland to find an American woman and plan to return to China to continue his father's work. his corrupt home town, when an existing political machine that controls the city, realizes that it is making a perfect cushion against the current mayor, who is also the leader of the city's underworld. this is why the mayor continues to lead the city and lead his schemes that make them all rich. <br /> <br /> Lloyd doesn't do physical comedy here as he does in silent movies. He makes a convincing picture of Cobb, who has reserved undervalued dignity was good for everyone involved and the story and scripts were also quite good. but these stereotypes are not nearly as big as I've seen from other movies ever since. .This movie does not breathe, but it may be enough to be interested in Lloyd and want to see more of your work.
