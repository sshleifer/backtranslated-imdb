What should have been a routine babysitting concert in a separated lake house will become a fright, because high school student Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) will receive phone calls threatening a sadistic stalker, trying to keep pace. br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes of the original movie were pretty good, but everything was downhill. Transformation takes them for the first 20 minutes and stretches them into an 80-minute feature film. It's a good idea because it eliminates everything that made the original bad. But if they wanted to work the film more efficiently, they would have had to hire a better acting actress, a better director, a writer, and so on. There is no relationship, everything can be thought out long before it happens, and it's a very boring film, because it doesn't happen much. You don't have to sit down for at least 90 minutes of sitting. <br /> <br /> When this assumption works, the leading actor must deliver a realistic result. Camilla Belle gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen, and throughout the film she seemed to read her. You have a leading role in the Hollywood movie, which is viewed by millions of people and you don't make any effort at all! Why were they hired this girl? Of course, she's beautiful, but she can't do anything at all, but I think it's not important for the target group who probably eats that movie. The rest is more blissful and forgotten, especially the woman who plays the maid, Rosa. Even a stranger was flat and his lines on the phone were not at all effective. <br /> <br /> This film reminds me of the frustrating horror film Boogeyman in recent years. This movie was a series of cheap fears and false alarms, and when alien calls are pretty much the same. Jill enters the room because she hears the noise, but it's just a false alarm like a cat or maid. This type of scene is happening over and over until a stranger appears in about 50 minutes. He must be one of the flattering killers. He didn't carry any weapons and didn't feel like a big threat. The end is bad, but it fits the rest of the movie so it's not really important. The film is directed by Simon West and he is really bad at building. He used every clich√© he thought and the results were not very good. The house was amazing and I'll give it a movie. It was an isolated house, so it was quite horrible, but it is the only good thing this movie offers. Finally, if you are not a teenage girl, you should skip the movie. Rating 2/10
