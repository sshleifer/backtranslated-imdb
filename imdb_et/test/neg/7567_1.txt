If I could give this film less than 1, I'd definitely do it. I had read this film in the LA Times and found myself walking from the theater and remembering the review. My wife and I were in the game and we thought it couldn't be as bad as the critic said - you know the critics. Of course ... Give me a break from dreadful operation, terrible camera work, budget misuse (this is mentioned over and over again as an excuse). I've been working on movies with a budget less than 100 times better. It's a director and a producer who makes movies work - they choose teams. That's it. If they don't put it together and do it ... it's just not. So, they weren't - and that's not. I don't think they can ... I had to take the time to write this ... though I'm sure the film crew doesn't appreciate this review - I hope I'll do all it takes for you to make a good start, but - Another career. Success.
