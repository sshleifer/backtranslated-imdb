I borrowed a friend from the DVD the other day. I didn't know what to expect. I haven't seen many Russian films and I don't think I've ever seen a Russian film. Maybe it made me wait for something else, beyond the imaginary Russian mentality. But whatever these expectations came, they were put to shame because it was a fairly common war movie. <br /> <br /> The whole formula by which some young people are recruited, trained, deployed and some battles are well known. We have seen it both years ago and recently (as in Jarhead). Of course, there are differences here, because the film is almost like Russian soldiers instead of Americans. But in general it can be as simple as Vietnamese film. I think it just highlights my feeling that Afghanistan was the Soviet Union. The country, which should have been a driving force of superpower, made war a terrible death for years for both soldiers and civilians. <br /> <br /> The good points of this movie were a good photo (with some beautiful atmospheric shots) and good effects on what I think should have been a fairly low budget movie. What made me disappointed is mostly the story itself. It just can't interfere with any emotion in me. Mostly because the character's development is weak. And to really feel something when people are attacked, you have to make them human, not just for bogus cutouts. They don't do it in this movie. It is also too long, and it seems like a trend lately. In my opinion, a film that is more than two hours long has a lot to offer, and this movie doesn't cut it. There is also some disturbing music placed on every scene as a damp deck. Particularly in action scenes, it is very disturbing, not that you need action music, but anything other than just slow keyboard music would be great. Otherwise, the production values ​​were good enough, it wasn't a problem. <br /> <br /> I don't know how to watch this movie. Remember the fact that no matter where you are, the war sucks? That Russian filmmakers have already viewed too many American war films to make something original? Regardless of what this film is quite a cliche, there is no spirit, and although it has acceptable technical features, it lacks scripts and character development. Finally, it just becomes one of those warfare films that can't think of you and can't add anything to the genre. I'm much worse, but also much better. I appreciate it 4/10.
