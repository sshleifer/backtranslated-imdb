The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so bad that it forced me to register and comment. At this point, I should add that I am a film buff who rarely falls for tough decisions. But sometimes the film works so badly, poorly prepared, poorly edited, so bad that it creates criticism. and this movie was beautifully captured. I can only conclude that the cast and the team are active posters here. The action was extremely thin. The tempo of the film was embarrassing. I gave him new opportunities at all times (mostly because I didn't want to open myself on Saturday morning in NY), but for every new scene he pulled it out longer, giving me no signs I couldn't connect to whom I didn't managed to feel empathy. <br /> <br /> If I see negative reviews of such small independent movies on IMDb, I sometimes think that the poster has a personal ax for grinding (something like that). he still used the digger, he reduced it, and now he's all he's working on. But here, fast. I don't know anyone working with this movie. And I wish it was great. But the film was not dark (as some have mentioned) or frustrating (as others have claimed). . . they suggest that I'm connected to the film. . . Henry May Long was just too long, empty and annoying. <br /> <br /> It's Tomas.
