Does anyone remember an alternative comedy showing COMIC STRIP. In one publication, Charles Bronson (Robbie Coltrane) was interviewed about his new film GLC: <br /> <br /> "It's about a man, a normal man whose wife and family are wiping away and I have to whimper them and kill them in sadistic and graphic in the sense of "<br /> <br />" And after GLC, what's next for Bronson? "<br /> <br />" We're using a new corner. /> <br /> It describes exactly the evil who do. This is a Bronson vigilant thriller, where his motivation is not a bloodthirst, but it leads to a credibility that becomes tense <br /> <br /> Bronson is a retired man who does not give up his retirement until someone shows him a video tape containing interviews with "The Doctor" victims, not a legendary traveler, but an infamous expert on torture. It has never really been explained why the doctor is so infamous because every police administration has a lot of these sadists and has not explained why the doctor and his sister have ridiculous English accents <br /> <br /> As you may think, this is lazyly written in film and incident because the screenwriter needs things to happen to go on the plot, no matter how likely they are like one of the bad guys who are invited to threes so that he can be killed or things shown as a nurse's lesbian R&D can add <br /> <br /> In many ways, it's like one of those nasty Chuck Norris vehicles that were released at the same time, but the most disappointing thing is that the director is the same man who made two very well-behaved ICE THREE ALEXIS AND NAVERONE GUNSIDES a movie that is often celebrated on Sunday afternoon. Believe me, this movie will not be shown before the end of the water
