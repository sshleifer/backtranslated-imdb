Playmania is very boring. This is the basis for the exhibition. Mel or Shandi ask very easy questions that a 2-year-old can answer very slowly. This exhibition lasts 2 hours and is likely to play only 10 games in this period. People may like this example because hosts are eye candies, but they are completely destroyed by heat because they are so harsh. <br /> <br /> During the show, they mention that we need more players a million times. Top 5 studies that they probably take about 20 minutes of display. This exhibition is probably one of the worst games ever made. One reason they don't have callers is that it's cheap for money. The most money I have seen these hands was $ 210. I wouldn't be surprised if this "game show" was canceled by the end of 2006.
