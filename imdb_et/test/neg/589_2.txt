I'll never get back three years of what this movie stole from me. <br /> <br /> Film is basically a psychedelic addiction that is considered an important creative process. I would like to know what they were at the time of making this movie. <br /> <br /> This is also a historically inaccurate film; 2001 has come and gone without events or predictions. <br /> <br /> Characters are unlikely, design is easier, and everything sounds easy without any sense or logic. <br /> <br /> And the end is probably the worst thing: he should be thoughtful, but the only way I thought was "What's F $ * K going on?!" <br /> <br /> I would say that anyone who is looking for serious entertainment goals will turn this movie off at all costs and choose a sci-fi movie that isn't stuck with his @ $$.
