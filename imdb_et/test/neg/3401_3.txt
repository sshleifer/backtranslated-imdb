How about this documentary? Much more than a walking ghost can take in any southern city. Quotes fell generously, without trying to identify the source. George Orwell was the most identified quotation. <br /> <br /> Documents were referred to without ever being produced in any form. The flat-scamed images depicting the stock of the period's film were split apart from historical film rolls without separation from reality and self-promotion. The rolls of the film, which were completely unreal and unlikely by that time, were left as if Blair Witch had tried to build a drum house that would simply have been a dead property. <br /> <br /> Is it not in any way a great honor for the actual victims of tuberculosis, a dance in their collective tombs for commercial purposes? The line between the actual frame and the self-service produced is so thin; suspicion of suspicion was so small; scientific boundaries are so brutally ignored ... how could this be my TiVo documentary? <br /> <br /> This is a holiday allowance, and it will succeed. <br /> <br /> Hell, I'd visit you to find it in Google Earth. Not scary said previous poster. Not too serious, says I. Amazing story. Tough film.
