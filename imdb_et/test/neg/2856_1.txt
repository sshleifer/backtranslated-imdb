.... You get this stupid excuse from the child's play game! What did they mean? First, they interfere with Rumpelstiltskin's horror film, so they do it right. Fariy Tale's Wrath! Frankly, I've seen it as a child, and it frightened me a little bit just because I was aged, assuming Pinocchio didn't, wah wah wah. But I have grown up and come to think of it as a child's hanging out, fairy tales, and a flat Tales From The Crypt episode, or trying to be at least one with a stupid ending that was stupid, and it was many plot holes and I still don't understand how it is alive. Was it the work of evil Geppetto? Then, after some evil, will he become a real boy who becomes America's most sought after? Personally, I think the evil Geppetto concept sounds better, builds a wooden murder army and starts funny crimes. But it's terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, ONLY good! ATTENTION! Stinky like a shoe and terrible! That's a miracle of the miracle! If you want a killer doll, let yourself kill the doll, especially the child's play, no strings. Or, if you want the fairy tale to look upside down, check out Leprechaun or if you want Pinocchio, check out the animated version of Disnet or live version of Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Martin Landau instead. >>>>> -10/10 (negative 10)
