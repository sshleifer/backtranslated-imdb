Luscious Candace Bergen as the original Victorian beauty, Sean Connery kidnapped as a devilish desert in Sheikh! How can I go wrong? How? Oh, let me count you! Reputation, primitive Sean Connery, exactly the right person who can tolerate brittle, stylish beauty like Candace. . . Well, in the role. This is because instead of having a dialogue on the real issues ("you are a woman ... I am a man!"), She has to hit the pointless "will of God" and "the wind blows fate with the sand of the desert." "John Milius, a director who is more well-known for worshiping naked male organizations and brute military power than a normal human relationship, is a crazy way to cut off his desert lovers every time it seems Candace is able to kiss. up to date with a stunningly attractive person, we have been treated by Brian Keith for an infinite (and I mean ENDLESS) blinking his nut-sized choppers and offering sharp sermons about Teddy Roosevelt's joy, I have nothing against Teddy Roosevelt, but looking at him for testing his new rifle or To make calls from a hero of a big bear, just don't worry about how the love story of Candace Bergen and Sean Connery would be ... if it had ever really been! The odd thing is that Milius spends most of the time creating characters and a story that doesn't have Candace's two little children will create as much time as she does that is, what has happened to him in the desert has no humor, no chemistry, no sparkle. If you think it's funny, after a week of horse-drawing, her hair is still perfect. <br /> <br /> The only "real" moment of the story is when late at night, Candace Bergen shakes her little daughter out of a soft cushion with soft sleep and says, "We have to flee." A little girl turns and says that without any flaws, "the mother answers, I slept!" The fact that one line summarizes what the story actually lacked. Ladies in captivity have no danger, intercourse, or the main story of spunk. She (and her children) are so harsh and well-cared for that it is hard to believe that someone has worked on her destiny. <br /> <br /> Remember that if Candace had said she'd worked better. If the tension came from enjoying his imprisonment (or his joy from Sean Connery) and his guilt that all his kidnappings were caused, the story would have been tense. But Milius is making a strange assumption that the audience has worked as well as he has, whether Teddy Roosevelt has the chance to prove his manhood three miles away. Finally, a beautiful lady and her children do not seem worth it to her. . . and because they are at the center of the story, the whole thing looks pretty dry and endless. . . like burning desert sands.
