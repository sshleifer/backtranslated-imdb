Trite and unoriginal. It's like someone who looked at Immortal Beloved and Amadeus, and decided to mix them and steal other formative parts of the plot to make another. Like most of today's historical films, there are some inaccuracies when history is manipulated to make it better suited to a story that is usually understandable. For example, the rest of the days of Beethoven's life required other people to write what they needed to understand. Of course, it would have been unpleasant to show on the screen. The script, which is filled with some quoted lines, does not reflect the feeling of this time period and seems to be quite modern with some bad effects. Diane Kruger is nice to watch, but she still has a lot to improve her craft. Ed Harris doesn't work for me like Beethoven, and I blame Gary Oldman mostly. In general, music is not a very good interpretation of the maestro life. Better just find yourself a copy of Immortal Beloved. <br /> <br /> http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews
