I saw this movie last night. And I am worried that I will become one of the left-wing liberals whom they entertain in South Park. Because I found it very offensive. Am I ridiculously sensitive? First, there is an old stapler that's America, the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything, ever. <br /> <br /> Secondly, when you cool down, there's an early meteor shot that hits some (unnamed?) why they need a name?) An Asian country. The reaction to this is to look at it as a warning. Like "my god, imagine the tragedy that * could * happen". Because you know it happened to the Asians. White Americans can happen, and * it would be tragic. <br /> <br /> Then, later, the bigger meteor hits Paris. Our cast spot is upset because it could mean our boys have less time than they thought. America is not much upset. It is not mentioned that many people are dead. <br /> <br /> Then there is Michael Clarke Duncan. Wonderful actor, wasted. Never has a black man been so symbolic. Among the heavy cage team, his work seems to be behind him, sometimes saying, "Hey, you, man." Really. Why do they even bring him? It's not as he is small - he weighed this shuttle for nothing! Never lift a tool, drive a spaceship or even blow something up. <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the Russian cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great actor who wastes a meaningless role) who seems drunk for most of the time and hits things with wrenches instead of fixing them because "Dat is how we die in Russia, "it's pretty terrible. <br /> <br /> Everything is, of course, affirmed by the blonde, blue eyes of American children who celebrate corn fields at the time of salvation and everything is fine. Because the death and destruction of the whole world is irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Waiting for a bad script, an unpleasant act, an incredible plot (fat, middle-aged men trained as astronaut for 12 days? Including one who seems to have slowed down?). But I could not believe that racism and xenophobia in the film, and that anyone who has not been fed America, is very neglectful. <br /> <br /> This is a cool accusation of western attitudes. Society for the world. <br /> <br /> And it's a dirty movie.
