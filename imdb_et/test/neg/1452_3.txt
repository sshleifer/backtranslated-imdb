It seems to me that I remember a lot of film about this movie when it came out but hadn't seen it over the years. I wish I waited longer. Maybe this movie was funny in 1988, I don't know. I was younger then, but it didn't seem like the world was so different. Michelle Pfeiffer, as she is, is never convincing. Mercedes Ruehl not only chews the landscape, but brings it to his cheeks like a gerbil to save later. Dean Stockwell is about as convincing as a mob boss if James Gandolfin were Bolshoi's main dancer. And Matthew Modine demonstrated that puberty delay is the most noticeable when I've ever seen it. All in all, it is not bad enough for you to bring out your eyes with a melon baller, but it is not far away.
