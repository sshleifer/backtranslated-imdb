Jim Carrey is a special sense of humor and I personally think he is a great actor (such as Eternal Sunshine). <br /> <br /> But this movie is probably something other than Jim Carrey's vehicle, so be aware immediately that if you don't think his comedy style is funny, you will be faced with all this film because he there is nothing else to suggest. <br /> <br /> Even if you like Carrey's comedy, I'm not sure you'll find this movie fun. I went to see it on Saturday evening at 22.30 and the audience was definitely ready to laugh. They grabbed the whole trailer, which wasn't very funny, but when it came to the film, it was rocky silence. I think it raised about five real smiles. <br /> <br /> The film's problem is not what he wants to be. It can't remember whether it's going to hit or seriously. If it were stupid, it would have been forgiven, but (I think) is also an attempt to highlight the relationship between the two central characters. <br /> <br /> The strong side of the film is keeping there a lot of possibilities. But they did not start halfway and remained largely developed. Meanwhile, you have to sit for the first 40 minutes when a couple of lives get worse. <br /> <br /> Four separate groups walked out of this movie when I was there, and if my general commander didn't ask me to keep away from the house (his girlfriend, who had just rested for a month!), I would have done the same. And throughout my 25-year movie I've been doing it once before.
