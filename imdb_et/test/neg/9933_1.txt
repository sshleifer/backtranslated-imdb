First, even IMDb is open for this movie because the cast list is very "gappy". Even the main characters are missing, for example, Buddy. <br /> <br /> Now back to the movie. I love watching movies, but it tortured me all over the 82s or so for several minutes. It was HORRID. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. And the reason why it bothers me so much is that I was quite excited to see it. <br /> <br /> The line itself is good. It could have been a good movie if it was done properly and carefully. Golden Brooks was a huge disappointment. I see now that the only role he can play is the loud, fun loving, energetic sexy chick he plays with girlfriends. Melodrama roles are not at all for him. He killed his character, Rachel. <br /> <br /> I love some cast, such as Deborah Cox, Mel Jackson, and Darrin Dewitt Henson, but even they couldn't save that catastrophic movie. Of course, my only personal opinion is that I can't hold Hill Harper and he didn't help me any more. <br /> <br /> The voice of Golden Brooks is so painful that I had to force myself to stop watching the movie. It seemed he whispered all over the joint. The director I don't even take will leave such a bad job. Editing, photography / camera focus and almost everything about this movie was SAD. Not to mention dialogs! Absolutely unreal and many times straight fun (if it was to cry you and look for yourself). <br /> <br /> As I said, it could have been a very nice movie, but it was seriously confused. I do not recommend it to anyone unless they are cinematic large and want to see what they are not showing for their future work. <br /> <br /> Have a great day, everyone !!!
