This movie was very bad. I really mean very bad. The scenes were like a parody and a special effect was sucked up. And it was filmed in 2003 !!! I think it was a waste of time and money and Michael Shanks's "Shaggy from Scooby Doo" picture just made me laugh. Never waste your time with this picture ... I really don't know what the director thought after the final cut of the movie, but the struggles were so unrealistic that my eyes began to look at them. "Latex Lady Female" fighters were like sheep who just run around the scenes and were looking for fear as they had no idea what to do on the scene ... I think this is a beautiful example of the 100 bottom pictures.
