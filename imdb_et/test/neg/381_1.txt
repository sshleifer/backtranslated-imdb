Mr. Bean is just a bunch of unpleasant humor. It is the lowest humor television ever made in history. Scenes are often nasty and terrible canned laughter sends chills through the spine. Mr. Bean is a selfish and rude character and only receives compassion for how pathetic he is. It is unbelievable that such a low-quality TV series can be stored for 5 years. It is a complete waste of time to even look at one episode and one cannot help but express the disgust and regret why Rowen was depicted as a two-dimensional, unusual and ridiculous character. Or sorry why you even watched the episode. Tracking this is an aggravating experience.
