I cannot honestly believe that this is the follow-up to the horror film of John Landis's classical comedy in 1981. I don't think you can really describe it as the original werewolf movie, because the bare bones of the story steal an element from London: an American tourist visits the famous European capital, lives in a narrow werewolf attack that kills a colleague, he starts (Pardon the pun) in a sexual relationship with a medical worker someone , he changes his werewolf, he visits his dead victims' stories, and so on. and reading the previous line I just discovered how much the story shared with the original, that it really looks very similar. The difference is how enjoyable and entertaining the Landis movie is <br /> <br /> There are no scenes in this Paris movie that really look like. There is no naked man who wakes up in the zoo, wondering how he can get the money back and returning his clothes, there is no odd dream of Naziwerewolves and there is no noticeable climax. AAWIP is trying to be funny, but isn't anything more embarrassing than failed humor? I mean a scene where Andy McDermott must convince someone to whom he has chewing gum and not condoms! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two films is that this suspicious follow-up does nothing. You really know the fate and dilemma of the main man in the London movie, here you feel that Andy is nothing but a letter that passes through the script's literary movements. There is also a large number of holes in the plot. Is it the first time Lunar Club has made a massacre? If not, has there been a large number of dead bodies in the world press whose hearts have been pulled out? Why has the police not taken the lead? <br /> <br /> All others have mentioned it and so - visuals are bad. Look at the Eifell Tower Bungee Jump, it's painfully obvious that this is achieved with a blue screen projection, while werewolves are being redesigned by some very comic comics. I do not put Anthony Waller in the same staple as Stephen Sommers as a director who completely destroys the film because reliance on the CGI is greater (the main problem with AAWIP is the scenario, with great expectations for those who saw it). 1981 classic) but I would have preferred Rick Baker's type of special effects used in conversion. To be fair, it is wise to speculate that although the budget did not go so far. But at the end of the day, this is a rather bad horror movie that doesn't have to be done and DOG SOLDIERS is a much better entertainment
