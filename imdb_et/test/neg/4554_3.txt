Firetrap is another bad action film about a man who has yada and happy endings and a fire and burning and over-action, and a bad relationship and predictability, and ------------- ----- - Just don't see. <br /> <br /> (Dean Cain played Superman on Lois and Clark and no longer gets good roles. So I don't know if he's a good or bad actor. <br /> <br /> It's not why can't anyone stop those bad people who continue to do these things? * they are on a conveyor belt and hope they are good, they have to make a man whose job is just to burn bad movies, just next to him a bucket of carosine and dig things in. Every day illuminates and goes home.
