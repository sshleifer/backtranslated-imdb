This film has every clich√© of every movie of terrorism or aircraft crisis. <br /> <br /> But it is not completely unobtrusive, thanks to the good performances of Rowland, Loken and Smallwood (and perhaps Enberg). <br /> <br /> What is amazingly bad is the computer animations they try to exclude as live scenes. Boy, boy, CGI scenes "The Last Starfighter", filmed in 1984, are better than those (filmed 17 years later). Cheepney's feeling really sends her back. <br /> <br /> Damage, it could have been a much better movie with a little more budget and taste.
