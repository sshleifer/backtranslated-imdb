Rozema's 1999 Mansfield Park adaptation is much better than a seemingly more loyal film. The 1999 film has been overturned by many purists by purists, but I admire the work that Rozema did to embrace Mansfield Park. It may not be strictly Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, but at least it was well written, beautifully photographed and well-run by itself. I don't see how Austen's purists could be happier with the 2007 ITV version (and restart the Masterpiece Theater / PBS). The scenario is glued lightly and slid down, production values ​​are weak and cast (except for Jemma Redgrave and Blake Ritson) are mostly guilty of bad actions. I can't think of the worst confusion as Billie Piper as Fanny Price. Her appearance was wrong (bleached hair and dark times?) And her talent just didn't fit the material. Sir Thomas looked at constipation all the time. Michelle Ryan as Mariah was an autopilot, as did Crawford's actors (if I think the higher Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz were in the '99 version, I just shake my head). <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the 1983 version so I can't comment on it, but I would recommend someone who is curious to give the '99 version a chance. Read the novel before or after and remember.
