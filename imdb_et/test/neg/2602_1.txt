You know what? Family Guy started with something fresh, funny and original. Funny casual humor. I thought it was the best animated sitcom next to Simpson. Watching new episodes in recent weeks I grew up with an exhibition that relied too much on random humor to be funny. South Park was FG dead when they raised the manates and the idea of ​​the balls. <br /> <br /> And look at the example myself, I don't understand why my parents like it so much; there's nothing great there. "Intellegent" humor is funny and would have been funny if the exhibition was not based on randomness.
