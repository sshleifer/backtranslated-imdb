I think it's very interesting that this movie is called a thriller. It's nothing more than exciting. <br /> <br /> Most of the time you hear the piano. Then you hear the piano. Then some people talk about facts that do not touch anyone. <br /> <br /> Then the piano is called. <br /> <br /> Frankly, this film was the reason for registering in IMDb, because I think this movie is one of the people to be warned of. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: By the way, the most active part happens when a hot chocolate container leaks. <br /> It is also very interesting: "participants". Yes, quotes are deliberate, as you think, because they don't act. They play the piano and make a small talk, but they don't act. <br /> <br /> I think I'll never go to the cinema and feel angry before this movie. Really, this movie made me angry. Angry about the time and money I spent on it.
