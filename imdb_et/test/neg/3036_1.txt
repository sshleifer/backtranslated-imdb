Sorry, this movie was bad for a TV movie. Are you the rest of the drugs when you looked at it? I thought hair, make-up and characters were bad two-dimensional. The story is suspicious, especially since all the main characters are dead or almost dead. I think it hasn't worked well ... what was that hair in cephalopod turtles? It seemed badly glued and the bushes looked like they were falling at any moment. It didn't feel like the band's story had come up with something new and how members met other bands and people. I laughed all over, Frank Zappa seemed stupid, so did Mama Cass and so did the Beatles. They were made foolish and ridiculous. Other band members like Jim Morrison, Donovan also took a big hit with a fool. That terrible when you remember these people. It's a bad history lesson for music, it's fancy how it was done.
