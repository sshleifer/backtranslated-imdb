After a long hard night that had left at Walkabout in Islington, I needed to get up. My throat hurt, my purse was empty and I could talk to a drug addict at a bus stop trying to sell me gasoline. Today I watched "Red Sonja" and I can honestly say that I felt much better last night than I do today. Brigitte Nielsen manages different shapes and sizes to restore the green stone from some evil queen whose motives have never been fully explained. Yes, it's so good. <br /> <br /> "Red Sonja" is not a well-known movie genre until Peter Jackson came with the Oscar winning trilogy. In fact, the best sword and sorcery I could think of before Lord of The Rings was George Lucas's child-friendly "Willow". Maybe it's a bit easy to do with this movie. But I can't - it's poorly written, badly acted (except for Paul Smith, who's just average) and terribly put together. The film is as convincing as the Flintstone episode, where costumes and landscapes are apparently drawn out. Considering the source material of the comic book, it is easy to make different plot contradictions. Why Sonja emphasizes that the most disturbing boy in this world or in this world is rescue. His personality seems to be sliding through the corrupted brat on the polite gentleman's switch. Schwarzenegger has less charisma than cows and just passes through the movements, the perfect actor in his breakthrough role as "Terminator". <br /> <br /> It's easy to hit a movie if you are, but it is true that it is not a good movie with any stretch of imagination. When Nielsen mourns her sister's death and Schwarzenegger gently puts her hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then glows, in this special Germanist accent, "she's dead," you know you're cumbersome. At the inappropriate points, some smiles were raised, such as the temple priests who, when they were dead dead on the ground, seemed to have enjoyed the experience - at least judging by the organs of the orgasm that appeared around the place. If you need to look at an eighties fantasy film that was not porn, see "Willow" (but never take it as a ringtone). For the real thing, take your local multiplex and show Peter Jackson what he did with "Lord of The Rings". Trust me, 11 Oscars really means it's a great movie - unlike the bloody "Titanic".
