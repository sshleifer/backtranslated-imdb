It's an old dark house. The young couple slipped around the strange mansion led by Satan, where they run one after another, a poorly mixed team: one in trouble, a monkey, a monkey, a dwarf, different odd-looking people and (for some reason) two Chinese. They arrive at the throne room, where the hero is obliged to play a "Price is Right" type race, which includes seven levels of climbing with seven illuminated footprints; hence the title. For my taste, it's the same thing. Sliding around the gateway corridors is fun for a while, then it becomes repetitive. Compared to Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton or Laurel and Hardy with the same roll, it's not really funny. Nor is it scary, and apparently it wasn't meant: the household is too absurd. Most movies in this genre balance comedy with real danger and usually two - what the characters believe is real and the other for which it is on the cover. Here, the cover should not be taken seriously or covered. Some moments of fun arise from the mix, but it's quite hard to have fun. The novel on which the film was based was a straight thriller, and I think it could have been playing straight for a better result - and it could be.
