There are several movies that my high school friends and I never joked about. They are mostly 50's campy works that showed on television at late shows. It was one of our favorites. The soul of the fallen native rises to the living strain on the face. Now my friends said that if you looked carefully, you see that it had shoes. I never saw it. The most striking thing for me is that the natives seemed to be black men with greasy colors; some saw Italian. They also talked about the strangest thing that didn't fit their situation. Like the mummy movies, the movement of the thing didn't seem like a big threat. The confrontation should only be fast walking; I think it's an old surprise. If you see it, don't take it too seriously. Be happy that we have a battery of old horror movies that gave us such joy.
