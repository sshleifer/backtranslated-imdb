Hey, when people thought the wood was a bad director, they haven't seen this movie. I mean, there were empty plot holes and used cast. Dirty special effects. I mean, I don't think this movie came to a Hollywood studio. The college drama club could probably come out better. I mean they had Erika Eleniak, who is a proud Casper van dien and a prestigious actor. Their agents should shoot to ask them to sign up with this strip, whether they read the scripts. I still don't think the little lister was alive in the survivor's movie, which I was beating all the time, why he's not the last man of van van's successor. I am a fan of vampire films and it is by far the worst thing they should put in order to not see the light of day.
