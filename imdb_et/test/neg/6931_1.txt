It is part of Hollywood products that would never have been able to leave the film. Dialogue without incredible meaning, without pointless plot, without skill, directing without direction, and acting without some backwater high school fantasy class play. The whole cast should have been detained when they acted. <br /> <br /> But otherwise, okay!
