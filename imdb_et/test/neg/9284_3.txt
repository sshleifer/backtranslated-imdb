Martin Lawrence is not a funny man, Runteldat. He just has too much of his mind and he is too crazy to travel his punch at the beginning of the game quite early. He's trying to joke on the critics, "f *** for them". Then he goes to smokers with a rather primitive sexual joke and it goes down there. 3/10
