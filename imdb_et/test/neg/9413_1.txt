I'm usually a big fan of Pacino (Scarface, Serpico, Devils Attorney), but because of the woman's smell, she plays pretty much the same role and cries a lot. This film did not warm up pleasant characters. Brandon, played by Bongo McConnahey, is the least pleasant bunch. He didn't even reach a real person anywhere. Pacino was hopelessly unlikely and my goodness, how old is Renee Russo? The only big light for this evil confusion was the hot lipstick with perfect lipstick and it has 10 lines. Even generally, a trusted Jeremy Piven was completely unlikely. <br /> <br /> Note to movie writers doesn't work if one of the main characters is at least a bit pleasant (noticeable exception to Scarface). As the movie closes and old Brandon is at the airport, my only idea was to let the plane fly and kill Brandon.
