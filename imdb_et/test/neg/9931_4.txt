I've read the last comment of 28 people about this movie and I was surprised that nobody mentioned the fact that the first victim to be shown in bed with "missing eyelids" when the camera is put up and away is blinking! Yes, BLINKS! I remembered it as it was on HBO last weekend, and when I saw it, I had to repeat it literally, focusing on one eye at a time, so I didn't see things! Of course, it was difficult to take the film seriously, although there was an interesting and intense scene with Julian Sands. Very disappointed and gives it 4 mainly because the first victim flashes in one of the last frames when the camera pulls away from the body / face. Damage.
