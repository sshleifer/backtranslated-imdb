By the time this film was released in 1996, director Mark Lester made more than 20 years of intense, sharp little B-pictures. He was responsible for the great "Truck Stop Women" in the 70s and many other small gems; unfortunately he is also responsible for this. It is a shame to see that talented - and still smoking - Theresa Russell is wasting again, but she is still the best actor in this picture. Eric Roberts shows for a while whether his Eric Robert's thing is going to go away, not an entirely unwanted appearance in the picture that Eric Roberts has. Frank Stallone is not really bad, which should give you an idea of ​​how obviously this image is pathetic. As other reviewers have said, action scenes, which are the reason why such an image is made for the first time, are almost completely illogical and unrealistic, in addition to being somewhat inaccurate. Other than "vintage" clothing and some old cars, it doesn't know it in the 1930s when this movie was set. Of course, an extraordinary script of irritating obsolescence with logic and little historical precision, which is of course not a documentary, but filmmakers could have made at least TRIED a little authenticity - and performances ranging from class B to class school leaving this low-cost little quack to HBO until Sunday 4:00, which is where I saw it.
