I'm probably disappointed, so I'm short and don't waste your time. First, the plot was at least at least. Animation was even worse, we're in 2008 for God's sake and it looked like a shorter version of G.Joe. I can't even describe the performance and dialogues of the actors. Or maybe I see that I just saw that you need 10 lines (?! ??!?) To comment here. Where were we? Oh yes, well, it was quite flat, lacking passion and talent when I apologize. Now, like dialogues like actors, there are no memorable quotes, something that no one expected. We just hope the movie is decent ... at least.
