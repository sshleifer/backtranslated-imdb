It was perhaps the worst movie I've seen for a long time. Forget that it is clear that no research has been done on Detroit (Detroit City Center! Bwahaha !!). Writing was terrible, the assumption was absolutely unbelievable and, frankly, the characters were embarrassing. I cannot understand for my life why the flavored participants would stay so low and take part in such a godly horror. Now, I have never seen the original and do not know if this film will pay tribute to its original form. This is my understanding that the original was not in Detroit. Why did they deviate from the fact that without studying the setting, only tells me that it was more than what they were looking for to rent. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this spam unless you are from Detroit and want some comic relief.
