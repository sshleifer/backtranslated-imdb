Oh, sexy, do the potatoes that guilty of the demon live? This is the movie you look at, tend to be a bit in the running time, and when you notice it, you can't just talk but smile. But it's not that the potato men sex game is actually a funny movie and what inspires you to smile when you talk or think about it is just that the film is so weird; is so offensive and not disgraceful when trying to get all the warm laugh sex and sex live in general so you just can't help but your mouth break the bugs. Do not forget that what follows a smile is the drowning of the head; Raising the head and ring and thumb resulting from it by rubbing them gently, trying to memorize your time to see this trash. <br /> <br /> But this is the movie, it's a trash; it is a very bold and shameless trash, but not a trash. Anyone who came up with this idea put it on paper and then spreads to the industry that is trying to do it, either to be very brave or very desperate. It is strange that we have a film that is definitely something but not one that is by no means a decisive narrative. This stems from the idea that most European cinema is artistic, and its stories are unclear and open, and the topics are overriding for most other things. The same situation and technically the same joke over and over again in potato men's sex life is an idea that consists of: "sex is a very, very funny thing". These ideas are probably more suited to American film, so it's no wonder that when you watch this movie things get a little bit more familiar. <br /> <br /> The film begins and ends in the same way, creating a circular sense; a circular journey that has gone completely and nothing has been achieved. Three stores are sitting around the table and talking. Their boss joins them and the conversation is limited to all kinds of raw and nasty stories, situations or scenarios everyone can think of. The odd thing here is that when one man says something disgusting, the other grimaces, but the same dirty story gives the opposite, creating a contradiction between what these men cross the border and what they don't do. Men are Dave (Vegas) and Ferris (Crook), two people with whom Tolly (Coleman) joined, when the film looks like throwing a third face to break some of the more disgusting sex jokes or break some peculiar stories. They are worked by Jeremy (Gattis), who has deeper problems and problems, but with problems related to humor rather than learning. <br /> <br /> What is Potato Men? Three to four men are in crisis and during the film we will accept the role of an unhappy plane on the wall when we know what these people are going to do about a week. When the humor around Dave and Ferris is disgusting and repugnant, Jeremy's things are just terrible. It all starts with a fairly innocent and seems to have a woman who likes it, and one who likes her equally, but when essentially, Jeremy is just a stalker, that jaw falls. Jeremy's character is used and transferred in a way that makes unequal love and robbery generally funny. Jeremy sits in his apartment, listening to classical music and writing abuses to Ruth (Davis), repeating some sort of psychotic person more involved with Hannibal Lecter, writing his letter to Clarice in 2001 in Hannibal. But any sympathy that we may have here is made completely wrong, if later the true origin of their relationship becomes clear. Suddenly, in the audience's mind, we feel disappointed that he knew him before, and for whatever reason he did what he did first, it just seems timid and terrible. To say what it was, would make a little surprise in the film. <br /> <br /> Quite sadly, one of Jeremy's letters writes that he is something-or-other that he has no "artistic vision?" "just one big mess". I hate it when the characters say they captured the movie they're touching. Potato men do not live with any psychic or special interest in fetish, or why they feel the need to go as much as possible, simply using them as a heap of ridiculously unforgettable jokes and situations. Instead of taking a group of sex and exploring what drives a person to look for it, he makes fun of it (tickets with numbers!?); Instead of getting into the Sadomasochism fan's mindset, the film is hanging on someone's basement cover and warns of all "incoming salt and vinegar" when it culminates. Ferris covers her face in disgust and the camera disappears to the next scene without being too big. This is a relief that the film did not get to the audience abroad. This is one part of British culture, indeed, the British way of thinking that I pray is limited to our shores and ignored.
