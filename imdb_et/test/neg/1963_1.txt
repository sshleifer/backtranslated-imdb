Alright, we start with shrinkage and probably not very good. The main hero of the first Jack Frost is in a shrink bureau that beats off random rhymes about Jack Frost. Gee, well, my brother takes '' Turn it off! ''. Anyway, back to the crappy movie. <br /> <br /> The shrinkage has a speaker phone and lets his secretary and his friends listen to this heroic mad sheriff. I think he should be the hero of the first movie, but he doesn't see anything like him! Yadda yadda yadda, they laugh at poor sheriffs, yadda yadda. Now, some people have dug a frozen snowman, yadda yadda, now we are in a laboratory with some types of medical people. I don't see exactly how it has to do anything, but their freezing / Evil killer is a mutant snowman with a needle, warming it, shocking it, adding strange and odd chemicals, all nine meters. Something. Okay, they give up and leave that fish in the tank. One doctor leaves his coffee on top of the tank. The farmhouse walks, cleans things, strikes a fishtank, and coffee leaks into Jack's lively tank. <br /> <br /> See mocha's power! Now he's somehow ..... I believe in the Bahamas ... but it seemed like Hawaii .. But it couldn't be Hawaii! If they did not spend their entire budget on air tickets. Bah .. I don't break the rest of this rotten movie, so you have to rent it and watch it for yourself ... Er ... I don't recommend doing it ... Sheesh ..
