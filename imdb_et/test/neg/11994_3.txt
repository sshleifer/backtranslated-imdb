Glenn Ford, a New York boy who has saved his money, thumbs and horses on his way to the Arizona beach where he hopes to find HEAVEN BARBED WIRE FENCE. <br /> <br /> The film with the Dalton Trumbo script and story, led by villain extraordinaire Ricardo Cortez, and starring often in the complex Glenn Ford and the troubled Richard Conte, should not just be so bloody. Although the system, which is usually seen as police and railway bulls and real estate agents, is as terrible as expected from the left of Mr Trumbo, every proletarian is just as cute and nice and the salt of the earth that one knows nausea. It doesn't help that the heroine - a sweet blonde thing that is an illegal alien refugee who escapes from Franco from Spain - is annoying because of both scripting and acting. <br /> <br /> Why watch? Richard Conte is already a part of his personality and a pretty good role in his first role. And there are some moments of the 30th left camp that are quite amazing. (Did Dalton have to play a large part of the film on the Russian Worker Mission? All that was missing was the brilliance of Joe Stalin!) It is also Glenn Ford's first important role (although his performance is not good). <br /> <br /> Why not watch? In principle, a convincing vision of the film is related to a political perspective that is unfamiliar and the two leading films have done much better. The strengths of Dalton Trumbo as a scenario are not proven. Instead, we get a movie that the Coen Brothers Barton Fink could have written with a flash (and avoid a bouncing blow to the writer's block).
