A really hesitant script, and I was very disappointed with Marc Singer to accept it. <br /> <br /> I went out of the theater for about 15-20 minutes and demanded my money back. I have only come out of life three times (I am 43 years old) and this is the only one that made me crazy to claim my ticket price back. If I could, I would also have received a popcorn support. It was a really sad movie, and there's no excuse. <br /> <br /> One thing, how did someone who was raised as a pre-tech barbarian learn to drive in a car? California !!! (Driving is a somewhat complicated skill, and in California, even a tricker ... I should know I live.)
