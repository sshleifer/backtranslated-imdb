I was invited to screen the film early about four months before it was released. I had to watch a movie and later fill out a package with my thoughts. It was hard to sit on the ground. The exhibition is just climbing and you will soon want you to be dead. The thing is that there are two types of Mormon films. Good ones with real good stories, and those who just smell. Holidays and soldiers, now it's a good movie. But for these wannabe comedies, writers and actors just try too hard. Basically, they try to be funny when they're not. No wonder why there is such a small target group for these films; they're full of internal jokes that aren't funny from the start, and they're just trying to have fun things in the middle stuff. This is a story that makes the film and the stories of these films are only weak. I bet you can guess what my package looked like when I was told it would be filled after the movie. ;)
