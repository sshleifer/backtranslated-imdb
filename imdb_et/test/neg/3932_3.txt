This movie wasn't that good at all. Here's the first clue and it's not a strong movie, Harrison Ford's name doesn't just appear first, but it's also a title. Music was named Oscar, what the hell was that? This music was probably the most annoying in the movie. Action was the best, except for the Amish boy whom he did a decent job to be so young. Then you have a story that was weak and a bit over the place, and it won custom! The music was terrible, I know I already said something, but it was really bad. The rooms were really good and should be rebuilt. That's all I really have. <br /> <br /> Your average movie boy, <br /> <br /> -Trever
