Please, if you mean renting this movie, don't do it. If you think of viewing a downloaded clip, don't. If I had my way, no one would even have to read this summary. <br /> <br /> While acting as one of the highest points in the movie, it was still pathetic. The director was probably a sadist. The funny one lining was something to expect from high-paying anti-social 7-year-olds who eat color chips for breakfast. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that it is trying to be a movie like "Evil Dead 2" (don't in any way associate these two movies) that it's so bad that it's funny. But at the same time it tries to be funny and can't do it any more so your sense of humor is too bad to do something, but leaves your gag reflex to save yourself. <br /> <br /> I could go much further, specifying how terrible it really was, but I think it would break me out of my will to live on to keep thinking. If you need me, I'll try to boil myself so I feel clean again ...
