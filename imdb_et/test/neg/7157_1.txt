Includes spoiler! These men are complete scams, they made Judas a lost scroll, saying that Judas was a great friend of Jesus ... And now it is? This is clearly a test case for destroying religion and should be illegal. They have no evidence, it can be a clear setup. How do we know and trust these people? What if they carved the grave and "say it"? And finally, they made the grave forever so that no one could explore it? How stupid do they think we are, really? Should we trust that they are trustworthy people? Who really found the tomb of Jesus? And how can you push such Christians like this? I think this documentary should never be made by a religious man. IT CAN BE MADE BY A CHRISTIAN AND I MAKE A DIRECTIVE AND AFTER. The Jews should be illegal to document a documentary about Christians, especially if the documentary accuses Jesus not of "the Son of God who was resurrected" (nothing against them, they could be Buddhists or atheists, anything other than Catholic). /> <br /> For me this is a complete confusion, a pure documentary. They closed the grave to make people "not" think about controlling things. This documentary is a complete failure, how stupid do they think Christians are? And how the lost leaves of Judas have disappeared ... it was a complete scam, they said seriously at the end, something like "We know some people who could make such fake bodies and no one knows it was fake" ... Oh my god , they just said it .. "Dude we could have made them ... ... Such a documentary should be illegal, it is a barren bar for all Christians and Catholics !!! I am not a fanatic, I am a former Jew, now atheistic, but I have loyalties and always respect other people's religion, part of Israel's ordering the seal forever.
