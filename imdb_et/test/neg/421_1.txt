It is hard to imagine how the Dan Dan novel "Angels and Demons" involved could be as wrong as the version of this film. Here are ten reasons why the movie was unsuccessful. Do not read more about spoilers if you have not already seen the movie. <br /> <br /> (1) There was no love relationship between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra. Worse still, there were not even any chemistry between the two leading parties. <br /> <br /> (2) The breathtaking places described in the novel are not visually visible on the film. I'm aware that director Ron Howard was having trouble filming on the spot. But there are taller images of Roman history in the Canal than in the movie where the Eternal City was filmed with an eternal film. The film only briefly described the great works of art described in the novel. The magnificent Bernini sculpture of "St. Teresa's Ecstasy" was only a glimpse for a moment and the relief of the West Ponente on the Vatican Square was not at all visible. <br /> <br /> (3) The filmmaker depicted a dead pope who actually remembered his beloved John Paul II. In the novel, the Pope is clearly imagined, without being like any real pope. <br /> <br /> (4) One of the most colorful (and important) characters in the novel, Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN, was cut out of the script. <br /> <br /> (5) There were many cases where the lines of the dialogue were audible due to background noise. <br /> <br /> The characters were not seen in shadows and chiaroscuro movie lights. This method worked in "Godfather", but Ron Howard is not Gordon Willis. (7) The Cardinal College was a rather dirty team where one of the voters spoke at lunch. This guy would have been on a Texas beach more at home than the Sistine cable. (8) The decisive relationship between Camerlengo and the dead pope was not defined in the film. This relationship was central to science and religion and the importance of the Illuminati against the Church. <br /> <br /> (9) In the novel, Hassassin's character was an unforgettable villain. In the film, this was the role of the assassin in carton dropping. (10) All filmmakers did not trust the success of a successful novel. <br /> <br /> In the new novel, Langdon makes it impossible to fall off the sky. The Tiber River. In Ron Howard's movie, it was a film that landed on Tiber himself.
