DANGER: Follow the tracking of falling spoilers ... <br /> <br /> Boy, was it a bad movie. I know they went into "real love to conquer all" things, but about the whole movie that was conquered was about 3 (which knew more than 9 hours) in my afternoon, which I'd never get back. The film is about two young lovers named Kai and Gerta, who live in a fantastic city far away. Kai is a great abuse of a hotel owned by Gerta's father. First, Gerta Kai ignores her progress, but eventually she heats her a lot to get Gerta's father angry. As if that obstacle would not be enough for the evil snow queen to glaze Kai's eyes and become the middle person who treats Gerta badly. When it comes to the Snow Queen Castle (which is the same as the hotel that is covered with ice because Hallmark's good people want to go all out), Gerta puts the mission to get Kai back. Along the way, he runs 3 second seasons, which is in his special way evil, but Gerta flees from them with some dull and forgotten characters he meets. (At the same time as you want to turn it off but can't force yourself to do it. It's probably the most bad and most effective snow queen spells) Anyway, I'll save you from the end because something you can think of now with your head probably better than they it ended. In conclusion, Snow Queen is an incredibly boring film that takes the fan out of fantasy.
