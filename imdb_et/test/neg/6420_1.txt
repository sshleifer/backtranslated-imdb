Years ago, Sara, a young girl, murdered her parents, now as an adult she suffers from various mental illnesses (did I mention she has an imaginary friend?) This film strikes the viewer, not the tension, the feeling of thinking rather sleepiness. Deadly boring, I had a hard time sitting because I could feel my eyelids growing harder and harder for every endless minute and thoughtless "mystery". Is Sara going crazy? or is it paranormal? The better question would be who cares? And the answer to that, nobody. No one at all. Leave this movie out, save yourself some time, better suited to performing other valuable tasks. <br /> <br /> My Class: D-
