* some possible spoilers * <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie cannot be expected to be as good as the original, remakes are rarely. But this remake of Hitchcock's biggest films, Psycho, could have been much better. First of all, someone who hits the film must be psychological. Vince Vaughn is Norman Bates! What do they think ?! Unlike "harmless", the almost childish Bates that Anthony Perkins was able to portray, Vaughn sees he could be a murderer. In an attempt to make her Bates an unknown innocent, Vaughn is getting gay. Many other actors didn't seem to fit their parts, including Julianne Moore, who just didn't seem to fit the film. <br /> <br /> After fearsome casting, cinematography is especially dirty, despite the fact that they have redesigned the movie scene. One of the things they added was objects like clouds or a naked woman between the murdered characters. In any case, these images seemed irrelevant to the plot and, in turn, did not make sense. <br /> <br /> In general, this Psycho remake, which may be a decent picture, turned out to be a waste of time.
