I didn't expect a classic but at least funny movie. There were just a few scenes that make you laugh, but nothing else. You don't frighten me that it's full of American teen clich√©s and you might think just what's going on. <br /> <br /> But it speaks a lot about college students. The pressure of student selection exam (OSS) that the 3-hour exam determines which university goes and think about the exam when the ghost is after you is no exaggeration. The film is bad. Don't waste your time watching it.
