First of all, I've seen better ways of doing things and more realistic makeup in porn clips. How bad was Chris Moltisante like Stewie Ungar? The Sopranos, Chris is not taken too seriously and can be considered a comic. And then throw "Bobby Baccala" as one of his Vegas cronies. It's just too dramatic. Neither actor can play a serious role and is better suited as Tony, Paulie or Uncle Junior's second banana. And I want to know who made this disaster? I want this person to be my makeup for 25 years, so I never stay for a day. So that's all I write about this movie, because it doesn't waste much of my time. Yes, I know Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirippa are their REAL names.
