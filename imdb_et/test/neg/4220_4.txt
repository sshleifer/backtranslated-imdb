I read the book "Scarlett" and waited for the first time for a good movie. I'm afraid I was disappointed. The film did not follow the book and made many changes that I did not like. One of the changes I didn't like as Lord Fenton was depicted. There was no point he would be a bad man. The way Lord Fenton and Scarlett ended up was very different and their whole relationship was too intimate. <br /> <br /> The film also had much less confrontation between Scarlett and Rhett when it was originally written in the book. The film sent two in two completely opposite ways and they didn't seem to be often crossed often enough to seem to be a love between the two. Fine film, but I think it would have been better than it was, it would be more for Alexandra Rippley's book.
