OK, this movie was the worst show I've seen for years. The participants were not bad (I thought it was a b-film so they made a b-movie). Anyway, I watched this movie, thinking, OH COOL UFO Sci-Fi movie. ERROR. It was just an excuse for radical Christians to direct the message to the people. The last scene was very confusing. It's a terrible thing a person has to do to believe something. What anyone believes is a question of opinion. This film simply shows how corrupt religion is, especially Christianity. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a b-movie, it's not. If you want to watch a movie that is trying to wash the masses temporarily. Well that's the litter's choice. go to it. If you intend to forward the message, do it, don't force it. It is ridiculous for people to abuse the media to such an extent. Particularly Christians.
