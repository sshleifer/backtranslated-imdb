The original airport (1970) was a sort of classic and the first two B-movie exams (Airport 1975; Airport '77) were the best, the worst of a fun camp; but this crass and final entry have no entertaining value, and it shows their audience a shocking disdain. It's endless and even laughing. <br /> <br /> All three "Airport" sequences were theater releases made by Universal TV Wing, but it is even below the modest standards of its daily TV movie, with cheap production, grotesque casting, visual ugly and tasteless , unusual "comedy". The project was clearly condemned by the "creative" efforts of the universal executive Jennings Lang, who personally produce and "get the story" of credit. <br /> <br /> Everyone starts somewhere and writer Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) may have given himself a burlesque element, as well as previous films (especially the infamous airport 1975), but nothing deserves to be Roth's powerful, inconsistent scripts and even comedy Airplane ! left this trolley intact. <br /> <br /> What makes Concorde: Airport '79 particularly offensive is its offensive abuse by professionals. The worst victim is the highly talented Cicily Tyson (Miss Jane Pittman's autobiography), which has been gradually reduced to a vomiting sub-site where she sent a cold heart transplant to a regrettable flight. <br /> <br /> A special kick in the groin is reserved for the magnificent George Kennedy, the real leader, despite being buried in the list. The official mascot of the "airport" series and the only actor to appear in all four films, Kennedy had more than served in the ledger and his equity at the captain's location would have been the only possible entry reason, except for one last doll. Kennedy is the only heat and true humor in this mechanical muckup, briefly setting aside the bravura mechanism and revealing the character of a truly sweet and delicate side and its loving and heroic "Joe Patron". Unfortunately, we must never forget how fat and old and mountainous Kennedy are, and overall beautiful boy Alain Delon calls him consistently "Porky Pig" as part of a perfectly flat girlfriend. Even Kennedy's Parisian romance, the only humane part of this plane, is a mere congregation of funny jokes at Patroni, Kennedy and the viewer.
