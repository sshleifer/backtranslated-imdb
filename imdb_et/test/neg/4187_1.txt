Well, let me side. I have not seen this movie that is bad because fucking 13 SECONDS or HALF CASTE. Someone should take this man's Sony Handycam off! This movie proves that simply because you can make a movie for your camcorder for $ 20 does not necessarily mean that you should. <br /> <br /> I remember that one of the things Robert Rodriguez wrote in his book, "Rebel Without a Team, was that if you didn't want to make a budget, you should use all the assets at your disposal. Rodriguez says you should Count all locations and requisites you can beg, steal and borrow from your friends. Robert Rodriquez was with the mayor of a city in Mexico with his friends, so the Mayor let him shoot for free. budget. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the director of this movie has a copy of this book and he took this advice to heart, in which case he was probably a boyfriend with a corn field where they put him in the haunted house every year. location for a scary movie, but it is difficult to keep the corn of 90 minutes of interest.NOTE CORN'S CHILDREN'S SHORT DESCRIPTION did not carry more than a few minutes of corn field. BY NORTHWEST - Get a hint, fella ... cornfields don't do cinema bullying. It would have been good if the director had more friends with more places, because this thing gets quite annoying in the first 15 minutes. This film will cost you about $ 30. (or whatever it costs to allow a cornfield maze). <br /> <br /> He probably couldn't even act in his movie, so he threw himself. Big mistake. Here's the point, if you really want to make a movie, become an actor. So, as far as assets are concerned, it seems that the only thing the poor man had in the maze of the eye was. Maybe he thought it was enough. In fact, I go out and say that I know he thought it was enough, because the movie, before it was a coveted honor to be DARK HARVEST, was simply called MAIZE: MOVIE. Maybe she has already planned MAIZE: MUSIC or even MAIZE: MINI-SERIES. <br /> <br /> Our all-inclusive guys (and yes, any part of this message is definitely not right here) plays a psychic father who can tell when bad things will happen. Think of the character of DEAD ZONE, but not anywhere from a good actor like Christopher Walken or even Anthony Michael Hall. The psychological father has the idea that his two daughters, who are in the maze of the mother's corn, will be killed. He speeds them up. From that moment on, the entire film looks like a Permanent Father who runs around in the garden looking for his two daughters. He finds two little girls haunted by the fire, and he helps solve the mystery of their murder. <br /> <br /> Shooting $ 200 from Handycam. The director shook himself. Edited in iMovie. Improvised story. If this is not enough to keep you from this a-maize-shattering disaster, consider it as a final warning ... MOVIE is on the spot, boils and cucumbers. Here is a tip for Ghoulie Guru on how to save money and still feel you've seen this movie. The next time you see the corn field, stop the car. Take a flashlight and go there for about 90 minutes.
