Ted Nicolaou made many great horror and fantasy films. I'm looking for all of his movies. I didn't find it for three years until I suddenly found that youtube. To tell the truth, I wanted to see more ghosts and fewer talks. It seems that between 1999 and 2001, Ted had a crisis, maybe money. His features at this time are more like real low budget thrash z garbage films. But I do not claim to be a bad driver this time. Everything happens. At the end, there are some nice horrible details and intercourse, but the whole movie was long, boring dialogues. <br /> <br /> Only for real Tedi fans. <br /> <br /> www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab
