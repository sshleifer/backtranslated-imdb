I was really disappointed with this movie. I had heard some great comments and unfortunately I didn't see them in the theaters. As a result, I was very happy when I saw it on a DVD. I thought it was going to be an amazing movie with a lot of frightening surprises, but instead it was a snail-predicted movie. It pulled and pulled its peak, and after all the difficulties these people went through to try and escape, the ending was completely depressing. I gave this movie for one reason. This is not your typical horror movie with one central bad guy who kills a lot of people. The story makes this movie unique and offers changes to people who watch a lot of horror films. Although I don't like this movie, I recommend that all horror fans see it at least once. You might like it surprisingly. As for this horror fan, I can say that I hope this is not the sequel to this forgotten movie.
