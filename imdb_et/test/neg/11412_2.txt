Sami's second son is definitely not an Oscar winner. Technically, it's terrible. Operation is not too good. But there's something that makes you look more (like a car wreck). The ridiculous close-ups of killer's eyes are more fun than anything. If you're looking for intimidation, it's not a flick for you. It is very confusing and almost impossible to find. I'm sure that's the reason. For some time this was the title of HOSTAGE. It doesn't matter what you call it, it is still a poor choice for entertainment. It can be good for MST3000 or something. Do you think they would use a title like SAMI other? If it's not used all over, I'll eat my hat. I remember when it was shot in Belmont, NC. Many local personalities were used as talents.
