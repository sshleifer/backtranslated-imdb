Fifth collaboration between Marlene Dietrich and director Josef von Sternberg, BLONDE VENUS is a film that looks good when it plays but does not participate in the viewer. Dietrich's two-man story, which turned into a mammoth cabaret and fought for the custody of his child, is confusing and often seems to be composed of three separate films. Dietrich is wrongly thrown into a rather passive, realistic role in the film, and his character stays away from the viewers, while Herbert Marshal is not convincing because his poorly tempered husband and Cary Grant are largely wasted as a savvy suitor who sticks in and out of the picture. The film contains some intriguing pieces (the "Hot Voodoo" number is the highest point), which is impressively surreal for this era in Hollywood, although it proves that such a boring, inconsistent film is not effective.
