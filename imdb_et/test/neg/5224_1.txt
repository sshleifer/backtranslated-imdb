It is quite possible that the worst film has ever been made. I know people talk about how terrible Ed Wood movies were (Plan 9), but this film makes Plan 9 amazing. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris makes kamoo why I don't know. Maybe destroy your movie career. In addition to Chuck Norris, the movie's day-to-day soap supplements and Mike Norris ... it's right, son of Chuck. <br /> <br /> This director can't even continue and I have no idea where the scenario or scenario is. It must be a green burning minister of the South Baptists who had a third relative who had a studio (which I am sure it is closed). <br /> <br /> I don't really know what else to say about this movie. I would like to give you a summary, but I lost. There is something about Jesus and Satan ... no eternal battle. Other than Indians. And a bunch of freaky kids who don't know how to act ... they're just uncomfortable and shouldn't be in the camera. I don't know what happened most of the time, but I know the movie was a big laugh. Mike Norris pushes his daughter (on his own bike) into the street somehow ... but he's in the middle of the park. So he learns to ride his bike at a speed equivalent to Flash and hit a car or a bus ... I don't know. But he's dead. This is actually a more fun movie scene. I know it sounds sick, but when you see that Mike raises his hands and wins his head and scream in terror ... you understand. It doesn't show the girl a stroke or anything ... you just have to assume she's been hit by a vehicle. But the film is not clear. Maybe it was completely independent and he died of cancer. Anyway ... after that the movie really gets confused and I have no idea what really happens. I'm a Christian and I have no idea why this movie is made. I see no value for this film in the religious or non-religious sector. This is probably the first thing they show to the 101 students of filmmaking ... that's what you don't want. <br /> <br /> Just look at it ... you hate it and suggest me to see it.
