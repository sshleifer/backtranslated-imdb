Thomas Vinterbergs "De St√∏rste Helte" is another movie that doesn't have the most important feature of the movie: a good story. The characters are not very original and not very interesting. Especially Thomas Bo Larsen is in the neck of the pain, playing the same role he has played in recent years and what he repeated in "Festen" - he thinks he is acting = is angry and screaming with others! The film is not very meaningful and not very funny - although it tries to be "kooky" and "strange". When you make a movie on the road, why not add something original to the genre?!
