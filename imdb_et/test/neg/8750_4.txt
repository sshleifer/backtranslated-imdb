For all my mistakes, I tend to be a charity for "Thing". Here is an interesting, horrible, claustrophobic story of Hitchcock. Put it in the hands of a writer like Theodore Sturgeon or (if you prefer a British perspective) Robert Bloch or a boy who wrote "The Day of the Triffs", and you might have been a nasty, disturbing little horror story that was the best thing in the anthology of the book of horror and temporary stories. <br /> <br /> But someone decided to tell this story as a feature-length movie and cheap, second speed, so most of the potentials are wasted. Such a story really needs a voice like Sturgeon to bring out the more interesting character's better light. His classic story "The Widget, Wadget, and Boff" is an example of how he can collect one of the "normal" characters in a group, and on 40 pages they can be turned into the most entertaining, sympathetic and exciting people you've ever met. A good writer can, with a few words chosen, "see" some of the more vivid and memorable events that are ever to frighten his emotions. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a movie where some of the most irritating and unlikely characters ever made are put together and made to be convincing "Where does it come from?" moments that are just there. (IE blonde spiritual girl who complains that "You are all evil and I hope you are destroyed!"). We get incandescent and slow motion blocking and dull sets and rigid participants. I blame the director for the "rigid and low" part. These are all actors of the third-order character who never made a great deal of time, but they are also "real" actors and a good director could have performed better. We get lesbian records that make the viewer uneasy and exploited without giving any reward. (If I want my bass gadgets to be used and guilty of it, I want things that are better to be done). And we get over an hour of creepy construction, scattered around about 35 seconds of any of the worst anti-climax I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Good Thing? Um, well ... some asylum chiefs, who looked at their directives quietly, were quite effective. Dirty and terrible widow was alive (even when I wanted to put a sock in my mouth). The first scene, where a large, "simple" ranch quietly cries over an oily cowboy and kills her, was a bit of a shocking value because the plot had worked hard to create a big boy quite sympathetically. And as I said earlier, the cunning idea of ​​the past, which separates the members of the isolated community against one another, is good and able to maintain an interest that exceeds the real value of the bad result. <br /> <br /> What it definitely is. <br /> <br /> But as I said, I have been inclined to be a charity, because the director probably worked on an insecure budget, break the time limits and the best actors he found the money. Heaven knows how future generations will appreciate the simple reprocessing of a crap like "cave", "wrong turn" or "wax house" in 40 years. I hope they will be charitable for our own tastes by supporting the waste of our generations of film stocks.
