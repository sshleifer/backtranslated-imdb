I just spent the last half hour reading through other reviews and I don't know if I want to laugh or cry. It is not that ADJL is like Harry Potter, Danny Phantom, a rather unusual, non-secret magical world that has been redundant. Also, there is no ADJL anime. Anime has a lot of drawing style (and some say more, such as plot and Japanese origin), so ADJL is not so anime that it says it is and if you are looking for something like anime, look where, like Teen Titans and Avatar. <br /> <br /> ADJL is typical. It's like all other Disney exhibitions. An argant protagonist, a child who thinks he knows everything and doesn't care to listen to people who are his parents and make the same mistakes. Best friend sidekicks. Repeated plot with twist. And sister competition. Will they ever be able to make a character with a brain and not being full of itself? Can't they respect the children of their parents? Don't they think of something else? Can't they siblings bypass each other and hate each other? ADJL is simply too general because you also have bad guys who win and come back and also have complete idiots that don't have a hate background. I think you think at least 30 years old will be able to get 13 years old. <br /> <br /> Watching ADJL is like anything else on TV, just like now and again. Nothing special, but new designs and one little idea that has been used over and over again.
