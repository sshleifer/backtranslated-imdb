I'm just in cinema in Prague, watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the poster I found a very holy heroic style of Holywood, <br /> <br />. Not because of the high profile that reminds me that most of the French films that are big are usually pathetic. But just <br /> <br /> because there are not so many movies in French as in Prague. And because I love Adjani, Depardieu and Rappenau <br /> <br /> Cyrano. Then I decided to write this little comment because I think I really disagree with the main stream of comments about this movie in imdb. <br /> <br /> I wasn't disappointed. The film looks like a poster. The characters <br /> <br /> are as stupid as they see. After a while I thought Adjani would be like a caricature - just a funny sign <br /> <br />. No he is not! For example, if he decides to say <br /> <br /> Depardieu, he killed the fat he killed at the beginning of the movie, then the violin came from the fat fat pathetic <br /> <br /> music that should cry you and understand Adajani character is <br /> <br /> a deeper person than he looks. Maybe it was humor at level 10, but I'm sorry my sense of humor is not so high! If you want <br /> <br /> to see the fun French movie of World War II, look at La Grande <br /> <br /> Vadrou! It's definitely more fun! I have also read the miraculous <br /> <br /> that Lemoine is doing great in this movie. I have to say that I've never seen such a bad act! (Well I've never seen any Edgi movies). However, the film is a good movie with lots of good <br /> <br /> scenes like the Pantheon in the morning <br /> <br /> when the German army arrives in Paris or when the refugees are on the bridge at Bordeaux br /> <br /> I think Rappeneau is a good filmmaker, but it makes a good script better. It was easy with Cyrano. He didn't have to write a dialogue! <br /> <br /> I'll give you 1/10.
