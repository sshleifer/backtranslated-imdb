Well ... I like Patricia Kaas. She is a beautiful lady and a very talented and versatile singer. His acting in this film is more than competent and, from my point of view, the only redeeming beauty of this film. He gently pulls the nature of a lonely singer with a hell problem. But what I don't really like about the film is shameless product placement on a well-known French hotel disc. Another thing is that the story seems to be inclined towards the road without actually deciding what the film is and what it wants to be. With a positive comment, you can say that the film is not predictable, but you can say that it is clearly boring because of the lack of cohesion. There are some nice shots in the Bujt movie that you can't think of, that all parts don't give anything at all. It really is a shame that the Cover shines in this movie.
