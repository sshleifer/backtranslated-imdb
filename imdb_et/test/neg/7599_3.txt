My first VHS recorder has been a tradition for me to capture the incarnations of Charles Dickens' old chestnuts, and I recorded this year and "Karroll Christmas". Fortunately, if it was run on the Hallmark channel in the 3rd century, I have to change it into a commercial box. But this was only a salvation of grace. <br /> <br /> Writing was amazingly boring, almost no wise scene, so it would be more than something other than a serving bipper, like Beverly Hills 90210. The exclusion seems to be the only logical explanation of how it turned into a Scrooge-like TV talk show hostess. This wasted Dinah Manoff, who just plays a slut to the other bitch of Goddess Tori (who had more faces than some colonies), and Bill Shatner is probably one of the few fun things to do otherwise. <br /> <br /> Some of the best options are wasted like ghost entrances. Aunt Marla's entrance could have been remarkably funny in the hands of a decent writer, but obviously this Christmas poison wasn't. <br /> <br /> Tori's spell can be a lovely person, but he has all the skill of a dummy and it makes a bad show in itself. Yes, it was good to see that Gary Coleman is running again, but the script gives him something to do, except for rolling eyes and a real flat dialog. <br /> <br /> And what was most frightening was that the transformation from Scroogedom Tori to "sweet and light" is just as convincing as the passionate conservative. Now that somebody wants to write the story of George Bush and Karl Rove, we may have a refreshing change from the usual bad Christmas carol clones. <br /> <br /> I think if you are a fan of Mrs Spelling and / or 90210, it can be your cup of Christmas joy. I'd prefer to leave behind the coarse and cold beer to wash it off. What I can just do before it is here for a long time with me. <br /> <br /> God save us all!
