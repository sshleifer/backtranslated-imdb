Frank Tashlin's "censored" is such a private Snafu short to teach the importance of the censor in stopping military secrets. Snafu is trying to get her girlfriend to say she has to be placed in the South Pacific, but every attempt she makes to send a letter to the tsensor film. These early scenes are the best, with the invisible censor pushing long mechanical hands, nets, and even a specially used eagle from the sky! The other side of the drawing, where Snafu is able to send a letter with the help of a technical manager, first-class (who actually teaches him a lesson), is less funny and culminates in a disappointment-a-dream finale. The main point of interest in this part of the training is the appearance of an extremely low-covered Snafu girlfriend, who is even seen with bare breasts, although strategically positioned with limbs, it always exists! Snafu's short trousers, often geared to the military, were often characterized by elevated stamens, but these scenes, as they were, are by far the most erotic ones I've ever encountered in any of these shorts. Despite this, I prefer Snafu shorts that go a little more, which usually causes the death of the main game. A great example of this, look for Tashlin 'The Goldbrick' or Chuck Jones 'Spies'. "Censored" is relatively weak.
