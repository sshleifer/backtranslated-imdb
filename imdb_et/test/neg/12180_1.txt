Charles Bronson has given spectators many great moments on the screen. But this movie doesn't have everything that a thriller / action movie should have. There are some action scenes in the movie, but they are really dirty. And if the scene operations fail, will this story record the movie? Not at all, is it my answer. The story is even worse than scenes. It's very simple and boring, and while I'm a big movie fan, I stayed almost as many times asleep. I don't know how they came with such a mistake. Maybe a small budget? Nevertheless, it seemed that not all the participants were at all in the film. If this happens, the result is very bad.
