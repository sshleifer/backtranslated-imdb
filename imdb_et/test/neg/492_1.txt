Well ........ how and where do I start describing it in complete shit? Imagine the Hollywood morale of cheeses, throw the utmost help to the storyline of the finest soap opera and try to think about the kids cooling it down, dressing it around the "modern". This movie is all a package and no substance. <br /> <br /> It begins with a promise ...... young men who dream that they are rockstars and who are engaged in worshiping the hero can all laugh. After that it goes downhill ..... faster than the bobsleigh without braking. The first concert with Steel Dragon is one of the most regrettable cine kitch pieces I've seen for a long time. The singer appears on the stage with his debut and falls down some stairs ..... does he rise and sing ...... or does he stay on the floor and did not sing ...... who cares now? It gets worse, but I don't want to wear myself, remembering it all over my distressing detail. If you look at it after this review, your own fault!
