This ultra-low-budget kitchen-sink is a movie that can only be done in the UK that the market should exist anywhere else in the world before giving green light. It is probably self-financed to clearly try to solve important issues, but ultimately its existence is undermined by the question of asking who would ever put money into its distribution and, secondly, if there was no market-based viewer to watch, buy or rent this movie, why does anyone work hard first? My opinions may sound unfairly for the first time, but this is a film that only undermines commercial viability and quality standards that have retained the British film industry. Reviewed in Edinburgh. 2 out of 10.
