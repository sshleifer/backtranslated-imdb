Have you ever read a book, seen a movie and wonder- How are they so bad? This is one of them. Huffaker's book, "Nobody wants a drunken Indian" was great, foolishly funny ... this movie is not. It seems that no one cares about moving the direction so we took care of the characters. This film, which concerns some real concerns about the Indians, makes you wonder why we haven't seen more comedies about the Holocaust or slavery. Not well done.
