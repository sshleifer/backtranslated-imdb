Not bad performances. Whoopi plays a reasonable / warm role quite well. At the same time, one cannot believe that style and situations are forced (forced stereotypes on the computer). Sometimes good Jews and black white white Christians (ho-hum). A typical Hollywood fantasy. The film has its own moments, but I do not recommend that I look at my way.
