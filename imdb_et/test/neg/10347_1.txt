Hard to believe - but that's it! I shouldn't be surprised. Ads try to show how unique and funny a show can be. But not only did I show ads for new ads, but I didn't tell anyone who found the ads to be fun. <br /> <br /> I never remember seeing a pilot wisely, intelligently, or with humor. Characters were mostly tolerated. Especially Selma Blair (which is amazing she would be willing to show such an exhibition). Some moments where the characters were easily redeemable were remarkably scary and tiny. <br /> <br /> A rare show has no redeemable features at all. And that's not one of them. Kathil and Kim have exactly one redeeming quality - and that's Selma Blair. Despite the reluctant equipment and action like the pathetic, tiny fool apology to a young woman who seems like a cross between Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, Selma is still nice to watch. <br /> <br /> But if you want to look at Selma, go to Hellboy for rent. You must at least keep your respect instead of associating this amazing character with your brain to associate with it. <br /> <br /> Overall, Kath and Kim are wastes and really represent the worst TV has ever been. It creates a new low.
