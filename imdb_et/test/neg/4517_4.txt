I found my tape on this long forgotten "show". In addition to the theme “DISCO BEAVER FROM OUTER SPACE”. This exhibition is hardly traceable. You move through the channels just like a couple of TVs. This is a TV parody. <br /> <br /> The beaver is cool. A homosexual Dracula, a chick that discusses Peria's experience and a woman with too much lips over homosexuality, shows us everything that is wrong with TV. It's all BAD. Like the color of space that seems to have disappeared in this new world, you are. *** at the end *****
