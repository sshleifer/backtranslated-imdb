Not all films made in 1931 are crazy and the fact that it was "the best picture" has to give even more impetus to the development of television. <br /> <br /> For all Ferber's novels, it's not typical to have the whole story on the screen, not to mention the fact that it is a feature. Dix - as strong as it is in the first third of the movie - makes a face, but no one knows why and that doesn't make sense. And what about Dunne, which makes him so stoic? Edna May Oliver's scenes are invaluable as usual. <br /> <br /> This movie plays a role in cinema history, but it's long and boring.
