Probably not the same version as most other reviewers, because there is no real heavy sex. What do people mean by hard core? What kind of explicit-hearted sex is visible in movies that play Traci Lords and "Big" John Holmes? Anyway, this is really a bad film, I doubt I've ever seen so many big name losers who are wasted in the movie. The script is really bad and pointless, management and cinematography are terrible and editing is not there. This is really a terrible movie. You could look at it ten times and still don't understand what the hell is about. The only memorable scene is where people are buried on their neck and the giant lawn mower reaches out and decapitates them. Yes, you read this right, there is a movie in the Roman era that has a giant lawn mower cutting head! <br /> <br /> Trivia Point. Many years ago THE THING (1982 version) made a pirated copy of my island rental round and it was copied to the CALIGULA rental tape, which means that THE THING's pirate version starts with some person's CALIGULA in the first few seconds. The woman who walked through the forest then begins the title of THE THING. It made the people who saw the pirate believe that the forest picture was the opening of John Carpenter's 1982 film and was very confused about what it meant. Well what you get for renting pirated videos. But having seen all of CALIGULA, I don't know what that means
