This is another variation of the two-maned story and the division of children. ASK YOUR WALKING ROLE is headed by Howard Morris (television) and it shows because it is a story that plays like a half-hour comedy that is upholstered in feature films - but with ridicule or, in other words, only the number of smiles that would have been possible for a TV show In an hour. <br /> <br /> DORIS DAY decided to finish this movie - and it's easy to see why. Even the presence of some fairly reliable actors does not help. BRIAN KEITH, BARBARA HERSHEY, PAT CARROLL and ALICE GHOSTLEY are doing their best, but the script is a real problem and should have remained intact on the big screen. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to say about it. Skip it and watch Miss Day in her numerous valuable films.
