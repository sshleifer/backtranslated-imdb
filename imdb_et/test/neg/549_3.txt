I was pleased that TCM showed it because I love the 1992 version of Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Joan Plowright ... This film was a luminous performance by Ann Harding, Frank Morgan, but others made the movie more farce , then amazing that later movie. Reginald Owen's Arbuthn is painful to look at and you don't understand why his wife adores her. After watching the movie, I learned that it was based on playing on the stage, where the 1992 film was based on a book. The original film also seemed to be a bigger piece and seemed incomplete. Too bad it was such a loose.
