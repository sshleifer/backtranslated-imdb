It was on television last night. I made my way painlessly and barely through it. First of all, with the exception of Leroy, Hilary and, if possible, Coco, no other students we should take care of have any appreciable talent. It's like HSPA had no standards, just write a dotted line and you're in. <br /> <br /> The story lines were grate and obvious. Doris was just impossible to be terrible. Gay boy was such a thrown clich√© (funny how this school had only one gay boy, right ...) I liked the character of Leroy, but calling his teacher a discomfort and then at school vandalizing should have sent Leroy a pack. Lisa looks like she would be somewhere else, and because she was not a talent, I don't know why they kept her. <br /> <br /> I would have appreciated this one letter (terrible), but the music was not so bad, and I made that assumption. It would have worked much better if students had been attractive and had some talents.
