It is the beginning and middle of the 1950s, and equally dressed a team of government officials who all look like they have just responded to the "Untouchables" electoral call to relocate uninhabited people who don't understand both their direct threat and the proposed ball to move. . An exciting anti-development film is always an opportunity, but let's be real: rural electrification is one of the greatest advances in decent living conditions and economic recovery in American history.

Not in this country. <br /> <br /> But this film is not as much about the situation of households as it is a fantastic animal that evokes the evangelical imagination of a dying young boy. Nick Nolte is a priest who tends to go to the boy and much of what he says could have been interesting when the sound was clear enough to hear. <br /> <br /> The alternating black-and-white evacuation agents (working by the lake) "The earth, when the oak creates this valuable field" and the fantasy arsenal of the congregation, does not develop the film either consistently or interestingly. <br /> <br / > The cinematic art is poor. Washed, weak and depressive color passes through the whole film a little dramatically. . <br /> <br /> 4/10
