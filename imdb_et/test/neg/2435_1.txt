I usually don't write comments, in fact I don't write comments. This movie was so frightening that it inspired me to get started. Virtual sexuality strives to be a light-hearted and funny teen comedy about conventional traps; Virginity, boys, etc., with the exception of the main character, apparently seems to be becoming his perfect son whom he has created with the help of a machine at a technology fair. <br /> <br /> Sound interesting? Well, that's not. Action is the most half-hearted and terrible thing I've ever seen. It is unfortunate that they really look like a supportive script and movie that probably explains why I've never seen them in memorable products. I'm not bothered to learn the names of the actors and their characters. The lady of the container does not relax or take you and hence does not care for her. A leading female friend does not express sympathy even if the script is screaming so hard to regret her. The only thing he gets out of you is extreme anger and sudden violence. The only half-dignified actor was a blonde leading man who, despite his badly weak role, gave him everything he could in the light of such a daunting work. I'm not even talking about acting as a "bad guys" for a plot. But then again, what plot? <br /> <br /> I watched this movie unbelievably discovered because I had no idea how anyone would be silly to audacity to write a script to produce, operate, and run it. I can only wonder. The only reason my companion and I saw this film vision was the incredible laughter that we managed to bring out, because cohesion, logic, class, and even impotence were not taken for half an hour. I have no idea why anyone wanted to spoil the film industry by publishing it to the public. It's a movie joke and it's best to leave dust in the warehouses forever. 1/2 out of 10
