This is a parody. This means that there are no such signs, they are all common stereotypes and the film is totally dependent on the quality of the jokes. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie has some great jokes. Unfortunately, they are hidden in the mass of real fools. If anyone expects all dialogues to be absurd, fun will take away. <br /> <br /> You see, there is an American Pie 2, my all-time favorite teen movie. It contains many real initial characters. Maybe jokes are tasteless, but all people live. For example, they feel embarrassed when something embarrassing happens. This is what makes jokes actually funny. <br /> <br /> Not that movie: every scene is clearly placed as a pure parody, so there's no sign, so there's no compassion. . Too much if you know the original movies, you know all the scenes in advance. Add the fact that many jokes are not funny at all, and you have this movie. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved me completely forever, as a matter of fact, was the comments of some young people in the cinema where I was watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Ah, and my personal highlight was Melissa Joan Hart's very short look in one scene. Sigh. He's just too cool, he can't be real. Hmm, worth the movie?
