Yes, it's a clean trash. Any man who loves experimental cinema (like me) can be interesting if you see the lower salmon and do nothing for almost two hours, but it becomes very painful if you realize that you have actually paid for it. This is probably one of the films you love to watch for your total emptiness and nihilism. I accept it for the value of my shock, decades before Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction.
