I think the film can be made with children as a target audience. You can tell yourself: a) Let's make a film that kids love today! or b) "Let's make a movie that I would have loved as a child!" The second approach explains why Steven Spielberg often makes films that attract younger audiences. The main examples are E.T., The Goonies or Indiana Jones. This Darn Cat is the first approach. You see these apartments, incredible signs that say things that should be funny but not. The plot itself is enough for ten minutes, but it continues and continues. And although I'm not a child, I don't understand what children should have in this movie? Crazy policemen drove by the dog, old lady with birds or Christina Ricci's sarcastic onelier? One actor gave his acrobatic sense of talent a sparkle: Doug E. Doug played an FBI agent.
