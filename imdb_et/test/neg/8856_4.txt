Well, this movie is really "PLUMPED" HAHA. It's like a film attitude. The plot has only a copy of Pulp Fiction, it is acceptable, but it's "PLUMP" (haha)! is really incredible. The story is so pathetic and the whole thing was just a few laughs. He tried to make some jokes from various other films and it failed at most times. I mean, I have a sense of humor, but it doesn't really make me laugh. Most of the allegedly funny moments are completely ironic. The film is quietly short, about 75 minutes. They could have done a lot of fun work without seeing they created a relaxing movie, they were gambling and hey! I think they lost! <br /> <br /> Overall, PLUMP Fiction is "PLUMPABLE", but you don't have much at all! <br /> <br /> Is it worth watching over and over again?: It's never enough, actually it's more than enough! <br /> <br /> Is it worth renting? Ummm..I said, its "PLUMPABLE", but you collect just a few "PLUMPS" about it! <br /> <br /> Generally from 10: 4 out of 10!
