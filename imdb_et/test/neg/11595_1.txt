Like the whole movie geek with a lucky job of video store manager, I tend to watch all kinds of movies, from good to very very bad. It was a film with so many corn-ball lines, cheesy CGI effects and predictable plot points, which I smiled before turning off 30-40 minutes. The genre feature films genre has made some terrible things in recent years (someone from Godzilla 2000?), But this film makes me think that the creators didn't even try. It may be worth looking at only the potential of "my jokes" (read the strokes!), But I could not recommend this to anyone.
