Now, this overpriced director Franco is a real turkey who gave us such classics as "Las Vampiras / Vampire Lesbos". Yes, I think bad movies can be very fun. I adore the horror of Dorise Wishman, Dwain Esper and Ed Wood, but it turned out to me too much. This is the first movie I rated 1. Where should I start? The scenario is extremely idiotic. The dialogue is incredibly bad. Management seems to be non-existent. The best music cue (this film is used repeatedly) was taken directly from the movie "Der Hexer" (1964). And it's fun! Bad Shirley Eaton and George Sanders! In one descent, Sanders Popeye counts as a comic when his henchman tortures a girl (this aspect is probably the intellectual highlight of this film). The only thing that bothered me was that Franco immediately showed the woman's nudity when I thought the movie was going to benefit - it's a real leadership skill! However, I am afraid that the film in which the participants pretend to shoot with the machines is not really worth it.
