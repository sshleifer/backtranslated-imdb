The most predictable movie I've ever seen ... very boring, I feel like I've seen hundreds of movies with the same story as this. Action is best at best, there is no action and no excitement. Powerful actors with a terrible script, I think it might have been better to write for grade 10. It seemed to me that I was looking at more harvesting because I hoped there would be something in this film that would leave all the other garbage in it, but it would fit directly into the heap. The whole movie I was expecting was good, but it never came. I never rated movies and I never watch movies, but this movie was so bad that I had to log in here and post a review to try and save some poor souls from wasting their time (and / or money) with this movie. I pirated it and I wouldn't have even wasted hard disk space. If I spent $ 10 to see it in theaters, I'd kill myself.
