I am very interested in very positive opinions here. Although it had some good qualities, I found most often that this film was difficult, predictable and worst, not the least scary. The first 30 minutes of the film were promising, the actor did a beautiful job in his imagination, and his surrounding world was well thought out and meaningful. Unfortunately, the movie went down the film. I went to this movie without a clue what it would be - knew nothing about actors, directors, genres, etc. At some point, my wife commented on "should this be a scary movie?". Well, I think, like the boiler plate "horror film", full of carving violins and extended vibrato, doesn't mean anything else. There was not much originality in the film, the romantic interest was painfully obvious from the first moment, and the other side of the film went deep into a ridiculous world. Such a film walks in a dangerously narrow way, and unfortunately, there is a point where the viewer has to decide whether to continue walking in that tea, or to jump and just laugh at the ridiculousness of all of them. In the last 30 minutes I chose the last one.
