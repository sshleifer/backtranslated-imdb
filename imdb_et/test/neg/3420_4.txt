Recap: Not fully familiar with Shakespeare's Macbeth story, but in my nature it's pretty close to the original, only to the present. This is about Macbeth, who is a member of the Melbourne criminal syndicate (?). He is a valued scorer and leader Duncan. But he and his lady have higher ambitions and are planning to murder Duncan and any throne race. It's a story of betrayal and cold, brutal death. <br /> <br /> Comments: I have to say a very interesting idea. To use the story, but to change the setting for the current time, but still keep the original (?) Dialog. It creates a tremendous contrast between classical poetic work and violence. Promised to be extremely violent, this is the promise it keeps, but not in the sense I imagined. In fact, it is very bloody, but violence is slow. Not only figuratively speaking, it is calculated, but also it, but also literally. A lot of action has slowed down to slow down and bring the movie to his knees. <br /> <br /> What could have been a unique strength, a contrast between superfluous and poetic dialogue and extreme violence, now becomes something else. Now both are slowly moving down a lot, so that it gets boring and boring from time to time. <br /> <br /> Also, I cannot understand the context in which the three witches work. Show the time and reality that magical sorcery was not in the film. Obviously this is the case, but it seems to me totally inappropriate. Not a sub-block, but a complete rule with its own rules that are completely different from the rest of the movie. It seems totally inappropriate. It must also be possible to make this part modern. Perhaps the drug-induced hallucinations (what I suspect the director suggests, but then he's left too much witchcraft to be credible)? Now they're just next to the movie, which is clearly next to the story, and I was just waiting for a real film to start again. <br /> <br /> Clearly disappointing, but maybe something about Shakespearea buffers? <br /> <br /> 4/10
