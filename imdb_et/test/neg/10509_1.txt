This film made me almost cry. <br /> <br /> Fake teeth for beginners. Then you will see a nice plastic or drawn set. In order to be even more boring, light is followed by all the actions. Then they say: Sound levels are so different, sometimes too hard, then too soft, never quite good as in good movies. He also repeats so much that I think they have one microphone in the set. And worse, EVER heard the stereo? When the camera turns off, the sound will always remain in the center. Participants talk as they read from behind the camera. And going to another scene as a terrible kid. <br /> <br /> Music is so wrong that it doesn't add anything. It only destroys the excitement created by chance. <br /> <br /> Finish the fighting scenes ... to finish, my 3-year-old niece with a better fight. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even good for laughter, it's just so bad ...
