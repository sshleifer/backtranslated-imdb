A little too much Mediterranean machine for me. It was a beautiful, lovely look in all the romantic scenes. The locality was beautiful in the sky and heaven in the water. It was not just convincing to me that such an egomanic crust that curved something apart from his building could attract so many beautiful, vulnerable women. Only in the Mediterranean, I think. I certainly don't know any world. Maso men were really unpleasant, and I had a hard time believing that the female characters could have been so long. The scenario, cinematography, management, etc. was created for the transmission of a Class B film, the central task of which was to show the breasts of beautiful open females. It was aesthetically nice for a while, but it couldn't keep a mediocre movie.
