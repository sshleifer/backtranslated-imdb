It was just a terrible movie. I watched it once when I was about 12 years old, now I'm 19 and I don't think I'll ever forget this movie. <br /> <br /> I still feel sick when I think about it, it was just all terrible that could fit one movie. I really do not understand which person would enjoy this complete garbage. To enjoy this movie, just simply turning off your mind is not enough, I can enjoy the most obscure TV-de-Disney movies as much as the next person, but that is something else. <br /> <br /> Normally I don't like to rate a movie before I see it myself, but believe me to do it for you. Don't look at this movie.
