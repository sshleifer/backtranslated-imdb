This movie must be with Ed Wood films. Terrible script and bad, bad behavior. <br /> <br /> Machine Gun Fighting Plate Glasses; minutes go before someone has hit and nobody covers - no window ever breaks. You think a big U-Haul truck - not scratches - can be a big struggle after a fire struggles. <br /> <br /> Are CIA Agents and Government Companies = Screaming = Top secret information about stand-up cocktail party with hundreds of people around. <br /> <br /> Not an actor you care about; everyone is low and basically unlikely. <br /> <br /> Hawaii Link 747 flies out of Los Angeles and runs in twenty minutes to the Pacific Ocean "... 100 feet in water ...". After a short time, when the stewardess announces to five other passengers, they have only two hours left in the air; 747? <br /> <br /> The next day the rescue teams showed amazingly that six passengers are still alive. <br /> <br /> A movie that starts with mediocre and gets worse off. <br /> <br />
