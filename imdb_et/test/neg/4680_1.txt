I've recently become a big fan of Patton Oswalt. I think he is the most deliciously original comedian who arrives at age. She is refreshing and fearless in her routines, guiding topics as much as Bush sucks Robert Evans, a producer of the 1970s, on slippery exploits. I am Maria Bamford's long-time fan and her wide-eyed innocent / schizophrenic routine. If he easily cuts and cries out his naturally high-pitched voice, I can't interfere. I liked Brian Posehn long before I even knew he was "Just Shoot Me" and his obsolete nerd person is so funny. All these three talented, unique comedians titled "Comedy Comics", a documentary by Netflix on their US tour. They really deserve the stars, and this tour gave them the recognition they deserve so richly. I thought no, I'd like this movie ... <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. Three comics, each with their own routine segments, are "Comedy Comics" broken by scenes of curving and dull documents that do not contain humor, no understanding, no real interest. I think there are a total of 30 minutes in an interrupted routine in a 109-minute movie. What a rip-off! Come on, is anyone really interested in catching our stars in our RV? Where is humor in seeing Pehni in the arcade and comic store? Does anyone find particularly random dining scene scenes? If this film hadn't shown our comics about our stuff, do it at least on the road. It's not even that. The worst thing is that comics don't seem to be really fun. Oswalt admits how boring he is doing a radio interview, Posehn probably recognizes how much he sucks while traveling to his home, and Bamford improvises nervously every time the camera directs him, and his humor is only casual. Sheesh, these guys deserve the opportunity to show the world their unusual, amazingly designed humor, a refreshing change in the mainstream comic strips like Dane Cook's crazy entertainment. Instead, we have to sit in our daily routine on the road in a non-standard film, the quality of which could easily be crossed by each student's film. If you can find any of Oswalt's, Poshn's, or Bamford's productions on DVD, always do it. Their talent should be a vision of joy, not such a chore as here.
