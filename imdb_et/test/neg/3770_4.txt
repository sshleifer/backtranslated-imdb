The director does not know what to do with the camera ... too many choices and he always chooses the wrong ... he lets the travolt take himself ... and he checks the film from start to finish. characters are not developed ... maybe because we have to watch them sing ... no pace at all, sometimes too fast sometimes too slow ... wrong: travolta OK ... johansson, he's too grown to be 18 ... even if he's really 20 ... <br /> <br /> happy ending? well seems to have one, so the story is sad, but not too sad ... travolta doesn't know how to play the guitar, but the director doesn't look that he cares too much that he is completely in sync ... <br /> <br /> The idea is the only thing that is great ... but how did it develop it? well, it's just full of stereotypes and lines that have heard too many times ... <br /> <br /> too bad, another missed opportunity ...
