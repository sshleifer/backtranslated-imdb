Credits come from Sandy Frank's sewing work, which was made to re-open this film to Cave Dwellers. Now that it's solved ... oh! Torturing, striking pain. Blade Master jumplessly jumps with the sword and the witchcraft that Conan's clamps started ... unless the bandwagon ever leaves the garage. As such, this is an Italian flick who tries to remove the box with predictable results. However, it would give the director and writers too little credit, who will not make any effort to maintain a uniform plot, continuity, and exact continuity of the era. Miles O'Keefe is neither now nor forever a leading man (Tarzan Ape Man proved that if Ator did not do it). Just an unlikely picture and a chore.
