I saw a preview of Femalien and thought it might be a cool movie. It turns out it's a terrible waste. There is not much nudity in the film, not to mention that he does not have much sex. There were only a few fools and dirty dialogues and some uninteresting dances that would normally be expected during the listening session. In our case, you can see it even in real movies. Conclusion: I have nothing for that. Leave it alone.
