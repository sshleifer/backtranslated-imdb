The prerequisite for this movie is ugghhhh. The man is married and everyone on this site seems to think, "Yes, it's a funny, cute and good movie." What the hell?!?! What is funny about immature girls who are married to a young child? What's cute about deceiving her wife? What's wrong with them to find some teenage boys to have sex before starting college? Noooo, it's not good enough, the guy has to be married, off-off, off-the-market, that's what we have to be. Crazy-ass girls! Then one girl decides she loves her. No, he just loves how he does his feelings. Two girls are having fun with it, they think it's funny and no one seems to have moral problems with what they do. It's just disgraceful, but yes it's all good for everyone with one on this website. A dark haired girl even has the courage to call her father out of the house, while she is in childhood. It's a morally disgusting movie and where's the woman? A poor woman works and pays her bills when her babysitter screws.
