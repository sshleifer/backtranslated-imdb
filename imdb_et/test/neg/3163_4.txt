Frankly, I met the real Han Su Ying and saw him by an American actor who is not like what China does in my head when I watch this movie. Why not Hollywood, instead of Nancy Kwan ... can't ... the story of cos goodness ... Dr. Han Su Ying is a Chinese I know I've met him personally <br /> <br /> and looking all over. ... so little Asian face in the movie about the story of Asian love makes me think too <br /> <br /> I think the actor is good, but without Asian faces, the Asian love story has made the plot so thin and full of load on Baloney > <br /> like the other movie I know, "CONQUEROR" imagines that my eyes are burning when I see John Wayne as Genghis Khan !!!!! ... how on earth can a man born in MONGOLIAN STEPPES come to Alabama's southern critic? !! Cheap Imitation from Asia <br /> <br /> I am not surprised that one day I see Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, who is played by one black boy. and white minstrel show <br /> <br /> Would like to see it and laugh at the whole roof !!! <br /> <br />
