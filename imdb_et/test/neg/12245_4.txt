Stylish movies have come so far that Mel Brooks '' Manufacturers '' (1968) said: "Don't be stupid, be smart. Come and join the Nazi Party". This brought us some nice movies, such as "Young Frankenstein", "Airplane!" And even "Naked Gun". But good death is young. Fortunately, the genre was able to do it until the end of the 90s. And then ... Wayan's brothers discovered the apocalypse: "Scary Movie". Suddenly, the abduction of the word for sexual jokes was an inspiration. Most of the films claiming to be spoofs have followed suit, including "Scary Movie 2", "Date Movie", and a movie to kill the "Epic Movie" genre. Of course, there have been some tax exemptions. There was "Shaun of the Dead" and "Hot Fuzz". Has Ferell become a spoof of vehicles that is close to any kind of sport. They also leave Wayans Brothers 'Scary Movies' and have made it a reliable Zucker Brothers. Although these films have been somewhat valuable in rescuing, the genre is tragically disastrous to be films that are loved only by pre-eminent men who have just discovered the erection. People who haven't studied the term "spoof" and cut and pasted movies for a quick laugh. No heart, no brain, no cheap glue. Sorry, "The Comebacks" is added to the list. Dave Koechner (who played "Anchorman" with Ferrell) leads the team's winner (Carl Weathers' Happy Gilmore's fame), who got him back to the coach. Koechner has shown his promise as a supportive actor, but under the direction of this film he just sounds like a script. He sounds too much as he makes a passionate cold. There have also been jokes in the past about a washed trainer, who during the film encourages the team to break down at school and later run the police out of their underwear. Yes, it's a spam. But remember that even spoofers can have quality. Give the dignity of the characters and a sort of complex view of today's society. Also, we are no longer laughing at relying on stereotypes (who knew that one movie with jive-speakers could lead to gangsters' stereotypes (not really, but see). Although I admit at least a few times to laugh ... it wasn't about. The football team itself had many stereotypes, including Mexico, the fucking jock, the fat boy, the rotten nerd and the mentally handicapped. Even the only female bitch in the team was reduced to stereotypical female humor, mostly with little coverage and excitement. In fact, his nature, but also most others, has never developed. This is the sad state of this movie. If it were not so dependent on jokes about stupid sex, he would have done something. In fact, this movie is likely to be the butt of jokes with "Epic Movie" for the future. Koechner really did a better job. The script was generally poorly designed, even naming the 'The WC Bowl'. So yes. corrupted movies die. There is a movie called "Meet the Spartans" (now, boycott now!), Which contains Britney Spears' failures. So let those kids get an erection ... but people grow and lose. We need nutrition. One day, they learn to stop spamming and restore spam. Hopefully, one of the heroes "Get Smart", prepared by Master Mel Brooks, will arrive next year. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5 (stars)
