I caught this Philadelphia theater in a short time. Regardless of the local origin (and its connection to the hometown of the hometown, namely the death of Eddie Polec in 1994), I really have to come under this film. The director decided, for the reasons he knew, to shoot the whole movie-guerilla style, cutting down on continuous handhelds and fast fires. This technique can act to attack violence, but is completely inappropriate for the rest of the material that makes up the majority of the movie. A walk along the sidewalk, a brother-brother-on-sofa, hell, even in a kiss on the first date, is a cusinart style that disturbs the viewer from ever being able to enter the drama. Martin disappears too much from his narrative by offering themes: besides the birth of violence, we get anorexia, alcoholism, divorce, racism, parental abuse ... can I miss anything? Undoubtedly, it would be better to cast (and better-oriented) these yarns together, as Martin certainly saw to show how one moral mistake leads to many others ... ... but good intentions may not be a big movie. Just a striking mess. Martin, I know you're from my city and I'm with you, I'm really ... just doing a better job next time you did two plus one.
