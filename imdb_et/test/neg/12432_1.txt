It begins with a very serious social comment that quickly thinks about other Clark films, such as Kids, Bully, etc. Who is the main character? Is it a serious movie or some Gregg Araki-esquire over the top joke? Is it a skate with documentary dialogue moments? I have no idea. I found myself watching the watch and wondering if this swell would end. I thought there would be a big shocking culmination that never came. I cut out the film for 20 minutes, quickly transmitting a meaningless skate scene. Yes, it illustrates the changing landscape between which there is no. I got it back in the beginning. The children and the Bully were made so that I actually felt that I was watching the reality of this circle of friends. Wassup felt very staged, poorly built, and still worse. Serving Caveman, which Larry did not write, but did it directly, was terrible. But at least it seemed like a terrible movie that didn't take it seriously. Wassup Rockers was just bad.
