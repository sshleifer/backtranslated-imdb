As far as I love trains, I couldn't wrestle this movie. The premise that a locomotive and a "ride" from Arkansas to Chicago without a train running on another train should be inappropriate on Impossible Plot routes. Imagine that two unpleasant NASA employees steal a "crawl" that travels back and forth and rides to New York and get an idea. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, it's nice to try. Wilford Brimely is the best of his Quaker oats and Levon Helm is good for his dark but well-understood sidekick. Bob Balaban is a worm, as a business boy, and the "little man takes the Goliath" story can be another incitement.
