It's really a shame that IMDb won't let you give negative voices. This is the most terrifying exhibition ever seen by the American public as neighbors in the north. Parents are troglodyte and neurotic hag. It is as charming as a well-used hydrant with the same hygiene standards. He is a wax museum mannequin programmed with more neuroses than the whole EXCHANGE. Children are non-economic when they are female and resilient as men, especially the nature of the title. The boy is a serious competitor for the most unpleasant, self-satisfied, arrogant, and empty father character who says something. This exhibition was clearly created as an anti-BRADY weapon, but it comes as an anti-Christ. And why is photography so dark?
