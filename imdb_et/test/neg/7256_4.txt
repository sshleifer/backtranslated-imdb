So you're a gigantic pantyhose and you've hung up for a while in the Arctic, and you're tired of the Eskimos hitting you with snowballs. What is a giant mutant insect? Of course, create a big city! See the sights, maybe we'll be on Broadway. But wait! Just when you find a nice cozy tunnel to make your own calls, some irritating people will attack you! Argh! Time to crush! <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is one step forward for most of the other giant movie films, as it has a pretty decent FX in 1957. Avoid if you really don't have to see another big bug breaker or see another Perry Mason actor in B movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
