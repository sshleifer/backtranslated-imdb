I started watching this movie with t.v. a few weeks ago but gave up after the first 10 minutes or so. At first, a person on a witness protection system on an isolated farm becomes nervous with his outer guards and then asks in-house from the guard whether he can call - just to open the line. br /> <br /> Shortly thereafter, Roy Scheider will rise as a witness to the assassin and really fill the witness and his wife, whom Roy Scheider's character properly cooks in the kitchen, dials the number and then speaks: It's done !!!! It was for me!
