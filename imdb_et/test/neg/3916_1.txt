Heldeke! ohdear! ohdear! ohdear! <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but this ... "movie" just puts the space in shame. Every sci fi movie I've seen over the past year has somehow disappointed me and I've seriously reviewed what genres of movies I really like in the future! (Maybe I'm looking at romance now.) <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALERT! (And that doesn't speak much!) <br /> <br /> This flick is so dirty that rivals Battlefield Earth and Baby Genius are very bad. The special effects are obviously fake, the Big Mac truck saw the stops with its roller-skate seat restraint systems, and the killer robots saw the idiotic version of Power Rangers. .. Space Truck School ??? WTF? <br /> <br /> Mr. Hopper can do it better. What really looked like were two good views that sent him and didn't run anything but their panties (?) For a full two-third flick! The mandatory "sex element" between our young heroes was so badly done that I almost smothered almonds laughing on the TV screen. <br /> <br /> The only notable thing to note is the captain of the pirate ship / cyber / crazy scientist. He created the word grotesque and was predictably weak, but I believe he could have been much more dangerous. He does and says things that are pretty funny (all the best scenes involve him!) So I'll give the captain a bonus point for this movie. <br /> <br /> But this flick is so bad that you want to make it abused on TV or throw the TV out of the window! It can even kill some brain cells and put you in a catatonic state. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION? I like the way the captain tries to walk on foot, if he is obviously a fake leg! I would have given it in 10 out of 10, but because he broke me with his stoop-antique ... this flick gets 1/10!
