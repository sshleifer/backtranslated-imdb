Supreme Sanction is a film about a female assassin who works for the US government. He has to kill a known TV reporter, but he leaves his life when he sees he has a little daughter. As he has not killed him, he becomes the next target for employers. <br /> <br /> The script is not good even though I've seen worse B-movies. A frightening person, the government killed innocent people in the fight against terrorism ... What's next? Aliens Rescuing the Victim? No, Supreme Sanction never gets a prize because of the script. And acting is not better than I fear. Some of the better actors (Michael Madsen and Kristy Swanson), who obviously had to pay a lot of bills and play in this movie, along with other players who probably don't even know what the camera actually looks like, don't do the movie. <br /> <br /> So why should you watch this movie? Well, if you have nothing better to do, just look at some of the activities, and you're tired of the repetition of Mclife or A-1031, this may be the movie you want to see. Otherwise, leave it better. I'll give him 3/10.
