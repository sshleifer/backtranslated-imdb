Heminway's de minimis love story is a terrible adaptation. The American soldier (Rock Hudson) falls in love with the British sister (Jennifer Jones) in Italy during World War I. What's wrong with that? Almost all. Hudson is out of his depth here. He could be a good actor but not in this movie. Jones is too old for his role (he is in 21 books - here he is 38 ... and sees it!). Also, his actions broke into the overwhelming and underdeveloped! They took a simple low key love story and blown it all proportionally. The film is deadly long (just over 150 minutes), self-conscious and ridiculous. It seems that producer David O. Selznick thought he was "Gone With the Wind" again. Some landscapes are truly stunning (even on a small TV screen), but there is not enough picture to suit the pictures. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! The end where Jones dies should be tragic, but a bad actor and overwhelmed theaters fought me to not laugh! <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, actor Vittorio De Sica is truly overwhelming. Overheated, self-conscious, poorly cast and slow. Pretty terrible. It was (understandably) a financial and critical bomb and ended with Selznick as a producer. Maybe you want some landscaping at the end of the setup, but it's not really worth it. I'll give it 3.
