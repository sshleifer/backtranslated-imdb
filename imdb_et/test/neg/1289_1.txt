If you ever plan to rent this movie (hopefully not to buy it), think again. Just as Gary Busey would have a gun with his head and was forced to act or die. I'm just wondering if Busey was arrested for something and was sentenced to play in this movie because I just can't see a man who was doing so much better at Point Break with Keanu Reeves. It was a good movie, but there are thousands of other sensitive movies that laugh without you wanting to get your money back. <br /> <br /> The only reason I ever want someone to rent this movie is to watch this movie to see Gary Busey jump up and down like a monkey. If you want a good funny movie, let Quigley go and rent Spongebob or something.
