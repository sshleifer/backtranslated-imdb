There is only one reason why this film is traceable. Till Schweiger. He is such a good actor that the film is not completely terrible. Uwe Boll take a new career. Special effects and action are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. I can say that Kevin Smith (evening ...) told Tim Burton who didn't read Batman's comics and it showed. Uwe Boll must never play video games that he does in movies. If you two want to know how to do it, see Andrzej Bartkowiak. Doom was one of the best video games to customize movies. Some people may disagree, but if you look at the movie, you will see that the ID had a lot of guys with Doom. It doesn't seem to be anyone in UBIsoft even close to this production.
