This film has a feel for a college project that wants to make a blitz witch project that meets vision. But it is not successful. Cinematography is poor and even more functional. I don't think the characters are reliable at all. Movie editing is not really designed. There are many bad effects that I think will be put there to try and add a terrible effect. But for me it gives me a sense of indifference. <br /> <br /> I would stay away from this movie if you are not a dedicated movie freak who likes to watch "different" and indie "horror" movies. However, I believe that this movie is not viewable for the average person. You won't be delighted with the bad effects and handycam feel that this movie looks at viewers.
