I can only assume that the previous posts came from production plant applications ... <br /> <br /> Last night, the UK premiere. Zane and Brook participated (they probably knew I was there) and are undoubtedly stars, but what is a turkey film. It seemed to me occasionally when the audience bounced to laugh, which was a serious "thriller" scene. Perhaps the language-cheek element was meant. If so, pure genius. If not, a career in genocide. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Zane always looks and Brook can really do little. As the other side said (when we cinema, avec broken ribs), they can be forgiven for this movie because both seem to be nice people! However, the scriptwriter should be married.
