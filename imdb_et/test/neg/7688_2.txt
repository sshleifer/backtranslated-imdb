Like a bit of Michael Dudikoff's fan, I sat down to look at one of his good old-fashioned artists - I'm still waiting. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a group of US commandos trying to get rid of a number of Syrian terrorists who have taken over the nuclear reactor. Maddie Reese (Felicity Waterman) was an English member of the command team and, of course, she got romantic with Tom Dickson (Dudikoff). I have to ask, when the British women are SAS female members - as far as I know if they are ever needed, they have got from other sources. Even if they did, I can pretty much guarantee that they would not be as wet as Maddie Reese. I also think Tom Dickson would be a bit more responsible in his job - or would I have lost the plot?! I know that these films always have a romantic angle, because it helps to provide a sensitive factor, but must it be a whole, especially when there are important things to consider - like a nuclear war! <br /> <br /> The signing of the US Air Carrier Agreement was of interest to me. The "Holy Pencil", which is carried by one of the presumed television news teams - does not have security controls to find out who or what is happening on one of these ships, especially the caliber of the people accompanying it. Remember, there would be, I don't think there would be a story. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but when he came to an "inner body bomb defect" to safely remove the bullet that I gave up the action drama movie a bit and enjoyed this comedy it really was. <br /> <br /> By the way, a news reporter would really say "Downtown Damascus" ??
