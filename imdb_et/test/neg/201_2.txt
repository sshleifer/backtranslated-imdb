This film, despite the list of celebrities on Lists B, C and D, is a complete 90-minute waste. The small peaks of the plot were very predictable. It was so stupid that I couldn't believe I was taking the time to write it for review. Flex, against his credit, has grown to his ability to act as he played Michael Jackson for television broadcasts some years ago. On the other hand, Tangi has retreated because he was more talented a year ago than Felicity's flunkies. When I was sitting in the movie to look at the trains of the train, its poor production and the terrible sound quality, I remembered the other four letters to qualify this movie. In an attempt to keep his writings G Rated, I just say that this movie is another four-digit word that begins with L. LAME!
