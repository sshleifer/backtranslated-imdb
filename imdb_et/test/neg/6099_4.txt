Three Stooges are arguably the biggest comedy team in film history. For this reason alone, they deserved a much better end in Columbia than they had in a short time. <br /> <br /> "Sappy Bullfighters" is not just good. In this case, it is not all Joe Besser's fault. Personally, I feel that some of his short pants are fun enough, just because they leave the Stooges traditional fanfare they contain, and the fact that Larry is sometimes shown more. But this short just doesn't do. And the fact that we know it is their last short, which was once shown, just adds to the general disgust. <br /> <br /> This film is just about how the short themes were in the last breathing breath during this time. and how little effort did they make. This short is so sloppy. It's easy to pre-curly short, "What's the Matador?", Filmed years ago. As if that fact was not bad enough, the studio also threw Moe and Larry from the original (which was filmed nearly 20 years ago). Are these things obvious? Is it ridiculous or sad? You are a judge. <br /> <br /> Another short part that makes it unhappy is that it is basically a presentation by Joe Besser showing that everything she has (at least in this movie) is curly-wanna -Have been completely wrong! Moe and Larry are little in this short time. As a fan of Larry, I must also say that I feel a bit shameful that Besser can use jokes that Larry originally popularized in short "Ants In The Pantry". Besser says, "I don't see, I can't see!" and say that Larry says a simple "Why don't you see?" while Besser stops "I got my eyes closed" at all levels is wrong. <br /> <br /> Two courageous soldiers who were stuck in all these years Howard and Fine are so short. They are hardly a funny bit. The only thing that qualifies is Larry hiding under jealous husband, trying to be "Pepe", her dog. <br /> <br /> The dynamic duo cannot be blamed. Larry and Moe give him everything. No matter how ridiculous things could be (and I'm sure they had their own career views on it), Howard and Fine never did something better. Their efforts are not 1934-1959. Light in years. <br /> <br /> I often have a lot of short shorts that some are terrible. I'm all of those "more experimental", unusual shorts. At least they contain new ideas. But this short, I think everyone can accept it, not just good. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the goodness of television later, the boys discovered after the short departments. Had they been forced to leave this way, it would have been a serious injustice for all the years when they invested in laughing the audience.
