This is a very mediocre Jackie Chan movie and one of his absolute worst James Glickenhaus destroyed it! All the characters are decent, but the story is so, but Jackie Chan is still amazing, even if she looks bored. Jackie and Danny Aiello had zero chemistry together, and it was very boring, but the final was above average and managed to be quite fun and had good tricks! I haven't seen the Hong Kong version yet, but I'm sure it's better than that, plus the twist is very predictable! It's really inanimate and blissful, and I don't blame Jackie for not being happy about it, and if he doesn't celebrate it, it would have been intolerable and totally irresponsible. Opening should be memorable, but it is not something I have ever seen and done better, and I thought the whole movie was pretty lazy and could have been a fantastic movie if Jackie had it under control! did not write any characters. This is a very mediocre Jackie Chan movie and one of his absolute worst James Glickenhaus that destroyed it! Not even recommended for Die Hard Jackie Chan fans. The direction is terrible! James Glickenhaus is doing a terrible job here with extremely strange camera work, bad angles, and boring film keeping all the time. It works like this. Jackie Chan is AMAZING as always, but she's not her usual energetic self and it seems boring and Ps * ed through the whole movie, was a chemistry by Danny Aiello and I really don't blame her! (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Danny Aiello is here, as Jackie's partner, but his character is a little ass and he had a chemistry with Jackie, he thought. Roy Chiao is a decent main villain, but was just in motion and wasn't all that threatened, though he's still cool. The rest cast is the best. Generally it is not worth your time or money. * 1/2 out of 5
