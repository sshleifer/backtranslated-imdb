This movie is a gangster clich√© cinema collage. Writing is grade z and plot and story are built carelessly or logically. It's a dirty stereotypical gangster (think of Bugs Bunny's cartoons) and foolish supporters (lady doctor and writer). There are many better Bogart movies. It looks like Bogart looks like he slept through this performance. He puts this character very little. I think that the guidance he received was something like "He's a bad boy. Disturb". This man is the equivalent of the Darth Vader era; obvious, evil and hero. Don't waste your time with it.
