What the hell was that? I testify that there were some scenes that captured my eyes, such as 23 bulls, where the main character sees or calculates 23 numbers wherever he goes, but was it a short film?! To cry out loud it was to be a holy film and labeled as a psychological thriller. I would have expected it to have at least some catastrophic effect on the mind, but instead of what we got? We got something like an animal control guy who found himself in the midst of a crisis of life and his journey to redemption. Confident like an old man when you ask me. I'd probably have just rented Wild Hogs, it wouldn't have changed. I mean, who's kidding us, they should have killed someone. Compared to Sparrow's main character 23 in the book, they gave quite a lot to the viewers, suggesting that he was a killer all the time. How would it shake our heads? Shame on all of your voters who decided to show their kindness to the wretched work you call the film and the defendant for most of the critics who joined my reaction.
