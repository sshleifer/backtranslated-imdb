The disaster is underestimated to name this movie. I don't even know where to start! But I have questions and lots of them. I would like to know who imagined this script? Who gave them the money to make this movie? Who was responsible for casting and costumes? They all have to complain! I saw this movie in my local library directory and thought "Hey! Great!" I had just seen two FOG films that Hollywood had brought and then realized that Bollywood had a version. I did not like it to be a complete and complete crap! <br /> <br /> Dhund - The Mist is a film of four cries (actually only one of them, but you should know that you have four friends), one of them is the Queen of Beauty (played by India's 1st World, Aditi Govitrikar) and Director don't take the cost if you know it. The script even claims that he (the character's name is Simran) has Aishwarya Rai's eyes, Kareena Kapoor's lip and Rani Mukherjee's hair. You can freely barf if you want, at least at this point you haven't seen the movie, unlike the poor man. : * (<br /> <br /> In any case, Simran gets the risk of death by one of his uncle who tells him he's leaving the competition so his niece can get a better chance, but he's not allowed by Simran This leads to his former college classmate Tanya's crack cocaine-sniffing uncle, but his cousin Kaja, Simran sinks the culprit and they both involve their boys to get rid of their body, it's hard, but eventually they can do it. /> <br /> In a scene that borrowed a Hollywood movie from Diabolique, where the dead body is hidden, it is only emptied to reveal that the body has disappeared and starts with Whodun and where-is-it until the film is over, steals movie successfully scenes "I know what you did last summer I still know, Scream 1, Scream 2, Scream 3, Murder wrote episodes and not m ention, Columbo and Scooby Doo!" Shameless, I say ya! <br /> <br /> There are inconsistencies and problems in the movie d include, but not limited to: <br /> <br /> 1. The low-stitched Simran answers phone calls three times from its killing, the camera shows that the phone is off the hook, but the phone can call again each time and select it in response. <br /> <br /> 2. Does Tanya try to kill her because she doesn't win a beauty contest? WTF? Even Aishwarya Rai, who is ten times more beautiful, did not catch suicide if she could not Miss India! <br /> <br /> 3. In the pool scene, the children who fall into the pool will disappear comfortably as soon as the police arrive. And the ball disappears. <br /> <br /> 4. The blue contact lenses of the piano become blue-brown at the point of death, but when his body surfaces are again, his eyes are blue. <br /> <br /> 5. Someone who dies in the movie is grieved (weird, especially in Indian society). <br /> <br /> 6. When Vikram jumps into a dirty twilight pool, the underwater camera shows us our actions and miraculously, the pool becomes an Olympic size and is clean and clear as the day. <br /> <br /> 7. Sexy belly dancer performs pseudo-orgasm drenched song and dance number that comes with aging. It would have been good for some Bachelor's evening, but they celebrated Simran's victory! Hi !!!! <br /> <br /> 8. Kun, Sameer, Simran and Kajal can't dance properly or Lip Synch. But don't blame them, but agree that there was no choreographer for the dance numbers. <br /> <br /> 9. Nothing in the movie was choreographed, just as they just said that the actors show up and do whatever you want. <br /> <br /> 10. The film was played as there is no script. Whether that or the director was high and drunk when filming this junk! <br /> <br /> 11. When Simran's image appeared without his consent in the magazine, he flew to the police headquarters to arrest the photographers, but he is at risk of death and does not disturb the police. <br /> <br /> Of course. This movie was a painful experience for me, and I recommend everyone to skip it with the necessary and possible tools. Bollywood should shame such filmmaking.
