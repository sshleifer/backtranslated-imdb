NOT POSSIBLE ! I hated my grandmother. First he is too long - of course he is, this is Tom, who is his brother who plays him - and I hate the thing he does when he brushes his fake silver hair back, but: this movie has funny parts. For example, the fact that every actor looks like V.G. (very German) and also that they think that even if they are alone, they should pretend that this man (Tom) is their real grandmother or something. I liked Charlotte leaving and going to the nearest gas station to ask for help. Suddenly he finds himself in the middle of the environment (where they were before anyone dared to explain) and turns, turns, ar-oun-like ballerina, looking at the stars ... and ... ignoring the fact that GRANNY'S WILL BE COMPLETED STRIKE !!! But the music was not so bad, the discounts were fine and ended in a terribly provocative ... Mmmmm ... I wish I had a German version.
