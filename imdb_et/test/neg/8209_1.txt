A couple of men are crushed on a distant island. They then seize the mad number who lives there with a small group of servants; when the castle cave lives in an unfortunate leper's husband. <br /> <br /> Harrow Prison is pretty much a movie hacker. Amateur artists are on the move with all the crash strokes, while in the background there is always a demanding score for annoyance. The different bits of action are filmed incredibly disproportionately; in fact, the film is generally completely sleepy. It just seems to drag on. And even if the end is not too bad, this point is taken care of. In the example of the 60's Gothic horror, it is a strictly favorable example of a basement. Sorry, we can't really recommend it.
