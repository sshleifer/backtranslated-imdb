I agree with the downside comments. The last view has been a little better, but the writers definitely need more direction. I think the characters are still interesting, though sometimes they spin too much into the "white trash". Fineness and nuance goes to exhibitions like "Office" far. I think the target group is somewhat similar, both in the same night and in the composition. One might think that the matter of Karma and the whole East religion is a big enough topic to bring out different and interesting exhibitions, but they only scratch the surface of the object. In my opinion, this shows the contempt that many people have in Hollywood's intelligence level. We can handle more exciting content. This has been shown in many other exhibitions in the past.
