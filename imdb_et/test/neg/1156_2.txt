I am a big fan of fear films and I know there is a lot of information about serial numbers. Obviously, its director refused to investigate the film created by the director, as half of the film was fictional. Moreover, Ed Ge's character was portrayed in the wrong light. I didn't rent a movie to worry about the deputy and his girlfriend Erica. I rented it to watch Ed Gein and his legendary story. This movie was terrible, the only reason I gave it to him was 10 out of 2 because gore wasn't too bad. Active = terrible actor = subpar Movie = Time wasted. <br /> <br /> Great irritation everywhere, but I won't give up looking for a good horror movie.
