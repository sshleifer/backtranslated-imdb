Watching this movie, you will immediately notice the elements of the standard TV movie cheese ... although the plot changes through the image (if you are brave enough to say that this film has a plot), it is a book and a unigen ... and every movie "KEPT GETING WORSE! ‚Äù <br /> <br /> Candace Cameron Bure, famous for her role in DJ Tanner's hit TV show Full House, is not very convincing when Possessed twenty something. excuse me for Possesers Death. I believe he is a beautiful actor .... just not in the thriller range. <br /> <br /> Filming was filthy and as I said the plot is outdated ... although I look at it, I knew I was an automatic cheese, I had no idea how much worse this film would be ... <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie ... as hair filming and poor writing is what you are looking for
