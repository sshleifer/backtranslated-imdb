Not balanced. The director should not express his opinion as true. The film has some Fujimori criticism, but it always gives him and his family the last words. So little of Fujimor's critics that it seems to be the only reason they were involved was to say that the film offers both views. But this is not the case. <br /> <br /> The film is barely one of the massacres accused of Fujimori. And it gives him credit for the murder of the MRTA rebels that led the Japanese Embassy. It is well documented that the CIA made the plan. The site published by Caretas magazine and other newspapers even has pictures of a well-known CIA strategist. <br /> <br /> The fact that the director did not use such well-known information gives us some possible conclusions: the director is a province of Fujimori and deliberately and wrongly decides to grant him credit; the director doesn't want viewers to notice that CIA and Fujimori worked together; or it had just disappeared from ignorance because the director was not in Peru and was not at the time of the events in Peru. <br /> <br /> The explanation of other commentators that Fujimori is quite popular in Peru does not excuse the lack of precision and balanced explanations. <br /> <br /> The film also has the highest statistics on Fujimor's actual support I've ever heard. Most large survey agencies have much lower statistics. Ketin Vidal and had full autonomy from Fujimori and Montesino. <br /> <br /> Fujimor's first government experienced general economic trends (GDP), but this improvement was financed by the privatization of a number of national industries. which was not useful to the state in the long term. Also during the Fujimori regime, the gap between rich poor people increased. In its second term, the economy was suffering and there was nothing to privatize, and by the end of the second term of Fujimor, the economy was collapsing. <br /> <br /> With the Fujimor regime's infrastructure investments, they fell into a paternalistic pattern. They were created to support Fujimori, but they didn't have to last long. These structures need constant maintenance, but Fujimori did not give the civilians political power to demand additional investment. In fact, the Fujimor regime was able to destroy most forms of political organization, such as trade unions and grassroots groups, and the massive increase in unofficial unorganized labor. <br /> <br /> Finally, the director decided to spend most of the film he talked about with Fujimor to quote massive corruption in favor of Fujimor (media, entrepreneurs, army, etc.) that were so widespread that it was impossible for Fujimori to be aware of it.
