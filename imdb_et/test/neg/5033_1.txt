I turned it off in the first five minutes. It is very sick and disturbing, the moment I turned it off, was how a beautiful white horse was taken to the slaughterhouse and its skull was broken by a small pipeline. Before he died, this creature was shocked on the floor. The narrator said the animal would die immediately, it was not. I disagree with graphic realism about animals, insects, or living beings. I was very disappointed because I had just seen "Eyes Without a face", which was a brilliant movie, and this short movie was added that spoiled my night - because I couldn't fly hurt, never in spite of this wild documentary. <Br /> <br /> reading other comments on this page, I noticed that they used words such as aesthetics - not art or beauty. I can imagine that the documentary would be very explicit and deep but not aesthetic.
