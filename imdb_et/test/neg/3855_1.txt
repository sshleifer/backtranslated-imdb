Ok, I'm usually relatively open to the movie. I usually see a good movie that others have completely looted. This is an exception. <br /> <br /> I don't waste much energy telling you what will happen, but think about how Bill and Ted meet the worst police academy of all of them and you win. t be far away. <br /> <br /> The thing that really came from this movie was the foolish racism that was evident everywhere. The general theme of Latino / black boys = cool, white boys = flat is a little fun for the first couple's jokes, but if the same joke is repeated 500 times (not exaggeration), it becomes so tiring as offensive <br /> <br /> I spent a month until Karma's laws return to John Leguizamo for this movie. I had almost given up hope when the "My VH1 Awards" were screened in the UK. Followed by Mr Leguizamo, who performed on a rare comic strip bombing. You have to be a completely ridiculous laugh. Ahem. Ha! Ha! Ha!
