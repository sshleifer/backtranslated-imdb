And I can be generous. The overwhelming majority of the film consists of loop-shot films ... a shambling monster, two women pursuing a terrible monster, a number of people in the pool, again a scary monster, despite the injury. . you get the picture. I closed myself "GET ON IT ALREADY" several times. <br /> <br /> And it does not help that the film material used is poorly produced. Sound is unevenly synchronized with the image. And in one scene where they tried to achieve "artistic" lighting and camera techniques, the illuminator, who keeps the torch, which gives the scene the only lighting, is clearly visible in the picture. <br /> <br /> My hope is that production was the victim of some terrible catastrophe, where the original track and most of the material was destroyed, but they decided to release it anyway by tapping the floor of the editing room in memory of heroic crew members who gave their lives trying to save * real * movie - one with a graph and an interesting dialog. Unfortunately, there is no evidence of this and I have to conclude that they do not care about the immortal words of Joel and Bot. <br /> <br />
