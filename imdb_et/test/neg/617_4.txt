"Felony" is a B movie. There's no doubt about that. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you look at the cast composition, you may have great expectations of this entertainment experience. This movie is filled with all the wonderful characters of the character you grew up with, those with faces that you immediately understood, even though you probably don't know their names. It is amazing that filmmakers could get all these people together on one project, almost as they decided to make a B-film actor reunion. Even a couple of truly top-notch actors are cast: David Warner, most of whom know 'Titanic (although my favorite is Jack Ripper' Time After Time ') and Lance Henriksen, who many remember as' aliens' as bishop. These two actors have done great work during their long career and made very fine films. <br /> <br /> But as impressive as this collection of actors, their talent never appears on the screen. "Felony" writers spent a lot of money to collect a dream team, which is an important factor in the common denominator of all B-films: a silly script to collect their golden opportunity. <br /> <br /> Let's start with a stupid assumption. The bad guys are holding a tape that makes a terrible murder, and they are relentlessly pursuing the film crew to acquire video tape and destroy evidence. But honestly, why bother? At a time when they need to watch the film crew, thousands of copies of this tape can be made and distributed to every law enforcement and media field. Criminals do not seem to understand the pointlessness of their efforts, and they say that stealing and destroying one original video tape solves the whole problem. Stupid ... but I think if the bad guys were so logical, there wouldn't be a movie. <br /> <br /> Then there is a dialog. It is at times stupid, sometimes cliche and at times unbelievable ... all that is to be expected from the B movie. Of course, I have always believed that strong performances can go far beyond the material shortcomings. This casting involves actors who are certainly capable of a strong performance, and while many cast members are not good at all and have achieved the status of a B-movie quite well, there may be hope that most of the majority would be able to bring their lives into their lives. However, it is disappointing to see that a few of those in the film really seem to be serious enough to give him the best picture. There is not much inspiration in these performances, but then it is an endless script. Now, I admit that some of the more colorful actors play a certain amount of pizazas in the delivery of their ranks, but to be honest, even the very beautiful actors mentioned earlier seem to be mostly interesting and did not participate in the story. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the story ... even though the actor had been caliber high enough to show the dialogue a bit less cheesy, he still doesn't let Felony redeem that fact that his writer is committed to scripts for low budget movies Ultra Faux Passport: A plot with as many holes as a Swiss cheese block. You can watch this movie a hundred times and you still can't figure out how everything adds. In an attempt to reciprocate and always keep the viewer away, the writer throws all kinds of surprises and unexpected turns into his script and reaches the puzzle, but when you get to the end, you'll find that there are a bunch of pieces. which just doesn't fit everywhere and others are missing. I admire a good thriller that thinks of me, but creating a lot of twists that are just confusing to you and which is not in line with the rest of the story is an amateur. There was so much that it was never explained that I felt very disappointed. If you decide to watch it, be prepared to be confused. <br /> <br /> I haven't even mentioned all the other stupid things about this movie, but I'm not worried. The funny thing is that, despite everything I've said, I have to admit that I can't give "Felony" 1/10 stars. Although I can't justify my finger exactly, I found this movie somewhat pleasant. Foolishness can actually be sometimes fun when you are under this mood. I really like some of these characters, and although their performances are somewhat weak in their talents, I still got out of their sight. <br /> <br /> Now I know I've appreciated it for a serious film movement. It is quite possible that I have completely removed this point. It may be that the filmmakers aimed to make B-film. Maybe stupidity is completely deliberate. If that is the case, and if I appreciate them on terms, then I must say that "Felony" is a classic genre of language-in-cheek activity labels. B movie fans love to see all of their favorite actors in one movie, get some smile from the script, and they are entertained with a whole dose of weapons, explosions, and traces.
