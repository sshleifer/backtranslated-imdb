For a long time as a fan of Steve Martin, he was hurt in the film with such a clich√© script. The script must have just rented some videos and taken away a piece and a piece - this is definitely the least imaginative film I've seen for a long time - I knew exactly what would happen on every scene as soon as it started. African-American stereotypes and slaves are also offensive. But the worst thing for me was to see Martin in the movie without meaningless traces. He's probably one of the most intelligent participants, and here he sold a completely buggy script. He must be behind his alimony to be so disappointed.
