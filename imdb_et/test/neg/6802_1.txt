I don't know how this movie has received so many positive comments. This can be called "artistic" and "beautifully filmed", but these things do not compensate for an empty plot filled with sexual innuendo. I wouldn't want to waste my time watching this movie. Instead of being biographical, it was a bad excuse to promote strange and bad behavior. It was just another Hollywood to try to convince us that such a life is normal and OK. From the beginning I asked myself what was the idea of ​​this film, and I continued to look, hoping it would change and was quite disappointed that it continued in the same way. I'm so glad I didn't spend the money to see it in the theater!
