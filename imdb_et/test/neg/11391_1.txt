It's a terrible frenzy of the French film Ma Vie en Rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). The only scenario I can imagine if someone (Blue?! Bates? Doesn't write credit - or talent! - to his name) to translate topics for an American audience - whom they both agreed, is stupid, stupid, stupid. He then invited other friends to sign in and they did it as friends - certainly not for the benefits of this pathetic, all-but-kitchen-sink script. <br /> <br /> I am not a fan of the French movie, but I Vie en Rose is a delicate, thoughtful and thought-provoking treatment of sensitive cultural issues. I would like to see that this would be broader contact with English-speaking audiences - and if that means rebuilding America, then be it. But Puh-leeze! little respect for the audience's problems and intelligence - and the better direction for the actors who don't seem decisive whether they're working with Tennessee Williams or Jerry Lewis!
