I like Wes Stud, and especially Adam Beach, but who is this film that is a burdensome pretentiousness. Amazingly slow. Too mysterious about the hiding place, not because the plot justifies it, but because there is almost no plot. Even with less characterization. It is almost like one of those passionate old Charlie Chani mysteries (cheaper versions of the Monogram studio) with many red herring and odd symbols (like the old ex-senator with a square past who is now a party) and many people are being killed over objets d'art you wouldn't look twice in the mall. Great terrain. Pretty hair is also redheaded, though I could never figure out what she was doing at all. Nor did my wife become. Sheesh, at least in the old B-films, was good to be short.
