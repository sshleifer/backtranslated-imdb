Okay, let's be realistic about it. Nobody goes to WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God's wrestling game), which the director was a former porn movie (man gave the world a trilogy of cheeks), playing a wrestler named Kane and waiting for a little bit of art. If you do, you'll probably need to find something other than watching a movie to take your time. <br /> <br /> So what exactly to expect from this movie? Well, here's what I expected: <br /> <br /> 1) Bad action. 2) The story of non-existent, clich√©s. 3) Kane walked around with a wounded, sour face, indicating that his nostrils found a potato salad that he had misplaced a month ago. 4) tons and tons of gore. <br /> <br /> Well, if you are hungry for some "funny funny" entertainment, it can satisfy your appetite because it gives you all the lists. <br /> <br /> Obviously, such films are best seen for free, but if you decide to sacrifice cash registers, then it's fun and out of it. The filmmakers are great to introduce us to every annoying criminal, flashing their names and offenses on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write what you want to kill and in what order. You and your friends will see whose predictions are the most accurate. <br /> <br /> I also suggest that you and your friends write down every stupidity and failure to the moment you find. Tally them in the end and see who comes the most. I think my big quantity was 107; can you beat it? Personally, I want to know how, after 35 years and a fire, this abandoned hotel still has electricity, running water and a running elevator? <br /> <br /> I know, I know, filmmakers expect that if you pay to see it, you obviously don't think much about what you spend on your money, and therefore probably don't think much about how the movie is foolish, but that doesn't mean we can't bring it out and laugh I like the way the city wants this great hotel (which would be condemned by a sensible inspector and recommended to demolish) as a shelter for the homeless and they think the best way to get it cleaned is give eight pounds some mops and brushes. <br /> <br /> I think you know what to expect, but I feel the need to give you a few warnings. First, if you hate crowd communication regardless of the movie, you might stay away. People in the audience acted like they were in real wrestling. Shouts "Kill him, Kane!" and "I hope you die first!" and "Chokeslam!" called through the theater, showing what I hope is NOT the best of what the American offers. Normally, I do not understand such audience interaction, but for such cheese pain, I thought the comment was added to the value of entertainment. But I see how others can disturb it. <br /> <br /> Second, and it shouldn't even justify the explanation, the movie doesn't let the film go away. If you look at the great hanging of the ugly, they will not shout out "fun night in the movies!" Because you know good and good to save your dough. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I was a little surprised that there is very little dialogue with Kane. I didn't expect him to present a working clinic, but I was hoping he had some cute little words like "Say Good Night" (his surname is "Goodnight") just before he killed the victim. Instead, he said four words in the movie - "Nooooooo!" and "I see it." But hey, he gave them flawlessly! <br /> <br /> If I was a bad guy in the movie, my quotation would be something like "Place your bets!" or "All BETTS is off!" <br /> <br /> This would be the rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror movies, like No Evil, which makes so much inadvertent laughter that you need to label them almost comically. Feel free to send me your suggestions. Right now we're just calling 'HOR-larious!
