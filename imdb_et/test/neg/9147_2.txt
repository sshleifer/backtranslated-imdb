This version of The Magic Flute is not only Mozart's great opera I've ever seen, but also the worst video production I've ever seen on any opera. <br /> <br /> I am a big opera fan and I have more opera on DVD than movies. Sets are cheap and cheesy. Papagenol doesn't even have a bird costume. He's just dressed like a guy. Sound is mono. The color is very bad. It's orange saturated. Most DVDs of this period have been digitally restored to color, but they didn't bother it. The language has also been replaced with Swedish instead of the original languages. <br /> <br /> This is not a version of "Magic Flute". It is a filmed performance and it is not a good result and it was not filmed very well. You can choose another available DVD from this opera and I guarantee it is better than this. My preference is a version of James Levine's by David Hockney.
