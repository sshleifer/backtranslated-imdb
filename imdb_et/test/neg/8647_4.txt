The fourth LA police, driving a large black convertible in the fedoras, look weakly absurd and even ridiculous when it turns out that Nick Nolte, who is the most terrible, is responsible. The writer will never be able to create a spirit of divorce among team members and the director will not be able to move the so-called "divorce". Use someone to interrogate. The Nolte symbol illuminates the cigarette, gets crazy and wins the pulp with the interviewees. His methods will get him somewhere until he has traveled from his place of residence at one moment to let his mouth open and his brain closed. He crushes the FBI team and throws two soldiers out of the plane who have only a vague report of anger at headquarters and no punishment at all. At the end of the movie, she's the same as the muscles and muscles, as she was at the beginning. How he managed to get a beautiful whore for his deep grace is a mystery, as well as the eternal dedication and tragic feeling of betrayal of his unemployed woman. There are two interesting pictures in the picture: one, atomic explosion, another giant crater that is apparently caused by a bomb. It's almost as spoiled and swollen as the Nolte's face.
