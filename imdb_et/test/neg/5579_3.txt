From the opening of Meteor, which falls to Earth, you know that you are something special. <br /> <br /> This is an extremely low budget made for a video about the archipelago of lighthouses. some monsters. The story is unobtrusive and something you haven't seen a thousand times before. Action is not great, but it is not terrible, but special effects, many of which are many, are at best ridiculous. In fact, if you can read this sentence, the probability is better than 50% so that you can do more reliable work by creating explosive and composition effects in this movie than filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Sustainable film - if you are in the mood for the movie's Z-Class turkeys - it's always going to happen and it's never boring. And if you like having fun with your friends, you can just find a worthwhile dollar for rent. <br /> <br /> And I have to say I appreciate the fun of opening, "it's the name of the island's dumb I've ever heard." Probably the best movie time.
