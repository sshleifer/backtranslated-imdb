I picked up this DVD for 3.99 rogers-videos to get enough points for a free movie for free. I'm never going to look at it, but it started poking at my curiosity and finally decided to sign up for a DVD player. The effect of this movie is terrible and cheap. Some of the dialogues in this movie sound like it was written by a lucky 12-year-old boy. Operating in some parts really cheesy and "action" scenes are totally ridiculous. You start to laugh in some parts that were positive for me because it kept me entertained. The plot is a girl who has a curse that causes her vomiting snakes, so some shamans have to take her to Los Angeles, there are two girls who try to smuggle drugs there and some other people who aren't important to the plot, not there is really a plot at all.Do not wait for something in this movie and do not listen to the cover, there are 100 passengers and 3000 vipers, there are 10 passengers and 20 random snakes. <br /> <br As far as the DVD is concerned, there is a trailer that is almost as ridiculous as a movie, a blooming roll, which is just one hit over one actor trying to say the train, and the deleted scenes are really useless if they weren't good enough to stay in this movie so they would be pretty bad. It's also a bad feature film that doesn't really show off, except that people related to this movie were sort of idiots. I can't recommend this if you don't really want a bad movie that you can laugh with friends. I'll give him 2 kitty from 5 cats.
