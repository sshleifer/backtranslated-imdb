View 1 of 7/29/2001 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mark Dindal): The fast paced animation group of the Ted Turner function, frantic animation plays a lot like TV cartoons, and leaves much to be desired, but it is unlikely the villains are very unlikely . I'm not even sure why kids want this movie because there are so many references to old movie stars that kids know very little or nothing at all. The mediocre effort at best, despite the rips in the box, compared to Disney's efforts like Aladdin and Lion King. Don't let this fool - the story or quality is not compared.
