For some reason, some scientific people go to the cave and there is some kind of creature that kills them. <br /> <br /> I usually give a more detailed plot, but I didn't pay too much attention to it. All in all, it was boring and the only time you really paid attention was during the action scenes that the director did perfectly. <br /> <br /> The actor is fine, but the characters are so empty and forget they mix up in your mind. You forget who lived and who died for two reasons: 1. Kills is boring. 2. The characters are boring. <br /> <br /> The end may have shocked me more when I knew who was who. /> <br /> So you're looking for a creature-cave movie? Check the descent instead.
