Not as I was going to wait a lot for this, but at least I was hoping for a fun, meaningless, big budget movie. That's not even so. This point is on the underside of all seen vampire movies (and believe me, I've seen them a lot). Bad action, zero characterization, little or no thought, almost non-existent plot (and the fact that you can drive semi-trailers through holes). Of course, he has action and it is loud, and he has more action and more noise, blood and action ... These things alone do not make a good (or even semi-decent) film. Let me know how some people can say it's the best vampire movie ever made - I can assume they haven't seen much. I recommend seeing the blind instead.
