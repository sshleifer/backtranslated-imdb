How has the name of this film ever been made for dignity? <br /> <br /> One assumes that the subtitles simply say "terribly" about this truly shameful effort for each frame. <br /> <br /> Dreadful action, poor dialogue, and the absence of all the talents involved in nightmare make it an exciting 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> General impression? <br /> <br /> Lots of stimulating drama students became happy with the lottery prize and started making one of the most painful movies ever made. <br /> <br /> This makes Hammer Horror's TV shows similar to the Oscar. <br /> <br /> And don't think it belongs to the category "so bad it's good". It's not so bad. <br /> <br /> However, the scene is probably one more look.
