The game and hockey game is the so-called "speed" that real hockey scenes in this gentle movie will never even capture. Add a story that is a clich√©, predictable and stupider as a fool, with some of the sheer '80s music that disturbs your senses from each scene and you have' Youngblood '. Oh, Keanu as a French Canadian, yes, whatever. Go to Dunlop, Braden and Hanson at any time ... One on TEN.
