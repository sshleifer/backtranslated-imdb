It was the first feature film of almost all the people involved, including director Teck Tan, so they deserve to be drawn out. But this film was inconvenient in its direction, preaching in its style, exaggerating its actions, and too politically correct. The plot was all over the place, preventing any aspect of it from developing well. Gangsters participate in the story, although I am not sure what their presence is, except making the movie unrealistic. They could have left out completely and the film would have been better. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a young ethnic Chinese Malaysian who returns to his homeland after studying in the West. His research has brought him back to the skills he thinks he needs to fulfill his dream to lead the rock band and lead them to the top of the Malaysian charts (quite a presumption for minors). The beginning of the film implies a conflict with its traditional father, but if the gangsters accompany it, the story falls vaguely. <br /> <br /> The film attempts to take advantage of Malaysia's stunningly diverse ethnic mix, but unfortunately it seemed to be horribly viable or fair to see how these aspects were put on the film. Malay women have beautiful traditional dances on the beach, but the vision of integrating the plot seems to be forced and unnatural. the male leader was particularly convincing. The female Malay leader was a remarkable exception that was most positive. The film also has a publicly geographic character and, although it is a little caricature, it offers some of the funniest moments in the film. But the film was just barely a typical local television soap drama. Unfortunately, this film, which is not the least offensive, is banned in Malaysia. 3/10
