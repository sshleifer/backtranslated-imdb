The whole act of Joe Rogan is guilty of guilt. He is a pot smoker who entered the deer and thought it was a joke. He said he had eggs for people because he didn't know how stupid people were. The performers to whom he explained they went on the assumption that they were playing with the unsuspecting competitors to see how far they were going. The level of evil involved is slightly twisted. Mr. Rogani's special is just filled with someone who is too good for ordinary people. I found that he was offensive and his things could be heard more talented comedies like Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock. Rogan even makes N words in five minutes. In general, ignore this special.
