This film had great production values, good lighting, costumes, cinema, cinematography and acting. But somewhere, somewhere, took the script and replaced all the dialogue with the class level school literacy. I felt my IQ drop points at any time when no one spoke. <br /> <br /> Did they do it for the purpose? Was it just a Brain Dead Studio driver accident? We don't know right now. <br /> <br /> All I know is that this movie was a big mistake from start to finish. We can't even see how Squad got to the police, so instead of creating any character, we get what seems to be a bad TV movie residue from the 60s. Or whatever. <br /> <br /> Find the scriptwriters, beat them with socks full of socks. All others, nice work, but next time read your scripts. <br /> <br /> 3/10
