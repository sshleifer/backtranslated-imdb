I waited for quite some time until I saw this Lone Ranger movie. I finally saw it on the Lone Star Channel and was very disappointed with the whole movie. Clayton Moore and John Hart acted better as Lone Rangers and Jay Silverheels than Tonto when these two stars in this movie. Everyone made this movie very badly. Even the plot was bad and far-fetching. I believe that the horse that depicts Silver was the best actor in this movie. I'm glad I didn't go out and bought a copy of this movie when it first came out, because I feel it's a waste of money. I really regret that Clayton Moore, John Hart and Jay Silverheels played and lives on the silver screen, they are so badly faded. If in the future they do not find actors who deserve the characters in the same way as Clayton, John and Jay did so well in the past, they will not spend money on buying a movie. I'm not watching this movie again. <br /> <br /> Wayne Davies
