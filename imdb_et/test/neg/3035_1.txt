This film repels the mark on most fronts. The emphasis is on the ridiculously weak, acting actor and the best comedy. <br /> <br /> They have a great idea, it could have been especially enjoyable, but for the reasons mentioned above. <br /> <The writer seems to think when you put the word f * ck into every sentence that makes it more fun and the main character just seems to try a little too hard. He's not sure about brick. <br /> <br /> Next time you get at least a cast that can emphasize the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It's a crime to compare it to movies like Business, Lockout, and Hijacking.
