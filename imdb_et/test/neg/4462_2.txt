If you saw this movie for the first time with Mary, maybe it is possible that the nostalgia fog will encourage your charity. If not, this is not an option. Young things hipspeak is a complete nonsense, people could use the random word you hear here, but not the huge batches of sentence after sentence. Dracula AD 1972 is not as many pieces as it breaks into pieces, from the moment when someone under thirty opens his mouth, it is impossible to take the film seriously and if it is laughing, it is not even a smile. Throwing Dracula to the present day is good and worth a much stronger script than Don Houghton. The Thames River and Chelsea Chess are not suitable for doll balls, models and scared attachments, but you can't help but feel that it would have been so different with better writing.
