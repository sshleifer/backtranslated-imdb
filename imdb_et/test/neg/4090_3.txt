This movie was a mistake like comedy and film in general. It was a very slow tempo film that seemed to have tried to convey the message, but the message was a clich√©, a hopeless mess. This film is shameless for environmental protection, even making the destruction of off-road vehicles and the promotion of the animal planet a point in itself. <br /> <br /> As I sat through it, I could not notice that Steve Carell was no more than one really funny line. The only thing that could hypothetically mention this comedy is a bad attempt to give the comic relief line to Wanda Sykes. His character becomes a frequent, tempting line where they are absolutely inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Far away from Bruce Almighty's glory, Evan Almighty blows all of its record budgets into special effect schemes that are barely on the way forward. The film spends the first half of the Evan ship building, but finally we find out that the ark was completely pointless and the whole plot was just a cell for fools and even stupider messages. The film concludes when we find out that the whole cell, flood and animal collection was just a weak political statement to anyone other than God. Yes, God tried to influence politics.
