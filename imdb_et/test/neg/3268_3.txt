Caddyshack II is nothing like the original Caddyshack. But there are good reasons for this. (1) Rodney Dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this movie, but he didn't like the script, wanted to change it, his application was rejected, so he didn't make a movie. (2) It was a small budget, Bill Murray had grown into a superstar. Ted Knight died in 1986 and Chevy Chase's first film "ace" (though it was Rodney all the time) could not be more than 5 minutes because it would cost him too much. But if you had Dan Aykroyd, Robert Stack, Randy Quaid, and Jackie Mason, all the substitutes that were used, no one had the best results.
