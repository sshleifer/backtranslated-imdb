In fact, I have this movie, which is the MST3K version called "Cave Dwellers", which is really the only way someone could actually watch such a movie. If it wasn't for all of Joel, Crow and Tom Servo constantly wisecracks, then it would not be possible for this piece. You have a hero, Ator, who looks like Jeff Spigoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and looks just a little more intelligent, just without stones. He takes over the caves (cave inhabitants?), The invisible boys, the giant snake (with a number of anal retentive snakes that want to assemble all the skulls that face the same way), the ripps discover a glider who looks suspiciously like a modern aluminum one with some cheap vines , and then the dumb John Saxon looks like a guy. Then he drops off his horse over a track where someone is four-wheeled. <br /> <br /> Yes, I got most of this MST3K that, as I said, is the only way to watch this turkey Film. If not, it would be close to zero.
