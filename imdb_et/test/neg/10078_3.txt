It is clear that for this movie, the story wanted to be led by characters. But immediately the story line will cause you new headlines. The flying of the island and the dinosaurs below had no effect at all and seemed almost like a cartoon. Entire island access to the island is only a part of JP 1 and 2. The story is predictable outrage and it is a completely dissatisfied end that deceived me. It gave me no chance to give the movie 3/10!
