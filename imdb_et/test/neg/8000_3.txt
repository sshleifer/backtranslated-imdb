Enter Ninja (1981) was the first of many "Ninja" films produced by Cannon, who provides or notices the Japanese lesson Sho Koshu. But the first "Ninja" movie star was legendary tough guy Franco Nero. Unfortunately, not even Mr. Nero or Sho Kosug could watch this movie. If you have two bad deeds in a feature film, it's not as watchful or fun. But I ground. Skip this chapter and watch a series of movies below. They are more interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> Next is Ninja's revenge. Instead of playing "evil oriental" (I use this term verbally). He's the star! Weird Western movie. Watch it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, except for dead heroes by Sho Kosuk fans or Cannon movie films.
