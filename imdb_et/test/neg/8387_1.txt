I was afraid to see this movie recently and I have to sit through it. A friend bought it for Â£ 1 and demanded that we look at it because it sounded good back on the back cover story. <br /> <br /> For 10 minutes, it was obvious that the actors were amateurs and this was a very low budget effort. <br /> <br /> The scenes were very bad, the script was stupid and the story contained many scenes that seemed unnecessarily long so the movie would have a reasonable length. For example, if a wiring rents a warehouse, the film spends a ridiculous time on the scene that lacks a meaningless dialogue that does not provide the plot with any real purpose or necessity. <br /> <br /> The leading player is an allegedly revenge woman who sleeps with men to give them HIV, she has never thought of testing. Instead, he becomes a crazy killer who decides to torture him before he kills and catches him. <br /> <br /> If it sounds good and you think it has a lot of gore, think again. This film does not have real sequences and is quite the same for this type of film. <br /> <br /> It doesn't scare you, it doesn't make you pointless, it doesn't offer fast pace. However, this may make you sleep, so be sure you wear tears so please save your despair and follow my headline. <br /> <br /> RESPONSE 1/2 out of 10 (it doesn't even deserve 1) <br /> <br /> The movie was 78 minutes, but it seemed to be 2 1/2 hours.
