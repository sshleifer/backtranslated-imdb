With a catchy title like Butcher of Plainfield, this Ed Gein variation and Kane Hodder play him undoubtedly fly on the shelves for a few weeks. Most viewers bored silly with this last take on the life of Ed Gien. / / <br /> The film focuses on Ed's rampage and gives us a (couple of) glance at his Psychosis and living at the Plainfeild. These scenes give the film a much needed hit. <br /> <br /> What ruins this is a constant focus on other characters lives and focuses less on Eds.Big error here. <br /> <br /> Kane Hodder is a strange choice to play Gein, but he pulls it quite well and deserves more action on credit than he gets these days.Prascilla Barnes and Micahel Barryman also appear. <br /> <br /> 3/10
