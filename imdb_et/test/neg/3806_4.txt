Stodgy's drama starring Pat O'Brien as a washed reporter who turns to his ex-boss house to ask for money to fund his son's operation to find him dead on the floor. Because O'Brien knows the identity of the culprit, he offers rape for the money he needs. A decent assumption is wasted on a film that pretends to have surprises, turns and turns, although it is not. Performances have rotted across the film, the film is dressed as a hard-boiled American knife, but the mix of insecure accents doesn't work and the story hardly grabs. And it probably contains the least attractive screen kiss all the time.
