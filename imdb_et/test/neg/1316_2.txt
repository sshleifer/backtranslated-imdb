In the form of this film, it seemed that it might be really good - it is not so. <br /> <br /> Cast is pretty good, but most of them seemed embarrassing. A real disaster in this film is not a flood, but a script. He's trying to add all the clich√©s to a book that's all incredibly badly done. The end is very steep, but it's a hidden blessing. Congragulations when you do it so far. <br /> <br /> All three major male actors (Carlyle, Courtney and Suchet) would certainly agree that this is a low point in their career. I hope they got a lot of money because none of their reputation came in tact. <br /> <br /> Special effects are pretty good, but the same thing was done with a much better result tomorrow day. In short, it's a useless exercise. Don't waste your time.
