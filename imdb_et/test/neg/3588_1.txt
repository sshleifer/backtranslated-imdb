The only reason for FC De Kampioen is local popularity. This has led to the launch of this sitcom for over 15 years (and still counts). <br /> <br /> This is about an amateur football team with an emphasis on "amateur". Each story deals with the same topic: some misunderstandings that take on an infinite (and predictable) proportion to ultimately resolve. <br /> <br /> The exhibition has been going on for over 15 years, and the production probably did not change the winning team. This means that the exhibition has undergone some minor changes over the years (apart from a few participants who have been replaced (almost all of them have been replaced instead of the show). Humor has not changed a little over the years, and it was already outdated when it was first stimulated for the first time . <br /> <br /> I think you have to have this Flemish and over the age of 60. Enjoy such an old TV show.
