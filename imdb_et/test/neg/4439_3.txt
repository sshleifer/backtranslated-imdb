"Quintet" is definitely not a movie that most people find amusing or even interesting. There is no scene, dialogue, behavior or plot development that shines the light. The ice world is one thing, but the confusing plot is something you really don't wear. The characters are not only three-dimensional, they are not even one-dimensional, neither emotions nor anything that continues. The ice is surrounded by a world where nobody does any meaningful work except playing Quintet, and the rules of the game have never hinted. Homes are not warmed up, even if there is electricity, but who and what produces it? There is wood, but there are no animals except dogs, so where clothes come or shoes on this issue, because apparently there is no industry and everything is dressed like the 16th century Europe, which is a strange contrast not so futuristic pavilion background. The entire film seam remains in Altman's imagination, and he never shared his ideas or vision with the audience. Desolation or hopelessness has nothing to do with the lack of this movie, the world of "Lucas" THX1138 is not a brighter place and characters are no more fun, but the story is the way. The quintet has no obvious or even hinted path, and in my opinion, it does not even create thought behind this idea, such as a similar film, "Zardoz" by John Boorman. It's not even made in Altman's unique style, so it doesn't like its fans and I'm one of them. All in all, Robert Altman had a dream and he woke up without anyone talking what it meant, not even to him.
