This movie is terrible. If you plan to see this movie, two words DO NOT. It's tasteless, the story is really flat and the jokes are even worse. Operation is really pathetic. I can't believe this movie is made. Look at American Pie, Going Greek or Road Trip, if you are for a teen comedy. It's about two girls who run their Spring Break in Malibu. As usual, they didn't do much planning and called (I think his names Michelle) uncle to collapse in Malibu Manor. Uncle Bennie strictly forbids them from any kind of party and, as you thought, they go on and on. Please, you don't see this movie.
