Terrible in writing, very understandable, by "good" people who don't know in any way L.A. or US current racial relationships. Dirty positive reviews are a mystery to me - but they can only be offered by people who think that someone's "good" intentions should be praised, no matter how low, simple, and simply unrealistic. If you want to see a film that realistically deals with today's L.A competition issues - a movie that you must see (and probably already saw) is Pulp Fiction. Within two minutes of this movie, there is more honesty and reality with the race than it is 4 hours (oh, I'm sorry, it seemed after 4 hours). <br /> <br /> If someone needs proof that the road to hell is paved with good intentions - then this is a movie for you.
