Andrew Gurland's "Cheats" is his fictional "real story" about four high school freaks who maneuver to deceive tests. The quartet is: Trevor Fehrman (like Handsome Davis), a general schoolboy, Matthew Lawrence (Victorina) with his beautiful appearance, Chum Elden Henson (like Sammy), his chubby schoolgirl and Martin Starr (Applebee). In adults, North Point's main point is Mary Tyler Moore (Ms. Stark) and pornography-loving father Griffin Dunne (Mr. Davis). The high traps begin with Mr Fehrman and Mr Lawrence, who are allegedly urinating in a teacher class book. Put this one on the bottom of the pile; and be grateful that it will not go on a permanent disc. <br /> <br /> *** Cheats (2002) Andrew Gurland ~ Trevor Fehrman, Matthew Lawrence, Elden Henson
