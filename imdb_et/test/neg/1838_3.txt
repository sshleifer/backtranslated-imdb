I was expecting this movie because everyone was talking about it as a good horror film and finally Europeans. So, maybe my expectations were high. <br /> <br /> It starts quietly with horror / shock, but it allows you to step down into the following scenes, where the graph starts when the actress and the characters' motivation / life shows that it is no better than any "TV drama done ”. It keeps this way straight to the end. <br /> <br /> The movie's horror is definitely a good idea and another, but all the scenes have "seen it before". In general, my idea of ​​this film was that it had a good concept that was inserted into a mediocre story, with poor performance, and less than acceptable plot holes. <br /> <br />
