The fact that this dirty series can trigger dozens of comments (much less hundreds of votes) speaks of a decrease in western (or at least American) civilization. <br /> <br /> Read Proust, you! ! Or at least the anthologies of Dave Barry or Calvin and Hobbes. <br /> <br /> Chuck Norris. Turn around your brain the fact that you would have had to spend minutes to evaluate or write this series. used to make a call at the right time in your local service. <br /> <br /> DO NOT REMOVE THIS SHOW !! CHANGE OR NO APPROACH!
