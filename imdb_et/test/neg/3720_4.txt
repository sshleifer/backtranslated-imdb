Meek and Light Edward G. Robinson (Wilbert Winkle) decides to finish his banking work and do what he wants, opening a repair shop behind his house. Mr. Robinson is married but childless; he is friendly with Ted Donaldson (Barryna), a resident of a local children's home. Young Donaldson is an avid workshop assistant and sees Robinson as his father. Robinson's annoying wife Ruth Warwick (like Amy) is not happy with Robinson's job choice and wants things to be returned to the idea of ​​normality. Their life is even more annoying when creating a robinson. <br /> <br /> War also interferes with what might have been an interesting story, as Robinson's character is being fought by a dominant, uncertain woman. It is possible that filmmakers will show how to save marriages and lead lives in a positive way. Robinson and Donaldson are a pleasant team. Robert Mitchum has a bit of a failure. The "trick" of the end played by Mrs Warwick and Donaldson is predictably staged.
