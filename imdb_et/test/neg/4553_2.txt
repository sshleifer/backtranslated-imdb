It can be the worst film I've ever seen in my life. Usually I don't watch such movies, but I was forced to watch it at school. What a torment! <br /> <br /> The story is as medium and boring as possible: The boy meets the girl on the Spanish coast, the boy and the girl fall in love, but the love between the two seems impossible and everything is against their love. At the end of the film, the film turns into some kind of strange kung-fu movies, where the white boys are fighting black guys. Amazing! <br /> <br /> The action is so bad that it laughs at you. The movie dances, which I think should be cool, are so simple and ridiculous that I can even do them! And Georgina Verbaan is probably the most irritating person I've ever seen on the screen. <br /> <br /> Johan Nijenhuis is on the way to Dutch Ed Wood. His films are so bad that they laugh. <br /> <br /> Victor LÃ¶w, however, gives surprisingly good results and Daan Schuurmans is also OK. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. But if you like watching soaps, it may be worth your while. <br /> <br /> Yuk! <br /> <br /> 2/10
