Sometimes it is difficult to judge how bad a film made in Italy or Spain is, because they all seem to use the same stable 9-10 ESL trained voice actors to provide English voices for US release. And things always go down in translation, because the shtick and plot elements written for the expectations of the European audience may not work well with our American ideas of what is funny, hip or dramatic. I imagine that the team responsible for translating this movie into English was about 3 days from the beginning to the end, and they would probably have paid their used Fiat to pay for it. In other words, pure hacking that has been taken away in one or two keys and has never been reviewed or proven by someone with a real ear for the American language. <br /> <br /> Looking at Devil Fish, I can imagine that if you were in Italian in your mother tongue, you might find that it is a lightly amusing little cafe. You would laugh at jokes and a drunken drunk, you would like to scare and nonsense bad guys, and you would like to say Peter and a non-real Daryll Hannah on an attractive pair of beaches for no apparent reason looking for clues about eating a monster who has already killed one of his friends . <br /> <br /> But after a voice-like and tin-headphone dialogue, keep us out of the American film experience, we can't help but notice that the editors had a serious disorder of attention deficit, so that no one on the screen can really act like an attitude that The rationale for its creation is that the monster makes absolutely no sense that the sequences of activity have the whole cooked oatmeal filled with cereal and that the director, scriptwriters and producers hate women. <br /> <br /> Don't even think about buying or renting a movie - check out on Saturday afternoon only on cable TV with one of your beers in the fist or with the help of Mike and Botide and protected by MST3K.
