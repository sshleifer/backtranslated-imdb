I rate movies on this site all the time, but usually don't write reviews. But in that case, I felt forced to WARN another! This movie is bad! This is probably one of the twelve films I'm "1 (terrible)". I know people say it all the time, but it was really one of the worst films I've ever seen. Anyway, it's just on the tenth underside. <br /> <br /> For horror films, I have very low standards. I forget all kinds of shameful films. But this movie is embarrassingly bad. It seems that someone bought a video camera in Sears and decided to make a movie with their friends. (The fact that each team member's name appears on the election list proves this theory, I think.) This film has lower production standards than your average high school game. It's actually a bit shocking to see a movie that looks bad on a DVD. Special effects are sometimes somewhat effective, but are still at best amateurish. The best thing about the actors is that at least they don't remember to watch the camera mostly. I can't say for sure whether they try to remember their lines or do them when they passed. Everything and everything with humor is flat. This movie is such a waste of time.
