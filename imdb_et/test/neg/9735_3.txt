I was hoping to learn something about this movie, but I was disappointed. It's all about Rommel and praises him as a great generalist, but in this movie we never realized why he was great. What made him so successful? Was it his ride, did he want to accept his defeat, his discipline with his men? I was looking for a similar transfer from Patton, which really gets into the character, but it fell flat. Most of the dialogue is artificial and sensational and feels old and artificial. Here and there are good activities, but not much. The story of the tail tip of his involvement in Hitler's murder was the most informative and probably the most interesting. But as Germany's biggest general history lesson, it was a failure.
