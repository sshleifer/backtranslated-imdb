I am also a SF buff among other genres, and I especially like these 60's and 70's movies on the "influence of ideas" that produced so many intelligent and pleasant stories on the screen. In short, I fully agree with scott-886 with this movie review. I heard about this movie and what I mentioned earlier, the SF chip of the 60's and 70's, who wanted to wait for SF stories with "Twilight Zone". this "second best" of Kubrick's "2001 Space Odyssey". What a Fraud. "The journey towards the sun" was a normal, complex, semi-baked, stupid, top-down film with ridiculous amateur effects (and I remember the love of CGIs of this era and the CGI) and can be compared more closely to the 60-year-old SF disasters, "Marooned", which "Journey" reminded me. The idea behind it is not so bad, but building the plot on the story of two planets Earth, where the same world is reversed, asked the captain like Kubrick. The needles say that Robert Parish is not something like this, so he gave a boring and silly film that looked and felt like an adventure of these days. It is not worth the time to waste your time, even if you are an absolute fan of the genre.
