All Greetings, <br /> <br /> Isn't it amazing what the ability of movies after first viewing? <br /> <br /> I was so glad to be watching this movie first. "Stop talking to" Flatliners "for all your friends for weeks - remember that I was 18 years old very impressive and my taste in movies is a bit more conservative ever since." Then I forgot about this movie until I saw a DVD from my local department store and remember how big it was when I thought "Right! I'll put you out of the shelf when they lift Special Edition. "<br /> <br /> Last week I was lucky when my best friend invited me to watch Flatliners on a DVD. even more when watching 2. If I was wrong! <br /> <br /> Decision: After 11 years, my view of this film changed from a very frightening 1st class movie to junk that goes beyond the religious and supernatural side of things quite superficially. /> <br /> I have never been a big fan of Julia Roberts' behavior (except for Erin Brockeridge, where she earns her Oscar) with this movie is definitely a director and so mediocre scripts. that he had no real content or potential, and only a few scary cheap excitement that wasn't well done at all, not even James-Newtown Howard, whom I like as a filmmaker, I couldn't excitement and excitement. <br /> <br /> It was in 1990 n I gave this movie 9.5 / 10; but in 2001 I would be happy to give it at best 2/10. <br /> <br />
