The amazing but weak James Bond movie is mainly because both the hero (Bond) and the villain (Blofeld) were seriously confused. Lazenby is too big and innocent who wants to play Bondi. He looks and acts rather in good-natured, but twilight ties in the police action film. The director and the writer are trying to prove their credibility, but his words "Royal Baluga, ... north" are not effective in creating him as rogue and earthly rogue. Savalas does not do bad work, but his characterization and behavior is more suitable for mobgangster. The best images of the movie are Tracy and his father. However, these actors' performances with Lazenby on screen sharing only highlight his shortcomings as an actor. This movie is too long (140 minutes) for a bond film and does not offer excitement to Bond's mountain escape, where it will pick up. This movie is trying very hard, but there is little. Many of Bondia's elements are there and climate fight is top-notch, but I always look at it when I look at it.
