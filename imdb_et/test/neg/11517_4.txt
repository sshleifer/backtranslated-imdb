When I saw this movie three years ago, I thought it showed a lot of features in the Singapore Art Museum: slow motion, minimal plot and dialogue, depending on the composition of the film, to make it work. > <br /> At this time, it is impossible for local churches to judge "Be With Me" as "Citizen Kane" or some Ozu late movie. I do not know how "Be With Me" achieved such consecrated heights in cinematography in Singapore, but I always thought that "12 floors" of Khoo is a better film, although the last film does not pride as well as Adrian Tan, Khoo's Development Partnership "Be With Me ". "The 12th Floor" is a story that is better connected with most of the Singapore people, and also has a bite, something that is not with Be With Me. <br /> <br /> "Be with me" is basically a barely intertwined trio of stories put together by Khoo and his screenwriter Wong Kim Hohi. It deals with a security officer who falls in love with a girl she sees only at a distance; two girls in horoerotic relationships; and the story of the deaf and blind Teresa Chani. <br /> <br /> Be With Me is very well filmed with Tan using the Varicam camera. The film's compositions are masterful. There is no dialogue on a film that is almost silent. The characters move around, not realistically, but almost as if they were models under the direction of the director, almost always looking at the screen and emotions: either loneliness or sadness. Unfortunately, characters don't work against each other. This movie has been seen many times already: in Tsai Ming-lian films, Khoo defended Royston Tan in "4:30" and elsewhere. Unfortunately, the use of this ultra-slowness (basically a smaller line) and piano music is not just a call to me. Teresa Chani, who is blind and deaf, but still lives a living life, but I'm afraid that this movie doesn't do much to me. I am willing to thank Chani for his viable and bold march and Tani's striking cinematography, but for more of the same theme, more meat (without two other annoying and disruptive subpages), try Werner Herzog's "Silence and Darkness" (1971).
