"Marathon" is a very interesting prerequisite, with wonderful surrounding sounds and a good landscape. Unfortunately, the film falls on its face beside these aspects. For a woman who tries to understand so many crosswords in one day, she spends a lot of time, stays and doesn't make puzzles. I believe there is more walking in the film than his work with these puzzles. Although I can see so many landscapes, it's just too much. The film is incredibly boring and purposeful. It is not worth buying, renting, watching on television or unimaginable viewing. I lost my interest so quickly that I'm not sure why I was sitting across the film.
