I looked at it under curiosity. I liked Stargate SG1 and I've been watching a number of other TV shows and movies that the main characters have been working on. <br /> <br /> My expectations were not high, so I was surprised that I was so frustrated. <br /> <br /> A good collection is terrible and the script is worse. <br /> <br /> Zero research all over the film's fallen bad science or martial arts (which many film members participate in the film, despite the fact that they do not clearly have martial arts training (baton rolling is not a warrior) to do)) training already makes the unlikely plot even less reliable. The same weapon (worn by Michael Shanks), when photographed on the hill, causes extreme damage, but toning on the inside wall, produces a small fireworks effect without damaging the willow structure - OK, I think Michael Shanks fans will be excused to see that in Stargate SG1, where the employee's weapon creates a surface to burn with the head symbol or if necessary breaks the part of the castle wall, but ... Bad CGI snake "God" eats one of the faithful how the dog starts eating - the snakes just don't behave. br /> <br /> The main prerequisite of the Amazon warrior cult on a distant planet is at best foolish: Matriarchal societies have always relied on the lack of understanding that men are required in the reproduction process of species - for example, the Picts who did not find the role of men in sexual reproduction until the 9th century - At that time, the balance of power went from women to men, carrying technological weapons and demonstrating some knowledge - especially about medicine - i that the idea that a matriarchal society could exist with such a level of scientific knowledge is based only on the original wet sleep of the author. Of course, the few references made to this science in this film show that the author knew nothing about it (except for some of the keywords he had heard in other films). However, it could have been better done, for example, in 1965, "He", which showed the matriarchal society with a firm respect, much more credibly, and even after 45 years it seems more fresh than this stupid habit. Going around a woman around the "armor", aggressive rush and their line like a child looking for a nightclub ("Come on! I'll do ya!" Style) seems to be too simplistic for the matriarchal culture. <br /> <br /> Cultural references are so simple - "all the hail that a snake's mother has pretty much takes it. Even the smallest village shows more cultural variations. <br /> <br /> There is nothing clever, thoughtful, interesting, visually exciting or remote about this movie. The audio track is of similar quality. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the little, too charitable, positive comments that this film has received are flashing Michael Shanks fans who give thumbs to everyone with whom he is involved. Don't be fooled. Low budgets aren't the reason why a movie doesn't succeed - cheap B movies can be great. This is not one of them and there is no reason to put that movie on itself.
