I happened to be surfing the whole movie and it seemed to be another badly made Christian film from the End Times (which I find quite fun because they take themselves so seriously). To be fair, I only saw for the last 30 minutes so I missed some UFOs and Sci-Fi stuff. But it was long enough to categorize this Christian faith as an embarrassing and terrible image, as well as a rather pathetic film in any artistic sense. <br /> <br /> As a film, the script was terrible, the action was mediocre and the pace was bad. Cinematography and direction were sub-par: there are no interesting visual lines, layered plot line, creativity. Don't blame it on budget alone - movies can still be interesting without special effects. It wasn't. Christian movies can not excuse their mediocrity and uniqueness in the artistic field simply because of their message. And the message here was hardly a "Christian". <br /> <br /> ** Disclaimer: The rest of the commentary is aimed at Christians ** <br /> <br /> First of all, it is unethical for every business to feed and exchange a client. I don't like to say that I can only win an iPod for free to realize that you must first spend $ 300 on participating stores. Nonchristians don't like being told they are watching a Sci-Fi movie and then being bombarded with Christian propaganda that has all the sledgehammer nuances. Hidden agendas do not take any friends, much less converters. Secondly, you should not use public hazards to convince people that your beliefs are real. Actors representing Christians came up with such harsh, insidious bullying when they dealt with a skeptical "unbeliever" as they even go so far as to steer to scare him to believe. Representative Dialogue: "Seek Jesus or HELL!" "Well, don't believe me - IF YOU HAVE SORRY!" "On the day you die, I can guarantee you want you to pay more attention to this Jesus stuff. Okay, I can exaggerate, but it certainly came in. If you think this is a" clear message for Christ, "you're wrong "I don't remember Jesus for threats and coercion. And I don't think people can make a real decision to believe him in fear. So Christians, don't use it as a" witness "to your" unsaved "friends. Third, theology was bad, and besides characterizing Jesus as a means of securing hell, he did not give space for discussion or debate, nor did he try to deal with the question of whether a UFO or alien's life could exist. Instead, he offered one answer: "The UFO is a fucking scheme that deceives people, if that happens, "which is neither biblical nor widely accepted by most Christians. Because the Bible does not mention UFOs or foreigners, it cannot be as a source to draw conclusions in one way or another. Cropping may not even be a widely accepted, reliable biblical concept, although today it seems that most evangelical Christians believe it because of the popular series of books. When you do your research (as many supporting reviewers point out), the idea of ​​the two coming of Christ (the first as rapture) is a relatively new phenomenon in the traditions of the church, which some traveling evangelists have made popular. 20th century. Most Orthodox Christians will probably find the message of this film a great stretch, based on many unsupported assumptions. <br /> <br /> In principle, this film remains a valuable entertainment, as well as an accurate representation of Christianity and its beliefs. I don't recommend it.
