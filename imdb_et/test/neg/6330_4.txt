I don't understand people here. The film is not as good as bad as some people say here. Except for De Kok, this is OK. The film's problem is mainly a script. The characters are not plausible. Sex is okay, but the psychology behind people is a little pointless. The film doesn't look good, but what are you waiting for? There was very little money for the movie. Of course, it doesn't look as good as a regular film, duh! One thing I agree with is that music is bad. Sounds like a cheap 80's erotic movie. The film is not good, okay, but you have to give some credit for it without money.
