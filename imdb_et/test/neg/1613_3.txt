This film takes a plot behind a sci-fi flick "Doppelganger" (our Earth's astronaut that falls on the opposite side of the rays of the sun and the Cold War totalitarian bows in this world) and is trying to turn it into a TV series pilot. But the whole thing went down and the TV is probably better for it. <br /> <br /> Everybody here is perfectly suited for "television". Cameron Mitchell turns to his usual solid result. Both Glenn Corbett (who seems to be a poor man John Saxon) who plays a harsh individualist whose presence represents a threat to the "World Order" base on Earth. <br /> <br /> Low budget and low power and inconsistent scripting, and the lack of real imagination in set design and cinematography keeps this Sci-Fi adventure firmly in play. <br /> <br /> Let me give you one example: in this pilot's original form ("Doppleganger"), astronauts lose their landing gear at a thunderstorm and crush their ship in a really terrible order (it was obvious that their ship never started flying again). The two astronauts then step on their vehicle's smokeless rain and wind in the middle of the wind, but hit and beat the men who were screaming through the loudspeakers. <br /> Astronauts sit in their seats when the sounds start to sound, things start to shake and the camera blurs in blackouts (and as the friend said, it was obvious that the actors just shook their seats, the director wasn't) ‚óè even shaking the camera or set). I've seen episodes "The Twilight Zone" and "The Outer Limits" that took more effort to create mood and settings when it was made mediocre for the TV. <br /> <br /> And that is essentially what is the "narrow space" error. No budget, no time, no imagination ... just make symbolic gestures and hoping for sci-fi Fan Boys imagination and enthusiasm for the rest. Sorry, guys, it doesn't work. <br /> <br /> I am sure everyone here has just finished this job and walked away and never thought about it except for their C.V. And what you do, the viewer does. Remember when you press that you've ever watched a TV channel "Breaked in Space", but it didn't give you a lasting impression and you can't remember it too much.
