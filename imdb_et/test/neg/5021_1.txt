"Inuyasha" was terrible. This exhibition was incredibly jumpy, but it is nothing more than annoying anime clich√©s. The characters are annoying and inanimate, the story is boring and endless. I think it might have been interesting if it had better writing, but it seems that the authors of the exhibition have more examples of Inuyasha and his foolish friends fighting some monsters and then crying for their tragic love triangle with Kikyou and Kagome and many circles around the same thing over and over again. The script is funny and stupid and the animation is bad. Character design is very ugly, I don't know why everyone loves it, everyone has the same face! : Big eyes, tiny nose, line like mouth and typical anime discounts. I find "Inuyasha" incredibly boring and stupid. It must be one of the more animated exhibitions ever made.
