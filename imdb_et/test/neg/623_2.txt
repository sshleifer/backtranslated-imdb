I'm an atheist. For me, history and truth mean a lot. <br /> <br /> This film is made after a novel published in 1921, which is still being updated to the present day as it would be a history book. Well, that's not. The film is about novels from the 1950s. Some of the participants were big but it didn't include the plot. <br /> <br /> In short, the man says a super bomb, so God and his friends keep the court to see if they have to intervene. Behind the devil's analogy, a man is tempted and the spirit of man is to protect. What is the human spirit anyway? And why was Adam the first defendant? Finally, you will just be in the fifth grade of US Christian propaganda. Although other religions have been mentioned, only European Christianity is studied. <br /> <br /> First of all, we get the mind. Women are terrifying stereotypes of girls in distress. Real cave women were as strong as men and as durable. Hard time, hard life, adaptation and survival. All this is mitigated by the stereotypes that exist in the middle of the century. <br /> <br /> Next we get the first pyramid structure in Egypt. Today we see a different story and we know that there were far fewer deaths and ordinary citizens at work. Losing these many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and no one then tried to defeat it. As if there was only one pyramid building. <br /> <br /> Moses, Moses and a true god, was just like a Spanish survey. The Inquisition was never even mentioned in the film. <br /> <br /> Helen of Troy's evil grim was so weak that I didn't see why so many were interested in her. In fact, they were just soldiers who followed the overriding instructions that "discussed" the political issue of power. He was just an excuse. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra's story was when I saw that the film was inaccurate and full of propaganda. Here the brother was younger. He was not obsessed with poison, was quite educated to restore the contents of the library and was politically competitive to pull Egyptian dirt off. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yes, Rome was burning. Yes, there was persecuted Christianity. But how they depicted was that the Colosseum would be built and there was no Vespasha to rebuild Rome. <br /> <br /> Attila's wolf is short-sighted and when we jump into King Arthur. Cross attacks are called minimal bloodshed. And there is no mention of crosswords in Russia, which ended with an ironic battle. The knights just went home and started to entertain it. A lot of things are being put down like plumming in indoor spaces, hygiene and scourges. <br /> <br /> Then they cover Joan from Ark, where he always has a lot of makeup and looks like princes. Territorial policy was replaced by an unfair court. The only side in the stool is questionable for me how anyone could follow it. Here I burned the will of "Hura! Now die! Cheap special effects, where is the fire?". <br /> <br /> By the time they mentioned Leonardo, I already got a movie. Columbus, the Spanish killing of America, screams Queen Elisabeth's "hit Spanish armad" and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> The only reason I wanted to see this movie was that it was the last of all 3 Mars brothers. And all they got was a scene with Manhattan and the Indians. Funny, but no more than a smile. <br /> <br /> The witch hunt is called short, as well as scourge (after renascent). When they begin to portray revolutions, things get hungry and anarchist. The US Revolution was followed by the French Revolution. Empathy and incompetence are bad, but you just can't get out of anger, but you have to replace it. So they replaced the French monarchy with the new French monarchy. So we get Napoleon and his ambitions to go to India with land. But they replace their motives with unity and put him only under the title "Emperor". European conquests, defeat in Russia captures Waterloo. <br /> <br /> US Civil War, English Rich Inventors (not Tesla). "Mr Watson, come here, I want you to be almost laughing at teenage causes. The hard work of technology was shaken to the ultimate discovery and comic abuse. Ultimately, after 85 minutes, we will end up in world wars and organized crime, but not none of its horrors. Adolf's words, "I get into Russia. This is my last territorial demand "were fun. It was his last territorial demand. <br /> <br /> To build a gap, God puts the last word" on the wall "in retrospect. All the mighty cant stop the universe for a few seconds? defending made one last throw. <br /> <br /> Finally, we see tomorrow's man as the ultimate defense. Apparently a paradoxical man because the bomb went today. His toys are a music box with a weapon and a pencil case sword. Now it's wrong? Pens and pencils Abandoned egoistic generals make music out of the gun fire So tomorrow a man is already a monster. <br /> <br /> How do I see it all had to protect to blame the devil as a real conspiracy for a man's death and case, and frankly, compared to all the barbaric things our ancestors did for a hundred these days, we are quite humane in these days with painless backwardness. <br /> <br /> To sum up, I just quote "Firefly" episode "Jaynestown": "It's my estimation that every man got a shape made of him, was a bitch or another, not you, Jayne.
