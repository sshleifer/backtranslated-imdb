In the 1960s, those who were bad film enthusiasts thought that "Plan Nine from Space Space" was the worst film ever made, and that would be so long. However, to see things, we thought that a lot of $ 3,000 was paid for the new car. <br /> <br /> When we grew older, our innocence was gradually reduced when we hit movies like "Hercules New York" and "Overdrawn at Memory Bank", which completely defined the "bad movie" genre. In this context, last night, my son and I "Alien From L.A.", which pushed the envelope extremely unforgettable only the generation back. It's not possible to make this movie "bad" (or bad or destructive) as well as any other English-language tags. Even if there were words to accurately describe this film, there would be no reason for them to be banned in a civilized society. <br /> <br /> Kathy Ireland, who apparently took the time to model the Illustrated swimsuits for sports to begin her cinematic career, plays the title alien. His pain may seem like a suggestion until you actually see the movie. Makeup artists earned their money by making Kathy's look so stupid and unappealing that you wouldn't want to touch her with the far end of the bones - nothing. To put it plainly, this film has a face that freezes Medusa. Even worse than his appearance, his voice was so fierce that I initially could not understand it as a human being. Throughout the film, I found myself longing for a chalkboard to drag my nails to cover my dialogue bluntly. At the end of the movie, Kathy finally gets a makeover and finds her beloved swimsuit. I suggested to my son that the film would have been better if they had made a swimsuit at the beginning of the movie, so at least we should have seen something. My son noted carefully that if they had taken the swimsuit and filled it in their mouths, it would have significantly improved the film twice. I leave the simplicity of my observation. If you have any doubts, compare this dreck with "Barbarella", where a competent filmmaker shows you how to use the fantastically beautiful leaderfile assets in the fantasy genre. <br /> <br /> There are few comments to make because there was so little evidence. It has been said that if a million million monkeys were writing for millions of years, it would have finally become Hamlet. With the elimination process, the rest of the time comes out to bring this scenario closer. Imagine if you want, then Alice, who gets into the hole and falls 500 feet on a stone slab, after which she rises, dusts away and starts looking for her long lost father in the city government of Atlantis. When he stayed in Atlantis, he spends most of his time running, struggling or climbing stairs and ladders, and basically tries to hold on to the general hand who seems to have no soldiers to make his offer, and who would make Tiny Tim out. macho. This summation, as it turns out, is probably longer than the shooting script. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, if you rejoice in product values ​​and take all sorts of suits and costumes with smoke and blur, you will realize that this is one movie where you can actually see the screen where everything from the $ 20 budget went. <br /> <br /> The perception that I felt was that filmmakers should not have access to drugs and alcohol when they are filming, or perhaps before it brings results, such as "alien LA "although I have to admit fairly that I do not know whether they are actually involved in substance abuse or were just brain dead at the beginning of the project.
