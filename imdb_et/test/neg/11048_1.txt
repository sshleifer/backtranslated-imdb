I'm sorry for all the parades. Just a little background about me: I like and know a lot about Asian cinema, especially Japan, China and India. Of course I'm a beginner in South Korean cinema, but if it's the best, excuse me. I want you to know that I'm not narrow-minded when I appreciate foreign films, and I'm not fit for a "foolish" stereotype. . . well, not completely. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that this supreme praise that nothing gives is given. It's a nasty * and * ridiculous movie. Hammy is acting - everything is badly done and superfluous, like getting the attention of an untrained viewer. Terrible camera work, demanding meaningless close-ups of MTV aesthetics. <br /> <br /> The plot is full of holes than a giant piece of Swiss cheese. No one expects the thriller to be 100% realistic and, for entertainment purposes, I'd be happy to close my eyes with small, unsuitable details. But excuse me for what's happening here, that * can * be stopped evenly? This story of incredibly complex and frightened revenge is worse than the worst tabloid story that can be read in the supermarket. (Don't want to ruin your "enjoyment" when it is a word, so don't go into the details of the plot.) Fighting scenes are violent, incredible, downright fools (the main "hero" who takes tens and dozens at the same time, after he USED ​​ONLY IN BRIEF, BREAKING THE BODY!) The truly "outstanding" qualities of this film are two: gentle and bleeding (gender-sister and father-in-law, well, we've developed after Oidipus, aren't we?) And graphic violence. Cut body parts - hands, teeth, tongues - with spilled blood in industrial quantities (how many tens of thousands of tomatoes needed to be pressed to make this film) do not have an aesthetic function / motivation. <br /> S & M's feast tends to be inclined, but even sacred for them, which is neither worthy nor exquisite. In heaven, even Mel Gibson's recent and much-discussed work on a nearly similar topic was not what was bad. I don't know what's going on. I do not think of myself as a paragon of supreme taste, and often I am willing to accept that a film that I did not enjoy can be better than I realized. However, I have no worries that I call it: bad, bad, bad. No redemption features. My 2c? Find something better with your time.
