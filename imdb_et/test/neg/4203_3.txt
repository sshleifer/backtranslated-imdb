I bought this Chuck Norris DVD knowing that it was one of his first films and it shows. We all know that he never wins the Oscar for his show, but that's not what we look at him. Although there have been some earthquakes in California after this film, Hwy.99 and I never had a desert or mountains. I want the writers, producers and managers of these films to look at the map at least. Like a truck driver who spends a lot of time in California, I can say right from the start that geography was wrong. However, spending an hour and a half more. So grab your Doritose and adult drink and have some time back.
