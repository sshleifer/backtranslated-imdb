I hate to admit it, but they were against Schutch's sack. The opportunity is to create an atmosphere to direct the audience to the movie. It wasn't done. The characters are weak. The story was weak. Management was very bad. Schrader was out of his depth and shows. I've been watching this many times in the hope that at least one redemption function exists. But no, nothing. The next step is probably a remake of the original, or hopefully it will remain alone. Anyone who wants to know what the best exorcist order is, should read "Legion", written by Blatty, this must be the best piece for printing. Unfortunately, it was not very well interpreted and I doubt whether it is ever possible. Like domination, start. Avoid at all costs.
