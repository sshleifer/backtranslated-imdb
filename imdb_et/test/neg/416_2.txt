Ron Howard and his "editors" had only one job ... Follow the instructions in this book, which were "rich", "mysterious", "moving" and very kinematic in their approach! <br /> <br /> What did they do? They changed everything and I mean everything! What's left is something that doesn't have the right to name "Angels and Demons"! <br /> <br /> I really love this book and it is very difficult to see how it is treated in this way! <br /> <br /> I don't know what Dan Brown's opinion was about this movie. <br /> <br /> I really do not have the patience to sit and the right 1,000,000 changes they made, it is pointless .......
