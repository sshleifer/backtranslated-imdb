Eh. It's a popcorn movie, nothing more. I watched it with a lot of friends (and although it may not be the best way to watch horror movies ...) and most of the dialogue and action was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It missed me a real movie. :) <br /> <br /> The main problem is the lack of tension in the movie. It flashes back to "clarification" scenes that scatter all noticeable tensions. <br /> <br /> And the character's relationship "revolves"? Yes, they suck. I'm not saying what they are, but they just don't add anything to the movie / storyline. <br /> <br /> (Relatively I mean two main characters.) <br /> <br /> Eek. My suggestion is: watch this movie if you can't think of anything better. Mediocre best ... Maybe not even.
