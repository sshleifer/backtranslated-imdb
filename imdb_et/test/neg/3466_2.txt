I thought this movie was good. It was absolutely not, despite the Oscar winners. Maybe I've ever laughed and I didn't hear anyone laugh in the theater. Renee Zellweger's pancake make-up was very uncertain. It seems that everyone is trying to try this movie so hard, running around in the sink but not pulling it out. I think the film may sound good in the development of the film, but in translation it lost something. Is roaring 20 really that? I don't think so. Everything seems to be artificial. The result of Randy Newman was annoying. The film is in sepia tones, like any other film in the 20th or 30th century. There is not so much originality here.
