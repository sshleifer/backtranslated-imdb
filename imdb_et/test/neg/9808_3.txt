During filming, Vanessa Redgrave took mogadon? It was like he read from the car crane. I've seen more life in a wooden spoon. Or was it all part of the character? whatever, it was very annoying, I wanted to shake the screen to hurry. I read the book a long time ago and didn't like it much except that Septim's going into madness was very well done - but I don't think Rupert Graves showed it very well, his action was all on the surface. The link between her life and Clarissa is not very well done, but I suspect that the attempt is to show the sacrificed soldiers to allow people like Clarissa to continue their life with their coats of arms. The film is very funny and has no real unity. I hated it.
