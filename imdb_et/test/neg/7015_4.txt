In 1967, I saw the outstanding music at Wintergarden in New York, where Angela Lansbury created Mame on stage. But did Hollywood give him the lead ???? Lucille Ball is not big because Lucy got this role. He killed the movie. What's wrong with Chemistry because of Bea Arthur and Angela singing songs. It is too bad if the manufacturer does not put these two together today
