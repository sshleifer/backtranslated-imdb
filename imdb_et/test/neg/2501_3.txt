As a serious horror blower, I find that certain marketing images are used to sell films, especially the really bad sellers. So I wouldn't call it naive that I assumed it was a horrifying horror hanging from Cannibal / Zombi / Jungle Holocaust. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong because it is very difficult. I should have realized that when I saw an odd "real or detectable minor, was not used" warning. Observe the detectable part as if he dared us to catch him? A group of scientists, half of whom are beautiful women in bikini, are headed by a sea captain who catches the beach for 69-year-old women looking for mutated native killing villagers. Because of the explosive nuclear bomb allegedly evacuated on the island, the radiation made him the rape / killer of this last man. . Sexual scenes have been thrown away. Women are moving naked, which has a strange overcrowding, and even asks for rape when her husband turns her down. Well, two chicks that hit each other will naturally become a lesbian scene because women are horndogs. I saw the chick strike another chicken salad and finger on herself. <br /> <br /> If you know something about this movie, this is the case. Because the rest of this crazy movie is the same. Oh, who am I kidding? There's a lot to say here. Like the white "Duchy", which pays 2 black boys to mark the team in the cabin. Or "Duchy", which takes the title as a bond when the captain himself cuts. When he refuses his progress, he starts to cry. Being a good gentleman, he reluctantly gives him joy to other team members. I had been honestly expecting the pizza boy to appear and the "Duchy" would ask if there was any other way to pay him. research. Wait, I thought it was a zombie flick? But the zombie does not enter up to 73min, but by that time all others are "entered". Did I quickly find myself in a scene? It's my first splatter porn flick and I don't think it's that subgenre of any justice. I think this is a woman who speaks when I say I want more plot and less sweaty, slippery, hairy sex. The funny thing is that it could have been a good horror movie, because the idea that bombing an atom mutates a bitter man and killed his family was good. Even Eastman's character shakes his head and walks in a couple of caves. It makes me wonder if it was a character or a writer who was outraged. <br /> <br /> I don't feel like going to sound or film quality because you should have thought it was bad. This production was shot back by three more films, including the live dead Erotic Nights, which sport most of the same pain. Eastman has said it has been done because everyone wanted a vacation and a salary. Never, I feel like I was suddenly talking about sound. The sound was strange during sexual scenes, because when Italian is cast, it seems that they would have recorded English and played it during their dialogue. So when 2 people are boned, I can clearly hear that someone in the background says, "No! Yes! Wonderful! Wait!" There was a bit of an entertaining Italian score that couldn't save that movie. SFX was at best minimal and consisted of some scenes of blood. And I would like to point out that there were no violent rape scenes, as the DVD cover had a bright warning label (ahem, another marketing), so there's no fear there. Scare only a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Displays a wide screen 1.85: 1 aspect ratio. I watched the region 1, which was not rated, running 113min, which was released in 2005 by Exploitation Digital. Alfa Digital is probably the XXX version that has the same working time, so I doubt anything is different. Prices are different, but you should not pay more than $ 25.00 for a copy. Or, as I would recommend, don't pay anything and pretend it doesn't exist. <br /> <br /> Favorite Quote: Sender, "Civilians are bad luck. Women are bad luck. They are also scientists? monsters." if it is, trailers SS Hell Camp, Emmanuelle, & ENOTLD and a very informative interview with Eastman. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Flat porn, but even weaker than horror movie. Get real porn or watch the real horror. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 by Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com
