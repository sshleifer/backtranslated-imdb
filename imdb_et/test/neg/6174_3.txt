Ugh. Even more and more popular Diane Lane could not record this movie and the most exciting thing about the movie was to see if Rourke's face was moving. One has heard so many "gossip" on his botched facial lift, etc., just like the accident on the road side, we just had to slow down and see the wreck. The plot was thin. Here we have a very professional mob who hits a man who somehow holds on to a wild and uncontrollable punk, and we think about all this film, why this man stays with that idiot, let alone with the man first. Then the offender, who had not even committed, would recognize the witness. He would have come to them and from there. But then we wouldn't have a movie, would we? And why did the realtor even approve the extortion? There were more holes in this flick than my can. The action was terrible, the whole movie predictable for minutes and even the end. And so much could have been done to make it a much better movie. But if you have about 90 minutes to kill and don't have to use any brain cells in the process, this movie is just what the doctor ordered.
