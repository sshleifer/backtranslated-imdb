I saw the trailer of this movie before I look at Titanic, and I have to admit it threw my appetite. Volcano seemed quite remarkable and full of promise. But what is wet squib. Corny has no script word and testimonials are often ridiculous. The stupid daughter is just incredible - she should be 13 years old. 4. But then scientists, firefighters and peripheral characters are no longer offering. This movie is just in front of Cruise II and Twister, but only because these two movies are absolutely terrible. It has some sensible effects, but in general it is 10 out of 10. Don't waste your time
