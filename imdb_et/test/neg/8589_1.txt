I've never seen a more unrealistic movie than this unpleasant bait. Action was up. The direction was sticky and amateurish. The script was just a joke. The story was seen by a person who has never been in high school football, much less in a professional game. And why, why did Oliver Stone feel the need to be an actor in this film? He was terrible, ever playing an unrealistic listener. She couldn't even hire a professional wrestling contest. Then you have Jamie Foxx who throws like a girl. But he's more sporty than Elder Dennis Quaid. Seriously Stone wanted to direct this movie to 16-year-old men with ADD. This is why we hear loud music, fast cuts and many changes. It just became a bad MTV video. Shame on Al Pacino to do this mess. Cameron Diaz? Heck that no talent takes any role that pike falls. When Lawrence Taylor is the best "actor", your movie sucks! And that is.
