This is by far the worst film I've seen about Bollywood this year. I may not lie, my wife loved this movie very much. It wasn't Bobby Deol or Arjun Rampal that made this movie incredible, but it was Amisha Patel. He plays the role of a blind woman in trouble when he almost falls from a hill where (luckily) the hero Arjun Rampal can save him (somewhere in the middle). It amazes me here how the blind girl is aware of the danger when she falls from the mountain because she doesn't see her environment. From this scene I began to watch the film very carefully and there was a mistake in the action of Amisha Patel in each scene. The way she plays the dark girl is very bad. The only way he does this is that he doesn't have to look at the person he's talking to. When I saw this movie, I honored Rani Mukherje more with the movie "Black". Amisha never reaches that level as an actor. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he falls in love with Arjun Rampal. It's a clich√© story. Suddenly Arjun can kill a man who is in love with Amisha. Amisha is desperate, but Bobby enters the movie. She also loves a dark girl. Bobby Deol is a great actor from my point of view, but he can't pull the film to a higher level, where Amisha Patel bursts into the deep ground. I have to say that Bobby deserves better movies for better movies than he still is. Bobby grew from the first film his cute father gave him. He was so bad at Barajas, but when you see him acting now, you get trembling and believe every word he says. Only a high-potential film, such as Yash Copra's film, must follow its path. <br /> <br /> Well, if Amisha falls in love with Bobby, somebody enters her life. Arjun Rampal is not dead! Who believes in this mess? I do not. Why didn't they give their role to one of the ugly family members (Shushant Singh or Aryeman Ramsay) and did not give Bobby a role with Amitabh Bachchan as one of the blockers? I'm sorry if my comment sounds like an excuse for an actor like Bobby to give him a big role, but he deserves so much better than the movie Amish (bigscreen t.v. face) Patel. This movie was so terrible that I regret buying it.
