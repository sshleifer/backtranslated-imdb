A better film could have been done to portray Bosnia's tragedy. Some parts are very effective and the film gives a good insight to give some insight into people's suffering, especially for children, but in general it seems less like a documentary film. Woody Harrelson is very good, but the rest has worked well without being ordinary. You should watch out for an approximate idea of ​​what the war for Bosnian children did. If you are expecting a great and thrilling movie, welcome ...... disappointment.
