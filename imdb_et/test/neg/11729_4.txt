Dirty plot, a malicious script that is actually almost everything. The most robust result is Joanna Pacula as Lauren, but even it will not save this nonsense and nasty movie. The direct appeal of the director to the viewers is not only a suspension of disbelief but also a suspension of the judgment. <br /> <br /> Probably it is meant to be steaming and threatening, but although the film has erotic moments, they are a little and far away. Many others have done this. Don't go your way to see it.
