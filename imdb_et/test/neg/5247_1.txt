"Beowulf" is like a very bad game: characters, story, real dialogues, bad struggles ... This is probably the worst movie in cinema history. It's deadly boring, losing time. I am very sorry for Christophe Lambert who does not know how to choose the role of the role. If anyone wants you to see Beowulf, believe me: run like crazy.
