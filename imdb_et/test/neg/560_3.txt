A young spinster who does not associate women with his age and is under the watchful eye of a gentleman on a pension package, probably calls a quiet young man in his apartment on a rainy day. Nervous and overly polite to conceal his sexual uncertainty, he is very pleased when the boy makes his house home ... but not as happy as he slipped out of the window at night. Sandy Dennis is not an unhappy actor, but why did he attract these horrible roles, which I think we never know. Based on a book by Richard Miles that was as far away from commercial drama as possible, this delicate material not only drew Dennis, but also directed by Robert Altman (whose work is at best static). The narrative seems almost a collection of The Collector, which may have sold film rights, but which is not a cinematic good idea. Even the best sequence of the movie (Dennis buys a prostitute to satisfy his prisoner) doesn't really come down, Sandy is acting as sick as outraged (whose idea was this plan?). Michael Burns is quite good when a child who uses this frumpy, pasty woman just for his cozy digging, but Altman is being handled too gently, with a lot of strategically placed towels and underwear for muscle color (Altman was probably not a mature mature mature subject ). Sandy Dennis has a handful of very good scenes; he does not deliberately, he thinks before he speaks, and he is worried about his activities. Unfortunately, this role is self-evident, an obvious slide to the deterioration of the mental state that seems to be taking place outside the screen. Consequently, the steep finale is crazy and overall results are falling. * 1/2 from ****
