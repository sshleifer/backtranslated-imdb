I watched it mostly to see Charlie Ruggle and Una Merkel, two of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The plot has many twists and turns - it's not bad as a straight mystery on the train. > <br /> But why throw a circus train wreck and escaped gorilla? I can mention it without being a "spoiler", because the circus train wreck and gorilla have nothing to do with a plot of complicated mystery. <br /> <br /> A bad person trying to kill good people has many tricks in his loop, but the circus wreck was purely random. It allows one scene with a threatening gorilla, but then it is back to the mystery of murder!
