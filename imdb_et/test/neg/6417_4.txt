It's the worst job of Daniel Day Lewis ..... I can't believe he made this terrible movie in the same year and my left foot ..... Please stay away from this movie ... this is just a curiosity for Argentinians. .. It is impossible to understand the plot ...... The writer thinks that all people in Argentina are talking in English ... Of course, Patagonia brings a very good photo of the film from the movie, but this is not enough reason to see this movie. I repeat only if you are a fan of Daniel Day Lewis or if you want to see the southern part of Argentina, which is part of Patagonia, and you don't have enough money to travel yourself .......
