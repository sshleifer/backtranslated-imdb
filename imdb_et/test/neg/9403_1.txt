This is by far the worst film Al Pacino. There was no real plot in the movie. It has 24 different directions. The target audience of this movie seems to be people from anonymous gamblers.Mat Mcconaughey's character is not credible enough to be Pacino's demonstration. So he won some stakes for some degenerate clients as a by-product, which involved 900 jobs. Should it automatically convince the audience of their skills? It was just stupid to think. The Hague promised us to show how he did his fever, but after going through the whole film, I still can't see what skill he's ever had. If you want to try to look at Robert de Niro's casino casino, which is now showmanship. At some point in the film, Mati's character chooses his winning stakes on the coin flap. Someone could do it. Al Pacino seems to be talking a lot and I mean your face in dialogue. I think this style started with a woman's smell and worked for her because she finally won the Oscar, but now I think it's just irritating. He always seems to be sermonizing. He does this by depicting a man with unstable angina (this is an impending heart attack), which usually resembles his actions in divine 3, which he plays with aging, diabetic mafia don corleone, but besides that Pacino's talent is a wasted movie . Rene Russo is just an eye candy for this movie. She keeps her shape and shows it in the harsh clothes she wears. This movie is a common mess. Don't waste your money. The film is much worse than Mims' films.
