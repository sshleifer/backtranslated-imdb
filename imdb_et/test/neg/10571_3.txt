This movie is funny if you are a gentleman who sat about three lines behind me (repeating every punchline, laughing when there were no gags on the screen, and giving a gravel "haaaa" to every scene that includes a computer or mobile device) <br / > <br /> For all others, this is an exhilarating, comedy. The film follows strictly the formula of the later "Scary Movie" films, as well as the "Epic Movie" and "Meet the Spartans", though without the heartless references to pop culture, the latter two were annoying. However, the enlightenment of intellectual and peaceful numbers in the whole world makes it clear that the film knows its audience: the people who are envious of the brainstorming. The "Superhero movie" is especially and consistently disgusting for Stephen Hawking, introducing him as a sexual hunger drug and using his disabled car. <br /> <br /> The plot is based on "Spider-Man", "Batman Begins" and "X-Men" being thrown to get physical comedy. Much of the film is shockproof, but in no way lively or interesting. The longest running time is a fun joke, and early scriptwriters seem to believe that getting the main character is thrown at the pile of outstanding fake animals, which automatically increases the otherwise uninspired rehash of the Spider-Man spider bite scene. Perhaps the only redeeming feature of this function is the energy it contains, especially in other recent parodies. The filmmakers act as if they were doing something new and the audience can feel the impact of the actors on the screen. Extremely shortened lengths (about an hour and fifteen minutes) and presentation make Superhero Movie acceptable, not terrifying.
