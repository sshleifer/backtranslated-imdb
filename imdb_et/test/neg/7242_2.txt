The Salena incident is in Arizona, where six prisoners of death are transferred from a state prison for reasons that have never been explained while driving along a heavily armed prison ship bus arriving and the driver is forced to pull out of the way. Then two blondes will rise, and after attracting incompetent prison guards, they will be able to get better, six prisoners will be released, but their escape car will be damaged by firing, leaving them all in the middle of the Arizona desert. They decide to drive to the nearest town, Salena, several miles away and take the hostage with them. When they arrive in Salena, they find it strange that the place is completely abandoned, if not any other visible person. They will soon discover that the whole city has been killed by eating meat from foreigners and they are firmly placed in the menu ... <br /> <br /> Also known as Alien Invasion in Arizona USA DVD and probably titled Terror Town This Dirty Low Budget The sci-fi horror flick was co-written, co-produced and directed by Dustin Rikert and has no real redemption qualities at all, frankly Salena's incident is a film that gives the films a bad name. The film can be divided into two parts: the forty or fifty-minute-long opening focuses on prisoners who have been thrown into the thriller, guards and refugees, although it has been poorly written and staged. The dialogue between the two blonde birds and the prison guards is so bad that they are unintentionally funny because two suitable birds are talking to two not so suitable prison guards. Actually, funny things are, unfortunately, the Salena incident should be a sci-fi horror movie, not a comedy. When the escaped minuses and their prison guards arrive in Salena, it goes into a sci-fi horror regime when aliens arise and start killing our cliché character, which is good because they are annoying. Look, the whole movie sucks when it's poorly written, thoughtful and done. I can't really bother to go, but trust me Salena's incident is terrible at every level. <br /> <br /> Apart from being a bad, dull and stupid movie, Salena's incident is badly done. The scenes of the set of operations are terrible, foreigners are terribly looking and they are never shown on the screen at the same time as the character of a person and as such it is sometimes difficult to say what is happening. Special effects are also bad, aliens see garbage and CGI computer effects are also terrible. Editing is bad, cinematography is bad, kits are cheap and the whole thing is really outstanding. There's a little gore there, there are some blow wounds, somebody is ripped in half and there is a broken hand. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the low-budget Salena incident will be shot with low production values ​​and expects to quit cheaply from the start. Filmed in Superior Arizona. The actor is terrible from someone I have ever heard, although the female actor is pretty good looking. <br /> <br /> The Salena incident is a terrible sci-fi horror movie that is terrible. in any way, not 90 minutes from you, me or anyone else's time.
