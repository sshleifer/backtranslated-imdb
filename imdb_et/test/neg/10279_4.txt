"Electra Glide in Blue" is a slow moving B-flick in which Blake plays a motorcycle policeman in the desert who wants to be a killer detective and accused of investigating murder. At best, mediocre film "EG B" has some band members in Chicago, activities, some philosophers, and many and boring dramatic fillers. Not worth the time.
