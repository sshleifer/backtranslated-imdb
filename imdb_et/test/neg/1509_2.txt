Truly terrible useless garbage. This movie does everything wrong, except that the working time is less than an hour. Gore FX violates gravity and logic. There are no fears. Action is abysmal, with everyone looking at their rows. There is a surprise that is just stupid where we find out that things have not happened even. Boy I hate the end of the police! They put this thing out of people with a long drawn frame that doesn't do anything interesting (like putting on a make-up or talking that seems forever). Do they have to put out a movie that is less than an hour long? It's ridiculous. The story itself is quite thin. I mean, it's just a variation of APRIL FOOL DAY when I remember that movie correctly and that movie wasn't that big. The only good thing I can say is that it seems to have shot well. Too bad nothing happens that is very exciting.
