Okay, it's not possible to communicate. The plot was ridiculous, the assumption was ridiculous, the actor was uncomfortable, the effect was ridiculous and all the outdoor conditions were filmed in New York Central Park. That said, this movie had something I couldn't walk around. Maybe it was the atmosphere or maybe it was evil super-vixen or amazon wenches. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm not the one who sits on the margins and criticizes me for not having some of the redeeming qualities, so here they are. <br /> <br /> Violent withdrawal of female lib movement is depicted in the desert (of course, the central park) and all masochistic young men have been very impressed there. What's more, some scenes where certain characters lose consciousness are fun dramatically (you notice that I am writing dramatic rather than convincing). <br /> <br /> All I can say is that some people like B-movies and I'm one of them. If you're one of them, give it a go. Sir, Mr. Kincaid. It's one for the ages.
