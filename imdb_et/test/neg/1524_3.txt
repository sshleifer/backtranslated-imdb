I loved all of the other Don Knotts movies, but I didn't hear much about "drawing a drawing" and now I know why: I can't think of anyone who would like it. This film seems to be pleasing to 9 or 10 year olds, but even most of them would give it a thumb. At best, short light amusements, mostly from Don Knotts, play the same nervous, underdog person who made him famous. <br /> <br /> After finishing the movie, I was curious if my teenager could accept the film's deadly mistake. We were in full agreement: Prentiss Gates's sidekick character was even Dumber Knott's character. Be happy that Mr. Limpet, reluctant astronauts, Shakiest Gun and Mr. Chicken movies are enjoyable.
