Look, some movies are the worst. I recommend that it can be an Indian song. When I saw this movie in 1976, he played at Carnegie Hall, a place where he visited the movie a lot. About half a point, people just went out of the theater. My girlfriend won't let us leave, but finally the theater was almost empty. I told people when they left, "a good part is still ahead." And that was. The good part was at the end of the screen, which said "fin". That was the only good part. 24 years later, this movie is still annoyed. It was pointless, stupid and a derivative (Marienbad, part 2). Look at it only if you want to spend an endless two-hour study to distinguish only bad and just awful.
