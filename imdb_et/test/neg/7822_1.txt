I've never seen a movie that bothered me so much. This is a movie about foolish people who do stupid and terrible things. It's not a funny movie. I have to say that the plot line is terrible. I had no patience to see that I only saw half of it, but it was enough for me. The characters are not very inspired. Just terrible. This movie is a hard boy trying to connect his tyrannical superior to his daughter. When he finally manages to talk to him, he asks him to go to his home this evening to watch his father's owl, and he thinks he had invited him to go with him to the party and his home at 18.00. He's very disappointed to find that he only has to look after the owl and he has a boy. When his father leaves for precise orders leaving home, taking care of the house and his beloved bird, the secretary appears, the renegade son and nothing else inside the house. But he finally ends up with his boss's daughter. TRUST ME THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!
