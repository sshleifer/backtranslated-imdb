WARNING: I recommend that anyone who has not seen the movie yet read this comment. <br /> <br /> When I first started to watch this movie, I expect it to be a vampire movie that is fantastic given how Rodriguez and Tarantino helped make the movie. I started it for about 15 minutes and already my hopes for this movie were down the drain that shocked me. First, the story he hadn't had was in any case possible, and just slip into a boring and unreasonable point where I just wanted to turn it off. I was more frustrated because of this movie because it pulled on, but I think I had the hope that it would improve .... when it finally showed vampires, then BLEW MY MIND, very badly. I thought, "Okay, that this movie started with a somewhat modest story with these two criminals, it turned into a very vampire movie, which I thought it would be from the beginning, like in the last 30 minutes?" To add to this, they try to make the main characters all cool and awesome and mean the end if they just aren't; The rabbit would have frightened those signs! This movie is a terrible piece !!! From Dusk Till's threshold, I was ashamed and left my dreadful taste, tortured my mind with my head, and left my body unable to move from a terrible shock that I just wasted for 108 minutes on my life. I do not understand how George Clooney, Quentin Tarintino, Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, who are all good and respectable actors, could participate in this meaningless hell. In my opinion, since Dusk Till Dawn is one of the worst films ever made that I've been struck by. Don't see it, you're making yourself very happy ...
