Julien Hernandez is probably an attractive and pleasant screen staff. In fact, his character carries a lot of this movie or is worth it. The problem is that no one else even reaches, except for his gal palm (played by Marisa Petroro) and Paul Lekakis (trick / date / boy of some characters). Hernandez plays a 30-fold director of Cuban heritage and an unknown sexuality who arrives at L.A and works by making a gay documentary. During a meeting with geographic groups, when they find topics, he appears ... but very beautiful. Even after 88 minutes, the film is obviously stretched and cushioned by a variety of film school equipment, most of which stop narrative (which isn't much of a start) with just a meaningless interruption, or refers to making a movie for general amateurism. <br /> <br /> What a shame, because there is a love story somewhere here and the last three minutes when Hernandez Sebastien finally clicks on a rich West Hollywood competitor (nicely by Lonnie Henderson). share some sexy soul kisses. But we don't really care about any of the other characters or their situations: Why would a beautiful Dante girlfriend be in the Eurotrash Priss? He wouldn't. And even don't start with the rules of Sebastien's friend Paulie regarding the dating-no gay man I know, hell is not a reasonable person, a period that would not impose such constraints on myself or others. And please tell me how Sebastien gets a peeled banana (which is usually quite uncomfortable, right?), His ass closed and must go to the doctor? <br /> <br /> I noticed that Hernandez won the "short" award for this movie - it would probably have had to stay that way. All this said - I look forward to seeing Hernandez on the screen, in better scripted comedy, with a firmer direction.
