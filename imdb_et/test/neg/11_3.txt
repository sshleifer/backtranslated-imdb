Julie Andrews produces an image of her good two shoes in this superb music comedy drama, but when she approaches her role, she is alone. Blake Edwards from a woman who is both an entertainer of the music hall and a German spy during WWI doesn't know what kind of tone she wants, and Rock Hudson has a gratifying task to play a romantic second violin. Music tracks had grown in favor of 1970s and elephant productions like "Star!" and this film repelled Andrews' reputation, leaving a lot of dead space in his catalog until the "Tamarind Seeds" came. I have always thought that Julie Andrews would have made a big villain or a shady lady; his strong voice can draw attention and he hits some low notes that can be tempting or seductive. Man / director Edwards seems to understand this, but neither he nor Julie can work a lot on energy in this scenario. Sculptor William Peter Blatty is not a good partner for Edwards and no person is in the heart of this material. The Beatty Script offers Andrews only one fabulous sequence - striptease. * 1/2 from ****
