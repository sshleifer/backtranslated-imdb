It must be the worst film I've ever seen in Nielson. This movie is not just funny. I think the reasons why Naked Gun and other similar films are that they didn't demand Nielson's fun. He just played a role as straight as he was, while all the comedies that went on were mostly visual. But if you put him in a movie where he has to be funny, he's not. There was only one good part in the film and it could be considered a spoiler for some and the original loans were animated. If the whole movie was animated, it could have been good. I had no intention of seeing this movie when I saw the ads, and the only reason I saw it was that the tickets were awarded to someone who won them at a radio contest. This is the first and probably only movie I've ever been out of. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this film -100 scores.
