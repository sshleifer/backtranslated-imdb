What a positive story is, Dolph Lundgren leads the mercenary group to take over the tropical island, which looks like a paradise, so that the men who hired their team will get it into the feces of the birds. In fact, the nitrogen gas that comes out of the spider of this island is what they do after that. <br /> <br /> There was only one good thing in this movie - the location of the island where it was filmed was beautiful. Otherwise, the story will sink itself, leaving the actors to do something. The result: a lot of violence, a lot of language, a lot of blood and a few women from women. If you want meaningless violence (sorry, the story can't even make violence, though it's trying), it's a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Parents: warn that this movie is full of violence and blood, R-Class.
