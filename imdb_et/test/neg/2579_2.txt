Steven Seagal's intention is to be praised and his actions in this film are equal to many of his other people if you ignore the fact that he apparently represents a brilliant scientist. The problem I had was with two plot elements that stretched my disbelief to a stop after the break. <br /> <br /> First of all, how is it a carefully designed variation of an unpleasant germ that has to be treated as carefully studied and developed by large laboratories, treating you to drink flowers that grow high in the mountains? and that grandfather's family seems to be the only person who knows something about it? <br /> <br /> Secondly, and it really takes the cake: after having collected enough of the whole city, wouldn't it? Don't you expect the army to let the helicopter start and start the candy flowers in all the homes in this small town? No, they decide to spray the flowers all over the city and force the sick to go out and collect them again. It's just stupid, except when under the native religion, drug power is somehow dependent on having gone out and gathering flowers. <br /> <br /> Add the cartons to the carton's nature and title inappropriateness, and you may think that my vote for this movie is really great.
