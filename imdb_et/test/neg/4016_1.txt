"Independent" film, which on the back of the box allows you to twist, adventure and emotional adventure that we never forget. This film also tells us that we look at it in Rachel Lee's starring role in Cook. After the first twenty minutes you realize that this movie doesn't give you anything. The story goes on purposefully, revealing something new or important to interest us. All three "disturbed" characters have only small back races that force us to care. As you finally reach, all the story is about the story, and instead of helping the audience catch up, you have no idea, and more importantly, there's no interest in "why". The director, who thought he was good to celebrate, seems to have come to the film without any prior experience or knowledge of useful filmmaking. The whole piece looks like a college film made by a student of fantasy films trying to hide the lack of true talent.
