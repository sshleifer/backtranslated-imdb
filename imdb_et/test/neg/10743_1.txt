I had been enjoying the nightmare master until I came to a heap of manure from childhood. <br /> <br /> This anti-Bush propaganda cabinet, masked as a horror movie, comes as Michael Moore's original Batman episode. Political satire should be smart, but it pulls ten on a simple scale, with the style and credibility of L. Ron Hubbard's film. <br /> <br /> In camping and ugly, he blames Republicans for stealing elections, for absolutely no reason, and treating soldiers and women as mere cannons. It even takes another change and religion. All that was missing was Caesar Romero as president, who created fear of how he organized 9/11. <br /> <br /> I think the end was that we "support our troops", but I think they would be more confident than the whole effort. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Hollywood elites will sit in their Malbu mansions, who beat each other behind this "pithy" work, while false information is anti-war drones, this genius. <br /> <br /> The time when you have new flat hats installed.
