Jack Frost 2. The worst "horror movie" I've ever seen. Why? 1) The assumption is good, as ridiculous 2) The damn thing is not even for the feet! 3) It flees after it has completely subordinated Anti-Freeze (first film) 4) Get this ... It drives all the way across SALT WATER to TROPICAL Island to get revenge on the sheriff who made her first film. 5) "Killer Snowballs". I'm not drinking enough to see "Ginger Dead Man" so Jack Frost 2 is distinguished at the time of writing by being a stupid horror movie. Even surpassing this predecessor's unevenness (if you can believe it!).
