Looking at the ratings you expect, this is a classic, but yet another example of how poor independent filmmakers are trying to get their movie interested. In the case of votes, they are not even smart. I think it can be a curve and a balance of all 1/10. Is it better than any decent zombie movie? No. <br /> <br /> Action, messy and garbage. <br /> <br /> Sound effects, cheap and nasty if it wasn't where the actors saw you didn't know where it came from. <br /> <br /> Cinematography. These people act as they borrowed their father's camera right after looking at the matrix. Less is more, but more of this team is completely priest. <br /> <br /> Zombies are also garbage. I have no doubt that most of these people will never hear and that is a good reason. I hope the zombies eat their eyes because it was a 90-minute board that I can't get back to. <br /> <br /> And rating counterfeiting makes it a million worse. <br /> <br /> One reviewer said he was one of the best horror films he'd seen in the last 30 years? I can only assume that his recent corneal transplant was successful. <br /> <br /> See how the trailer is this warning about the badness of this movie.
