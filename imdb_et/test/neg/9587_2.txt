... why watch television drama (comedy) where no character is pleasant or even interesting? I can see what writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: misdirections and bad taste that he put "one mouth in the grave" and so on. I testify that the script made more effort than most British television. But really ... who cares for these people? Other posters mentioned the scene where the woman was sitting to watch her own and her dead ex-boy-shagging video. It was the moment I turned off this program, never to return. <br /> <br /> P.S. It is interesting to note that not all posters like this series are British, while those who praise it are mostly in other countries. This reflects the fact that when the BBC transmitted this series, viewers ignored them and dropped them like a stone. <br /> <br /> P.P.S. Good news for those who liked it! In the autumn of 2007, the second series is taking place - though without the men's leadership. The BBC seems to have decided to turn it into a more common 30-minute sitcom.
