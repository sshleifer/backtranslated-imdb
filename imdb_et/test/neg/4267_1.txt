I find that the criticism of many IMDb users is somewhat harsh and in many cases they find that they criticize the film from a very professional point of view, not a man on the street who wants to sit and look at something to get everything. In that case, however, I must say that it was BAD. I'm a sci-fi junkie and there was nothing in this movie that even grabbed me for one second. <br /> <br /> There was no right story. I can be an idiot, but I still don't know where the governments were, that these pieces were so concerned. <br /> <br /> The main character's pathetic attempt to bring these 3 pieces together is scary. Half of the time when two pieces were already in place, and he just had to add a third. A 3 year old child would have been able to put them together. <br /> <br /> This movie was BAD. <br /> <br /> Dominic
