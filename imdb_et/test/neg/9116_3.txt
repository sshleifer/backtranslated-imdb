Personally, I've been watching it because of Lea Thompson's appearance, and I didn't expect to enjoy the movie as such, but surprisingly I watched it until the end. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - it's just one of Saga's stories aren't very original or entertaining, but strangely keeps you on TV. My opinion of my own will would be much better if there wasn't one thing I just couldn't. <br /> <br /> There's a lovely and really lacking scene where Lea Thompson's character works on a street that holds the baby, snow falls, he's cold, scared, and he doesn't have a place to stay, he doesn't know what to do further. And then about 10-12 years later, when things get better for him, he leaves the same child without a warning to start a career. <br /> <br /> I just can't get it - I can't see how it might be doing it, it was the opposite of what it did in its life so far, what it did was aimed at child survival. After that sign I couldn't just enjoy the rest of the movie.
