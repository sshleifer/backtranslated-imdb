Light spoiler in second paragraph. <br /> <br /> Anna Christie was Garbo's first speaker. He and Dressler look like the only people who know what they're doing in this movie. The old man who plays Garbo's father (George F. Marion) in the movie is soooo ah-noying !! All he does is stumble in a completely broken way and hugs the "dat old dah-sea". He blames Garbo's "past", all his life and everything at sea! He comes over the fool x 10. Charles Bickford is Matt, the harsh 'n' drummer Garbo falls in love and he is good in his role but nothing really outstanding. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Garbo fires his "dreadful secret" at Bickford and his father. Finally, Marion stops talking about the evil of the sea and strikes her head and fists on Bickford. Then it will soon pass by the sea. <br /> <br /> I had to practice myself to complete Anna Christie. It is too melodic in many parts and colorful. There are many good early talks, but this is not one of them. If you haven't seen Garb before, try something else before Anna Christie, like CAMILLE or GRAND HOTEL.
