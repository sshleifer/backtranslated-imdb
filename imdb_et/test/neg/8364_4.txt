Last night I saw Prozac Nation's early preview. Because I love everything Christina Ricci first showed with great excitement, but as I continued to film, I wondered where it was going. Based on the real story, it's just Christina Ricci's character and her struggle with depression, drugs, friends and family, as you probably would talk about the title. In my opinion, this movie moved too fast and it was too dramatic. I would say that every five minutes there was a dramatic moment and the movie moved its life very fast and it didn't leave us any room for Christina Ricci's character. The performance of Christina Ricci was fantastic as always, but Jessica Lange distinguished the whole film, and I believe that the success of this film is all because of her and Christina Ricc. I would appreciate it from 4 out of 10 and I would recommend you rent it or read Elizabeth Wurtzel's books, which they are good and definitely worth.
