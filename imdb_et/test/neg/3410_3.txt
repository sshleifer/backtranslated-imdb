As a fan of science literature for a long time (long time), I always hated incredible plots. Unfortunately, most authors of science fiction for children do not show such respect to their audience. I always suspect that they think: "Children have to be fooled, so we don't have to strive". "Science Fiction (2002)" writer is no exception. The story is about a boy whom his new friends are spying on for their parents because they think parents are foreigners. As an intriguing idea sounded to me, so much I missed its realization. It seemed to me that the filmmakers had this one idea and tried to stretch it in a dark, stylish and carefully slow atmosphere for ninety minutes. The only thing left to me was the question of "how can they get out of this unlikely waste?" And then - bang - they didn't even try. So if you are looking for good entertainment for both children and parents, check out "Klatret√∏sen (2002)" instead.
