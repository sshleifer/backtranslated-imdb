I fully agree with Gregiga Ontario. I saw this movie today with a friend who later went to the theater manager and said to him: "It was probably the worst film I've ever seen." I've seen a lot of movies with this person and he's pretty forgiving, so I was really shocked. (The driver gave him a free passport!) <br /> <br /> I had a lot of humor in the movie (yes, the baked potato scene was at the top of the list!). My friend and I are white and we saw the film mainly with black audiences. After a while I thought I couldn't get this movie just because I'm white. Then I realized that no one laughed. Writing was bad; the direction was bad; timing was almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> There were some funny moments, there was just too much time between them. Even two of the aircraft were more fun than this, and it says a lot. <br /> <br /> I was so dazzled by Snoop Dogg Starsk and Hutch (like Huggy Bear) that I felt like I was enjoying this movie. No. <br /> <br /> DL Hughley was as usual, but his role was rather small. Tom Arnold had some funny moments as a "white man", but most other humor tests were far from the mark. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I was unable to give this movie a negative star rating.
