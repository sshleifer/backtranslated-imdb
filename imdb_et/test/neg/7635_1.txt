This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It's a thriller with a pretty ridiculous ending. I watched this movie, hoping for the best, and instead found something really bad. there were two actors in the film that I really like, Rebecca DeMornay and Antonio Banderas. Of course, they had a decent chemistry, but what? The premise of the film was a bad start and its performance made it even worst. <br /> <br /> Miss DeMornay is playing psychologist Sarah Taylor, who is trying to analyze the murderer of convicted sera whose defense soul is linked to several personality disorders. This will give you lots of tips on where the movie goes and the killer's identity. At the beginning of the film, he gets an unexpected visit from his father. It's been done in the 1990s, when a bad father was involved in Hollywood. This is another conclusion to the final conclusion. <br /> <br /> Mr. Banderas is playing a mysterious man named Tony Ramirez, who comes to Sarah's life. The first meeting and the first meeting between Tony and Sarah are so badly made and so convincing that it makes you think about how it even got. And there is a sequence where two of them should know each other that it is so gentle that it doesn't belong here. One thing I would admit was that there was a sexy scene that was very hot. Anyway, terrible things will happen when he arrives, strange packets arrive, things that fall off the wall that could kill Sarah, a case that says things are no longer normal. In general, the film seemed to be poorly designed, editing from time to time surprising and the conclusion was ridiculous. Another thing that hit me about this movie was the whole orchestra's music that played in the background. A finer musical result would have been better. I have to say this, no matter how bad the end, Miss DeMornay was very good in this order. It is sad that he never got first-class materials in his career. He is this rare combination of talent and beauty.
