Sadness was the feeling I felt after the darkness of the screen. The second was puzzled. Why should two tasted screen veterinarians like Matthau and Lemmon write a dirty project on this? I have the impression that they did not read the script before the cameras started running. Everything cast is wasted in this dishonest, uninteresting and impressive movie. Unfortunately, this was one of Edward Mulhare's most recent projects, hard on it. Dyan Cannon is trying, Hal Linden seems bored, Donald O'connor talks about a couple of lines that are full of contempt. (?? !!). I'm not under the "Correction Legion". My idea is that they were sprayed purely for his unusual listening. It's a desperate attempt to take "humor". In fact, he gave the film a unique entertainment game when he was knocked on the dance floor. I save my tougher criticism of managers. Walter Matthau should have felt better. She still offers great solo performances (IQ, Dennis The Menace, etc.). His character is rather boring and one-dimensional. He saw him once, saw him all. Jack Lemmon gives one of his own brand, "smart", "just too sensitive" to men's portraits. When he starts this mode, I want to put him in the box. OUT TO SEA is painfully uneven and anyone who has caused this confusion should do so.
