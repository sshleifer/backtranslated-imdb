When I first looked at this series, I had the impression that the characters were charming and funny, especially Lorelai and Rory were smart and intelligent chat specialists, though a bit too talkative. After a while, my opinion changed. <br /> <br /> The main characters slowly showed themselves as self-centered nervous nazis who proudly dealt with their small wounds as their worst offenses. For example, Rory would not talk to her mother for several months when Lorelai did not consult her during her impulsive marriage, while Lorelai's dumped Luke just wanted some time to adapt to her new living conditions. These people are low, see themselves as the center of the universe, where all others should behave exactly according to their own rigid rules, and if they do not, they will oppose them for eternity. They do not want to see other people's problems and deal with the smallest of the worst offenses. Most characters do not seem to be able to behave in an adult way. They think they should do everything they wanted, and everyone else should be fucking. <br /> <br /> The series is character-based, so when the main characters became so unlikely, it was impossible to see the show. I still have the rest of the series, but I doubt if I will stop watching them. I also have the greatest doubt that anyone who thinks that the exhibition and its terrible characters are very large must be as scary as Lorelai et al.
