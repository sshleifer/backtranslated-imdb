I only praise it in one part ... it was innovative. Innovative doesn't mean it's a good movie, that is, it gives you an insight into what you can take and apply in your movies. <br /> <br /> A simple plot is .. well .. simple. I got to the point where I don't care if they destroy the building or not. If I have to hear once again that the girl is annoying, I swear I would like to throw the DVD out of the window. And there is also the protagonist. They try to love her, but she's a freakin pervert! Girls' bra sniffing when she's naked, she slips with a smile, puts her bra on her eyes as she sleeps. umm) <br /> <br /> What irritates me is that nervous toning. In the photo gallery on the DVD you can see what the film was watching before they refreshed it and put it in color (also digitally). The film looked better at LOT without effect ... so they sacrificed it for a film just artistic ... bah. I can understand using such tricks when the film quality was nasty. <br /> <br /> I think most of the people who liked this movie liked it just because the chick was naked for 5-10 minutes. It's not comparable to Delicatessen (as many have tried). The delicacy has characters that can be accessed there, and like ... these people are just looting and strangling here. Finally, I would also like to emphasize that it was also old resins similar to the German impressionist film. One of the problems with most foreign, especially artistic films, is that they focus on making an artistic composition and forget about the "space" of the scene. The result is that the audience does not understand what is happening because they do not know the space around them. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's garbage. The DVD's short film "Surprise" was much better than heckuva.
