I watched a sci-fi channel when this steamy heap came. Although it is not as bad as Wynorski's "Komodo Curse", it sucks ... BAD. Wynorski uses the same island as "Komodo Curse", as well as the same actors and house. The effect is the upper limit (surprising), but it is ........ I don't know what else to say about this movie ....... oh yeah! Like the "Komodo Curse", the government participates and decides to bomb the island! Also .... when I saw this part, I laughed hysterically ... A KOMANBRA !!! (part man, komodo AND cobra!). In general, this movie is totally bad even for bad film standards. Remember, if Jim Wynorsk had nothing to do with the movie .... draw clear .... to avoid falling asleep, continue repeating "It's almost over ... is almost over ...". 0 out of 5.
