The first blow of the movie - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering through the reading threshold, so that the entire clich√© cinema has been developed to deal with the phenomenon of a woman's strong-minded journalism - I knew I was something Joe Wright seemed not only to read the book but regrettably misunderstood that what he was filming was not actually Jane Austen's subtle nuance comedy in the eighteenth-century English-language drawing rooms of alternating, gentle social interaction, but a sort of U-certificate in Wuthering Heights. So we treated us between every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy, which happened outside the visible cause, inappropriately harsh landscapes and often pouring. Not to mention that Jane Austen, especially P&P, does not mean passion, sexual tension or love. It is related to various strategies of negotiating the eighteenth-century society's stultification. It was completely ignored, so that Bennet's house was a terrible, chaotic place where everyone shouts at once, runs around, leaves their underwear on chairs and pigs run happily through the house; soccer balls become dreadful dances at the Matrix Reloaded dancing hill; and all say exactly what they think without meaningless. <br/> <br /> <br /> The genius of Jane Austen consists in exploring the space created by a society in which no one says what they think or think about righteousness due to overwhelming respect and the tragic failures of their characters are due to misunderstandings and misuse, which is allowed by this wordless divide. So Jane Austen's shine as well as the factor that makes her plots - especially in this movie - work is completely erased. In general, his film was not a nuance, sacrificed to a burnt-out drama that was completely material and performance. <br /> <br /> It was so obviously trying to be a * serious * movie. Humor - which is proud and unfair, both the Austen methodology and the appeal - was almost completely suppressed in favor of all this melodrama faced, and when it was allowed, it was so embarrassed. Pride & Prejudice is a serious story that makes serious points, yes, but these serious points and more serious issues are not simply intertwined with humor, they are built into it. You can't lose Jane Austen's technique, leaving only the bare bones of the story and waiting for the items to stay. Even when you replace your techniques with your heavy hands with mysterious numerical fauxbrow cinematography. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Bennett should be a woman, an adult, mature and sensible and clear. Keira Knightley played the first half of the film as a giggling schoolgirl with an empty head and on the other side as a schoolgirl with an empty head, who thinks she is a tragic heroine. Elizabeth's wit, her struggling verbal exchange, her main characteristic of seeing and laughing at everyone's fools, including her own, her strength and strength, and her fantastic clear vision was completely lost and replaced ... what? A lot of strangle and look far? Instead of being able to keep his head, if he loses his head, he started crying and yelling at the slightest provocation - and not really furious; no, these were tough lifts. And when Austen Elizabeth's great strength (at least in Austen's eyes) was his ability to maintain integrity and adherence within the boundaries of society and persisting uncertainly, Knightley Elizabeth had no agreement. In addition, he seemed to think that in the eighteenth-century version of barefoot mud in the mud, he undoubtedly was pleasant and vigorous and therefore did not like something like writing or performing, supporting it. Amazingly unpleasant and spooky performance. In the pursuit of bliss and weakness, he was very pleased with Matthew Macfayden. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, as Bennet, seemed weak, ineffective, and permanently exposed to evil humor and ironic separation at the expense of man, making Mr Bennet so exciting and tragic. His special relationship with Lizzie, as the only two sensible people in the world of fools, was completely lost, especially since both were fools in the world of fools, and it completely took away the emotional film. Mr Bingley was no longer friendly and meaningful to foolishness, but he played it as a cheap laugh to a complete slowdown, and Jane's woman was so wildly contradictory that she hadn't tried to do anything at all. The script twisted Jane Austen's verbal pieces, equipped with remarkable cowardice, and a completely simultaneous language that wouldn't be in today's romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> Just get BBC customization on DVD and save yourself heartache.
