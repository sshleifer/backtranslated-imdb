Umberto Lenzi captures new downhill runs with this recycled waste bin. Janet Agren plays a woman looking for her missing sister. It turns out that the sister is part of the Jim Jones-type religious cult in New Guinea. He hires Robert Kerman's shameful guide to help him in the jungle of worship. This is another (!) Kannibal film, and I would have liked it if not Lenzi padded this film with his boss "Man of Deep River" scenes. I mean, every cannibal scene is directly elevated from this movie, which I think will make it as reliable as Al Adamson. I felt hanged. *** SPOILER *** 1/2 stars and this is a dildo scene.
