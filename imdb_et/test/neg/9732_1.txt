The mainstream operator seems to want to make movies for teenagers, focusing on just one thing: gender. Don't make me wrong, I'm not a bride, but the fact that these people think my stones are on me is all that I'm interested in is very offensive. Take The Convenant, a movie that is so heavily dependent on finding your main characters if it thinks it can get a plot and / or script that hasn't been written for six years. It's essentially The Craft with (supposedly) hot guys. And yes, that's it. It missed me tears. Even my friend, who usually robs us, hated it. It is really amazingly bad as it can be funny. I would have laughed if it was not that many other women in the cinema felt they enjoyed it. They were accompanied by a number of bright boys who curved positively and died when the boy kissed (really cliche) at the end of the boy. Watching them was highlighting the film. I don't think the main stream, the Hollywood cinema, makes good movies for teens (or indeed for anyone) so I think I'll give up. If you are not a teenager who likes The Pussycat Dolls, Paris Hilton thinks it is "hot" and looks at MTV like a wasteland. Life is hard when you are fifteen, who likes an art house. :( P.S. Somebody should tell the director that not all teenage girls find the boy is the members of the band "completely HAWT LOL !!! 111 !!"
