I consider myself a big fan of low budget horror movies. The stranger and more imaginative the film is, the more blood and courage, the better and I really fall in love with the costly staples if they are properly made. Luther starts well enough ... in his circus of origin, in a creepy run, an old woman's attack, and the worrying occupation of a woman's farmhouse made the mood nice. When a woman's daughter and her daughter's boy reach the house, hot sex / shower is created. When Luther steals the motorcycle riders, the film gets worse. <br /> <br /> Characters have many ways: A) Save your loved ones, B) Get police help, C) Escape or (most importantly) D) KILL LUTHER !!! I don't know empathy or fear for those characters who are too stupid to help themselves. Quarries slip the chance to handle weapons and knives when Luther is out. Finally, a policeman who is equally ineffective when Luther is stopped, though at one point Luther is a butterfly, but at Luther's stapling, and he does a Polish dance dance. I found myself without training on the TV: "Make sure he's dead!", "He went out!" Or "Just kill him already!" <br /> <br /> Luther is a bloodthirsty savage, but he is hardly a Hannibal Lecter. If you can't overcome this egg, you deserve what comes to you. After halfway through the film, you are so widespread with the fate of the semi-finished products that only the sick curiosity will keep you lasting lightly until the end of the fun. This movie was celebrated as one of Fangoria 101's biggest films, which you have never seen ... well Fangoria is half-better for Luther Geek.
