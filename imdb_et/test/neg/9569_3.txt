Well, I saw this movie during the last San Sebastian Film Festival. The answer to that was ... we say as funny as the movie inadvertently. It happened that they showed a copy with terribly wrong Spanish subtitles. They seemed to be a translation from Chinese into English and then into Spanish. It was all confusing, the sexes were changed (girls were boys and boys as boys) and my friends and I remember the big lines ... but because they were so absurd. All in all, it is not a good movie, but if they ever show on the TV and you have nothing to do and if you want to laugh (again not so much movie), go ahead, the "visible secret" is your movie.
