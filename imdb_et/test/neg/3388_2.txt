I would like to know who the producers of this film have paid for their production - this is a genius. This movie somehow kept the attention of about two-thirds until I realized that it wasn't going anywhere fast. I think the music managed to feel like something happened, but nothing really was. It wasn't scary. The dialogue was poorly written. The first 90 minutes should have covered about 15 minutes. It would have been a moderately acceptable Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episode. <br /> <br /> Here I am just crazy that I was wasting all this time. It's a couple of hours that I will never get back. <br /> <br /> I hope these comments will save someone's waste of time. Take the sun or hit the gym. Or, if you want to be scared, turn on the cable TV channel.
