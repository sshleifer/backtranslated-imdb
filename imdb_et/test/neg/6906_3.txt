I took my 4 year old twins to see this movie today and I do not recommend it to children at their age. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of fighting scenes in this movie that I found too violent and my children found scary. <br /> <br /> The theme was over the heads of my children and the scene of death was too scary for children. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because we all expected it, but it just didn't cut it. If you have children under the age of 7, I do not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The whole thing also made me crazy during the movie.
