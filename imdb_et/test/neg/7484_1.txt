Often, I don't feel strong enough to post anything from a movie. But it was just the worst film I've ever seen. The performances were at best ridiculous, in the worst case they were good, there was no other word, terrible. Especially the leading women who are sexually random must be seen and heard. To be honest, the plot is pointless, dialogue is terrible and characterization ... is missing. I'm surprised that this is not Alan Smithee's film. I can't emphasize it enough ... to avoid it at all costs. It is not the budgeting of this very, in the worst form.
