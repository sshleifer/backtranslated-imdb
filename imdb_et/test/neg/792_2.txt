I thought id was checking this movie because I'm currently making a movie in a mysterious box, so it would be nice to see how this film took and developed the idea of ​​a mysterious and unexpected box. <br /> <br /> I was expecting this movie very much before going to the cinema. with actors such as Cameron diaz, you expect to be especially big. the actor was a one-off movie, the accents of the character changed throughout the film, making it incredible. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a strange box that can make your dreams come true, but destroying others is such a brilliant story, but I feel the director is putting it down, this movie was potential that it could have been much better when it was. <br /> <br /> This movie was not in the middle of it. it was too confusing and needed a constant story. No one wants to go to the cinema and think about what I just looked at: "I didn't get it at all," sometimes it can be exciting and people want to look at it again, but this movie ever made people ever want to hear the movie again. During the entire viewing, I noticed that half of the viewers had left before the end. I feel that every single person was allowed to watch this movie because of high expectations and slow parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The bad points on one side allow ... the scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end. it was unexpected, reminded me of a horror film, and how it was assembled made me imagine and how devastating and frightening it would be in that position. Lighting and effects showed it great, this scene seemed a little more than in the 1990s, when this film should be. <br /> <br /> This movie was confusing because it had so many different bits. parts that you should agree at the end, where everything is clear, but it was not, it is totally in conflict with the audience's expectations, though leaving the film on the rock hangers, giving the audience a reason why things happen and work really well, but that wasn't, it was creative, different unusual film, which I thought he had the potential to be better, disappointed not to enjoy it, not to buy it on DVD.
