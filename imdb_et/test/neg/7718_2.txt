The terrible, boring zombie sequel is just a little better than Uwe's terrible first film. It consists of a group of soldiers who go to a zombie afflicted college university to find some type of blood that could help find the infection to treat. These soldiers are your typical sheep for slaughter and none of them are pulled out (or at least not very interesting) so you don't feel sad at the stomach mine when they are destroyed. The film has typical zombies that bite people and blood splashes. It even has the same munching in the gut. It just doesn't do anything for the zombie genre to give it a memory. And the story is at its peak and ridiculous. One wonders how two people can get into the zombie army and not get a little (because they are the main stars who always seem to be leading the escape), while others seem rather light. The only motivation for the film is to show that people get a little bit of something else. Just go see the permanent effect of Romero movie.
