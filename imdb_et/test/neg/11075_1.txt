I love movies ... and rarely do I see the movie I hate ... but it was the worst movie I've ever seen, or at least near it. Every movie that ends with a rape scene is terrible. Hands down ... I can't believe I spent 2 hours of my life watching this movie. I'm very crazy, I want my money back and my time back. ATTENTION! Don't look at it, cinematography is terrible, the plot is terrible, the end is terrible. I didn't know what half of the film was going on because I didn't see it (and I was watching a very nice and big TV) Rent saw, the mountains have eyes or a wax house ... any of them are better than you want to be scary.
