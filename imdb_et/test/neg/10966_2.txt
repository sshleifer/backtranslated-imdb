In the trailer of this movie, the zombie genre promised a new twist: setting it in the old west. Of course, this is not quite the old west. It's some Future West, a world where the apocalypse is, because it is known that the apocalypse people are killing and then making them zombies. This is the time of zombie virus, people, and you know what that means? Get bitten and become one of them. <br /> <br /> So, a hero comes to this dusty and dead person. He is a hunter who has paid for taking care of zombies. It is not quite clear who is providing the funds, but it seems that a small zombie hunt has appeared. But as the trailer says, there is a problem. They're running out of zombies. The only way to earn is to infect new birds with the virus. <br /> <br /> I think it's not a bad idea for a movie. But unfortunately it takes a lot more than a good idea and a crowd of people attending windows to make a good zombie movie. What we actually get is the Clint Eastwood clone (even actor Clint, for crying loud) and his "fun" sidekick, trying to get the zombies into the bags, leaving some still living bad guys to get great benefits. The entire sub-block of infecting other cities is mentioned only by passing, more than half of the film. Instead, there are many Western movie clichés, bad zombie makeup and some world-class bad actors. Really bad. That's not even Hollyaco. Both hero and villain chig from cigars, quips thrown, people bite. When the film tends to agree, the only thing worth thinking about is whether it ends when the hero's cliché is the only living person who killed one that he loves, or his cliché that becomes the ultimate zombie frame. (This is the first, by the way) This film is written and directed by Gerald Nott. This is the only thing he has done and hopefully his last one. At the beginning of the movie, there is a title that says "Nott Entertainment". At least they got one thing right.
