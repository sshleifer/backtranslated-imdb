Emperor's new Groove was very difficult for Disney. It wasn't musical! It had clean, fresh jokes and political twists. It was just a funny funny movie. <br /> <br /> Kronk's new groove, on the other hand, is tired and weak. My three-year-old still loves the Emperor's new groove, but fell asleep during Kronk. There really is no real conflict (that all the hostile adventures in the first movie). Due to the lack of conflicts, it seems almost like that the animators threw the writers out and made the story when they passed. . . and still am.
