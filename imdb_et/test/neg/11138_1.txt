I think the trash really sucks. I looked at it a few weeks ago and I haven't seen such a c ** p movie by John Waters' female Trouble and it was even worse. Dialogues, acting; it is really bowed down, it was so bad that it made me leave the cinema and ask my money back. But I'm really glad I saw it because then I can say my honest opinion. This movie should be seen though it smells.
