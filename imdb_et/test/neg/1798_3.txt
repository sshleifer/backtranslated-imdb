It wasn't exactly what I had been expecting to pick up a crap from Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness'. Although the film is based on one of the most researched and interesting texts in history, the film became just that. The story can never understand the viewer. It's just as indifferent as it is. <br /> <br /> Traces of text are easily noticeable, but it is not actually Conrad's "Heart of Darkness". The script by Benedict Fitzgerald (who also wrote "The Passion of Christ") simply uses Conrad as inspiration and thus becomes "The Heart of Darkness" by Fitzgerald. The film is not just worth it if you are not particularly interested in Conrad or John Malkovich.
