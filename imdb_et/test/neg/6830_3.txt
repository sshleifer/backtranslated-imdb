I would be tempted to watch this movie, it's just dull. The characters are predictable and meaningless. The assassin is quite unreliable. There is no tension, fun, style or even originality in this train wreck. And the morale of the Hollywood clich√© is warm. Oh, and you have a movie that makes an IRA terrorist hero. Cute. And now I have ten more rows to do. And a little more? Not exactly how now? No, well the further confusion should do the trick, but Jack is not really worth the ten exposures. The original was great.
