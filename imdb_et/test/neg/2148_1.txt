You know that you have a bad movie when you hear that the soundtrack is played entirely with one cheap programmable synthesizer without melody or rhythm. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see how someone can do a movie seriously, even giving it a bad overview. This movie is "bad" below. <br /> <br /> The consistency of this movie is extremely polished. In one fight, the hero (wearing blue and vests) is in his hand in the corner with two revolvers; he doubles, only now he has two semi-automatic machines. he turns to another corner and now he has an automatic rifle; he travels along the corridor and comes out (suddenly dressed in a standard army fatigue) with a shotgun gun; after that he leaves the building with another automatic rifle. Or here's one for books - the bus slams into a high-speed car; the car is going to fly, throwing a giant explosion - cut into a bus that is completely undamaged due to the same explosion? Narrative continuity suffers equally from the numb feeling of unreality; bad guys really want to kill the hero - apparently - but every time they knock on him or otherwise get into a vulnerable situation, they suddenly decide to want him "to live to see it!" Ah? One of the funniest moments of the film is when the hero is released from isolation because his lawyer has seen him; then a bad man decides he won't let the two meet; and despite the fact that the villain, the hero and his lawyer know all that is happening, so the hero writes a note to the lawyer and the next one will see that the second prisoner will hand over the lawyer, even though we never look at the hero for him. (This attorney, BTW, has full access to California-based ATF offices, including confidential computer files.) Huh? Well, but this is a pointless action film - so how are the scenes of the acts? Not bad, surprisingly; unfortunately they were stolen from about ten Hong Kong films made five or ten years earlier. The open scene, shooting in a junker garage, is actually shots whose composition is stolen directly from "hard boiled" - so clearly it is a miracle that John Woo did not complain about plagiarism. Other Hong Kong movies have been stolen by "Prison on Fire", "Iceland on Fire", "Burning Paradise", "Police Story" I, II and III (aka "Supercop"). I thought I also had a few Sammo Hung clips here. In other words, the action scenes are exciting only to the extent that they are a successful repetition of the scenarios of other movie activities. <br /> <br /> With this movie, nothing can be done if one does not joke and just needs a lot of visual stimuli that do not have to make sense. <br /> <br /> Very funny movie, for all the wrong reasons.
