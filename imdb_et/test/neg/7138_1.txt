What a terrible movie. This movie was so working and so hard to follow. It was so hard to follow and was just confusing. All the time I watched it, I wanted it to end! I felt like I was wasting 2 hours of my life that I would never get back. Save your money and don't rent this movie. I see now that Sarah Michelle Gellar was barely in the movie. The first film was great, but it just sucked. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Save your money and look at the trailer as it is the only thing worth seeing with this movie. There was no real story on this film either. I still don't know what I was looking at.
