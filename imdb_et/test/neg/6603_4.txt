I hit La Bandar because he joined Jean Gabini and Julien Duvivier, whose Pepe le Moko is a noir masterpiece. I give him some points because Gabin is in it, but the clumsy plot, the cheap kits and the ridiculous Annabella, like an Arabian princess, put the movie on my "sell" shelf. When you look at it, you will find yourself wondering why idiots did not build a bird around the well * instead of a few meters away. And why use tin roofs in the middle of the desert? Then, the failure of the contest that creates the script should torture you with any further thinking.
