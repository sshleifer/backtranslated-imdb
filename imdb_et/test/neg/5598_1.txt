It was made in 2004 for the gods that happened to our modern special effect? What happened to our rough edges, but still with good actors? The participants in this movie were incredibly horrible, there were one or two that were not bad, but the rest, biggg thumbs down. Couldn't listen to poorly written dialogue, I mean, who the hell wrote this script? Please never write again! Special Effects? Don't even get me some special effects. HEALTHY, they would have been able to get out of the eye sockets better when they were looking for green light balls completely wrong. It looks so old and ... not honest. Even the easiest thing to look at is teeth, they saw so fake and fools that I almost tear my eyes. Come lucky I don't think it was even shown to the public!
