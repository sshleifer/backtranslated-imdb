This film has serious doubts as to whether Armando de Ossorio was a good filmmaker or not ... His BLIND DEAD films are praised by many fans. I understand that. But woth-be Gothic vampire trite, like MALENKA, does not show signs of talented filmmakers. This also applies to SERPIENTE DE MAR. It includes terrible action, a foolish plot, foolish events, many other things you can expect from a bad monster movie and a veteran actor Ray Milland who does his best to beat his movie, but who doesn't have much clue what to do he does this. Apparently, Milland was already very sick when taking SERPIENTE DE MAR (his last theatrical film) and went out with a ridiculous stinker, which makes it even more sad. The last look with Peter Cushing's TV movie, staged by Roy Ward Baker (also in 1984), doesn't change much. <br /> <br /> But the sock doll / sea scream is a hoop look. See that it turns the beacon up and crush it. See it by destroying the port of a miniature boat. Watch it demolish the bridges and pound on the charming miniature trains. <br /> <br /> Good bad? Yes, yes. 3/10 and 7/10
