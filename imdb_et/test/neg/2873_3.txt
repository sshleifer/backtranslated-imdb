wow ... I just watched this movie ... American people have such a stereotypical view of Hindi movies as all Indian movies are dances, songs, and a love story .... His pathetic how far from this truth is. This film simply expresses a stereotypical attitude towards Hindi films. Terrible, terrible direction, terrible cinematography. And all this by the Hollywood director. Most Indian films today are much more substantive, realistic, touching and meaningful than this cute piece. Indian cinema (not just Hindi) also covers various topics. Just like most other Hollywood movies, it shows a very stereotypical view of another country where the truth has been thrown out of the window. This is a highly recommended film. Instead, watch good Hindi movies such as black Friday, eclava, omkara, khakee, awarapan, gangster, don, zakhm, dor, sholay, mother of india, lagoon ... These movies are the real Indian cinema.
