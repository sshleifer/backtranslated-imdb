The business leader has been kidnapped for miles and miles away for forests to exchange days and days for a dialogue with his abductor. And we have to listen to all the mess ...... <br /> <br /> In the meantime, her funny wife and family are at home with the FBI, who knows what to do ...... never seems to be worried about the fate of her husband, except when it comes to ransom ..... "Love Story"? Give me a break! <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous. And almost every scene is full of hope that something important happens, but it's never. <br /> <br /> The robbery is predictable and stupid, and it will become even more stupid if we learn the fate of the abductor. <br /> <br /> It's garbage: <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10.
