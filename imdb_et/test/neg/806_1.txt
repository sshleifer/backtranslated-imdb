who is responsible for these things behind the scenes? who are these participants? did they climb out of the rocks? "yuks, a lot of yuks!" no. I'm not yuks. only sad and shame that i am a human being. I must avoid my eyes from the device, it is so embarrassing. actually i changed the channel. <br /> <br /> I've always had a problem with robin williams' non-stop. I forgot my lithium today, but at least it is a funny blue month. Looking at someone who is not funny, Robin Williams deserves to be slowly and sadistically drawn with his head, like any tooth, without Novocaine, forever. <br /> <br /> Please stop making these absolutely terrible TV movies. please.
