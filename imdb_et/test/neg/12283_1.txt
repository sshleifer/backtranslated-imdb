One of the worst films I've seen this year. All of the screaming movies "AMATEUR". For the film of the 19th century, everyone is talking like the 1990s. Working, especially people playing white slave masters, is terrible. After about an hour I went out of the movie. What a waste of time and effort. For a much better movie on this topic, see Steven Spielberg's much better Amistad.
