In terms of historical accuracy, it is the absolute worst film I've ever seen in Rome. The list not only of errors but of flat ideas of impossible plots would last longer than three hours of film, but only to give you an idea ... <br /> <br /> Julius Caesar and Augustus are presented as Liberal Democrats, "People" against "nobles". This is obviously absurd. The Kaisers were as noble as you got. Their interest was to strengthen power and stabilize a country that was 150 years of civil war. Reformers, especially Gracchi brothers, who lived about 100 years earlier and somewhat supported the rights of ordinary citizens. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that are completely ridiculous when you know something about this period. "Cleopatra", along with Richard Burton, gives you a much better idea of ​​how events have opened, fantastic, though it is. <br /> <br /> Historical accuracy is one thing. Action and dialogue is something else, and here this film is very dangerous if it is a bad university production. I crushed several times to laugh, especially when Julia, daughter of Augustus, meets a lover. They bind passionately as he breathes: "My dad ..." "Ah, your dad, your dad .... your dad doesn't agree." Peter O'Toole is in his worst position, forced his way through pompo and stupid lines. An actor who plays Augustus as a young man is such a nebbish --- and the character is written as such --- it is impossible to imagine him as a cunning, insidious, Machiavellian politician who has created the Roman Empire. Here he is just a bow to say what to do most of the time. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Rampling is able to stand up for a written role, like Livia, Augustus' husband, with dignity. If he had been given a more complete role, he could have saved that production from absurdity. <br /> <br /> There are some nice photography and battle materials that have been helped by many CGI standard issues. Strangely enough, it was made for British television (and it seems to be British-Italian co-production) but labeled "R". <br /> <br /> The DVD image is great and the Dolby Digital soundtrack is great, though you will notice it only in a few steps, as the movie is mostly spoken. <br /> <br /> Almost all Roman films, even "Cleopatra" or "Roman Empire Fall", are more historicity --- something to say convincing drama --- than this odd Classics Illustrated, Jr Customization. It gives a new meaning to the much misused phrase "Based on a real story." In that case, they could have said, "Actual events."
