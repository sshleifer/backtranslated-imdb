Now this movie is the worst I've ever seen! It's just a disaster. I think it's really a sick movie, I'm just wasting my time watching this cheap mess. I can't believe anyone would bring such a catastrophe. Such a waste of money and time. There is nothing to learn from this movie, it's just a hollow torture of the sick. I don't think they could have made it worse, this movie was just the king of the lowest nonsense. Action is a disaster, meaning ... oh, there's no meaning just the sick pain and the sadness that the child who suffered at the end of the movie caused, and the murder of a woman that was another stupid blow to this movie. Do it yourself if you actually have some self-esteem, keep it away from this terrible!
