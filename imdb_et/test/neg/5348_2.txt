So many great actors, so little worth. But with a script that changed so much from the book, it doesn't leave it on anyone's screen. Though it was faulty, this was one of Grisham's only things I really liked, especially how it created the taste of a deep southern small town, a slightly different world, like myself as a coastal urbanist. I also loved the factuality and naturalness of the book. In the film, the characters have been given a "nobility" of personality that seemed so blunt. Roses and films are flat and 1-dimensional. But as many of Joel Schumacher's works, authenticity and authenticity are clearly visible, and each point must be delivered to the silicon section. So preachy, stylish, and superficial so terrible tragedy, I wish someone would remake and get the story a little better.
