I saw this movie in the cinema. At that time, I was working on shifts and went to a summer summer day when I couldn't sleep. The cinema was air conditioned. <br /> <br /> It was an early multi-screen complex and I was somehow wrong. I was going to let someone else out. But when things came out, there would be no sleep. Shortly after the beginning of the wrong film, I was still disturbed by a group of female cleaners who came and used it as their social club. I was the only other person, and this is the dimension of the film's appeal that they assumed the place was empty and asked me if I was thinking of their presence. I didn't. <br /> <br /> In about half an hour, the cleaners talk turned out to be more interesting than the entertainment I paid for. <br /> <br /> This movie was out of screen with very slow mayonnaise. That's a little dark, furry, tufted on the surface. I especially remember that my senses have been attacked by music lines that blur very little warning and even less meaning. The cleaners offered the foreword by placing their fingers in their ears. <br /> <br /> It was about a bird town living on sticks on the back of the load, putting them straight, but at the same time taught a moral lesson or two. Like you. A 'discovery trip'. The whole production was passionate. Above all, the leading actor's irritating habit of staring at each hick with some intense compassion, as if he were a thick patron saint. <br /> <br /> And I believe at some stage that he wrote a book. <br /> <br /> Long before the end, I was fascinated by a detergent that was abandoned and breathed for sexual abuse. <br /> <br /> One suspects that there are some who sit quietly for a few hours and do not have to think, is a meditation. The best thing I can say is that I don't want to share my salad. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a movie that is advertised on television that surprises me. This is exactly what the afternoon is being screened to punish the unemployed for lack of jobs. <br /> <br /> If you ever work in shifts, be sure to get to the right theater. Or I hope some women cleanse.
