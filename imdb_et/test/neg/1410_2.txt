I was a little waiting for the man of the year, a couple of girls in my work said it was a pretty good movie, and my mother said she liked it so I waited for a rent and looked at it yesterday. I must honestly say that this movie was a big disappointment. I barely looked at it because, frankly, the start was pretty good and very good, but then it went too dark and not the movie I saw from the trailer. It seemed like a good comedy, then it turned into a very dark drama, it wasn't even that interesting considering how many of these northwest have been on government conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Tom Dobbs is a very popular comedian with top competitions, and he has an action where many people want him to get involved with politics, just because he seems to have a good grip on what should be improved. So she does it, she runs during the presidency, but many people doubt she can win thanks to being a comedian but she won't win! But Elenore Green, who takes care of all the votes, is trying to fix the computer, but when the government tells her not to fix it, they try to get rid of her and Tom will soon realize that it may not have been her job. <br /> <br /> The actor was good, the direction was OK, it was just a story that I didn't think was working. As I said, it just turned into a dramatic change in genres, because if you see a trailer, you think it was a comedy and when you start watching it, you get it, but then it just becomes a dark and somewhat frightening drama. I wouldn't recommend this movie, it was one of the biggest disappointments I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 2/10
