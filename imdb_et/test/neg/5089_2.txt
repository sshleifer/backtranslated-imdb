wow, i just got it looking. <br /> <br /> How CRAPPY is posted on this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not doing you, I would have literally done a better job. <br /> <br /> ALL post production is faulty, all. Anyone who cuts this movie should be banned from the film industry. <br /> <br /> This is to ignore that the script was on a train drop. absolute messy. <br /> <br /> Not to mention Jack Bauer and his Patchy the Pirate with spongebob accent. WTF is his character there? But for me, the biggest mistake was character formation, interaction, dynamics, dialogue. WOW. I can't believe how bad it was. <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie out of 10 out of 10. For Samantha, who is a great actor, too bad output did everything that everyone looks like amateurs. /> <br /> another 1 goes to cinematography, which was really good. <br /> <br /> If my friend, this is one bad movie. <br /> <br /> Even feeling a complicated post about it, it was just terrible production. Poor participants, didn't know what they got ...
