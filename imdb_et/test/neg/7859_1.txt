"Heaven Can Wait" is a crushing core and a mischief covered with candy. I can't imagine anyone other than film students sitting today. Don Ameche is in almost every scene and although he has a mellifluent voice that undoubtedly contributed to his successful career in radio, he has no charisma to carry this film. Ameche plays female Henry. Lubitsch wants to make Henry's sexual incontinence divine and amusing, and so drives Ameche to play this part as boring as possible. The combination of the lack of charity of Ameche and the fight against the weakness of Lubitsch leads to a leading character who is both deadly and boring. You wouldn't want to spend time with this man; he made you fall asleep. You won't leave her alone with her daughter, regardless of her age. Something horrible happens. <br /> <br /> The film's appearance is quite boring. The scene scene is made up of static, over-lit diorama-style shots that are dressed in gold-plated stuffed shirts and bustles that are located in the busy Victoria premises. There are so many freckles and cuddly and curlicue, so many purple and sky blue and pink, you need Dramamine. sweet little bow on top. The content of the message and its contrast is poor. One of the film's most disgusting scenes, the older woman is sent to hell because she is not physically attractive.
