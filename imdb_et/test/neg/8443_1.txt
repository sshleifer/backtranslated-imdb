I got this purchase seriously. Other posters cover the shortcomings of this poor poor movie quite well. On my DVD, which I bought, in 1978, Piranha's poster art was on the cover of the film "headed by Joe Dante" and so on. I was very disappointed to find the wrong film on the disc. I'm actually a lot of bad movies fan. Most of them always have something funny or at least fun. Not that movie! I am actually going to spend three dollars on gas money to return this two dollar DVD on this particular principle. Here's the wrong package. Just the worst movie of all time. There are no redemption factors at all. DON'T !!! Not even worth seeing how bad it is. Seriously.
