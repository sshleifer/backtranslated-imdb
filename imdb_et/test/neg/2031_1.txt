Somewhere in the US, young Clair manipulates with his friends Mic, Billy and John, showing a letter Bob sent to him, and a group of cowboy beats Bob and Mic kills him in a wooded forest. Mic knows sadness and decides to tell his mother what he did, but John and Billy are threatening him with tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> I believe "wind" is the worst film I've ever seen in my life. The scary scenario is ridiculous and it is almost impossible to write a summary because there is no story or plot but sequences of isolated scenes. Amateur direction and action are amazingly poor and terrible. It is incredible how producers invest in litter money, distributors distribute it all over the world and viewers like me buy this DVD. I was waiting for the last scene because I was curious about how bad this film might be and I was impressed because it is worse than I imagine my lowest expectations. Finally, I doubt why IMDb does not offer zero in the voting system, because the waste deserves this vote. My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Forvisa Force" ("Invisible Force")
