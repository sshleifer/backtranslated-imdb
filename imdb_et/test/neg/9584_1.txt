This is a sharp film, a contender for the genre of surprising films. And the genre that has been done so much in the past. There is a predictable end next to the plot. (Yawn) The characters are unlikely and some are so unlikely that they are almost unobtrusive. Fine, intense actor Matt Dillon is here completely uneven and stiff and clever. Others are forgetting. Much of the dialogue is sophomoric, again a pretender who is trying to be witty. I do not hire a scriptwriter to write my list of food items. Yes, it is so bad that just goes from gross failure to normal gross, as is the case for the gross and gross. With so many real talents out there, I'm surprised that this movie has ever been made. It shows the complete lack of imagination of office furniture ...
