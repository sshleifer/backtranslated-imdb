Initially, I tuned to Paranormal State because (more or less) I find the paranormal search genre an interesting television, if nothing else. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy Ghost Hunters because more than half of their investigations lead to full debunking and find the most haunted fun media and frumps British women whom Paris Hilton's day-to-day blinds out of fear / demons presence, all of which are struck in a beautiful night vision in green. <br /> <br /> Paranormal The state has no complaints. It seemed to be connected with the loudness that Ghost Hunters rejected. Episodes varied from trailer trash and single mothers whose mother-adolescents sat and scared themselves, "interview" with a 5-year-old monster living in his room (the monster goes to the RAWRRR, we are told). All these people invite the college club to solve their problems. The whole show is related to Ryan and his partner, his enormous ego. He leads his troubled-eyed group, unless the case is considered "too extreme" and ordered to stay in the hotel HAHAHA. Better leave it on the pros, ie yourself. <br /> <br /> The involuntary comedy of this exhibition is all about being cunning. Ryan spins his stories to hunt, follow, etc. What he first met when the Catholic Church hired him to help. Sorry, but there are people in the Catholic Church who can do it, they don't need Quiznos daycare to chip their 2 cents. <br /> <br /> This show is terrible, shame A&E went bankrupt by stupidity, trying to follow some of the better paranormal issues. It's almost unintentionally funny, except that Ryan is so arrogant and charismatic that viewing is long enough to mock it.
