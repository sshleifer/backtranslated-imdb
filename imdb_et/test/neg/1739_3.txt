Okay, let me start by saying it is not a terrible film in any way. It's not just good. I remember one poster saying that the actress is not campy it's just nuanced. I've seen nuanced Japanese and Asian actors. Sorry, you're wrong. It's in the camp. <br /> <br /> Characters are completely atypical, deaths are completely random and totally pointless. Writing is bad. I'm frustrated by stopping my beliefs, I'm fine if I don't have everything to give me the plot. But this film has no plot. One reviewer said: "This film is placed in a small town where people go around nuts and spirals." It's not blunt, it's an amazing movie. Congratulations, I just saved you for about an hour and a half. There's nothing more to it. No character, no plot development, no explanation, no resolution. And not even "acceptable in J-Horror", there is no lack of resolution. Just nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the musical result is made by someone who apparently did not watch the movie at the same time, because it is random enough to cause whiplash. Cognitive dissonance is one thing and it is well done, it can be brilliant (see Dark Water), but here it seems that the score would be designed with the composition of another movie. <br /> <br /> The best example of this is the Japanese Evil Evil Dead without smart bits or good deeds. It just falls. It's a J-horror without horror.
