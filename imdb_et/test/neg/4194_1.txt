Fully agree with another review. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for about 5 minutes. I looked at one review on another site and found that it wasn't even a real sequel. It was after I watched the TV slowly remotely, the jaw fell down and down. <br /> <br /> The quality of filming exceeds a low budget. It doesn't even look like an amazing movie. If I look at "home video" material from a documentary, I look forward to it. <br /> <br /> In summary: Avoid, avoid. Boooo Lion Gate! <br /> <br /> After 5 minutes of shame, I hope I have been rescued or owned by others.
