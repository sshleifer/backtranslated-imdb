I can't really see how anyone might be in the interest of seeing this movie. She meets a man, she wants to play, as well, but only when she realizes what she's missing. He's leaving and it's really. Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) left John (Mickey Rourke) for 9 weeks. He would have had to leave him in 30 minutes and end his misery.
