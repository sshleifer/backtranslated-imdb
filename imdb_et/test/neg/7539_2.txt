Contrary to most of the remarks made in this chapter, I must say that this film just can't get out of the term 'garbage!' The only readers who seem to be aware of what the catalog of clich√©s is is those who, like me, live in the north-east and know first what the region is. I'm totally sick of movies that should be "realistic", but still represent a working class (wherever) as stupid, criminal low-level attacks, but then apologize for their social background. And funny? I smiled briefly twice and laughed once, but it was with two boys who allegedly attempted to hide Suncast's accents from Sunderland's football fans with a Sunderland accent. There was only one pleasant character in the whole movie and it was a grandfather so far, whom Roy Hudd played quietly, but very competently - the only non-Geordie who was cast. <br /> <br /> What's in writing - Well, I just don't know what the university's sociology department has learned. He had no ear for the local accent. And I have never heard the phrase "purely Belter" - and not only am I a native speaker, I am a linguist who has written articles about the local dialect. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time and seeing this garbage. It's not funny, it's not realistic, it's not fun and it's basically dishonest.
