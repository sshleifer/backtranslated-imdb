It is not unusual for Hollywood to like to pump crappy movies. Sometimes a handful of good movies come from them, while most simply suck a big ass. It is also not surprising that these bad films are the product of old TV series. Sometimes the surprise "The Fugitive" (who saw the best picture of the oscar nomile?), But for every "Fugitive" there is a McHale navy or some completely irregular film that has no plots or interests. Mod Squad, in my opinion, goes to my ten really bad films, where Hollywood should give that ass a beaten film that's a good movie. We have shifted to the right scent story in the middle of a story that just doesn't seem reasonable, it wastes talents and dialogue is just bad. We don't really know who the hell is, and we could give flying f ** k about what they are. Instead, you are expected to automatically know who they are and what they intend to do. There's one particularly bad riff about "I'm too old for this s ** t" line, it's just stupid. Something my friend spoke orally about when we were mercilessly about ending the movie endlessly. It's just an insult to Hollywood cinema. Rating: F-
