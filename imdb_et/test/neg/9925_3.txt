As far as I love Ellen Barkin (who is really undervalued), I have to look at this movie. If you can't tell who did it and why you probably never saw a psycho-sexual thriller in the first half of the year and never watched 20/20. It's like filmmakers and actors don't care about how they did it and how they play it, would be a dead donation. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is blind perverts who want to mix violence and sex. Not a fun movie to sit on, though if you like Ellen Barkin, it's nice to see that she puts on a tough lady.
