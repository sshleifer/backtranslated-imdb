This very fine film makes it unforgivable (which is ironic due to the theme of the film). Someone who enters this movie doesn't know what they are. Even worse than getting to the 3/4 movie, no one still has a clue what they have done, because everything up to the "moment" is a different film. <br /> <br /> Dutch fan of the first two films competing to date for the best two best Mormon films (competing with saints and soldiers and now seeing the New York Doll screening it), the Netherlands had me who wanted to see their movie very long time. I was there. I wanted to believe I can see the next big Mormon movie that keeps Numero Uno on the ground for a very long time. But not. Three-quarters of the film took sharp left turns and pulled me through something I never wanted to go through. It takes Mt. Everest of all moral issues, yes, both, little time or emotional ability to adequately handle them, but instead waves them to both sides of Jesus when it does all the things well, instantly. (True, it is that Jesus will save you. Don't blame me for not believing it. It's not a Dutch problem.) <br /> <br /> Is the film well done? Indeed. Do participants act? They were doing their pants. Did the music fit? Everything but the final credit. All this film was great except for the story that was so bad and wrong that everything else was not important. (I learned from the New York Doll "dank", a very decent exhibition, by the way.) The third work was neither a desirable nor a pleasant or plausible affirmation. I know the Dutchman bent him back to do that, but I had been removed from the movie so far, that nothing, no thing, would have brought me back. The embarrassing disbelief of the details of the last ten years did not help. Anyone who has been on a mission knows what I'm talking about, especially anyone who is familiar with the events associated with the mission that was sent home from a mission early for moral and / or psychological reasons. It would be like a parallel universe abruptly, where normal rules or behaviors suddenly do not apply. <br /> <br /> There are millions of things about this movie, but they were created and decorated just to rob them and "ooh, kneels", it really gives them "elitism". So, unforgivable. I can only hope that when the Dutchman finishes his next film (probably "Falling"), he remembers that film critics can only buy so many tickets and that they are fans who pay bills. That's why the first army of God was such unconditional success. <br /> <br /> The Dutch shock and awe-inspiring approach proves that when it comes to big issues, it is over its head, which has neither mental nor creative maturity nor is it necessary to exploit it. Pray! She learns her lesson and since then she and everyone are back, glad and glad that she pulled her head out, where the Light does not look and really, successfully takes on these and other topics and makes this world forever.
