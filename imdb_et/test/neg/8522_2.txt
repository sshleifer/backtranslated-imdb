Messengers are a bad, general and boring "horror" movie. The film has a big problem: it doesn't scare. Performances and the scenario are completely foolish. It uses old tricks to scare and laugh at all the supernatural events. I'm not calling the messenger's bad movie ... I would call it random comedy because it's so bad that it makes a laugh. The only good thing about this movie is that it is short so that this crap doesn't stay with us for a long time. There are many masterpieces of the horror genre that think with a low budget (such as Theme Two, Happy or May), which unfortunately is ignored while this mess is all successful in the box. we recommend this weak and pathetic horror film called Messengers.
