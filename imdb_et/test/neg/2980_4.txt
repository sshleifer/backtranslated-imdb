Failure to find the right words is a problem for everyone in this vaudeville-type comedy. They do not know what to say, and they do not know how to say it, so they start a potentially humiliating company that is pre-arranged for speed dating. Unfortunately, they are all more of a priest than a real person. The story follows the usual three-way structure: getting to know the great pains in their unfortunate lives, the real acquaintance, and the last romantic decline, showing some new fools of found couples. Because all this is so predictable, I would say that the narrative is a "Shoppen" failure. Comedy is usually too funny to be really funny. Thumbs up to Kathrin von Steinburg. It differs from the soap opera crowd as an independent wealthy Miriam. Also for her big makeup (Verena Wei√üert): Heavy eye shadow meets the skin tone of the lip gloss, creating a whore and bohemian but frantic effect. Thumbs up to Stefan Zinner as the Bavarian love machine and Tanja Schleiff as a hot nutritionist. They pass the communication problem through the timeless body language of copulation.
