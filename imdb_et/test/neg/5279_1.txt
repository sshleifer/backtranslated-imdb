Such low budget films give me hope for aspiring scriptwriter. In other words, if there are people who are willing to fund such a script, if there is much more than hope, like someone like me, who can actually write stories. This film is right there, or I should say "down there" to the Ed Wood world. The story, when you call it, and dialogue, not to mention sophomoristic behavior, is loyalty to the genre itself. Someone should have contributed to this stinker if it was still on paper. It follows that since the literature is pretty much killed, this film should follow. To get a good or even just satisfactory movie, you must have at least a decent written film. Remember the legendary Curt Siodmak. They used a lot of their stories back for low-budget movies when they still come out today as good, serious entertainment, ie "Donavan's Brain". Casting this "work" should seriously consider returning to work in their respective hamburgers or footwear stores, and forget about future weak attempts to appear in front of the camera. Avoid it like a plague yourself!
