I really didn't want to write a tough review of this movie because I really appreciate how hard it is to make any movie from an incredibly low budget, let alone try something as ambitious as sci-fi. <br /> <br /> But this movie is really terrible. Action is one of the worst things I had to endure, and a fan of low budget movies, which is quite a serious charge. There are many aspiring actors who work with a deferred payment plan when they believe in the film and what the director was trying to achieve. I am sure that the actors did their best to do all the other people involved in this production, but it wasn't big enough to pull something like that out. </p> Very poor. There's no excuse for that. I had the impression that the script was written on the brewery quickly after the epic session. I hesitate to use the word "ridiculous", but that's exactly what the script is. I had no empathy. Indeed, they are telling me which, as a result, I wanted to refute some of them more than once. Mr Stirton has gone too far. Clint Eastwood he's not. Again, there are talented people who want to postpone when they believe in the project. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of special effects of this movie. In the case of money, they are extraordinary when used somewhat. It's like someone said, "I have the effect and the boy I use." Who was involved in CG's work was the most talented team. <br /> <br /> Just money could not be made to create such an ambitious movie as it tried. Tissue to try it, but unfortunately it does not achieve too many different goals. <br /> <br /> I really welcome everyone involved in this production, but in their next endeavor they must become a Better Producer or lower their sights to be better managed. <br /> <br /> All in all, I cannot recommend this effort to anyone other than the most enthusiastic film students or unfamiliar insomniacse. If you want to see a real masterpiece of low-budget sci-fi movies, try to make the pupil "Dark Star" by a certain Mr. John Carpenter.
