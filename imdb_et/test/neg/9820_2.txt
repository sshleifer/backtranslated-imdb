I assume that the rave reviews on this page were from people who never read the book - Hollywood is killed in destroying those who love it. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure where a woman's love interest came from the ground except she replaced a cat and why our Rogue Male didn't get a useful family at Blighty - In fact, most of the book is cut out and replaced the usual cruddy love story. The vagueness in which the world leader was in his sight was completely removed and our Rogue got the name (neither of them appeared until the second book). <br /> <br /> I gave it 1 instead of just 2 because of the excellent accents of bad cocktails. Joan Bennett crosses the miles of Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins and it goes a little way to save it. <br /> <br /> Ah well - Brits should probably avoid this. Trust me :)
