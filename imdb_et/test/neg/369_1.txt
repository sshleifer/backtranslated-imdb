I know Trey Parker and Matt Stone really hate celebrities and attacks in all South Park episodes (if they don't show them, mention them) and they love to mock and joke and joke, but I felt that it was useless too far. <br /> <br /> First of all, the most widespread topic in the documentary is that they are episodes that are meaningless pieces they just put out for money. Obviously, it is totally wrong if you even struggled with any episode, and the constant "You know, I learned something today ..." by the end of almost every episode. The creators are also portrayed as pompous, arrogant things that only care for money, including the supposedly-funny-but-there is no scene that involves Isaac Hayes, who leads Chef (by phone) and Trey Parker screaming and shouting at him for sucking and hanging. I think it should be funny, but its torture just brought it ... blunt. <br /> <br /> The way they interviewed employees who work with Trey and Matt, show the duo as tyrants who push their employees to the limit, all just for money, in the end. Of course, it is completely wrong and all a joke, but it's not just funny. It's annoying, though it's just a joke.
