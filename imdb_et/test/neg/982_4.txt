In order to rewrite "Lost Horizon" as music, Rodgers & Hammerstein or Lerner & Lowe had a musical composition. Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the wrong choices. Having said that my favorite thing about "Lost Horizon" is its score. It's just that the score doesn't fit the piece. Mostly, non-musical talents are cast (Ullman, Finch and Hussey, everything was dubbed and still not big enough). <br /> <br /> Frankly, the short story on which this and earlier non-musical film versions are based is mediocre, at best. Although there is a really good version of cinematic music, they are not realized here. The movie can be a good, rainy day vehicle. Otherwise, you are better off buying your audio track CD. Due to the terrible reputation of the film, it is only recommended as a curiosity. I've seen much better; but I've seen much worse.
