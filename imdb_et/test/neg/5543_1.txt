Well, they've done it again with a new pumpkin head movie, the first pumpkin head was perfect for its time, stupid, gory and clich√©d monster. the way he goes, some lose his loved one, go to the witch in the woods, get him to the pumpkin head and let him take all the responsible murders. unfortunately, filmmakers have considered it irrelevant when trying to do it, in the fourth outing of movies, considering it more appropriate to add a flat romeo and a Julia sub-block that includes an idiotic family spirit (car over !!!!) and surprise surprises some nice pumpkin root so far that it is so passionate, but it doesn't end there when the talent in this flick is terrible ... oh so bad of them can't even hold a southern accent to slip into their mother tongue and often postherent. Lance henrikssen is so sure that he will bring some gravity into the film ... but no lure will let go of the screen so that the words do not get into the mouth without any emotion or seemingly direction and walks again, I believe he just turned for money , he went to his trailer drunk and remembers aliens. <br /> <br /> This movie is the perfect cack that has no redemption function other than the one that finishes the credits that signal this collection. <br /> <br /> Despite the shortcomings of ph: bf ... if you want a non-brainer that makes you laugh at all the wrong reasons, look at it. <br /> <br /> If you want more meat and more originality with help.
