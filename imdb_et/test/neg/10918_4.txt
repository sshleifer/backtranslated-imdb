CUJO is the adaptation of a novel of the same name written by Stephen King. <br /> <br /> I've never read a novel, but scanning a comment page has given me some insight. I noticed a reference to the end of the change. <br /> <br /> The plot plot is as follows - St. Bernard's dog bites rabbis bat and goes to kill the smile. <br /> <br /> The plot now sounds pretty worn because it's made in different films. But it can be something new when the king wrote this novel. Or perhaps the king's novel made a story that was never shown in the movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, the first 40 minutes of this movie are not worth mentioning when the dog is bitten. Nothing else happens - something scary, something funny, something to add symbols to the depths and something else interesting. I found it difficult to sit in this section and constantly shout at the TV, "Come on, get started!". Events on the screen resemble drama genre TV shows or an extended episode of a TV soap opera. Unfortunately, there was only one family in the movie who focused so that it couldn't even work on soap opera. The dog was the best character of the film, but he didn't get enough time on that. Nothing showed why this dog later kills a smile. <br /> <br /> After 40 minutes, something finally happened. The dog suddenly turned from a pet to a sudden kill machine. It started attacking some people. There was also an interesting cat and mouse chase when two characters were trapped in the car and they couldn't leave because the dog was attacking them. Even in this long second half, the intercourse would be rebuilt before death. It was a recurring situation repeatedly until the film reached its conclusion. <br /> <br /> Without giving up, I can tell you that it was very formal and Stephen King's story was indecent. <br /> <br /> Temporary scenes on the screen are interesting to watch. Some of the big corners of the camera add to the danger to the dog during the attacks. This is especially important because, as others have mentioned, St. The Bernard dog is ever as scary as the Rottweiler. Unfortunately, suspenseful music is not used to support images on the screen. Music is rather melodramatic than suspensive. It may be suitable for a TV movie, but it looks amazing in a place that should be a dark-toned film that depicts a spectacular nightmare. <br /> <br /> This brings me to a broader problem with photography with this film. The choice of camera work and especially colors makes it a very cheap TV movie that could be expected on day 5 as a film here in the UK where I write this comment. <br /> <br /> The top two actors give good exhibitions to help you live in the dull segments of the movie. Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro should be commended for doing a good job as their poor material. I could forgive some brief moments, paying more attention to the dialogue, which, in my opinion, would not have received any other interpretation. I do not give a decision to other participants because they are given virtually nothing. <br /> <br /> Like someone who is a SALEM LOT and STEPHEN KING IT fan, so did the famous Stephen King novels movie, I had great expectations for this movie. But it turned out to be a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> In general, I do not recommend Stephen King or generally horror movies to watch CUJO. This is one of those moments where I have to recommend a book rather than a movie. Hopefully, this story will bring the film to life.
