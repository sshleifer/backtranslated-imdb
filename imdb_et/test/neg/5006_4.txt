It is very sad to see that someone from George C Scott's caliber is on a low-budget thriller that would have been better than the original novel written by Graham Greene and led by somewhat experienced in this genre. DO NOT MAKE A BETTER KINEMATOGRAPHY. Landscape and carnival have so many missed opportunities, but just slipped, instead of finding a movie in an exotic environment. <br /> <br /> The rest of the viewer's comments about this site, one very clever observer, complained about the variety of bad accents in this movie. Ever since I saw George C as Rochester in Jane Eyre, I've prayed for NEVER ever to accept the role that demanded him a British accent. Just every time and then, he could just pass the British or the very British sounding South Africa probably played an American actress. I can get the extraordinarily laborious accents (both British and Australian) of the stomach Meryl Streep - at least she gets it right, though for every advertisement she insists that we marvel at her skills. I am sorry that Mr Scott is not Meryl Streep, and it simply destroys the illusion - as Michele Yeoh talks about the tormenting mandarin with a strong Singapore accent in Crouching Tiger and so on. <br /> <br /> Peterson works differently from what we see in CSI. Except he is still very beautiful and in this movie more or less thin. He's a TV Harrison Ford. The same old expressions of every emotion, every situation. Not in the second thinking, Ford has two - confusing / painful and happy. I've never seen a smile on CSI!
