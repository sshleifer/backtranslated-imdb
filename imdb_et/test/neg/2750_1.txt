This movie is anything but a true story of Phoolan Devi. The statements of director Shekhar Kapoor are discouraged by the fact that he even made a film without ever meeting Phoolan Devi, in whose life this film should be based! Sorry, meeting with a woman would have disturbed the story of the director! The film destroys the opportunity for society to feel in the Indian society about the situation of women with a low box and reaches a stereotype that depicts Phoolan Devi as the angry woman whose only motivation is revenge. No wonder this Shekhar Kapoor movie was successful in the West because it satisfied their non-Bollywood tastes!
