I've seen this movie last week during the Berlin Film Festival and on average expectations. - The director is Bertrand Tavernier and I was familiar with some of his previous work in French cinema. I liked some of his earlier films. - Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgard, Mary Steenburgen ... I look forward to seeing all this talent on the screen. -I didn't know the book it was based on, and I hadn't read anything before the movie, but I was told it was a research game that has been placed deep in the south (we've seen a lot of them in the past) Maybe it will be just as good than others ...) <br /> <br /> 2 hours later, the final headlines appear: TODAY GOD IS OVER !!!! - The plot is incomprehensible. When you read the book, you have a significant advantage. There were too many small signs and lots of useless land. We didn't understand anything! - Shares. My God! Tommy Lee Jones's accent is decent, but I still have nightmares of Mary Steenburg's Cajun-French song ... - Bad casting in my opinion. I can't believe that old man Tommy Lee Jones can attack an attacker built from a goon ... And I'm not afraid of John Goodman. - Who were these people?!? We hardly understand who all these signs are and what they do. Is there a feed store? Tommy Lee Jones is a girl from Guatemala? Blurg! - Comic experiments were pathetic. The film's more fun thing was probably his "action" and "temporary" scene. They were terrible. No excitement. Bad Behavior (Can Tommy Lee Jones do different faces or is he like Derek Zoolander?) ... And then there is sci-fi stuff. There are no spoilers, but it becomes ridiculously and annoyingly strange. <br /> <br /> I usually don't write any comments to IMDb, but I thought the film was so bad and disappointing that I felt compelled to share my opinion. But it's just me ...
