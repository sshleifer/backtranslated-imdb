It must be one of the worst films of MGM and FRANK SINATRAS. Oddball is a musical comedy that does not work in almost every aspect. There is SINATRA on Silly's plot, who is trying to continue the reputation of his fathers as KISSING BANDIT. She's not a bandit and kisses! He plays both the character of the joke and the expected dialogue he has to talk about. The scene stealer is J. CARROLL NASH and MILDRED NATWICK. Too bad they didn't have more scenes together. I've given the movie to two stars because the suits and costumes are better and one of the songs KATHTREN GRAYSON sang "Love is where it is" is sensational. Maybe it would have been. The comic book is also RIDCARDO MANTALBAN, CYD CHARISSE and ANN MILLER as fun. Therefore, these reasons and only these reasons are traceable. KISSING BANDIT is part of Frank Sinatra's early years collection.
