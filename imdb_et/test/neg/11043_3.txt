Oldboy is set in Korea and starts from the drunken Dae-su Oh (Min-Sik Choi) police station, whose friend only kidnaps, Dae-su wakes up and finds himself in a small room for the next fifteen years. Dae-sui is nourished and cared for by his unknown prisoners, but it is not allowed out of the room, Dae-su begins to train when he gets out of what he intends to do by breaking down the cement wall. chopsticks. But before Dae-su ends up, she's gassed and unconscious when she wakes up at Dae-su's free high building, dressed and all in money. Dae-su is trying to find out who was imprisoned right after she met two love of Hyo-jeong Kang and, with the help of Dae-su, finally finds what she is looking for, but the truth comes from the price ... <br / > <br /> This South Korean production was written and directed by Chan-wook Park and has received several glowing reviews (such as what distributors can choose from quotes and tend to call them in a video box) and even won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes, while it was also a candidate for Golden Palm, so Oldboy is a real classic? Well it's not for me, because because I don't understand why I liked it and I'm going so far as to say that I hated it a lot after one or two independent moments. First of all, I couldn't get the story at all, I just didn't like it because I thought it was slow and boring, and though many would have believed that Oldboy had the best shocking twists I thought was quite common and not very well executed. The end where Dae-su goes to the hypnotic New Zealand Alps feels noticeable as if the creators wanted a happy ending. After almost two hours I was almost as bored as sleep, violence is tame, and that is what I think most people have a problem rather than actually shown. In fact, Oldboy has very little body weight with about seven and one light sex scene, not really graphic or memorable. I didn't warm up any character, and although I agree that Oldboy has the right concept and the premise that it can't deliver, and this is one movie I never understand, why so many people seem to like it. <br /> <br /> Based on the same Japanese name, Oldboy, the film looks good, there are one or two beautiful visual moments, although although everyone is talking about the corridor that takes place in one continuous shooting, I was pretty unprpressed and thought fighting choreography was pretty boring. The actual violence on the screen gore is very small, Dae-su eats a living Octopus, which is probably quite normal in Korea, there are some fighting scenes, broken hands, someone's teeth pulled out and there is some blood There was supposed to be a $ 4,000,000 trademark that is actually fair, filmed in South Korea and New Zealand. Acting is fine, but it's hard to tell if the actors speak a different language. <br /> <br /> Oldboy is a movie that I found an absolute harvest to sit on, I don't mind subtitling movies or foreign movies. pay attention to the plot when I followed it completely, but I just didn't like any of it and it is so simple and straightforward. Probably the second director of Choi-wook Park's revenge trilogy, which also includes sympathy against Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Lady Vengeance (2005).
