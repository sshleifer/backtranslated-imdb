I have to say I am not a mass fan of Troma movies. Allowing me to see only three (or four, including this) but two (Blood Sucking Freaks and Mother's Day) are widely known as the best that makes me believe that everyone else is not worth seeing. This would probably be the case with Graduation Day, a troma that takes over the popular eighties. Although the film is never particularly bad (given the type of film), it is never particularly good; and finally, all I thought was "why did I do the trouble?" Anyway, the plot sees some girls on the race track and soon after; more people will die. Of course, some potential suspects are; but it is hard to really care what happens. Of course, slaher terms; this is gore, which is the most important, and considering the events of Troma, which are reminiscent of red things, I was expecting this bucket. There are some decent kill scenes and some of them are disgraceful; but it is never very shocking, which really just turns it into another dreadful Slasher American calendar festive event. It is worth noting that this film has a small role in the royal queen of Linnea Quigley, but the rest is not worth mentioning. The direction, the plot and its filling are all very everyday; and I say that if you are not a big Troma fan or someone who wants to follow every slasher ever made; don't worry about this movie.
