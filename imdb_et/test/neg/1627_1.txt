Cave Dwellers or Blade Mater, or whatever is called, is in one word: VILE! I saw it in MST, and I laughed not only with the great running commentary, but also in the inert film art that was shown. Sunglasses, tire traces and where did the Ator glider? Then they pick up another movie where Eagles Dare resembles Tom Servo. To show how inexpensive this movie really is, check out this scene where Ator and Thong have to fight with invisible swords. Or even better, look for the giant hose dressed up that Ator must wrestle with! And what exactly are these credit scenes related to the movie?
