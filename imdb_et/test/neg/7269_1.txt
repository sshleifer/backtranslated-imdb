This movie is terrible. First of all, I thought it could turn to children thanks to Ewoks, who is the stars of Wars. After sitting in this movie, I am sure that even 4-year-olds will not find this movie interesting. The special effects are the best of this film and are very comparable to other 80-year-old TV films. The script is bad, actors, especially Aubree Miller and incredibly bad and the flick are so predictable that I still can't believe I couldn't touch my video recorder's back and forth button. But I approached this confusion more than once.
