This film captures short moments between mother and son in Russia in a rural area as she dies. <br /> <br /> I am so shocked that I am a nice movie or declare it a patience test. On the one hand, the film is beautiful, a rare dialogue captures the essence of its feelings. In fact, there is nothing to say, because everything you have to say goes beyond words. The son shows so much care, love, and patience to my mother that I think it is an unconditional love for her family. It also reminds me bravely that I could be in such a situation, staying happy, taking care of a very sick person. "Mat I Syn" is a cruel reality. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Mat I Syn" moves too slowly. Do I really need to watch a train crossing the horizon for more than 1 minute? With my previous experience of "Telets" and "Alexander", I am so tempted to put "Mat I Syn" together. <br /> <br /> I think you have to be in the right position to appreciate this movie. I certainly see this beauty, but maybe I'm not in the right position.
