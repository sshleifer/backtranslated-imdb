OK .. at the time of writing, 65 people voted for this movie, bringing it to 5 out of 10. I think only the film crew voted. So I'm here to bring all justice. <br /> <br /> The movie has never been more than that. Given, I laughed out a little, but the movie / story didn't want me to be. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of bad movies. LOTS. But man, it blows them all out. <br /> <br /> '96 computers, ridiculous action and wheelchair stops - and we have young Tarantinos who can't finance their ideas. Yes, life is a cruel joke.
