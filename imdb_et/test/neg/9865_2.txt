Yes! this movie was so bad in every respect as cast, effects, boredom, excitement and, of course, fantastic, and we all know that the four heroes were a little more colorful than the new colors, but it still has to go, fantastic as it really was silly in the trash, which I knew nobody would want when i saw it, i'm definitely thinking about this budget about 3 or 4 good movies could have done but not. I'm just glad that this year's new version showed everyone how fantastic the four should have done a good story, a great performance like Jessica Alba, one of my favorite actors, otherwise it would be completely forgotten, but luckily not. The new one was great when I saw it with my companions in the cinema, but this old fantastic cage has to go.
