I was so offended by this movie that I had to write SOMETHING about it, so please me with humor. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming round outside good practice is that it doesn't go past 107 minutes. Even this length is about 30 minutes too long. <br /> <br /> Here's a lot of comparison with the dark "Grifters", but I don't see it. These are two different films. The nearest "Swindled" reaches the existing movie "The Sting", which was made in 1973. It lends (sorry, STEALS) the freedom of this great George Roy Hill entertainment, which is exactly what it was. I liked it because it didn't look like anything else. <br /> <br /> 'Swindled has so many red herring that I thought I was a fish dense. It is very confusing, but it is just one of its many problems. The main thing is that if you make a movie where everyone is in everyone else's boundaries, we don't have any "anchor" to get us started. The inevitable result is a very sloppy mash between seconds from other capers. <br /> <br /> Almost everything in this movie is interconnected and reluctant. Certainly, the 101 film tells us that the audience must take care of someone. We cannot take care of anyone here: they are all pigs. It could have been a dirty comedy, but it plays it right from start to finish. BIG 'SPOILER' WILL BE. SORRY, BET WHAT TO DO. <br /> <br /> There are so many counterfeit blood and so many fake killings that it doesn't load faith - it destroys it. The end is completely ridiculous - "murder" at a crowded airport, which is not a "murder" at all? And the "murdered" boy, moistened with blood, just stands, brushes away and walks away, fake blood drips, catches? Everything, when the police and people's hordes are looking, and no one intervenes? The director must have a lot of cojone if he thinks we should buy it. Noirish B-films from the 1940s were better. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of European flick, but it confirms that schlock is not always from Hollywood. As far as "Swindled" is concerned, I think the famous line comes from the wrong producer Samuel Goldwyn, who knew everything about Schlock: "Include me".
