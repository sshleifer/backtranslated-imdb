Another stupid "movie". Image quality is correct. Also sound. Music is in the middle. The guy is trying to make music like Halloween. <br /> <br /> One rare time, the producer / director chooses non-anorectic girls. The reason for this is that this "film" makes one week and costs $ 10,000. Does this mean that if the producer has money, do they choose all anorexic girls? Good question. <br /> <br /> But girls in this "movie" are physically correct. But they are not good actors. Also boys. But maybe it just causes this "movie" story "" value. <br /> <br /> I'm sure we'll give $ 10,000 to some teenagers who like the movie, and they can create a better movie. <Br /> <br /> Don't waste time looking at this "thing".
