Doug McClure has played in some of these British-made genre adventures and must be the worst of the batch. I know COUNTRY, WHEN FORGOT has critics, but please at least that the film has filming and relatively good product values. This is the problem with this movie - the production values ​​go beyond "so bad that they are a good" cordial territory and become "so bad that I go and see what's on the other channels" <br /> <br /> One case is The first scene where the terrible Cushing and McClure are in contact with the monster. It is painfully evident that the monster is a medium-sized man dressed as a rubber monster made to view over twenty feet in height through an oversized back projection. It becomes even more painful that our heroes are trying to get out of the monster on the spot. Have I mentioned that this is one of the most convincing parts? In fact, it doesn't seem to have been filmed in someone's living room, where this year's DOCTOR WHO budget was left in reserve. Even the former DOCTOR WHO Peter Cushing is blissful and what should have been a fun line "You can't remember me - I'm British" is delivered in a very specific way (very similar line is spoken by Cushing HORROR EXPRESS) script without characterization, drawing and a memorable dialogue. It's not just the fact that dialogue is unememable, but also rarely and rarely, because monsters are not talking. Wouldn't it be better if the main bad guys humanoids were like ATLANTIS WARLORDS so they could explain the plot. Does anyone here know what the plot is? <br /> <br /> A very annoying British movie that even Caroline Munro's twin power will not save. The entire mood of the movie takes the final sequence, which includes two key rings
