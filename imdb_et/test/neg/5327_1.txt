I thought I saw this movie before the plot summary seemed familiar. But when I looked at it one afternoon (I needed some pointless but amusing entertainment), I didn't know anything - if I had seen it before, I had to block that horror from that memory. > <br /> This movie is terrible and shows its age. In fact, it looks older than that: rather in the mid-80s, moral comedy. Although I am a fan of WC humor and I see many things funny, it is the "comedy" with the purest and most homophobic. The plot is as thin as the Supermodel, which will not bother me if only the film is funny. <br /> <br /> There is only one fun line in the whole movie, spoken by character Louis: "It looks like someone was throwing a whopping white boy!" In fact, Louis is the only pleasant character (and it doesn't speak much). James and Carl are irritating, immature men who ride a reasonable woman miles away, their practical jokes are as humorous as the Iraq war; Susan Wilkin's character is colorless (looks like Julia Roberts, but she has no charisma) and she and Carli have zero chemistry - though it may be unfair to blame the actor because I don't know what she could have done about this badly written part; and the villain is neither funny nor frightening or memorable. <br /> <br /> There's a good trash can and a bad trash. This is a trash that should not be recycled.
