This film was strange mainly because the plot was so inconsistent. The title refers to the wind of the witch, which makes the land almost uninhabitable when the surface breaks down, but it seemed to have something to do with what was happening. The film seems to be extremely bad for Bladerunner's rip-off, ie rogue android is a fugitive hunter (or a ruthless policeman). Luke Skywalker is a surprisingly good result, as the rogue police mentioned above. Nothing seems to be solved at the end of the movie, we never find anything about android and its intentions. There is one amazing scene where Bill Paxton (who has been robbed of the android) plays one particular song on his carton plane for a particular reason (called "Yardbirds" "Shape of things"). This happens again in a later scene where the same song is played for no apparent reason. Is this song relevant to the film? Don't think.
