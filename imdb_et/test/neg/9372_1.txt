Eliza Dushku is a very talented and beautiful actor. He succeeds in being a "Stu Calling" rock-stable center, but that's not enough to save his TV series from mediocrity. It is a real shame that a woman, as attractive and talented, as Dushku should go to a carnivorous role in "Buffy Vampire Slayer" in this clunker. <br /> <br /> Unigiginal and desperate to be hip, "Tru Calling" is unable to excite the hormonal level. An ethnic heroine spends a lot of time running around here and all that has to be a very small town to avoid the good death of the dead bodies she has already met in the cemetery where she works. In spite of all the running he always gets to look like he has just stepped out of a portable air-conditioned dressing room. <br /> <br /> Eliza Dushku and the rest are fighting in every episode to breathe life into blissful, characteristic scenarios, but this is a pointless exercise. "Tru Calling" is just on the plate, watching the lifeless ceiling.
