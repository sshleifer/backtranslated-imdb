Given that Roger Corman added his name to this production, I had great hopes for this film. In the 1960s, Corman led a lot of memorable low budget horror. I was particularly pleased with the adjustments to Poe's stories, such as "Usher's House" and "Pit and Pendulum" and "Raven", which marked the late big Vincent price. These films had strong performance, atmosphere, intercourse, strong character, intriguing plot development and some cooling moments. Unfortunately, The Damned House mostly sacrifices these qualities to the low-budget special effects of cheese, free of charge nudity and meaningless gore equipped with fast clips and camera corners. <br /> <br /> The House The The Damned begins with an interesting shot of some of Ireland's beautiful locations, but it's downhill from here. Unfortunately, instead of spending time on building the atmosphere, creating signs that we could take care of, or building relationships - the manager decides to start counting the body. After a brief introduction to the lead figures, the young couple and their daughter, the audience spends the balance of one film that spikes a spooky event on another, which in this film replaces a single plot development. The badges are so bad and so bad - the audience doesn't care what happens to them. Worse, "horrible" events are either completely clichés or low-tech low-budget special effects. The soundtrack has been lifted from The Omen. The little plot in it lends "Poltergeist" and "The Legend Of Hell House", but there is no feature that made these films convincing. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in well-made haunted house flicks, I suggest you look at the classic like "The Haunting (1963)," The Innocents (1961) or Explore Corman Early in American International Movies and "House of The Damned" "if you are masochistic or frantic. <br /> <br /> 3½ out of 10. <br /> <br /> Rob Rheubottom <br /> <br /> Wpg, MB.
