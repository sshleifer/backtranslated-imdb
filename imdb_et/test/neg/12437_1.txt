Recently I had to look at it in a sociology class project and thought it was the absolutely worst film I ever had to sit on. It was like a bad cinema movie with all the "good bits" removed. Bad action, the creation of a fake documentary, the pointless plot and the rudderless direction combine a terrible and terrible film. <br /> <br /> Female characters are basically just sex objects. Think of this shift: "He's hot." "She has a girlfriend." "Do you have a girlfriend?" "No". * The girl takes the hands of the boys and takes her behind a bush. boy comes out and sits next to another boy, girl saunters out * "Did you hit it?" "No, I didn't want to take off my pants." "You are stupid." The other girl will appear when the boys go to Beverly Hills, get into the bag with one boy and when the policeman pulls over, you'll see the car up and down. <br /> <br /> Homosexual pervert, the lucky lucky Clint Eastwood looks the same, and what seems to be a luchador mask, everyone adds to the failure. One of the guys gets into the police, nobody cares. One of the boys is shot, no one cares. <br /> <br /> Someone said the dialogue was mostly improvised and it shows. Just terrible. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
