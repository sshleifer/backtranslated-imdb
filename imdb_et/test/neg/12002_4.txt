I couldn't look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found the full drag of this movie. Childish humor, cheap looking kits, cheap looking effects, a plot that makes "legal blonde" look like "ordinary suspects" and so many coincidences that I can now officially say that Robert Rodriguez had brain surgery after 1996. when its trademark is cool, the cameras move, but where it ends. OK, so the man decided to do something to change the children's spy movie. Well, if I were 12, I'd feel offended. The best thing about this movie is the absolutely amazing Carla Gugino, who just stole every event he had. Unfortunately, there wasn't much. 4/10
