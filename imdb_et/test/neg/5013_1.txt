This movie was on pay channels today and I had nothing to do. It must be ever made the worst football movie. It must be one of the worst periods of the film. The cable system's premium service has a rating system and gave 4 stars out of 4. This movie is not even half the stars. Bad action, Scott Bakula sinks as usual, Larry Miller ?? Sinbad, couldn't do it when he tried. Rob Schneider's one liner was completely empty. Fred Thompson should be embarrassed that he was even in this movie. The only sustainable love of this movie was the hope that you would see Kathy Ireland showering, not even close. Complete waste of time and film. If we can give a negative number, minus 9.
