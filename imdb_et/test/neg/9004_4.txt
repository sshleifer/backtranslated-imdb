I had a little hope of this hour-long movie, which consists of old Poverty Row films. Certainly, it seemed more than the mass of home video marketed to the world. Unfortunately, this movie still seems to be funny about home video, but equipped with film material. <br /> <br /> The plot is scheduled to read the lining at midnight somewhere in the tropics. The ship is sinking and well ... it's a movie. <br /> <br /> The film promises Karloff, Lugos, Chaney, and other older movies to draw new materials. We get it well, but most of the time we get a lot of new videos made for black and white movies. Old film footage is usually cut to set the scene, but very little of the old and new ones really fit so it is clearly only put. It is not very convincing and is a very disappointing person looking for a better design. <br /> <br /> Still, if you know and love old Poverty Row movies (it's very buggy), it might be worth watching. I would warn you about buying it, but it could be about five dollars, the rental price) so the choice is for you (though if you can't get paid for it). <br /> <br /> Disappointing.
