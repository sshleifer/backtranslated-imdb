Oh my God, this movie is incredible, it's the worst movie and I know what I'm talking about! I'm a frightening film fan! <br /> <br /> The story is totally stupid, a group of adults decides to make a party and a stupid guy with a terrible mask and kills all ... dialogues are sort of parody, worst, they only talk about sex with such a bad accent. The end is (oh !!!!!!) discover yourself! you're really very surprised ... (not possible! yes, that's it!) and surprise the movie is just 58 minutes. (not possible (bis) yes it is!) Worst than House IV and Howling V. <br /> <br /> To put it briefly, forget it forever !!!
