This is a silly film with a lot of singing and dancing. Action is average, but writing leaves something undesirable. Buddy Epsen has memorable performances that have a short but outstanding performance by Gypsy Rose as a rich playboy bitter woman. A completely unbelievable image of college life ending with excellent skating in Alice in Wonderland. Many parts are worth watching, but don't be afraid to move fast on parts of the movie
