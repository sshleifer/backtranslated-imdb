After opening the credit on a black sheet of paper with white stains sprayed, OK OK I am generous and call it a starfield, we know an alien spacecraft that falls into a meteorite and is forced to land. The scary looking model spaceship lands in a terrible looking model field. Three nearby campers are exploring. A burning spacecraft shows a reptile looking for an alien, "Nightbeast," OK, so I lied that it was a boy in tired rubber monstrous and silver space. Campgrounds kill the Nighbeast laser gun quickly, which makes people terrible special effects. Sheriff Jack Cinder (Tom Griffith) is informed. He warns his deputy, Lisa Kentian, and collects men to investigate. Meanwhile, Nightbeast has been killed by an unlucky driver who stopped by the road to leak. His two annoying children run for help. They approach the house, the two young men kiss, the girl says, "Someone runs towards the house". The boy can look up and attack and talk at night, it also kills the girl. Then you can kill two children with your laser, maybe it is not so bad at night. When Sheriff and his men arrive at the scene, they have a gun / laser battle with Nightbeast. It is possible that in the history of the film the most obscure struggle, only the sheriff, his deputy and the local man Jamie Lambert (Jamie Zemarel) live. But it is still alive at night, it seems that the balls do not affect it. The next day, the sheriff will visit the mayor of cities, Bert Wicker (Richard Dyszel) and his girlfriend, Mary Jane (Eleanor Herman), to get permission to evacuate everyone in town. He refuses to say that the manager he possesses (Richard Ruxton) cannot cancel and does not want to panic. The Sheriff will evacuate the city anyway. Nightbeast is attacked by two doctors, Steven Price (George Stover) and Ruth Sherman (Anne Firth) before they leave. But they manage to scare and survive the night. Together with the Sheriff, they decide to stay and fight against the alien. Don Dohler, written and staged, must be an amateur film made with his family and friends, see the credit, and see how much Dohler is involved. For this reason, I should probably relax it somewhat, but it still does not prevent it, or apologize for being a pretty horrible movie from every department. It has no story or purpose, things just happen to be wasting the time that Drago (Don Leifert) strangles his former girlfriend Suzie (Monica Neff)? This and many other scenes don't add anything to the movie. The script also has no logic why the night illness around the city stays when it is said to have been evacuated? Special effects are embarrassingly bad, just look at the effect when Nightbeast lets someone with their laser, the effect of the 80th spectrum computer is ashamed. It doesn't really have much blood or brains, ripped open belly, broken hands, and breakage, but everyone looks predictably bad. With the credit card it comes in, Nightbeast itself looks great. There is a sexual scene between Sheriff and his deputy, which must be seen credibly, music that even porn would be embarrassing, and two really dirty naked people do it for tricky tracking. Less than letters, photography, music, lighting and editing make it a real chore. And what worse is this movie? It obliges mortal sin to be boring and not the least. Sorry Don mate, but don't give up the day! Be sure to avoid one.
