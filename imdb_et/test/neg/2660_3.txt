Nothing would be more attractive than a good love story that includes Kristin Scott Thomas and Harrison Ford. Cool, refined English beauty and warm-blooded American man - what could be more beautiful? Well, that's not the movie. Immediately they destroy it, throwing Kristin Scott as Thomas's American Congress. It's like pouring Hugh Granti into Babe Ruth. Or Colin Firth as Al Capone. Kristin Scott Thomas is exactly the kind of woman you don't fill with shaking fatty ex-junkies in dirty slums, or squeezing a smelly crowd and kissing children. He would have been much better than an English-born widow of an aristocratic senator, one who belongs to a yacht club and goes to flower shows but doesn't know how the other half lives. <br /> <br /> Then there is Harrison Ford as a regular man policeman. Certainly, he is tough enough for this role. But the idea of ​​romanticizing this stunning beauty of society is a bit difficult to swallow. Why couldn't he say it was a tough, but prosperous reform politician whose roots were the Senate of Kristin's late wife? They are both pretty cool to each other, but for the commitment, Kristin is cordial to him and he will, on the contrary, show him some of the furious aspects of his life - the things his husband defended him. His political awakening coincides with a newer, blue collar, lover who appreciates his polishing and perfection much more than his aristocratic wife. Now this is a love story! Instead, you get an empty, meaningless "thriller" where action is dragged and nothing happens. Well, there is one ghetto-style "race" scene where Harrison is almost killed, but it's so steep and inexplicable that it's really a welcome comic. <br /> <br /> Heaven is always gray in this movie and our refined, lovely Kristin always looks a little chilled. If he were to dream of passion, he would see more than he dreamed of wool cover and cup of tea! He also looks a bit drowsy, as he really does in bed rather than Harrison turning Ford. <br /> <br /> All things, I think you can't blame him.
