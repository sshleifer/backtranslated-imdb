I say "flick" because it does not deserve the name "film" and certainly not "film". I'm sorry for the rental, and even though I've never gone out of the movie, it would have been if I saw it in the theater. In the future, the underground society (oh, this is the original), the many burning barrel drums, the inexplicable surrounding light that shines through the windows, the ungrateful woman and her shocked son ... the list goes on and on. C. Thomas Howell influences the stereotypical loneliness husky voice; you know how Eastwood is dead. She needs special sunglasses to remember her wife and child, but in the setback she's the same age! Talk about poor memory! I looked incredibly when the boy Abe accidentally pushes the code into the door and opens! Tensions, Religious (What Do You Believe?) All Over / Over ... Worst: I was waiting for a better Roddy Piper; <br /> <br /> It's probably the worst movie experience in my life.
