If you are a fan of both franchises (Aliens & Predator ... duh ... and even if you liked or didn't like AVP flick 06), you hate this movie. Countless plot holes, flakes and incredible human characters, terrible special effects, and even worse targeting and fighting scenes make it one of the worst films I've seen. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLIER *** One of the HUNDRED large plot holes contained the Pred / Alien hybrid that went from the chest to the adult in a bad ass seconds (it takes off the killing of the Predator ship on board and swept the Pred ship before the ship even smashes the Earth in orbit.) AS IF. In the first AVP we saw Sr. Pred hunters who fell on three young hunters who went hunting for "serving their stripes," and finally saw that they pulled up the remaining juvenile "honored body" at the end. Do we think that a single chest hybrid killed all those hunters before the ship even cut off the orbit? Also (and it was an extremely cheap production value for the director / producer) jars and jars and jars of facial huggers somehow magically appeared on board the Pred ship, although the entire temple complex and Queen Alien were destroyed by the AVP flick. These face-to-face heroes naturally play a part in the movie ... of course. And how do all these face huggers become adult aliens during the day? What a joke. Although there were a lot more holes in the plot, I don't think IMDb would appreciate me filling these servers by writing them here. <br /> <br /> Well, with amazing and incredible characters, where should I go boys and girls? Where to start ... almost all of these balls are clich√©s from other movies or TV shows. An evil boy who left prison to avoid time but appears just on the day when everything happens to save the day ??? Where did I see it? Oh yeah, last season JERICHO !!! Then there is a 20-something sheriff of the city (former distress) who was simultaneously the best friends with the bad. Where did we see it? Oh yes, JERICHO and Walking Tall! Then there is a generic soldier (who does not have) who comes home from some of the general military capitals that are not filled like a long loved man and hero at the airport or bus station, but his daughter and wife in his own city center. And who is this soldier? What did he do with the Army / Air Force / Navy / Navy / Coast Guard? We don't know, because the film never tells the US. But ... dunh, dunh, dunh ... he was a soldier / airliner / Marine / sailor / coaster who knows how to drive a Stryker infantry vehicle and ... magically ... HELICOPTER !!! This sign is just a copy of every "upcoming home" provider ... except that he brings his daughter home night vision goggles that cost several dollars. These are things that soldiers have to sign and not just "bring home". UGH! <br /> <br /> Special effects and fighting scenes are what drew me the worst. I enjoyed these things the most in my first movie ... watching Preds and Aliens! The way it was filmed, the sequences of actions were so blind and filmed so close that you couldn't say what was going on. You didn't see who did it and what happened when they fought against it. All in all, these hundreds of items kill its franchise and fans. No one cares more about seeing their favorite sci-fi movie monsters and can only guess that the series will go down here because manufacturers don't like millions of dollars more on the sequel.
