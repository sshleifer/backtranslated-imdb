Calu-what now? Yeah, I thought it was a stupid name. Chris Carter remains blissfully ignorant of the contamination of his written staff. Starting from the usual fun X-Files teaser (the child who is attacked by the train), this episode ... well, I can't really say it's going downhill, because to be honest, it never went up. Wrongly written, we don't know any signs (except perhaps at the beginning of the child) that the writer makes us hate characters before they are cruelly killed, this is the worst technique. Should we hate those hate characters? Don't ask me. <br /> <br /> It's not only boring and frightening, it's just as bad as following Omen's follow-up with overwhelmed and disgusting deaths and rotten special effects (though it's brutally honest, that's the least worrying to me). <br /> <br /> Sara B. Charno started her X-Files career and luckily finished one. <br /> <br /> Decision: <br /> <br /> The words of my math teacher Laverack: "Terrible, terrible ..."
