I have to agree with the conclusions of many other reviewers. A subject that could have been thought-provoking and illuminating in the opposite double standard failed. <br /> <br /> Rape and violent abuse, scenes were mostly pathetic here. It would have been a better idea to cover the short eyes of what happened and let the audience imagine. And the victim's smile with the police when he interrupted his police complaint seemed as real as the policeman. No discomfort, no hesitation to just join. I don't know if it was bad behavior and / or bad leadership, but nobody missed that point completely. As far as his half ** is concerned, his attackers should look pathetic. They should have missed most of the sex scenes - the second monumental failure of themselves and had to meet Colin Friels when he first went to the police. The story could then have been brought out with good dialogue and a random setback - and saved by the superior actor and presence Colin Friels - the only reason I watched this movie - brings to every project what he does. <br /> <br /> The only specific revelation of this movie is that it was nonsense.
