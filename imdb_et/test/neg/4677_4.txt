File it "How are these movies made?" column. The seventy-fold version of the "Macbeth" indie version was adjusted in a fairly faithful (but meaningless) way to the traditionally unusual black-comic style. The cast gives him a hit when Christopher Walken calls eccentricity when McDuff and Maura Tierney rise above the dull script like Pat McBeth. Other participants are wasted, as is the time of the audience. However, fans of this brand's knee-highs may like it. 4 out of 10.
