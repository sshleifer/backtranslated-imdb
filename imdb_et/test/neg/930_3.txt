It lent scenes from LOTR, Matrix, Star Wars, and so on. Humor is so dry, viable and horny that you can't laugh at your smile and look at it. Exactly what you expect from HK comedy. The average person would enter IQ 100 and leave less than 80. Stephen Chow is the obvious omission of this film. Humor would have worked better with Stephen. The Mandarin version of this movie is not as good as the Cantonese original. Graphics are bad compared to Hollywood colleagues. Low quality CGs are redundant. My biggest complaint is its end. The origin of the white horse is so clearly described as "Journey to the West" (JW) that this alternative explanation does not fit well with the storyline. Despite many mistakes, the film has a lot more entertainment than the second movie Nicholas Tse - Promise.
