Let me get this off before I talk about this movie trash: I love Park Chan-Wook's work as a director. Although I do not agree with the masses that say it is the best work of our time, I cannot deny that he understands how to use the camera very effectively. I really liked one of his other films, a sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Min-sik Choi was also the only thing that allowed me to take this movie seriously. . . 1/5 of the running time, that is. <br /> <br /> Now it's bad: the plot is just the oldest cliché used in cinema / literature. I'll never understand how critics get to the Hollywood cobarine trash, then movies like Oldboy, which are just irregular and cliche, if not even more. Regardless of that, Oldboy has a solid look, no matter what the generic film ever created. * Spoilers * Man is in captivity, man is seeking revenge, man finds he has a relative with a family member, a person's life is over. * End Spoilers * Simply put, this plot line has been used from everything from Greek to modern melodramatic soap operas and countless movies / books. It is so melodramatic and unigiginal when it happens when I happen to, I laughed out loud. Does that mean I'm desensitized freak without emotions because some reviews of this movie say people like me? No. What this means is that the excess plots are laughing at people. The Scary Movie franchise proved it and Oldboy also proved it. Why can't people think of something that is really annoying instead of trying out the clichés that are masked by fancy camera work and classical music? This brings out the blood / gore question. Simply put, it's not there. The director is too scary to even drive the camera on the screen when something happens as if we were watching a children's film or something. Maybe we were. Anyway, I've heard that Oldboy called "the most brutal movie of all time" and "the most annoying movie ever", but when I looked at it, I didn't see anything far away and bother. The whole "gore" is out of the screen and even then the level of violence is not something you haven't seen in PG-13 movies like The Dark Knight or Casino Royale. Why did it even get the R-rating confused by me, much less "the most cruel movie of all time". Seriously, I've seen movies that make Oldboy cute in every level of violence / gore. <br /> <br /> Another big, striking, cheesy mistake is the main villain. Most of his screen time shows his bare butt comedy in the American Pie style, but I think he's oh-so-bad? When she wears her clothes, her hair is slipped back like a mess of Asia, which is mixed up with James Bond's rogue mixed with Austin Powers. He talks like a brain-dead teenager who is recovering from an acid overdose, and his dialogue is so bad that he laughed again. Seriously, Oldboy was more of a laugh at me than any comedy made this year. . <br /> <br /> Finally, Oldboy is for those who enjoy good wine, no sense of humor, and talk about how boring life is during your dinner party. It is for those people who are so busy with their ego forgot how they are unfaithful, and forgot why they are unfair and boring "movies" (never "movies") they enjoy. <br /> <br /> The people I can say are: I like "movies" and "movies" too. I like thoughtful dramas that actually say something about a human being, and I also like meaningless action movies that fascinate me. But the thing is that I like movies and movies, they have to be original. They have to be something I have not seen so many times that I lost the use of the plot. If something is not original, it is expensive. If it does exactly what everyone else is doing, it will be forgotten and boring. Before you give Oldboy another perfect rating because it touched you, maybe you should think about something: wouldn't the film touch the same, but at the same time the original should think more? I just want someone else to understand me. <br /> <br /> Overall: Oldboy is forgotten and cheesy. <br /> <br /> 1/10
