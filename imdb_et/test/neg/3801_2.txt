Success, there are many reasons to do this, but what Irwin Allen thought was such a boring idea to go beyond all logical issues. There are so many open answers to this film that it is ridiculous ... like Poseidon, a monstruous ship with passengers, sailing on the sea and just Michael Caine with his miniature, and the evil Telly Savalas discover the boat ... well, at the beginning of the wreck of the French Sea round the wreck with your helicopter, but when the sunken cruiseship is a daily thing, they just fly away ... What am I trying to say ??? Hmmm, Michael Caine goes on board with sally Field and he can take whatever he sees (diamonds) if there was no Telly Savala looking for the ship's weapons ... my God, why am I really wasting my words here? It is ridiculous and knowing that both Field and Caine were involved, they think their thoughts went through reading the scripts.
