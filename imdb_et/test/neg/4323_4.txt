Lon Chaney Jr returns to the lumber, like mummy Kharis, who is looking for his companion, Annanka, whose soul now lives in the beautiful descendant of Amina (Ramsay Ames). George Zucco, the high priest of Arkan, leaves Yousef Bey (John Carradine) in charge of Kharis to continue his ways of doing evil. Tom (Robert Lowery) must find a way to save his beloved Amina from certain future mummy fears. <br /> <br /> Routine, predictable entry into the Kharis series proves that almost every film follows a certain format / formula. The city is threatened by a mutually intelligent, single-weapon body hidden in an envelope that seems to have given supernatural power to stifle life from bodily men who have been relatively lightly captured by Khar. Frank Reicher, who saw Kharist in action ... and knows a lot about Egyptian history .. in the previous film (The Mummy's Tomb) proves that anyone who has survived a previous collision with a mummy will definitely die when he returns to the next flick. Well produced, but there is no originality that would make it different from other movies. Unfortunately, Carradine's dreams are through his evil Yousef Bey. The embarrassing script error is Kharis, who is well-known for the exhausted, flat-spreading of his right hand, carrying long distances without the unconscious Amina without any bad consequences. One aspect, the shocking climax, where Tom's heroism attempt doesn't go as planned when Kharis keeps his daughter-in-stress hostage, raising the film lightly.
