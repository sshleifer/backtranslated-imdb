It was at SciF last weekend and I had to check it out. After all ... it was with science fiction, vampires and Erika Eleniak. What could go wrong with this B movie? <br /> <br /> A lot. <br /> <br /> To get started: it can't even be classified as a B movie because it would make it into the same league as Roger Corman ... and this film doesn't even meet his expectations. The most money was spent on vampire contact lenses. <br /> <br /> Second: Casting was terrible. Yes, casting Udo Kier as captain of Demeter was a smart move ... but the director couldn't even remember the line of his own. Eleniaki's casting in a vampire film is also a smart move because it means that a bunch of horny boys are buying / renting / storing this flick to see how the vampire seduces him. But the director, the writer, and the producer also turned it off. They got the money out of the poor, the souls who enjoy the vampire movies in their warm women ... but nobody remembers this movie for another two or three years. <br /> <br /> Third, there are few things that just emphasize the laziness of this movie. For example, Van Helsing calls the cross as a "crucifixion" and when I am involved in the coffins, the viewer can clearly see that his "chest" is nothing but pillows. <br /> <br /> Oh and one more thing: Why did they go to George Hamiltion's Dracula, instead of something that would be intimidating? Does George Hamilton have our future overall? Why didn't everyone who saw Dracula laugh at him? <br /> <br /> A waste of time. Even if you have a TiVo remote control.
