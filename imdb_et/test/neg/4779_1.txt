I must say that this film was not what I expected. Even if I haven't read the book, the fact is that the plants get one feed and then wait until the killing takes place just to pull it out of the salmon, the worst case scenario. With the title ruins you think 3000 years, that some deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit. It's like another movie's ancestor where you think it was strange that villagers are most afraid, but not crocodile. In both cases, this film was like that, it attracts you to think of the ruins of Mayan or Inca folklore, which results in awakening and an old god, or when people had another plan of sacrifice or something. What about plants? .... come, is there anything other manufacturers can come to the crowd? As far as this movie is concerned, it will never hit the B list. I have to say that some of the gore was good to see, but it didn't make up for the rest of the movie. And the plant that imitates the sound of the cell phone or the voices of people is just to believe. I'm a fan of horror movies, but I'm not a stereotyped fan based on gore or mechanical effects. I rely on the big gap and what the next scene will skip. It had a better story than it was. Even the ring was more jumping for me, but the ruins are that ... ... was destroyed by using the plant to kill the victims or kill the villagers. The prerequisite was that the villagers kept it as salt and as such, but still there is a simple burner flashlight and lots of napals to easily do the trick to end these irritating plants with meat eating disorder.
