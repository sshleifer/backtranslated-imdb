A great unforgettable story where mercenary Kerman and employer Agren are driving into the jungle in search of Agren's lost sister. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film is related to the cannibal film family, this film is more like Rene Cardona. Guiana - a century of crime. Lenz's goal is obviously to take advantage of the (now) topical Jonestown massacre, depicting a traitor, a self-righteous affection for the bigamy, and just clues to megalomania (played by ruthless intensity by Ivan Rassimov), leading his dirty team to himself forgot. When the sister is toe, Kerman & Agren tries to stop the rotting, but after a series of failed coups, they flee to the "green inferno" to let only the local people and their infamous appetite. <br /> <br /> One of the seventy-seventh rows of gore competitions that appeared at the end of the seventies and early eighties, where it seemed that every new addition to its predecessor was a one-time contest, trying to create the most sparse and graphical image ever shown. This lower installment uses all the other motives and tricks but with much less success. <br /> <br /> Was it the so-called "Amazon Native" who looked like Bollywood's refusals (this film was made at Sri Lanka) or "intuitive" and "castration" scenes, which seriously reduced the authenticity of "cannibalism" Holocaust ‚Äù? You can decide. Without breaking the conclusion, it seemed that Lenzi had put more emphasis on his shock and awe than the basic condition of unified termination, where all open ends were solved. Most dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> As with others, where the range of graphic images of human violence is limited (fortunately), filmmakers have not kept the extreme to create the worst possible cruelty to the most sadistic shocks of these unhappy animals. Unfortunately, the only thing shocking about this film is that it also appreciates what works more convincingly. <br /> <br /> If there is any redeemable qualities at all, Kerman is a somewhat one-dimensional leading person, and his harsh stains (Agren, Lai and Senatore) offer a visual breath.
