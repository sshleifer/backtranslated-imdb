This movie started really tight when a poor young boy was erected from wild dogs. After strenuous pursuit, he saves the grandfather with a magic whip. <br /> <br /> Then we introduce us to a number of tedious housewives, including one cake, who is always half dressed. During this stage, the film increases the strain with strange "plinky plinky" background noise that was on the edge of my seat. strange creature type with things that go around priming and killing. One advisory word if you've ever been trapped in a nut at your home - get some cardboard boxes and ointment. <br /> <br /> Although we went out of the movie because it was completely interesting or memorable, the end of stunning is now the last surviving thing of the creature fighting "whips" with grandfather and his magic whip. I'm not saying what's happening here, but I can say that the whip is full of tension, air struggles, split-level struggles and any kind of drama. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going through this door to a neighbor's door that I don't like.
