The sun was not bright, it was too wet to play, so I went to the movies for the cold, cold, wet date of the day. <br /> <br /> The cat in the cat was the name of the flick and when it was over my stomach was sick. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers played a cat, his humor was flat and the kids didn't have to see it, humor wasn't there. The movie was like drinking milk, a furious cow, so it's fun to have fun, but the filmmakers didn't know how. <br /> <br /> This movie, in short, is cruel. The action was bad, the plot was too much and humor was surprisingly very crude. <br /> <br /> It starts with Conrad and Sally, the rule shredder and the future sheriff. When their mother has to go to work, she gets to Kwan for babysitting. It is possible that the single funny part of the film is when Mrs Kwan is watching the court court in Taiwan, La C-SPAN. Soon he will sleep, and here comes the cat. <br /> <br /> The film starts to control. The cat had to try to let the kids have fun. He has a thing 1 and a thing 2 that suddenly starts to tighten the house. He improvises TV Infomercial and slips the tail inadvertently. And if the cat is full of Carmen Miranda, it's not funny. Perhaps his only funny obscurity is a hippie activist. And there is a fish trying to warn the kids about the cat. <br /> <br /> Too bad he didn't warn us that this movie was as fun as sour milk, or it started to fall off. <br /> <br /> Soon, children outside the family have been looking for a key collar. If the box is not locked soon, their house is home to the universe home. Here it becomes a little more interesting, but not enough to record the movie. <br /> <br /> Generally it works terrible. Mike Meyers brings his brand to the indecent Austin power to a humorous cat, saying things like "You dirty ho" and you portray yourself as a woman for the rest of your life after beating the testicles when they are pinata. Spencer Breslin is great because it creates a desperate Conrad, and Dakota Fanning is as cute as Sally, though alone is not enough to save this terrible Aortic Dissection, waiting for John Ritter to kill (an accident happens). The Alec Baldwin Slip and Slimey Lawrence Quinn is nasty, always catching the mothers of the children played by Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob, the mother's boss, and that's the fish's voice. The last three are also blissful. <br /> <br /> Generally, if I were older, I would not take my children who are potty humor, causing much and much more. Save your $ 7.00 and see something else. As the late big Dr Seuss once said, it is fun to have fun, but you need to know how. Really, Universal, stop! Theodore has already been turned into his grave. <br /> <br /> Like my mother always says, "Curiousity killed the cat".
