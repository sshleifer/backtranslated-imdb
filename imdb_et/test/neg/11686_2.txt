I've never written a comment about IMDb, but this movie was so bad that it left me with little choice but warned you that you wouldn't waste your life for two hours. As an obvious WWII historian, I don't even know where to start when this film was historically inaccurate. Carbines that have Korean war bayonet candles, K98k do not have cleaning radars and observation towers, German uniforms that did not exist can continue this list forever. Added that it is loaded with bugs, is literally a plot or climax and acts as a par for a local high school theater. Excitement. <br /> <br /> PLEASE ... there are too many good WWII movies to waste your time with this spam.
