Altman is very proud that people in their films talk about each other because he says people are doing it alive. Well, people cough, break, come in contact, etc. The point is that just because people actually do something doesn't make it a cinema. This is one problem. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that it is not a wise or direct or a hit or a satire in 1988 or 2004. Garry Trudeau still lives in the 1960s and thinks all except the small core of Republican elected officials is a 60's style hippie liberal. I mean, the boy runs out of Zonker in his band - this is the exact anachronism, but Trudeau still works as he represents the great American youth stripe. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. I'm conservative, but I'm not saying it's bad because it has a liberal bent. It can take a liberal grip and be funny and relevant, but that's not the case. This is mainly a vanity with a number of outstanding celebrity liberals (including nasty, repulsive Ron Reagan, Jr.). Sometimes it doesn't seem to be written, and for the rest of the time it is itself insignificant air and "are we not that smart?" - ness. <br /> <br /> Someone said this show would require it to have a cult. I think the status of this cult is more desired than actual. I am sure there are two or three people who recorded and owned all the original episodes in 1988, but if it is a standard, then any exhibition that has ever emerged is somewhat of a cult class. If Tanner had no Altman and Trudeau names, it would be another forgotten HBO production in the 1980s. Instead, it is presented as a hard-hit, sharper political comment on those players who are at the top of their game. However, reality is as far away as possible. Pat Paulsen's President satire is more important than Tanner has ever been and has died for ten years.
