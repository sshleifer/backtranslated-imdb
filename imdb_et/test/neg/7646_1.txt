Apparently, the film has a tough anti-Bush message ... If that's the case (I didn't get it), that's all. It's boring and useless, a period. <br /> <br /> It is sometimes too serious a comedy, too slow to be a thriller, not funny, not thrilling, not exciting, not a movie. It's all too much to be reversed and vice versa. I was surprised how bad the film might suck. Don't even think about it. <br /> <br /> I have literally looked at hundreds of movies and have never been so obliged to write a warning about IMDb. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> Even "... making" is painfully boring. It's just people who talk about dirty camera internal jokes, such as home video. There's even a part where the boy takes you to the food the film team consumed. But wins the movie I think ...
