Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor compete in this upcoming comedy where nightclub owners are forced by organized crime. Eddie Murphy wrote and directed this unpleasant ego-trip and therefore has no accusation but a failure for it. It's a really bad film that is so energetic and humor that it's just an example of Murphy's contempt for his audience. It would be very easy to continue beating this movie, but I will show more mercy when it showed my audience and stopped now.
