Yes, it must be one of the flattering films I've ever seen. It's totally tasteless, no style, the story is so thin that you can watch TV on it, and the whole movie has so many holes that you can fill it up. <br /> <br /> Of course, I appreciate a good B movie as much as most men do white homo sapiens. But it must be the worst I've seen. In fact, it's B that he doesn't have everything that makes B-film interesting. <br /> <br /> The entire movie is based on charming artifacts such as characters that beat each other, different body functions, and a complete lack of mindset. <br /> <br /> It's not even funny. In fact, it is the opposite. I found it even boring because it is extremely predictable. <br /> <br /> I can't find anything good about this movie. It was a waste of time looking at it and I hope others don't make the same mistake. If you pay for it, you should get serious brains.
