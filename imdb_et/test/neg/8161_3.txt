I have to say I found this movie very disappointing. Yeah, I know Maltin gave him 3 1/2 and the others think it is great. But well, the opera sequences were godly. I'll take it Jeannete MacDonald's acquired taste. Yes, in the short sequences that I saw him with Nelson Eddy, he's a lot better for him. But his own ... God, I don't like opera and I despise the operetta, and he's basically unbearable. At one point I had to cover my ears. Gable is just OK and Tracy is thrown away. Plot JM is annoyed that he just doesn't tell Gable that he loves him and the opera and why he can't do both? Instead, it will quietly (or not) with its compromises. Supporting casting is clearly unmemorable. In addition to the three stars and Jack Holt (and I think his mother) they are all just background and forget. The EQ sequence is the only thing that records a movie. And just. Yes, it is quite remarkable and moving. But "oh God is great" seems very natural. I prefer to catch a huge old catastrophe in Chicago. Keep yourself in it.
