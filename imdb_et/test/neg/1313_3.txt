"Flood" is a great example of how throwing good actors and a movie in a film reduces the waste script. The main premise is good: what if a pleasant storm threatened to send the sea directly to the Thames flood limits and to force London so quickly that most of the population would probably never come out on time? This is basically the New York segment "The Day After Tomorrow", but it shouldn't make this movie less. However, the script just doesn't exist. It's just functional, flat and incomplete. The big British, like Robert Carlysle and David Suchet, call, but the two do their best the best they have, but their characters are two-dimensional cyphers, like something from the old Marvel comedian. and it would be fairer to turn back. Not that every actor starts to knock off - Tom Courtenay seemed to have only one emotion in the film, but he didn't get much of a challenge. <br /> <br /> I appreciate any opportunity to see another - Hollywood catastrophe for change and I don't expect zillions of dollars to be spent on ultra-realistic graphics. However, there is no excuse for writing shonky - especially from a country that has brought some of the best science that is never out of the budget. This is a semi-bitter Class B fluffy coffee created by the Sci-Fi channel and barely a target. If I like you to be a fan of this movie, you still persecute, do yourself a favor and see it with your friends. Better yet; do not worry.
