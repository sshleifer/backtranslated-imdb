In this movie, which X-Files directs to John Shiban, something has happened that has prevented me. You get that feeling when the movie moves, that's not what it looks like, but I feel the film doesn't give you enough to look after it later. It's perception. There are signs that heroine Nicole (Jaimie Alexander) will meet with a film she talks about and disappears. It may seem like a spoiler, but it is something that just starts to focus on the part of filmmakers. They seem to be joking with us when we look curiously whether we should trust what Nicole sees or not. It will never get the right answer and I was a little married for one. The film comes at a time when vagueness may just be frustrating because the viewer is driven by a wild goose chase, which ends in a dead end and has little explanation of what we just saw. psycho drama. Nothing wrong now is wrong, but let us confirm or avoid us. So I felt like I was looking at "Rest Stop". This movie is said to be a young woman named Nicole, who decides to travel to California with her lover Jesse (Joey Mendicino) to make it big in Hollywood. They do what should be a small stop for Nicole to pee, but she descends into terror when she finds her Jesse is completely lost. Someone in a harsh, dusty yellow truck is a nut job that seems to be a lot of trouble for Nicole, and we will soon realize that she is in Jesse's disappearance when things start, when she gets signs, she finds a way out of a very difficult situation. Nicole is far from any existing city and with limited resources to protect herself from the maniac, which gives her some strong evidence of how she can be evil. <br /> <br /> It's a simple part. When a female character begins to play, the film makes a really strange logic, because we are not sure where she came from, how she got there and, more importantly, where she once goes, Nicole tries to release her from her supposed prison toilets. He meets another police officer in the area (Joey Lawrence), who may seem like his rescuer, but if he is also a victim of truck drivers, then again, things are asking if he has ever actually started there. The lorry driver makes torture to Nicole (as she pulls up in bed and tries to detach the wire that the killer has surrounded the door lock, she gets a nasty bite from her). He then puts the toilet in the toilet, leaving him without a permanent shelter. <br /> <br /> This is the timing of truck driver attacks that I have hoped for. Maybe he just wants to torture him, but he will appear appropriately in certain situations where Nicole has time to escape or prepare. It doesn't make much sense for her motives to push the film into an illogical idea. Why does he make himself so obvious? Why does he allow him to prepare? It looks like I'm going out of here to like her career to believe that they will only find ways to escape if she strikes this hope when she comes with her next terrible attack. But why does Shiban decide to play with the viewer if he has Nicole's experience with unusual meetings with people who don't exist? What is Shiban and a writing team? And the family is in RV to cover the film's uninterrupted strangeness. They play a small part of the scheme of things than the religious bigotes, but the film doesn't make enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in that movie at all.
