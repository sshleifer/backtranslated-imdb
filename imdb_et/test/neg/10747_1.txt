The last sentence of this review is a big spoiler. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed Joe Dante's work since Piranha. He has made many different genre parodies that were both funny and honest. <br /> <br /> But this is pure crap. This is a satire that is consistent with smoking - it is both written and direct that it does not leave a) a laugh and b) leave the audience to think. It is a shame because the plot and material are so rich, timely and mature for intelligent commentary. the end of the movie. It's just ridiculous.
