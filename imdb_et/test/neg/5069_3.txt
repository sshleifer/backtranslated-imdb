When I watch this movie, I've realized that I don't like them very much. Women in the cage are another "prison women" and resemble the rest of the genre; The plot is completely abandoned because it just shows naked women. Now don't get me wrong; I love naked women, but I also like the nudity to be accompanied by some kind of nail, and because this film has only the basic "women in prison" topic that runs through it (also a major escape, of course), I got a little bored before the end. The film is good because there is barely a moment when women wear clothes, but that is the only positive element. Director (and writer, ha ha) Erwin C. Dietrich rejoices in showing the naked woman's body close-ups, but it is never very erotic. The director was a producer of several trash bins, including some directors by Jess Franco. In my opinion, he should hold on because his writing skills do not exist, and he does not seem to know how to shoot a sex game. This kind of material is quite dry, but I think Franco would have got it more. All in all, it can be enough for people who actually get into such things; but i can't say i enjoyed it.
