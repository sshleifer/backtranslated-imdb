Having enjoyed Koyaanisqats and Powaqatsi, I waited for this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and saw the direction he had taken. Rarely has the film been so spectacularly unsuccessful that it did not catch up with its predecessors and lost its way. Although it seeks to represent "civilized war" in the form of sport, science, commerce and other forms of competition, it lacks a global scope and even unified themes developed by its predecessors. War is chaos, but even in wars it makes sense and this film had little structure and ambiguous goals. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqats is flawed because it is a chaotic image that does little to develop its theme. The plus side was wisely avoided using some iconic pictures of the wars of the last century. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqats is also so island that many times I had to remind me that I did not look at the advertising lifestyle that promotes American advertising. Perhaps this isolation reflects the ongoing "war on terror". Representing "sport as a war", outstanding team logos ensured that the US became a winner. As a result, it missed the opportunity to portray some of the many sports in the world and to show that humanity has joined the civilized warfare in the use of sport. <br /> <br /> Apart from the newspaper, the film seemed to be budgeted in New York and the rest of the world was not "living as a war". The face gallery (waxwork) provided only the presence of people important to the US. Compilers could not point out that globalization does not mean Americanization. <br /> <br /> The Philip Glass soundtrack sounded like any other Philip Glass score I've heard (with a possible exception from Koyaanisqatsi), and at best it can be described as "inoffensive", which does not lead to a chaotic image or reduce it .
