I am deeply disturbed by some of the posts I've read on the message boards on this movie, people say it's really a good movie! Just because this movie is the best of Uwe Boll does not make a good movie at all, not in hell! Far Cry is a cliché clutter that is full of bad behavior, bad direction, and buggy scenario. It's Boll's first pure action film and news flash people, action movies aren't too hard to do, because for basic operations, only blows and battles of weapons scattered around a thin plot, and hey, Mr. Boll, can do it. The dead house, alone in the dark and Bloodrayne, all the horror games adapted to Boll's movies are far worse (they have no redemption properties). Far Cry has two things that make it the best: two good results and a few well-done action sequences. Til Schweiger is pretty good as Jack Carver and Emmanuelle Vaugier is a strong female leader. Usually a large Udo Kier is passable, because the cliché smashing and supporting cast is pretty bad. At the end of the movie, there is a surprisingly tight tracking sequence that came in shock, as Boll was behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the rest of the movie has this incredibly cheap feeling, bad CGI, single liner and clichés around every corner. Oh, and the worst thing to manage is the sex game I think I've ever had in the scene. These two hours have not only knew each other, but it is all when he says he kept his army warm when he fought his soldiers. She already got her clothes off when she just said. Then he took off and climbed to bed because he was afraid of hypothermia. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a bad movie. This is a nonsense action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you're completely bored. One might think that it is worse than opening it and looking at it, but I would say personally that I look at a classic film like Die Hard or Predator and away from the confusion derived from it. <br /> <br /> 1½ / 5
