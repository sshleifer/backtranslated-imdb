I don't remember, for at least the last ten years, a movie that I liked less than Mama Mia. Ever since I lost my deeds that acted in terrifying singing, I started at least once a minute. I don't think I can even recall one short segment that I tolerated. I know I will never see this catastrophe ever. I can't believe that because of the talents with such high expectations - Colin Firth, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, that the film could be such a flop. But to see the lack of action shown, the seemingly drug-induced dancing, and the horror of horror, hear Pierce Brosnan's song (!), I don't see how this film does it in the hall. Certainly, the movie that you should never have done, and just when you missed it for the first time, what I never see again.
