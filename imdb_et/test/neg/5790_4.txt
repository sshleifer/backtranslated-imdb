I learned a little about this movie, which I didn't know from CNN and The New York Times. (And I did not follow the Enron case obsessively as some others did.) The film did a very bad job explaining what "business" Enron actually did before it started to hide its debts in the units created by Andy Fastow. It also significantly reduced the role of Arthur Andersen and Vinson & Elk in validating such illegal activities. Nor did it go as far as it would have looked at what "investors" - all prominent bankers - thought they were doing. Documentary films have grown with a 24-hour cable network, Discovery Channel, and a history channel. I've seen a lot of things that were better during the year.
