I happened to accidentally find this movie when I was looking for something to watch at lunch. I actually turned to the WE network because he said he had a last 20-minute film about the importance of some "gymnastics" for a gymnastics team - I thought it was good. Well, I got well. At first I missed the answer for 20-40 minutes at the beginning of the movie. Fortunately, most of it was quite fast, especially in the bedroom scene, where Crystal admits that he was responsible for his rapist's death. She is just so beautiful, and I want my lipstick to look as perfect as she always does. She looks like the whole look of the movie and does not really age more than ten years. In general, I felt this movie looked bad for the actors. All of them tried to sell their parts, but everyone was so badly written that it was a constant struggle. Frankly, I was surprised that Terry Farrell and Mitch Ryan (Greg's father Dharma & Greg) saw it. <br /> <br /> But writing wasn't the worst part of this movie. About half an hour before the end, his mother dies, and if they show that death was in 1979, it was overdue, I had the impression of a wardrobe in the 80s. Not one leisure suit or the bottom of the clock. Shame on the person who made this movie wardrobe! Don't do me wrong - all the equipment in this movie was beautiful, but they were totally wrong over time. It makes me wonder if they tell the garderoobile that this is a periodic piece. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - good for laughing or feeding Jennie Garth. :)
