*** SPOILERS *** This movie - called EATEN ALIVE here in the UK - is probably the worst film and it is great for that. Sexy rich girl team with a tough action guy to look for her sister in the New Guinea jungle. The following is explicitly a mixture of cannibalism, a mad cult, and a religious maniac, which must be considered credible. The cannibalism scenes are quite terrible, but they are so badly staged and acted to be quite fun. The cast is terrible, except for Janet Agren, who is a great female leader. Pay attention to the scene where she is naked and covered with gold! My rating - 1 out of 10.
