Despite its ambitious ambitions, Zurlin's film must be seen as a failure. One thing is to create a world that attracts the viewer to experience the protagonist's experience (and I think Zurlin was trying to do that). This is another thing to do with a movie that is intrinsically annoying and pointless episodic. In spite of the beautiful cinematography of the strange location - and a great result - the film never comforts the audience. Too much is unintentionally funny (for example, the sound of dragged fake in a quarter of Drago or the silence of some people's silent movie). actors) or just confuse (Why exactly Drago wants to leave fort for the first time?) to make the film coherent.
