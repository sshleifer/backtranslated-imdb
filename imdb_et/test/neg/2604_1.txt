I have to admit that I enjoyed previous episodes, but probably because I was younger and stupid at that time. I was sorta excited about the family member's return until I saw the "new" mess they put out. Not surprisingly, it was just like an old mess. All the flat jokes there were also flash backrests, except this time when they added jokes about an old creepy pedophile that seems to be any single EPISODE. it is just one of the annoying family members of gags who live and for some reason watch people. it is no longer funny, but just annoying. let him die. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the family boy was funny at the moment and the cheap laughs and gags were original and fresh, but now it's just funny. if you really find that a family boy is funny if you have to be slowed down or demarcated.
