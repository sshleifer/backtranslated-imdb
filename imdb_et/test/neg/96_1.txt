Seriously, I can't imagine how someone could say one attractive thing about this movie. How many methamphetamines was Bogdonovitch during this filming? Did she give the actress a bonus that created her lines the fastest and the slightest with influx or thinking? The dialogue is bad, scary for the plot, even for "comedy", and claims that the film is a tribute to the classic film comedy, which is the most kind of thing I've ever heard. Cinematic art is below the quality and innovation exhibited by the worst television shows, acting as a terrible (although I have the feeling that its guilt is exactly on the director's lap) and talking about whether I mentioned that the direction is so casual and incomprehensible that it violates word definition? The whole thing is terribly unpleasant (even in so many bad, funny clunkers in many countries), sucking the soul, destroying your life for two hours so you never get back. Don't be afraid, be afraid ...
