And you would be right. Black Mama, White Mama, also known as "Women in Chains", is exactly the kind of trashy and crappy b-movie that the assumption requires. Pam Grieri has been thrown into jail with a small island with many other women, and this place is serious about the summer camp, where Martha Stewart is locked up, like the largest security prison. In the film, it is not five minutes for one of the hottie guards to talk about "Strip em and get wet" and then introduce us to a life in prison that resembles the fantasy fantasy of college as the inside of a corporation house is like. <br /> <br /> Prisoners soap and rub and shower with each other in the shower, as is the case with the girls who are in the forest, they all hang together in their dormitory, openly smoke in the pot and discuss in the big group what would be the best ways to escape . I've never been in prison, but I have the feeling that escape plans are something you want as few people as possible to know, prisoners or guards, or otherwise. The biggest difference between this prison life and the life of some fantasy corporation is that the women in this movie wear orange cardigans (and pants don't go). There must be the general prison equipment of the prisons that cannot get the most suitable clothes, such as their prison name or prison numbers for their uniforms. <br /> <br /> And, as expected, a prison that can't afford the identification of prisoners on the back of a uniform can probably not expect to be able to find guards who are interested in guarding prisoners as much as they are in prison and having sex with each other. <br /> <br /> The movie's title refers to the fact that Lee Daniels (Pam Grier) spends most of his time handing down a blonde prisoner to Karen because they have run from police to escape from prison. I will not go into details about how they flee, except to say that you would have seen something like this in Fugitive if they could not get on the train wreck, and this would lead to a confused conflict of interest. these two women for different reasons. Both Karen and Lee have their own gangs, everyone hoping to save their escaped prisoner, and police officers are both. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) So Karen is tied to hippies that want to revolutionize life. Meanwhile, Karen just wants to get out of the island, which she has been trying to do for years, and it is not perfect for them to go to the opposite side of the island to achieve their goals. So we get this odd pair tied and because they are strange couples, it's hard to predict that they hate each other for most of the film, but eventually grow with each other. <br /> <br /> With so many conflicting interests in the movie, especially if these contradictory interests do not reach just two major characters in the pursuit of these two goals, it is not unreasonable to assume that rival prosperity will be involved in the film at some point in the climate. Do not leave anyone unhappy, but throw a silly gang at the end of the movie, where everyone lets each other kill the gun, killing each other massively, while two women drive safely and peacefully across the river in a small boat. Nice. Better yet, at the end of the film, after a massive massacre where many people shoot and shine bright red all over the place, the police captain looks over the masses of the dead. Criminals covered terrible and terrible special effects, and we learn to be great before dinner. Not a bad way to finish the movie, all criminals kill each other and the police get all the credit, but here's the last line of the movie? "It's better to win, isn't it?" <br /> <br /> Is it why the captain is starting to promote Major? Because he thought it was?
