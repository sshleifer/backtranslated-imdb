All I can do is laugh. Wow. I like Jim Wynorsk's movies, I really do. Chopping Mall is classic. But what happened to this man? He made funny horror movies that tried to be good. But it was hardly even funny ... I think it was because I laughed. The villain is incredible. I mean, terrible CGI. It seems ... terrible. And the film has no gore or nudity as redeeming qualities. It's rated PG-13. A movie called "Bone Eater" that you know is not a blocking film, you know it probably doesn't have a smart script. Such a film can be based on gore ... but not. It really doesn't depend on anything, it's just ... crap. If you want to laugh, look at it. But don't wait for a good movie. I hope Jim Wynorski goes back to movies like Chopping Mall and Ghoulies IV because it and Komodo Vs. Cobra won't cut it.
