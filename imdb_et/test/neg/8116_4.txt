I have to admit that I am ashamed that the impressive young teenager was one of my favorite musicians below the horror cooler. Nine years after seeing the fearsome story of Stephen King, I have now come to my mind and can judge Fritz Kiersch's work more rationally. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the king's story of small farmers in Nebraska who is an upward-looking young demonic preacher boy and his sadistic tie is really annoying to the paper, but it is a cheap, average horror show in celluloid. Much of this result may be due to the fact that Kiersch almost promises to start the movie as a hacker and then makes the final hocus-pocus a special nightmare for special effects. <br /> <br /> Cast is reasonable, but they can only represent as much credibility as it is quite unbelievable, the top film promises them, and Jonathan Eliasi's soundtrack is spookier than the pictures. <br /> <br /> A real shame that George Goldsmith's scenario made Stephen King's short story of a shocking horror. Isaac, Malachai and all other "Corn of the Corn" are not really all scary. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 7, 1994 - Video
