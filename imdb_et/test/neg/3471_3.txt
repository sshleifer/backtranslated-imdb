"Imperium Nero" is the second film of six "Imperium" productions. I've already commented for the first time on "Imperium Augustus". The other TV movie produced and broadcasted by the Italian national network last weekend has the same mistakes. In addition, it contains a significant number of historical errors. Some examples: Nero is a child and Agrippina calls him: "Nero, Nero". At that time, the name is Claudius. He was named Nero after the adoption. Nero did not respond to Acte when he was young, like in the movie, but after his marriage to Octavia and his candidate for the emperor. Becoming an emperor, his sons, if not adults: Britannicus is one month old and Octavia one year old. And many more. If you like the old Roman history, you can find other examples. The "Imperium" series continues with four more films: "Titus", "Marcus Aurelius", "Costantinus" and "The Fall of the Roman Empire". Finally!
