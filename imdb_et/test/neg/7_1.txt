The legendary fiasco of Blake Edwards will seem meaningless after 10 minutes. Eagle's combination has landed, Star !, Oh! What a lovely war! And Edwards' Pink Panther films, Darling Lili never participate in the audience; Air series, musical numbers, romance, comedy and espionage are all terrifying. At what moment should the viewer give a damn? This catastrophe stands out, never decides what it wants to be, and thinks it's silly, but it's pathetic and grinding. In the worst way, outdated, kept the audience away from understanding. It's terrible. James Garner would have been a huge advancement to Hudson, who is just a cardboard, and he doesn't connect with Andrews and vice versa. And both Andrews and Hudson do not seem to be laughing and appearing wrongly calculated seriously. Blake Edwards' SOB is not much more than OK, but it is the only good that ever came out of Darling Lili. Darling Lili's many expensive and professional outlooks only do what it is even harder to wear. Quote by Paramount chief Robert Evans, "$ 24 million worth of film and no picture".
