I'm pretty sure Poe would have considered it a travesty. The first two tracks are decent, something remarkable. And then there is Toby Dammit. What was on earth, did Fellini think? It's a brisk, casual, boring piece, little to recommend. It should be a disappointment if there is no background or conclusion, but there is only a relief that has ended.
