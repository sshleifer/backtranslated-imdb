Although the figures are higher than those of other social areas, I am not opposed to the very high salaries of many modern entertainers and athletes. <br /> <br /> A-Rod, LeBron, or Brady are all deals well with 8-digit or low-9-seat deals. Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld could really become billionaires at their exhibitions, the big debts and the fees they currently demand. Even their members and all groups of "friends" reached almost 7 numbers per episode. The income of one of Letterman's exhibitions could be solved by the financial problems of most people and take care of many for a week or two. <br /> <br /> But all of these are based on reliable supply / demand principles and their financial performance for employers. And everyone is gently filling their crafts. <br /> <br /> But then someone comes along like Rachel Ray who reaches a level much higher than any talent or skill. I find that he is embarrassing, annoying and forced to "frustrate", which is like a fake "$ 3 bill". <br /> <br /> My friend is responsible for meetings, events and conference plans at his company and its affiliates. One of the biggest sources of talent is the hundreds of customers available from $ 5-10K for a handful of people who get $ 200K and more. (This area includes Trump, Seinfeld, Lance Armstrong, Robin Williams, and jokes, Larry Cable Guy.) <br /> <br /> There is a higher number in the $ 100,001 - 200,000 range; for example, Bill Cosby, Steve Martin, and even cable man Larry benefactor Jeff Foxworthy. <br /> <br /> This category includes Rachael Ray. I think I have to admit that there may be enough demand for his "talents" to offer his speech and there may be some who pay more than $ 100K, + first-class air, hotel suite, all costs and limits on the door- to my door, just a few hours of his shame, at their organization's event. <br /> <br /> I just can't understand how this is possible in hell.
