Carole Lombard stars in this transition period. This film is a typical example of a very early "talkie" (the first practical soundtrack was "The Jazz Singer", 1927). In general, acting in this film tends to be extremely broad and very melodic. <br /> <br /> The viewer can easily point out that the actors are still "silent" with the silent movie, and it combines with an overly pronounced, overly serious dialogue (It seems most likely that the dictation-defiance-drama coach worked extensively to teach " silent "actors on the line to talk about", creates some pretty comic scenes that were not meant to be a comic at all. <br /> <br /> Later, Carole Lombard's grand capability is all gestures, melodrama, and eager recognition. <br /> <br /> Mainly interesting as historical curiosity, and it is a totally involuntary comedy camp value.
