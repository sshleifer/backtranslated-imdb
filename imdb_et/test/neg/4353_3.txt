A big knife, a film from the dark side of the Hollywood film industry, is ironically much more than a filmed game than a film itself. In addition to some very short exposures, all the action takes place in the film's hero's living room, played by Jack Palance. He is an actor in the film who wants to release his contract because of his studio because there are no redemption features in their films. She has again left her wife (Ida Lupino) again in the studio, not to mention her husband's media. Unfortunately, for both, the studio leader (Rod Steiger) is a real bastard. He has blackmail material to force an increasingly tortured actor to sign a new contract. But this is only a matter of time before he pushes the man too far. <br /> <br /> This movie is not, I repeat, NOT a movie noir. Rather, it is an exceptionally melodrama in the theater-seating area. The plot runs at a snail's pace and is so complicated and confusing that it is in a violent mismatch with static setup and carefully constructed blocking of real scenes. The action is extremely burned and is moving sharply between histrionics and softer, but no less unpleasant, soliloquies, which is obviously meant to be an embarrassing but contradictory turn, especially in the shameful shameful Palance. Aldrich apparently went out of stylized "something" here, but I doubt that even if he knew what it was, and certainly not the audience at all. <br /> <br /> I think the main lesson is that movies and games are very different media. What could have worked in the game did not come as credibly as naturally or in the film. The result? Great waste of time. Here's a little enjoyment.
