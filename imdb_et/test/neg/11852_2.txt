This movie is sad. According to my fellow IMDb users (* SPOILER *), RAPTOR uses stock from Carnotaur films. Well, since I haven't seen Carnotaur movies, I can't say. But I notice that some very bad edits and even worse operation. This film is one of the great steam s ***. It makes no sense. Here is the thing that calls itself PLOT: Mad scientist creates spies. The raptors kill people. The Sheriff is investigating. * SPOILER * (although I don't know what it is that I've corrupted) Sheriff is trying mad doctor plans. Army boys are sent and predators are going to kill the army guys. Raptors. Yeah, of course. I could make a clay image that seems more real. FX is the cheapest in the movie. There are many gore. Cheap gore. It's not even real. I agree with another person who appreciated this movie, the only thing this film has done is that it ends. This movie has about two seconds of originality. And it will only come when the sheriff speaks by telephone with a payment intermediary about his electricity bill or something. This idea has been used in around 100,000 other films with 100,000 different names. In general, I give RAPTOR 1/5 just because of its end.
