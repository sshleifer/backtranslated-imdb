this film was directed by Roger Avery and Quentin Tarantino, who made the scenario, I was sure it would be a pearl. I was wrong. I don't tolerate this movie, but I don't like anything. <br /> <br /> I love Roger Avery because of his amazing direction in attraction rules and his scenarios to reach cellulose and a quiet hill, but he made a mistake. Is it really necessary to comment on Tarantino, we all know he is a genius. <br /> <br /> This movie is simply put around a gang who kidnaps the bank, but can't be stupid because of the stupid people <br /> </p> thoughts on how amazing they are. everyone makes mistakes ......... 3/10 ........... j.d Seaton
