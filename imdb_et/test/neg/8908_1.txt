What is the film the film is about? The script is simply non-existent. Sometimes the movie looks like a music video. But it can't even be that because the soundtrack is not suitable. Pathetic way to combine action and rap. One might think that this is a recipe for a successful flick ... here it fails. Dialogues on this flick killed me easily. The scene where a policeman listens to Harlan is simply pathetic. In general, the latest Seagals films are hardly traceable. What the hell was the boy doing? I know he's old, but does he get "Hollywood" that he's a decent script or something? Does he run away from India when he takes something he serves?
