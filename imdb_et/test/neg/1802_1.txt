The production of the darkness of 1994 was by no means capable of performing an outstanding book. The film contained unnecessary scenes that confused the viewer rather than helping them understand what was happening. The director was apparently not experienced and when he was, he didn't show it. Besides, the scenes in the book were out or changed, scenes that were quite important. The film was quite boring for me and was a complete waste of my time. The characters acted as if they had no idea what was happening, and the actors did not portray the emotions of Marlow and the rest of the book. All in all, the film was terrible and there was no such relationship, which was otherwise necessary to make it even more interesting.
