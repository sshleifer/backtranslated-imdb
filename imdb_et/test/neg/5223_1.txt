Recently, I had the idea of ​​making a short film that includes a man hit by a car and wakes up thinking that he is Chuck Norris himself. This meant that I had to do Chuck's extensive research and find as much as I could for that person. Later I find out that he is not really a man, but an angel sent from heaven. With a face that would ever suspect it? I've been watching more Chuck Norris movies than any person in the last four months. I'm proud to say that Innocence watches are at the top of the worst list ever. I spent most of the movie, wondering if I could send my copy back to local Wal-Mart without a receipt I had bitten to keep my tongue swallowing. The biggest reason I chose to buy this movie was that it had not only Chuck but his son Mike. I was worried to see if Mike was an old chip in an old wet-paper bag block. I have long come to the conclusion; Chuck Norris is one of the easiest reasons for one of the worst participants in the history of cinematography. The only sign he ever plays is Chuck Norris. Whatever the film, regardless of the situation, he is always Chuck Norris. One thing he has about his son is that he is consistent. Mike does not understand how human emotions work. In a scene where she talks to a little girl about her dead daughter, she seems to be very happy! Perhaps it is because he brought his daughter to traffic, as shown in one of the most uncomfortable setbacks of time. His action interfered with me in the whole film, so it was very difficult for me to focus on what a small plot was. The other two leading actors were just as painful as watching Norris's son. A boy who wants to eat constantly or say silly peacock, was just one of the most annoying symbols ever brought on the screen. The only thing I remember about being in the movie other than this movie was the Walker Texas Ranger episode, where he plays an equally annoying character. Maybe Chuck owes something to this man. Another man who is the only name I think he was so forgotten was your average Christian fanatic. I have nothing against Christians, actually I'm one, but this man was too much for me. To round up the story, you have a lot of townspeople who love to call people "friends" and a few villains who don't seem to be able to decide which one is responsible. Not to mention the scary children who remind me of every other group of creepy kids in the movie dollar store. All in all, the film is likely to be one of the greatest failures of all time, more than the Chuck Norris can beat people's asses. Despite being one of the worst actors ever, I still don't get enough Chuck. Maybe he was really sent from heaven ...
