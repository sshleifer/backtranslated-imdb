I was extraordinary in this movie in July 1975 in Dallas. Some of the films that you see today and in the making of the film were taken for granted in this movie. Prerequisite, costumes, special effects, actors. It was all before his time. It opened the door for films such as "Star Wars", "Terminator", "Matrix" and "X-Men". Now people are watching this and they say, "Well, this doesn't add to this new story of special effects ..." It didn't include computer graphics and new movies like those days. It had a story and a wonderful director and director of hell! Places where it was filmed, such as Dallas World Trade Center, Zale Building and Ft. Worth Water Gardens at that time were the most modern and futuristic films. Director Michael Anderson was very creative and he tried to show a perfect future that was faulty due to the person's desires and weakness. It was my first film experience, the first of the six movies I've been. Just because it was filmed in Texas, it doesn't make it a less wonderful filmmaker art. Review it again and rate it more. This film was the foundation that set the standard for many great films. Well, my hand is flashing ... I have to run. Santuary is waiting ...
