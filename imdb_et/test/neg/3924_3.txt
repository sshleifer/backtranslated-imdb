There is nothing particularly unique or interesting about this small sci-fi flick. Regardless of the origin of your genealogy (the film is based loosely on Leo Tolstoy's novel), the plots and general themes of this film are not at all remarkable or original, science is at best weak and unfortunately the film cannot even incorporate compelling sequences of activities. <br /> <br /> The start of the plot is manned by a spacecraft on Mars, and although the main plot does not rise until the ship lands, most of the most interesting scenes on the route take place. Unfortunately, as soon as our interplanetary passengers coincide, their previously interesting interpersonal relationships, speculation about the meaning of cosmology and life, and everything that is interesting about the film, they all take for granted only a far-reaching plot of Mars' revolutionary, environmental problems, and not very convincing scams. <br /> <br /> There is nothing very remarkable about the quality of film production. This is satisfactory. And most of the actors are slowly OK. Cameron Mitchell is actually pretty good and plays a nice character. I think the best quality of this movie is, from my point of view, the idea of ​​this fashion. Martians have very nice equipment! If this film had a meaning, it could be much more interesting. Oh well.
