What should have been a dramatic life on the Murray River would be a stupid, foolish romance for the English refugee (Sigrid Thornton with an Aussie accent) who falls on the larrikine's first companion (John Waters). The first half of this four-and-a-half-hour mini-series has some promise, but will soon fall as it becomes predictable and slim. The film needed some real air and spark of life. The early departure of Gus Mercurio didn't help because his character seemed to me the only one interesting. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the longer the television version is deeper, because there was definitely no video translation. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 27, 1993 - Video
