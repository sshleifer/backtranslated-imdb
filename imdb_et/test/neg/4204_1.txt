I work at the weekend office and there is a TV that only receives one channel. So, I have no way to improve anything. I still keep it because it gives little background noise. Sometimes I get a decent movie / show. Not today. Today I got "Breaker Breaker". The city looks like a third price class (which of course is). All actors and bad guys look like they just finished stuntman school. I've seen better dramatic laws at the carnival. Special effects (flames at the end of the film are more counterfeit than Michael Jackson's masculinity). Even at the end of the movie, the horse was a terrible actor ... A badly-done, poorly-photographed, poorly written film.
