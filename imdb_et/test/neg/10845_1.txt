I rented this movie for about $ 1.50 - the most complete waste of money (and time) I've ever spent. It's LAME! I couldn't believe how they could bring out something like that. <br /> <br /> Plot ... no plot. All you think this is happening is only in a worse way. Operation was terrible. My dog ​​could have done better. Special effects have no effect - except complete disbelief. And cheesy lines ... I mean, why even trouble? <br /> <br /> The only credit I can give to this sh * t is the scenes that open up. They were actually pretty pretty. And one reason I decided to rent it. The graphics shown are probably the best and most realistic CG in the movie. <br /> <br /> Total Reality gets 1 out of 10 to miss it.
