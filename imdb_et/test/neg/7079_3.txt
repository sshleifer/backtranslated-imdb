It was a promise to be an interesting film. The theme was definitely promising - the Catholic Church's excessive counter-reformation. But it was not only developed (except for the introduction of the two paragraphs), much was not explained - ie the gypsies, the anabaptists, the investigators, and their relationship with one true church. Nor did it explain the time policy, that is, the relationship between the Catholic Church and its supporters, such as the Emperor of the Holy Roman. Although they may be obvious to the Austrian audience, the lack of explanation makes the Americans confused. <br /> <br /> But maybe it's good that they didn't emphasize history because what they showed was quite inaccurate anyway. The stars of the movie are torture instruments, bloody executions, witch and heretic burns, big shiny swords and pretty golden relics. It could have been as simple as one of Conan's sword and witch films, only with periodic costumes ...
