I don't think I've ever given any 1/10 rating, but it can easily name it. It's hard for me to just sit by one of his jokes. It's not just that the jokes are so bad, they combine the fact that Carson Daily has zero charisma, can't create or stop a punchline, and you have a late-night comedy recipe that really turns your stomach. <br /> <br /> I've seen the show, never as a whole, but many times. It just slips me over to Conan. I usually watch for a few minutes to see if Carson is still the worst talk show. <br /> <br /> In fact, when you see him interviewing a guest, it's just an interview. I feel so sorry that every time he has a guest and their confused smiles try to hide his body language that screams, "give me this fuck away!" I recommend showing, not laughing, but thinking about how he got into the air and what he was still doing there. See as much as possible, I think you'll find this complete discomfort ... interesting.
