Here is a film that clearly shows that banks are being marketed as an exotic to an audience who does not know his substance. <br /> <br /> A fixed and document hybrid test, "Kadosh" is thrilling in the chairs. As a documentary, it is neither accurate nor sensible on the one hand. In order to realize the details of your sloppy handling, you have to go beyond the opening plan, where it is quite obvious that the ultra-orthodox protagonist does not even know how to put his t'fil correctly. More generally, the tedious presentation of the details (in this case the Jewish ultra-orthodox ritual) is the role of the manual, not a good documentary; the latter should provide the viewer with an organizational principle (if desired) so that he / she can see a better understanding of what is being seen. This has not obviously happened here because the ultra-Orthodox ritual is even more mysterious. The director seems to have done all the oral explanatory work during the film release campaign; kinematically, this is a serious case of turning. However, as a fictional feature, it suffers from the parity of character, the simplicity of the plot, and the nuance of the message. At some point, I felt like I was looking at a comic. (eg the perfect scene of a wedding evening - without detailed angles, positions and dimensions ... well, technically it may not be a realistic human sex, wild as it may be.) <br /> <br /> There are no nuances in this movie. Smart manipulation of tips, stimulating the viewer's imagination, and active participation in movie text, which I think is a sign of good quality, are completely missing. On the contrary: watching the film seemed to be powered over and over, sometimes chewing and too obvious. Indeed, when the director Gitai himself interviewed, the architectural "objects moving in space" and then paint the scenes with appropriate emotions when they are called and developed on the appropriate and predictable trail of the plot; but the spark, this creative, duo-like darkness, incomprehensible spark (do not forget that "Kadosh" is said to be a tragedy) that casts a spell on a two-dimensional screen, making it an extension of the world of viewers, there are no traces. Perhaps the work of a visual engineer, perhaps a complex ideologist; certainly not a real filmmaker. What I saw was rather a passionate game than real people, not meat-blood-and-complexities. In general, the idea of ​​making a film (sometimes even tortured) could not be overcome. One remarkable, albeit relatively small, exception was the Meadow Lady and the Mother, both played with excellent and flavored Lea Koenig. <br /> <br /> It takes more than a rigorous winning formula (namely, serving exotics, plus a heartbreaking but simple melodrama, plus a popular agenda, preferably politically correct, to hug my hobbies. It is said below that a significant portion of the movie Despite being a novel, maybe even a pioneer in using an ultra-orthodox neighborhood as a film set, for which Mr Gitai and his team deserve all the praise, I also found "Kadosh" too Nadosh ("trite" in Hebrew).
