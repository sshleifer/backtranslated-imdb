Riggs and Murtough are back, but the magic of the first movie has broken down. The story is just terrible! I really mean South African diplomats who smuggle the mythical Krugerand into the US. It's just painful! And the accents are absolutely sad! Does anyone get the South African accent of Afrikaans correctly? Or can we hear forever the British or the Americans sound like drunk Hollanders? The only guy who got Afrikaans accent was Tim Robbins Catch A Fire. Another thing about this movie that I didn't like was when Danny Glover described the African accent as meaningless as joking! I mean what faces the Africans face. There's also enough hypocrisy in this movie to vomit me. I mean, Mel Gibson's character is against diplomats, but then sleeps his P.A. type! Don't waste your time looking at this garbage without exploring the movie. If you want to see a movie that doesn't break the culture group, rent Die Hard 2.
