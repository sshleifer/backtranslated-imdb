I just saw it in TCM tonight and I was shocked by Jean Arthur's overflow. Seeing her as a surprise and doing just about anything else was not the same as Dietrich and Art Lund. Dietrich was admirable and comical. He's the best thing about this movie. The Wilder Gags were flat and, frankly, something College College writes about trying to "get in" w / wicked, witty and dirty, but just sounded boring and not funny at all. It seemed that humor was being pushed too hard to be funny. The end ended completely. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD: Never for a moment did I think Art Lund suddenly fell out of love, then he was suddenly in love with Arthur. Oh, Billy. Get real! 3 out of 10
