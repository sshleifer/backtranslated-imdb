When I put this movie on my DVD player and sat down with coke and some chips, I had some expectations. I was hoping that this movie contained some of the strong points in the first movie: Awsome animation, good flowing story, great voice-cast, funny comedy and kick-ass soundtrack. But for my disappointment, Atlantis is not one of them. Milo's return. If I had read some comments first, I wouldn't have that. The next section is directed to those who have seen the first film and who liked it mainly for the points mentioned. Milo's return from local video shops (or any) screen and had expectations. Music seems to be a bad imitation of the first film, and the voice is replaced with a less suitable voice. (Except for some characters like Sweet). Actual drawings are not so bad, but especially animation is a sad sight. The style is also rather weak, as it is more than three Schooby-Doo episodes as a single adventurous story we last got. But don't misunderstand, it's not a very good episode of Schooby-Doo. I did not laugh once, even though I could have hit one or two times. a quick review of this movie as an independent product: If you like schooby-doo, you might like this movie. If you didn't, you can still enjoy this movie if you have nothing else to do. And I suspect it might be a good children's film, but I don't know. Perhaps it would have been better if Milo's return had been a three-episode series in a comic channel or on breakfast television.
