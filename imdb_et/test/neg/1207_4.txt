I'm rarely so hard at the film. Note that I laughed at AT Iron Eagle, not because it's probably a stupian movie I've ever seen (except for the sci-fi monstrosity CyberTracker). You should also remember that this movie is not comedy! <br /> <br /> Even despite the insecure plot (the idea that a 16-year-old could walk to the US Air Force base, steal F-16, fly to the Middle East and kill about a thousand people without anyone noticing it is incredible) ), the film is full of ridiculous activities that make little or no sense. For example, at different points, Doug Masters uses a machine on its plane to shoot a steel beam, a guide tower and a tent. All these things explode in a massive fireball. Why? The enemy aircraft also explode in a strange way that resembles a paper plane blown with fireworks. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I enjoyed this movie. Of course not as the makers probably wanted to enjoy it, but I smiled and later bought a DVD. This has also been improved by the terrible presence of David Suchet, a leader of evil terrorists (maybe you recall him as a black-eyed detective Poirot?) In summary, this film is a ridiculous and frivolous alternative to a more serious fighter platform for films such as Top Gun. Even if it is just as homo-erotic (see the man's hugging between Doug and Chappy. Something's going on between 'em!')
