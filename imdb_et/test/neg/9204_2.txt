A spaceship in some unspecified future, where people are equipped with space launches and have gun pistols, breaks the strange planet, where dinosaurs are randomly developed and only in this world, have not disappeared ... yet. Crash Survivors, about ten happy characters wearing blue, white and yellow suits, are fighting for survival against alien prehistoric monsters. <br /> <br /> "Dinosaur's Planet" is a peculiar film. As I said in the summary above, the animated dinosaurs in motion in the film are the only colored actors. Models are crude, but are animated effectively. And they are much more exciting and intriguing than those experienced by experienced participants and the talking lines represent a script that has to be written overnight without one correction. Obviously, most of the budget was put on dinosaurs, and although their share is fair, we are not nearly as bored. These human characters are only there to shout, move around and deal with these poorly written and literal speeches for survival. And, unfortunately, dinosaurs have not eaten enough of them. <br /> <br /> In general, "Dinosaur Planet" is not a movie I can see again. Some people just love it so cheaply and poorly made. Sometimes I enjoy such movies. But this particular film is too long, too boring and very painful.
