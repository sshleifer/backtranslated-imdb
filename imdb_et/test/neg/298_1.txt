How can you make fun of the mafia? It's not such a laugh! The middle film can't make me laugh because I compare it to Jane Austen's mafia! Mafia! was not a good movie, but the hood is really worse! In Mafia !, there were some good jokes, but there are two or three ... that make you smile. Not too bad actors, but very bad scenario !! We definitely prefer something serious like a godfather. I'll give it out *****.
