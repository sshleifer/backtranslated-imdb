I think it was like Lizzie McGuire, except that it was much worse than the original. the only thing that is different is that he likes animals and science and all that geeky stuff. everything else is the same. he likes a boy that he is too nervous to ask. and later he finds a man who likes him and has no idea. I think people have to give up doing similar exhibitions. and the other thing that is the same is that always melting friends are two girls and one boy. Do people think that these things are aging and tired, and these ideas are used over and over and they continue to use these ideas. but I know people who watch this show and I know they like it.
