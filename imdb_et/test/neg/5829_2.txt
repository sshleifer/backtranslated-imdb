Very silly high school / teen flick about geeks trying to prove themselves better than rich brats. Sound familiar? This director Rod Amateau's television movie ("Uncommon Valor" and some "Deaf Duke" episodes believe it or not) says nothing, does nothing, and definitely has little to entertain. who is on television, including Michael J. Fox, Bob Denver ("Gilligan") and Todd Bridges ("Different Blows"). This flat effort barely crosses the line. It also stands for Anthony Edwards ("E.R."). <br /> <br /> Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video
