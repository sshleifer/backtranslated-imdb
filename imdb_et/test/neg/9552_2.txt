I saw it this morning in the Fox channel quite randomly (my dog ​​woke me up) - I had seen it years ago and thought I could remember it quite well. As a child, I enjoyed it. But now? When the second poster commented, several rolls were unsuccessful and initially uncomfortable and odd, it seemed to fit the production - what was just terrible became surreal and amusing. Musical numbers about what I thought was a "big" money-handling show ("you're in an exhibition project, I'm in the showroom, most kids in the show business, show up at the show") nowhere are you talking about the show and then bounce without the oranges completely interconnected "straight" scenes. A leading man's girlfriend appears, spits out lines and dialogs, then disappears. I was half awake and loved every mad minute.
