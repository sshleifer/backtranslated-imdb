The premise of this movie, the comic exhibition, which directs the president as an independent, simply shaking thing, is funny, fun, brilliant and even a little inspiring. (thinking about Western discussion when Tom Dobbs leaves his podium, I thought of Steven Colbert who announced his candidacy in good times). The first 15-20 minutes of this movie are therefore very interesting, especially in the discussion. When he is finally elected, it is a pity that this is due to a computer error, you would like to have won a fair one (although it is unrealistic). <br /> <br /> But after that, the film goes downhill. I thought we'd get a great movie like "Dave" (1993), where we see how it would be when the comedian actually ran into the country. Instead, the film turns into comedy into a thriller, romantic comedy and drama, and does nothing good. Computer glitch becomes the main story that really sucks. The boy is this disappointment. I give it 3 letters only as a prerequisite and because I managed to watch this movie from start to finish without stopping it, which is usually a good thing.
