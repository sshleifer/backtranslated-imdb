This is a semi-fictional monument from an international man who has seen various political breakthroughs over the last 30 years. <br /> <br /> I was hoping this film would offer a unique understanding of politics and war. I also hope it touches and influences. But I was disappointed with this movie. "Chico" seemed fragmentary, main character Ricardo, who stayed in one country for 10-20 minutes. As can be expected, a detailed story could not be developed in such a time frame. His excuses for moving to another place were often perfectly explained. The result was a collection of fragmented clips from different countries.
