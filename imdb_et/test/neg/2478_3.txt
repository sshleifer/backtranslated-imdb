1) If you want to make a film that deals with social realism, it is quite important for the audience to recognize the characters being portrayed. 2) The audience cannot identify very stereotypical signs or situations that are obvious. 3) If you have a bad actor, you can't build any characters. Anyway, even if you have beautiful actors, their work is ridiculous when you force them to speak with a fictitious Andalusian accent. <br /> <br /> Jes√∫s Ponce ignores these 3 points and also makes some cheap jokes that are completely out of place. His script is so predictable: a woman comes out of jail, meets her old junkie boy, a tough life, etc. Even though the story is anything but the original, it wouldn't be so bad if only Ponce wouldn't be a complete incompetent writing and filming. <br /> <br /> I mean how long they spend money on their taxes to make movies like <br /> <br /> * My rate: 3/10
