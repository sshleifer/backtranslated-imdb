It is much better to use your time and brains to read or listen to Charlie Wilson's war. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays Gust, the most enjoyable character in Greek, and plays him as an eunuch. Gust, in the book, is a hard core and completely free to speak your mind. In the film, he is not even as important to Charlie. And the poor Charlie is never shown in the donation of blood (which he did every time he visited Pakistani camps). In short, the film is too sharp and history is too old for us today. We are not interested in the end of the Cold War and the defeat of the Soviet Union (which happened despite Reagan, not as a result) for a group of well-funded people who were very willing to fight. Not a real lesson we need to listen to and see how the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are going. (When I read the book, I kept this deja vu feeling except that it was today).
