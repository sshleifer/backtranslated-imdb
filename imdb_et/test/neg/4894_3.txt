"Hundreds of cafe ballads" worked on this picture, but when it fell, it stood with its own dust. <br /> <br /> It can't be said aloud, but if Vanessa Redgrave's Amelia were to fight with John Wayne or even Clint Eastwood, my hard-earned dollars should go to Redgrave. His depiction of Amelia was so perfect and consumed with a more detailed commitment than most participants are willing to give to any multi-million dollar contractor. Redgrave gave Amelia the spiritual pull that was a mixture of her unique voice and the hard-earned woman from the south. It can be interpreted as annoying for the average viewer, but as the movie progressed, did it become? Miss Amelia turns the beauty of this stage into a roighneck. That was Redgrave's performance, as well as his interaction with other characters that made this movie high? but not the highest. Others who followed his actions were necessary, but not stars. When we moved through the dark cliché picture of all the post-depression southern designers, the juvenile characters knew the poster board. The image was necessary to set the scene, but the city characters were not for any other purpose. Take, for example, Rod Steiger's vision of some of the old wild preachers. His scenes make every viewer question the validity of this descended road in the city. The two main players around Amelia fought with magic to the stunning top scene to steal the moment, but due to the lack of direction? it just seemed dull. The most absurd of the two (albeit both high among the respondents' peace of mind) is Cork Hubbard, who plays Amelia's "cousin" who appears randomly one night. His character is never precisely defined, he has no real motive, and his loyalty remains uncertain. He plays an important role in this film outside of forcing us, viewers, to question his peace of mind and honesty. Can you design your tongue simply by closing the tongue, slipping your ears and hitting your chest and head? Finally, is the other end of the absurd? Keith Carradine. Callow's close-ups of this tortured person create a character, but the lack of understanding between us and Amelia causes his goal to flounder. These were characters like South Cliché as they were? some stood still and tried to create an absurd period, and I can't claim they failed. <br /> <br /> When the "fucking cafe ballads" didn't rise above average, it was in cinematography and narrative. This film was about Amelia and her need for other souls in her life. The level of audience comfort with the arrival of his dwarf was fun? he could not, whether he was honest or just trust that the man was trying to let go of a warm heart. Cork Hubbard's character is never quite understandable, but we take short shots with him and Amelia with little things. This is his idea, which turns from exceptional businessmen into a good owner of a cafe. The problem is that director Callow never takes the dramatic level between Cork and Redgrave? is a man crazy or does he represent the whole Amelia family? I needed something from Callow that brought these two out of David Lynch-esquire's relationship they had. Then our pool becomes even deeper, adding Carradine as Amelia's "love interest". By using a rebound technique, we see two spouses, but never do they love their love? which Amelia's anger against their love, pulling her into madness. Why was Amelia so angry? Why was there no connection between Carradine and Redgrave? Why was it even in the movie? Concerning the focus on the associations of these characters, did the scenes between the two make no sense? throw Cork's choice and it just becomes awkward. Although there were some beautiful choreographic scenes created by Callow, he could not transfer his characters from A to B. I lost focus, interest and my care for the characters when I didn't understand the final question? "why?" <br /> <br /> In general, the "Hundreds of Coffee Ballads" started with a bang, but ended with a very small smithy cracker. My emotional feel for this film pushed up and down, up and down, and finally fell down mainly because the motifs of the characters were not understood. Redgrave did a phenomenal job with Amelia, and other characters (outside of random Steiger) tried their best, I just didn't understand who they were. Their motives were so confused that when the emotional end ended, I was apathetic. It seems that Director Callow has no importing connecting scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all our major players. Callow has created some beautiful scenes where the faces seemed to overlap, which allowed us to focus on Amelia? or Carradine, but nothing was explained or developed. The film was played next to anger, discovery, happiness, rebound, anger, anger, anger, fading. Without comparative connectors, it became an outstanding periodic film participant who plays the parts in front of the camera. It was a shame because "Sad Café" was a promise, it just couldn't deliver. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** ½ *****
