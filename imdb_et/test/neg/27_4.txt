"Cover Girl" is an awkward WWII musical that has nothing memorable except for the song "Long Ago and Far Away". This movie came out before Gene Kelly really hit her artistic action, and although there is evidence of her growing talent, she plays mostly with Rita Hayworth. And there's a problem. Rita Hayworth is proud, no doubt. But he just doesn't have a convincing screen presence. I've always found that I like her more than I actually do, and this movie is no exception. She's not just a very good actor and she's not a very good dancer. As good as he is, he has been shocked and this film suffers for it. <br /> <br /> Rating: C-
