I was really looking forward to the movie that I spent in Barcelona for a couple of (fantastic) college weeks. The premise is right - a confused and distracted young person enters the world equally confused and disturbing young people. However, the director's weak swats for symbolism, philosophy and social commentary were out of the mark, leaving us, the audience, confused and disturbed. Bravo. <br /> <br /> Maybe if this movie was to be played on European "American Pie", I would be able to turn off the brain and drive. But right after the bat, the director directs our deepest senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted roads and the "inner self" between the "public self" (the "mother tongue" and the "second language"). . In addition, it dives safely on racial / national stereotyping. Interesting start, eh? <br /> <br /> ERROR. It's as much as it goes. These interesting topics are hardly mentioned except at the end of the established epilogue, which seemed to be a way for the director to slip into the subject. It reminded me of a curving speech that goes somewhere, but the speaker ends, saying, "So I hope you see how it relates to my original thought!" <br /> <br /> In addition, as other reviewers have pointed out, the cynical stigma of stereotypes hurts itself. If the idea is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes, why did the director direct a circus-speaking English brat as a cartoon director? Why did the director depict the American as a neanderthall (literally breaking his chest and a monkey's noise at one point), while Europeans tolerate him in the extreme? Why is a British girl who swallows deaf proclamation (calling French "frogs" and polishing French), while everyone else is the most? The answer is that it is not a deep or thoughtful film. This is just the withdrawal of Anglophobes for Anglophiles. But it really does not differ from the prejudices he wants to ridicule! Now it makes sense to consider funny irony. <br /> <br /> OK, philosophy, artistic and socio-political commentary left this movie very boring. There is one very funny gag that involves deceiving one of the girls' boys, but aside from barely any entertainment. The only reason I looked at it to the end is that I would like to brush my French and Spanish language. (You can see that monolingual Americans can be stupid, but we're trying.)
