This is a film that has a lot of potential, well done and worked, rather than a weekly and inconsistent script. A young woman with two children moves to her mother's narrow apartment because the husbands are at the workshop where she cuts off stolen cars, aggravating their son's asthma. A man arrives in jail when his stolen car is in his shop, ex pat arrives at a generous, generous and naive shmoe (and rather cardboard and we learn from him) but reaches the girl who "trades", despite having his wife sexually satisfied. I hope this film is successful in Czech, where it is welcome thanks to its obvious assumption - "They may have money, they can even get women, but they are old, soft and our women want to be satisfied, we can be poor, But ... If only Evzen could marcel Marcel, he wouldn't have to play, or if he already had a family already in Italy ... but that would make things harder.
