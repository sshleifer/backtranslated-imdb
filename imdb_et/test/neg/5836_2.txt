Terrible movie. Just terrible. The beginning of this film is like something about bad women in a prison movie. Then he moves to the alien B-movie version. In this case, B-film means adding free sex scenes and women to lingerie. Oh and a lot of material is exactly the same as the same company (including women in prison) in two other films. The only thing that records this movie from 1/10 is that I've actually seen worse movies. Not much and not much, but worse.
