I've been watching this movie after seeing a couple of times the original "Spoonloo", waiting for the end of the cooling. <br /> <br /> I can't even start to explain the anger and frustration I experienced in the end and went and the film still had a happy ending. What a waste of time it was to look at the US remake ... <br /> <br /> If you have a choice, skip the "The Vanishing" and check out the Dutch original "Spoorloos". The break is very well built. You know Rex's disappointment, looking for traces of what might have happened to his girlfriend Saskia after he entered the gas station and never returned to his car. The search takes him three years and when he finally contacts a person who knows the truth about what happened to Saskia, he has to accept the same thing that Saskia has gone through. The end leaves no word on your chair.
