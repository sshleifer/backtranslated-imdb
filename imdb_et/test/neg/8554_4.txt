Not the best of WIP, but not the worst. I honestly feel this movie laughing, bearing in mind that it was supposed to be a low career for all participants. Yet, acting, in dialogue, in reluctant scenarios, and in the ever-increasing boom of the microphone, I always get and certainly add to the charm of this bad film. So many of Linda Blair's fans when I am, top (or topless) prizes go to Sybil Danning. There are also special celebrities Henry Silvale, who is the only one in the slogan who didn't play his role too seriously. Watching the movie now changes the character of Stella Stevens. He plays as a chief officer and I have to think about whether Hilary Clinton decided to accept his current appearance and behavior. After all, I am sure he had to look beyond the video collection of his wife to find this movie. Not that I meet. I've seen it myself several times, and it all makes me wonder what would have happened if Mr Clinton were allowed to install a hot tub in an oval office. Hmmm.
