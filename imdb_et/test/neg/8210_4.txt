"Harrow's Cave" had many things that could make this pretty good horror movie. Disgraceful mansion, torture house, paranoid host, henchman, ghost in prison, etc. But unfortunately it was said that it wasn't done very well. <br /> <br /> The writer and captain get into an island that belongs to the castle, to his slave and to silence the number of servants. The Count is becoming more and more suspicious that two shipwrecked men are pirates (all things) and they tend to turn to them and to those who interact with their friends to torture and imprison. Sound not bad? Well, not quite. I called it one of the worst films I've ever seen, but now I hesitate. Because it had so much potential, it can't really be called one of the worst. But seeing all this potential as a waste is really a big hit against this movie. All in all, this is not a very good movie. <br /> <br /> It is a very gothic scene when our hero is chained to a cave and faced with a mad and leprosy rotten bride decorated with a split wedding dress. It was both horrible and disruptive when I saw this horror in the scene. I want this to be a better movie! <br /> <br /> This movie had all the right things to make it a cool late night cooler, but finally took all the wrong turns. I recommend that someone repeat it.
