The new celebrity death game is terrible. They kill popular people and win low-budget celebrities. I mean ... Andy Milonakis? Lil 'Flap? Lil flip and Lil Wayne should both die. The battle between Lil 'Jon and Lil' bow and Lili 's flaps was bright and short for MAD. They should kill them all. Why did Tobey lose to Jake and Christian lost to Adam? they are better actors and superheroes. They spend too much time talking, not a fight that can be borne by the viewers. Everything seems to be in a hurry for some reason, they can't just make a long fight? old deathmatch is better.
