Just to save money and time, I'll tell you that this movie is not absolutely worth the game and the gas it takes to burn it. Don't waste your time. In fact, it would be better to forget that you have ever looked at it. I've seriously seen B-movies in a better language I don't understand. Anyone who has ever given permission must be sewn. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it can be a great story for a new script and the right director and actors. Let me break up; Virgo gets pregnant demon, baby inside mother wants people to feed. They are trying to make up for the fact that this is probably the worst film ever made with passionate and pointless nudity. All in all, the value of this dollar is not worth it at all.
