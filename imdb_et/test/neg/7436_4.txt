The overall problem with this movie is that he can't use Bill Murray in the best possible way, just because of a common star. <br /> <br /> If it was a movie movie actor in another movie, it might work. Even if they both try to get an elephant across the country, it would at least allow some interesting dialogue to be shared. At the moment, Murray is talking to an elephant who is unable to return to the cloak of clergy. In essence, this means that Murray speaks for himself and that makes the film more boring than it might have been if he had another sign to bounce. <br /> <br /> Kids would enjoy this movie just because of the elephant, but anyone who wants to watch Bill Murray's bite and enjoy the great script must look elsewhere.
