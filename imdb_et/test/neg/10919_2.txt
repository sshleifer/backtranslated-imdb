I'll write it 10 minutes before the movie ends. I feel comfortable right now because unfortunately I know exactly how this movie ends. <br /> <br /> The premise is simple enough, a furious dog in a small town, killing people. Big - easy fun in the horror of the 80's camp fears. <br /> <br /> Uhh .. no. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that it is based on a book (Stephen King) and you can say that it shouldn't really be a movie, at least not with the same plot. Why? Cuz your boring! The first 45 minutes will try to build up the depth of your main characters and create tension. However, it lasts too long (half the movie!) - the characters are unlikely and we don't care about them anyway, and it almost creates a zero contract. The simplest film (according to plot and time) to compare it with classic jaws. Everything that Jaws is doing right makes Cujo wrong. Jaws created good characters and a sense of real fear. Cujo doesn't do that. Jaws effectively create terrible scary and horrible evil. Cujo has a messy St Bernard who runs around breaking and jumping, not much else. Jaws are exciting and unpredictable. Cujo is a tireless drill that is still predictable until the end. <br /> <br /> There are also a lot of confusion about the number of sub-blocks that work on the main plot of movies just like the boring red herring. <br /> <br /> This movie was rewritten for a big screen and had a better director that might have been good. But it wasn't. It was a waste of 90 minutes of my life. <br /> <br /> People here say it's one of the best king's adjustments - I'm sorry you couldn't be wrong. Mist is a hundred times better, thinner is 10 times better and even cats are twice as good! This is one of the worst in my opinion! The only good thing was that the dogs looked at the reality, even though they were bored. <br /> <br /> Movies ended now and it didn't get better. Avoid.
