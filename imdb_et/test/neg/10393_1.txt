I'm not sure if it's comedy or not, but I found it quite comical. Isobel is in the possession of the devil. Somehow the perverted priest and the gardener fix it. Part of the exorcism and part of the soap opera, you get at least some laugh. There is a paranoid jealous father, a satanic sister, a doll in the valley mother, and then a cowboy boy; all there to help the skirts to bring the priest to the dear Isobel demons. Sometimes it seemed like an episode of Jerry Springer, but I paid for it. Instead of cooling his head, turning to a sailor's church and crucifixion, Regan worshiped Exorcist; you get a lot of Isobel bouncing into your bed like it's a trampoline, hiding in your closet and jumping from a hay-attic. Yeah, that's Chuck E. Cheese went into nature. So, if you want to watch a quotation on a unquote horror movie that is worth a little laughs, if you expect a predictable ending ... it's your movie.
