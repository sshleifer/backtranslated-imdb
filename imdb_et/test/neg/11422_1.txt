I can't believe this film will be rated as an IMDbis here. Of course, I have come to the conclusion that IMDb is somewhat worthless to actually know if a movie is good or not, that 99% of movies are rated from 6 to 7. This is crowd-sourcing and failure on the Internet. To this end, most people are average and, unfortunately, most people have simple ways of thinking that are easily entertained by the fast food lifestyle morals. But I ground. Movie. I really don't want to waste my time on writing about it. Let's just say I found it intended for seemingly two groups of people, young teenagers, the age where all the violent movies hit the ground, and the Gothic types that just love to thwart any Gothic vampire fantasy. Get your hands on. If you are not in one of these categories, you will find this film absurd. I enjoyed the first underworld. It was fresh at that time and had some kind of nervous quality. The second was a bit of a try on the plot, but sometimes I enjoyed direction and cinematography. But this whole movie seemed like a sci-fi channel or even a television series. I found the actors too targeted. Their body language remained rigid, natural idealistic. The lines spat out as young actors spat out the lines of Shakespeare, exposing their egoistic glory in such a role, but doing so, breaking their role. The plot was dry and predictable from the beginning. I found that I just wanted to "move" things because it was so easy to say what was going on. I tried to take care first, but my brain was forced to turn off. After all, I spent myself sleeping. There were so many parts that were inconsistent and there was no point in not even worth them. If you're a pimple face teen or chronic goth, be sure to have it. For the rest of us, forget it, as I am already doing.
