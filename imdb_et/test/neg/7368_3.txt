Headline, tagline, plot summary on DVD, etc ... I was waiting for something at least epic, historical fiction and romance that made you more exciting; this is what they did, for example, in recent mohaires, and I think they did a great job. Maybe I had too high standards for this movie and it didn't give it a fair chance. But the landscape was barely OK (how did they get nothing more beautiful than they had to work with such landscapes?), The two lovers had no chemistry, and the plot was just so predictable that it seemed to be made after twelve years of five years - and not very imaginative. Nouvelle-France is a love story that is placed in an event-oriented historical age. But the history of Nouvelle-France is hardly a sign, and the love story is banal and does not dramatically make the viewer look after the fate of lovers. Surprisingly, the only good parts of the film came from something completely unexpected and unheard of: the relationship between Marie-Loup, the heroine and her children (one natural, one accepted). If only they had focused on their family and forgot the story of love, it would have been a much better film. Marie-Loup's parents should have been given more time and character on the screen, and Britain's policy should have been more than three minutes long, with no connection to the rest. completely from the script (why hire actors like Vincent Perez, Tim Roth or Jason Isaacs to use them so badly)?
