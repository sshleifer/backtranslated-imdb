what happened to Mathew Modine's career? I still remember when he was considered to be an actor on the list ... <br /> <br /> was the ultimate pound of this bright island ever a promising career coffin? wow, this guy really has to hate Renny Harlin's gut ... <br /> <br /> This film wants to be a comedy badly but can't laugh, characters are cartoons and poorly drawn people. but what is still the most painful, I see that Mr Modine starts a role that is so far from his caliber that at the moment he was dealing with films like BIRDIE, he could never have thought in his worst nightmares that he would be in the movies in the future, where is the hoop who swarmes with a cow that has just had his anus clipped, and maybe even the worst, next to Elizabeth Berkley!
