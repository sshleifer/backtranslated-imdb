This movie was boring. Very similar to Underworld, but even less interesting. It's not much of a werewolf movie and not where a horror movie is near. The lead pair was boring. I don't care about Vivian and Aiden. And there was so little character development that I didn't care about the character of a movie. The plot was paper thin. The changes were basically zeros. I did as wolves myself, could have made a wolf documentary, I would have liked it. I don't recommend this movie. I didn't find it fun or interesting. It just pulls and everything in it is boring pulling. This film could win a prize for not making a werewolf movie.
