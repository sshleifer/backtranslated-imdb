This movie is not a little bad. It's not even bad. It's terrible. You know Charo has appeared in the movie. He had to leave the "Love Boat" of the week. George Kennedy, at least he's a player - he's trying. Actually, he's all right. And it's good to see Martha Ray. Jimmie Walker's okay. There's a little better action than at the airport '75, but what film does it have better than Airport '75? One thing I liked about this movie is that it happened more than many other disaster movies. At least they tried sub-blocks. It really hurts this movie's special effects - ugh! Not too special when you ask me. This is a movie that is really funny at 2:00 am if you've been having fun with your friends and are looking for something to laugh at.
