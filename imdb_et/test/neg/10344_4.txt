Corben Bernsen directed a horror film about a chemical weapon released during a sports event and turned it into a crazy monster. We will look at how radio station staff will take reports. <br /> <br /> Its moments are mostly, but mostly like a lifetime horror movie with breast and blood. Here are some great ideas, but they just don't work. In fact, the film's ideas are better dealt with in a movie called Pontypool, which works a lot and builds tension if we don't show us anything. It shows us things and it just seems cheap. Considering the choice I look at Pontypool again, instead of watching this movie again.
