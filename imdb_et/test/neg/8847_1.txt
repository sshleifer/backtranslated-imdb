I never fell asleep during the movie. Never. This movie made it impossible. <br /> <br /> Although many people claim that Japanese horror movies are better for their American counterparts, this film was a whole lesson. As well, the film was too long for 30 minutes. It would have helped if the film had a bit more movement in the plot and in the camera, but all we had was uncomfortable resins and a lot of slow motion. The action was absolutely terrible, limited to the filmmaking of bad students, while everyone fought with the ad-lib, called the script. Did these people even get any direction? Were they hatched to be boring and boring? Both therapies wouldn't have surprised me. <br /> <br /> Even worse was that the creatures on the other hand were a rather unpleasant make-up. In both cases, they were all stolen. Don't look at this movie. That's all I can say (if you're not an insomniac).
