It seems to me worrying that people are not critical of critical work. Many similarities, both structurally and literally, alongside "Amadeus", "Copy to Beethoven" deliberately select a simple path, putting the audience into art. And, therefore, denying the world a attentive, intelligent and creative work. <br /> <br /> Now consider the following: Is it not possible that the true story of creating the ninth symphony can actually be an interesting and powerful story itself and equally dramatically? Was Beethoven completely deaf to writing a symphony? Isn't that so interesting? How was the symphony performed? Wouldn't it be nice to know? So ask yourself what is the potential motivation for introducing a woman as a copier to a filmmaker? If he was an exporter, he would definitely be a man. What was his story? (Please try to be very critical here even if you like inventing a woman's composer). Fantasy should be much more than a distortion of reality to serve the purpose of writers. For those who find themselves in the comparison and justification of Anna Holtz's invention with Salier's assertion that he was murdered by "Amadeus" in Mozart, consider that he admits a priest in a hidden shelter (Schaffer uses this device to a large extent in the film). "Copy to Beethoven" may have worked when Anna was an example of Ludwig's imagination. But we have to believe he is "possible" ... Yes, and Strauss helped foreigners. <br /> <br /> Most of the positive comments I've read so far are often the words of DESIRE film are good; almost deliberate amnesia. Remembering the movie about what you want it rather than what it is. <br /> <br /> For those who believe that fantasy justifies the means, you must not only accept the worse interpretation of real events, but also sacrifice the truth for the sake of triviality. <br /> <br /> Finally, a brief message about what's working here, which may surprise you. Ed Harris is not good at Ludwig Van Beethoven. Does it shock you? She sees discomfort from the whole movie, like an actor dressed, but turned off and stood on a catering table. Most of her lines are clues rather than answers to Anna Holtz's lines (ie she doesn't listen to the actor). He is obviously an actor who disguises rather than character. <br /> <br /> How many times does Beethoven have to go to his grave before we get it right? Ask yourself if Ludwig confirms?
