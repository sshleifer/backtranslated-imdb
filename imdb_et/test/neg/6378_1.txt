Comedy works best when it comes to truth. But even as such, it is necessary to make some effort to make jokes that everyone likes and even the toughest viewers can smile. When I look at the Daily Show, I see the whole thing "it's funny because it's true", but I can't see the effort and often times I'm not, if they're funny or just trying to make a point (I notice that mainly in the interview segments). The Daily Show started as a news parody, funny as to how the media plays its news, pretending that they are unsuccessful and stupid journalists and anchors, and they are dealing with tons of topics from science to movies and sometimes politics, then Jon Stewart came along ... and everything went to hell. The first years of Jon Stewart's reign were unquestionably golden, although I was so funny, but then it came in 2004 and this is where you start to take a huge opportunity to see the show. The humor of the exhibition is over, Colbert left, Steve Carell left, many of the best anchors on the show left, and now it's mostly Jon Stewart and the parody about the parody of the semi-critical news exhibition, mostly for the Evening News, but with some gags here and there. For those who haven't seen the show and have trouble viewing the cable, I'll give you a brief description of what's going to show (at least until 2009): -Bush, Cheney, and all Republicans (unless they also have an opinion shared by the Democrats ) are stupid, evil, corrupt, and hypocritical; anyone who is conservative is also evil, corrupt, and hypocritical; - People who question the theory of global warming caused by human activity are evil and stupid; -Democrat; There I saved you 25 minutes of your time, see something else. But first of all, the producers hijacked the show for their personal political agenda, but when I actually see the interviews, it becomes crystal clear what it shows (what I mentioned above), but I'm going to do it right now. Frist off, humor The Daily Show, according to Jon Stewart, hopes to find a casual filmed quotation said either Bush, Cheney or casual Republican humorous because well because. Jon determines the joke by placing it in a specific context for writers and hopes that the random quote will in some way punch. So, if you do not get the context, it is totally useless as a disappointing humor. Also, the Daily Show hopes to laugh when they show one politician talking and some other separate video, saying one more thing, putting the context that the writers expect to understand, making it funny, why? Well, because Jon said so. Now imagine that the Daily Show uses this formula countless times every week, and you begin to understand what was previously a laugh, which is now 25 minutes of silence (yes, even in Lewis black segments). At first, some decent efforts were made in these jokes, but now it is much less visible. And the interview has the most unusual feeling I've ever seen. Jon Stewart calls Bill O'Reilly a bully, but what does he do when he sucks up every actor and democrat (John Kerry before, Obama today) that appears on the show and watches respectable Republics and reaches conservative journalists like Weekly Standard for his Bill Kristol ? He puts them in some sort of people's court, as if they were accused of a crime, often any person standing in front of Bush is depicted as being unaffected by reality and assuming he is talking to most Americans is de facto treating all conservative people if they do not share the same view with democrats, if so, it is an endless love festival. However, it is not important that Jon is already wrong in your eyes before you enter the show and you are still wrong. This is the kind of treatment you get when you are on the right. Now you have to think about what it can be with humor. One wonders what happens when Democrats win the White House ...
