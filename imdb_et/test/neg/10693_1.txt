Odious Chuck Norris decided to put one final nail into the church that contained his film career before he went to the CBS safe world. <br /> <br /> For such a stupid movie, this is a sure plotty. Norris is Chicago <br /> <br /> Frank Frank Shatter. First of all, what is the surname "Shatter"? Have you ever been in contact? Genforum.com does not have lists of <br /> <br /> the surname Shatter, which opens a smart viewer for any party. <br /> <br /> "Replace" with "Shatteris" i. He and his partner Calvin <br /> <br /> Jackson make the same old friendship you've seen before: make funny pimps and make your captain crazy. Jackson, looking at Whoopi Goldberg's theoretical child of love <br /> <br /> and Rick James, will quickly carry their nerves with their continuous <br /> <br /> and Eddie Murphy. patented facial expressions. <br /> <br /> Shatter and Calvin participate with Satan's emissary, whom we introduce to open scenes for too long. <br /> <br /> Prosatano is a demon locked by King Richard to encrypt <br /> <br /> Lionhearted. The demon scepter, from which he receives his power, has been broken into nine pieces and hidden in nine different parts of the world hidden by men. In 1951, some of the robbers were accidentally fired <br /> <br /> Prosatano and he started nine pieces. She hides herself as an antique professor Lockley, and <br /> <br /> there is always a lecture where the holy man is killed <br /> <br /> and Norris brings his "Walker: Texas Blunder" cohort Sheree Wilson, who plays Lockley assistants. He helps Norr through his <br /> <br /> investigation, they make goo goo eyes with each other, and our <br /> <br /> horrible investigators are traveling to Israel after rabbit killing <br /> <br /> Chicago. More complaints to Calvin are given to Israel <br /> <br /> about: heat, lack of restaurant facilities, nervous <br /> <br /> drivers and the fact that he is missing the Chicago Bulls playoff games <br /> <br /> . Norris even manages to work with a lovely Israeli boy in a <br /> <br /> nightmare. Bezi steals Calvin's wallet and hangs around men, guiding them around Israel and not creating any <br /> <br /> appropriate doubts. <br /> <br /> Lockley (Prosatano) collects all the skeptics <br /> <br /> but needs a license fee to complete the ceremony. <br /> <br /> and fuck. Where to find royal blood? Well, Sheree's dad is a Duke! He has an American accent, but he is a convenient method for the script writers, which forces this monstrosity inevitably to end. Of course, this Satan digger can <br /> <br /> kill countless hundreds over the years, but how does he start accepting the old-fashioned old American backhand? <Br /> <br /> After Prosatano was destroyed, he killed his own scepter (I <br /> <br /> envied him, he didn't have to look at Bezi to steal Calvin's wallet <br /> <br /> again ), we are treated with horror involving a bearded man who has followed the Shutter, I mean Shatter and Calvin <br /> <br /> in their quest. You see, it was predicted ... somewhere that two <br /> <br /> Western soldiers won Prosatano. Voiced <br /> <br /> The man looking at the couple was nothing but <br /> <br /> Jesus ... I'm not your child. Finally, he is on the "Prophet" list, but you and even your pets recognize the subtle Christian <br /> <br /> reference that filmmakers are trying to show here. <br /> <br /> As "I use Walker: Texas Ranger", Norris gets older and can no longer get into his fighting scenes. He strikes a lot and people fly through the furniture in slow motion, and then Norris gives all his line readings with his monotonous voice. Oh, what a real director can get out of her! His brother Aaron, who has directed him to other films, does not know the story <br /> <br /> or the momentum. Scenes are thrown for the ego, not for <br /> <br /> entertainment. Scenes, when the dynamic duo meets Bezi for the first time <br /> <br /> in and out, then Bezi isn't all that important to the rest of the movie <br /> <br />. <br /> The film / film was filmed in Israel, which means that Americans could offend Israelis personally. There is no Israeli character here. The Israeli police captain is a jerk. <br /> <br /> The police leader doesn't know English and Calvin convinces him. <br /> <br /> The word "sh * tty" is a compliment. Nothing more fun than <br /> <br /> the stupid aliens who are in the security of their homes, especially if this racist humor comes from an American minority <br /> <br /> who would have been more than offended by the tables > <br /> and an Israeli policeman mocking an African-American policeman <br /> <br /> Chicago. <br /> <br /> This movie is poorly written, badly behaved and badly directed. It does not work as deeds, police books, or even horror. It only shows that now the lost Cannon Studios was ready to throw their money, no matter how badly planned. Hellbound is definitely the most suitable title. I didn't like this film intensely. <br /> <br /> It is rated for physical violence, weapon violence, strong <br /> <br /> embarrassment, some sexual references, and some adult situations. > <br />
