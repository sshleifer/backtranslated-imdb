I recently watched Ed Wood Jr. autobiographical film Glen or Glenda for the first time since she had heard so many years. Nothing that I read about or heard about this movie could not be predicted. It must be the most bizarre film. Buffalo, slave women, Satan moving around and Bela Lugos, worshiping just as he can, "Bevare, Bevare .... pull the string, pull the string ...", it was totally crazy. The act was terrible and the dialogue was inadvertently fun, exactly what one would expect from Ed Wood. Having said this film was terrible, I have to give wood credit ... he was ahead of his time. You must remember that when this film was made, the transvestites were not publicly, even less, a subject of the film. I've read that Wood was a transvestite in real life, and I'm sure this film is based on his own experience. It was sad to see Bela Lugos say the ridiculous features he had to say about this movie, but it was sort of Ed Wood Jr. At least give Mr. Lugos a job at the same time in Bela when he was rude and drug addicted and no one else in Hollywood hired him. If you have never seen this movie, you have to see it, especially if you are Ed Wood Jr.
