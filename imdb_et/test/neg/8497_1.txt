This movie has been crazy. I believe that the original of this movie, The Mask, was a fantastic movie that was worth buying and watching. I firmly believed that they should make a sequel, but when I saw it, I thought again. <br /> <br /> This movie has violated the whole idea of ​​Mask. Mask mode? Child rides around in the room? My little brother, seven, didn't laugh and he was in these childish films, but it was worse. Kitskoos! I'm telling you now, don't look at this movie, it's a waste of money and a waste of time. Instead, you might actually have fun! Look at "Mask" but don't, I repeat, don't look at this spam. Thank you.
