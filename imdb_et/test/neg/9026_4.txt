What a silly movie. Although it seems nice, it doesn't make much sense. On the one hand, the film shows that Juana's "madness" was that she was just a woman before her time. On the other hand, he has an obsession that is right about the worst Victorian novel, and it seems like a mental problem like Miss Havesham Castle. This movie is what Elizabeth would have been if Elizabeth hadn't been able to bypass the sexual attraction of Essex.
