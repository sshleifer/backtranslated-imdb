Awful is really all you need to know. First of all, think of all the things that might be bad about the film. And then try to make all these ways a bad movie. You've done "Vacationland". The state of Maine should feel insulted: it is too nice to be such a tricky, pointless and boring background for Schlock. I'm romantic, and I always want movies about two people who succeed each other, and I was trying to find a good thing in this area. It was tough; very harsh. I couldn't find any glow of emotional affection in misery in this exercise. Except maybe one or two bad guys. <br /> <br /> Reputation is a good resting place; this movie is not.
