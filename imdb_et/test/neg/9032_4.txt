Have you ever wondered why these men - Seagal, Stallone, Willis - al - can survive all those bomb attacks they cross? I think I understood. Enemies always forget and the hero does not. <br /> <br /> There is a pistol at Seagal and can withstand half a dozen heavy fires coming from some feet. One of the most difficult is a shotgun. Or maybe two of them are. This is not really important. There may be a thousand shotguns that will burst him and Seagal will still appear intact on his ponytail. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to my a mine fight - forget it. Criminals may or may not be armed with swords or knives, or with a blunt object, but Seagal, who has his aikido or tempura or sushi or play or whatever it is, brushes them off with some triggering shocks. Not only is she a master of these skills, but her physical strength is Herculean. More than once, he clicks on someone's long bones as easily as we break the toothpick. One of her breaks the boy's SPINE across the knee. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you something. (I enter the spirit of the movie here because Seagal uses this line, "I tell you something," several times, "What should that mean?") These men deserve full extinction from every good Xenophobe Handbook. They're all black, talking with an incomprehensible Jah-MAY accent, wearing a dreadlocks that desperately need a shampoo, torturing and murdering with a aplomb, and - here's the worst part. They are Christians. This is correct. They practice voodoo. <br /> <br /> In fact, the voodoo element is the most interesting feature of the movie. They got the ingredients of the ritual pretty well - cigar smoke, rum spitting, sacrificing chicken. They only left the dance where the spirit was wearing the dancer. They should have read Metraux on the voodoo. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the plot will follow the usual conventions. What Jaqueline Bissett did to Voodoo practitioners in "The Deep" is made here for Seagal's friend. With John Wayne, "McQ" lorries were taken to Seagal. When the movie is very open when Seagal makes a short speech when he saw too much meaningless violence in his DEA career, he is now happy to retire and when we introduce our friends and family, I tried to follow my affiliates to see if I could find out what would be terribly murdered or kidnapped to provoke his revenge. <br /> <br /> Actress does not really need much comment. But Charles, a Jamaican policeman, played Tom Wright, is really pretty good. Wright has a remarkable choice. Here he is a companion of suspicious attitude, rather embarrassing. But in the "Pentagon Wars" he has a comic part he plays perfectly. <br /> <br /> Jamaicans never drove a movie as a villain. I don't know exactly why. This is a small movie market. And when you go to Jamaica, stay at Montego Bay. However, if you want to see Jamaican voodoo drug dealers and if you are joking about another typical standard, then this should be a satisfactory view.
