I really enjoyed the movie. Sometimes it was very exciting. (They destroy the stools with hair filters - but where are they connected?) However, this is a unique film and I enjoyed the action of Courtney Draper and Tamara Hope. I also liked Fanuel (although you wrote it ...) that liked Megan's career because he called him dweeb. In addition to the exemplary "rewinding" and showing what happened from Ariel's and Megan's point of view, it was quite interesting. I saw it twice and I see it again
