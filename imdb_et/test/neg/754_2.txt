Sometimes changing the novels made in the movies is not only necessary but good. However, this is a very, very bad thing for the Northanger monastery. Not only is the story cut, but satire has almost disappeared from the film, and it is a mixture of romance and intrigue that does not even touch what Austen put into his work. It is not at all amusing or satirical, and instead makes the character's charm with his fantasy world mostly a drama. <br /> <br /> It also affects romance. It's convex and purposeful. Chemistry and interest have never been created. The reasons why Tilney is attracted to Catherine are completely absent from the film, leaving the audience with doubts about what she sees at all. <br /> <br /> Hopefully a few days soon we will get a more faithful version than Austen satire.
