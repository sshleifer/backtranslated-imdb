It was like someone was trying to make a scary video game and documentary at the same time. The historical aspect was great. Everything else was terrible, another movie with the drivers' second plug that seemed to happen every other minute, the video of the actual ghost hunting was changed as a scary film as an investigation, they had haunted house music and sound effects that would distract you from what happened. 2 hours of my time wasting! If there was evidence, it would fly! Most of it was just a place where we talked about this place. The Ghosthunters episode shows that it was exactly how this show was. I've been playing this sci fi channel, I haven't watched it because it's been successful.
