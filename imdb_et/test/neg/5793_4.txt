If you thought Herbie was trying to kill you by driving the "The Love Bug" bridge, wait until you see her in this amazingly stupid second order. Dean Jones is the back of a rival who competes in the Monte Carlo rally in Paris; this time he falls in love with his beloved VW to love another race car, the Lancia led by Julia Sommars. At the moment, the series has more energy and charm than Herbie Rides Again; The film is too long and hard, although it is traceable thanks to Jones' typical pleasant result, some funny bits and casting mad frenzy.
