I made a big mistake to see this movie. This is probably a lottery for movies. After five minutes you knew it would be a clunker, and I struggled quite hard to stay in place - an old "losing two hours of my life" feeling. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that even without discussing "historical accuracy", the script is painful, painful, bad. <br /> <br /> The first thirty minutes could have spread to the hour to give credible, real, plot development. Instead, it pulled from one undramatically "dramatically" event to another. Making a girl at the beginning of a movie doesn't make sense, because the audience does not have any emotional connection at the moment. And all this walking down the sunset at the end of a long grass field, what the hell was that? <br /> <br /> Even great Ed Harris couldn't save it. You could almost feel your pain on some of the lines he had to listen to. The most shocking, frightening thing, without a visible reason, staring at the girl when she was copying her work in her apartment, she looked up, everything went a little fuzzy romantic - enlightenment (or I'm dreaming), and she says, with her own voice, <br /> < br /> "WASH ME". <br /> <br /> And he will rise and wash with a sponge. "Wash Me" WTF? This is fun. <br /> <br /> And then there was music. The long-term session, which was just Beethoven's leadership and the 9th Symphony Cinema and the choir waited, waited, quietly standing for what seemed forever. And finally, launching a huge sound. It was a wonderful spine-cooling and daring to say it brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> So the movie drew two stars. The only part of the film where Beethoven could say exactly what he wanted to say. <br /> <br /> And I believed him.
