A large number, a fantastic CGI monster and a brilliant script. If this movie had these things, it wouldn't have been the worst movie I've been wasting for an hour and a half. Infinite chimpanzees with infinite typewriters have not yet written Shakespeare's complete works, but it has appeared in their trash bin and somehow it became a film. You can say that the participants regret signing these contracts for every word they shine directly into the camera. The CGI is extremely amateurish and they could create more tension when the cast attack was created with Sinclair Spectrum. I wanted to like this movie, with the beautiful companions of Gil Gerard and Walter Koenig, so I was expecting a fun horror film that didn't take me too seriously. In fact, he is trying to take himself seriously but is as much fun as a dentist's trip. Do it yourself. Don't look at this movie, but encourage them to do more.
