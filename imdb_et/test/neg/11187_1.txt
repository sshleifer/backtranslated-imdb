If something can be something you want it to be or is meant to be, it is required to register with someone who is quite special. But as the cloud shape in the sky may seem to be one of us or remind us of the battleship and the other part of his aunt, and yet another to the cloud, this cloud does not make sense except for the viewers' interpretation. Anyone who can find the perfect giraffe from the window brilliant or useful for it, without being bound in any context, will probably try to impress us with our intellectuality. <br /> <br /> This movie, like mad dreams, is pretty nice, especially since there is no standard or expectation of what these dreams are, and even if we were crazy, it hardly gives a comparison for comparison. The love relationship with this film leads to the same risk as a serious interpretation of Nostradamus. Regardless of what the actual meaning was conveyed at this time, it may be buried in your own day's private jokes, music or provincial specialties, and selected radical intellectuals! Even though my limited capacity was small, I did a little agenda. <br /> <br /> The film is definitely fascist and to some extent anti-Italian. I note that although the years 1929-30 were major public works and urban renewal in Italy for years, any reference to avoiding it seemed. Besides (the avant-garde academic spies take note of this for your next class) a very short cut haired man with an end-of-the-way mustache is Victor Emmanuel III and his long female companion, not one of Helena's former Montenegro princess. Without understanding the potential historical significance, even the unquestionable importance of academic or other intellectual postures, which does not give us any importance to impress, is even obvious. <br /> <br /> I will gladly add my color to this movie joke. But with the little boy's famous motto; The film has no face (hit). The color would still burn it.
