Kindred opens to the Porsche racing route along the highway, reaching up to the old lift and going up. When the speed passes over the driver (Benjamin J. Perry, as Ben Perry), he cries out and shouts out of his horn. Failed to notice the obstacle and run Porsche together. He is quickly released from the wreck and taken to the hospital. On the way the paramedic (Randy Harrington) tries to save her, she suggests she probably won't. Then the ambulance is attacked and rushed off the road. Trailer driver Jackson (Jim Boeke as James F.Boeke) wins the parameter and steals the patient. Harry (Charles Grueber), the head of ambulance, is not trying to stop him. When the injured person is placed in van Jackson, he pays attention to Harry, who seems to know each other. Harry asks Jackson not to hit him because he broke his "last time" in his jaw. Jackson hits Harry's floor and throws him a bundle. After the movie, it is quite clear that we are in San Francisco, showing a golden gate on the bridge. Sharon Raymond is woken up by a phone call that her boyfriend, Dr. John Hollins (David Allen Brooks), would tell him that his mother, Amanda (Kim Hunter), who has recently had a heart attack, has become aware. Hollins works for a company called "Geneticell Corporation," and delights in news and leads. From there, he asks him to go back to his old childhood house, a small town called Shelter Cove, and to destroy all his notes and experiments, especially "Anthony Magazines", which Hollins has never heard of, as well as he claims to have a brother named Anthony. Back to Geneticell, Hollins talks to Dr Phillip Lloyd (Rod Steiger) about his mother because they had both worked together before they fell apart and interviewed him about his research and knew someone called Anthony. He says he doesn't know anything. When Amanda dies after an unfortunate visit by Dr. Lloyd, Hollins decides to make her mothers' request and try to find out who Anthony is. Paying her final respect at the funeral, Melissa Leftridge (Amanda Pays) introduces her wife to Hollins and says she was a great admirer of her mothers and a job after helping her. Since Melissa seems to know so much about her mothers' work, she calls her to the house, as she may help to find answers to various questions. Hollins, Sharon, Melissa and three lab assistants, Brad Baxter (Peter Frechette), Hart Phillips (Timothy Gibbs) and Cindy Russell (Julia Montgomery) and a girl with watermelon (!) Named Nell Valentine (Bunk Z, big name that was his parents think!?). They go straight to work, but they are of little interest. For some reason, no one here thinks in the basement that is as good as there is something, something big, slim, and has many tentacles. First he kills the dog. Then it moves to a higher yield. When Harta attacks somewhat at the table, Hollins decides that he must destroy all the traces of his mothers and whatever Anthony is. Carpenter also collaborated and directed with Stephen Carpenter and Jeffery Obrow, who also acted as operator and producer of Obrow. This is, in my opinion, a pretty bad film. The script has been credited to five (!) Writers, Carpenter, Obrow, Earl Ghaffar, John Penny and Joseph Stefan, and five people working on it, so I think they could do something a little better and more coherent than that. Nothing explains well why Amanda created these monsters of marine animals / human hybrids? What is the interest and motives of Dr. Lloyd? Why does he steal bodies from the ambulance on the back? Why does he have mutants full of basement? Why does none of these so-called genetic researchers think of the basement? Can Melissa act more suspiciously even when she tried? Why doesn't any character give any background? Why do people mention a substance found in seafood, called Hemocynine, when 99.9% of the audience have no idea what they are about? There is also a serious lack of blood and gore, only one person dying on the screen, only one! And all the scientists will survive vomiting, which will shamefully bring a "happy ending". This is a horror film, all we want to see is the slimy monsters who kill and eat people in different ways. Death on the screen is actually pretty cool, someone is under the skin with a blunt throat, just in the ear and in the nose movies with just a good horror. There's a scene where Dr. Lloyd is testing a skinned animal to try the Gore citation, but it only takes a few seconds, and that doesn't mean anything in the rest of the movie. Melissa also changes fish, don't ask. There is also no nudity that is not a surprise. The film looks professional enough with decent product values, but is just as boring and blemishes at the teodempo, we don't even see the giant monster in the basement up to 15 odd minutes before the end, which is too little. late, when it appears, the effects are fine and it makes it even more shameful that it is no longer used. Overall, I was very disappointed and waited much better. A movie with only one on the screen and only three on the world?
