I hated the book. The guy encounters a smart dog, gets a virgin girlfriend, and all the time he is being tracked by a man and a monkey beast (both want a dog). Dean Koontz really can't write (I read a book on the advice of a nurse, I should have known it better). When I saw it (mostly curious curiosity), I found that I criticized it because it was wrong with the book, although it is a book that cannot be done with this impossible film. I thought at least if they were going to film the worst book I've ever read, filmmakers can be accurate. They made the boy and his virgin love interest to the boy and his mother for some reason that most disturbed me (though I doubt seriously that the guy and his chick wouldn't have done it better). Just; bad book, bad movie, don't see it.
