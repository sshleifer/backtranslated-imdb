It's far from one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! And if you don't believe me and look at it yourself. <br /> <br /> The film starts slowly, the story doesn't make any sense. People have no idea. I couldn't understand what the film was talking about during the movie (in most cases I didn't even bother) It doesn't do anything to keep watching the movie, the only plus point is cinematography. New Zealand seems awesome. Everything else just sucks. <br /> <br /> Actors try their best to keep us awake, but unfortunately you go to sleep instead. can be "On Demand", don't look at it!
