Virgina's innocent Indri finds himself in a prostitution house led by a ruthless pimp MG. Indri is imprisoned in MG's private prison when he refuses to love him. Of course, Indri and the world-famous sounds join Helga's forces and plan to escape. Maman Firmansyah's blah, uninspired direction and Piet Burnama boring, talky script thoroughly undermines all trashy vitality this flick needs to qualify for a pleasing piece of babes-behind bars to use junk: slow pace painfully drags the whole, no free woman nudity at all (no girls nudity at all) show any skin during the mandatory group type!), the expected torture and worsening are both extremely tame and mild, a moderate crunch is also impressive, and even a ridiculous dash is not something to get. Thomas Susanto's cinematography, the ridiculously weak copying, the embarrassing excess of 102 minutes, the happy theme song and the Gatot Sudarto cornea provide an additional insult to the already terrible injury. Only some decent last reel-out action offers some relief from the otherwise overly rich tedium. Complete induction of burnout.
