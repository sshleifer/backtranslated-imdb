When The Spirits Within appeared, all you heard about Final Fantasy fans was how awful the movie was because it didn't seem like Final Fantasy. This is a different story for better or worse. Known settings, characters, music, story, and top action scenes should make fans of the original game more exciting. The problem is that it's not just a good movie. <br /> <br /> The direction of the scenes is often sloppy; , but only to make the scenes fussy and confusing. characters, although I have to admit that the Advent Children's characters moved much more naturally. <br /> <br /> The plot is almost a black hole. This is a giant deus ex machina, which aims to bring Sephiroth's last fight back. Old characters appear again, but they have no purpose other than fans. The formation of characters is non-existent and the film does nothing at all to solve the threads of any plot that remain hanging after the game ends. But it is packed with nice-looking fighting scenes with magic, invitation, and constraints, which are probably the fans you wanted. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the Adventists are a very glowing but totally pointless activity. which makes more of the fantasy of Final Fantasy VII than a true sequel. <br /> <br /> By the way, do not think that you are not helpful in the pain of my feelings. It just makes me feel better, knowing that fanboys / fangirls are so upset by my objectivity.
