My dad insisted that I watch this movie with him and I'm sorry I was wasting my time watching - I want it about an hour and a half ago! The "funny" little movie concerns the older Don Ameche, who is with his son Tom Selleck. It turns out that Ameche is not just "forgotten" as he has been told, but he has dementia (it looks like Alzheimer's). And because his father is so often "for lunch", he gets so much trouble over and over again - almost like a divine chick from BABI DAY OUT. However, the problem is that you know that BABY DAY OUT is all fantasy and the baby will be good. In addition, you do not laugh at a child with deformation or illness. But in this case, you are encouraged to laugh at a man who slowly loses his mind - and where is humor? If this film had been more successful, would the producers have made movies that were fun or people with brain Palsy or flesh eating viruses?!?! There are many people who should have been ashamed of making this movie.
