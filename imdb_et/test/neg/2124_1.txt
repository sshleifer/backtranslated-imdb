There is not much to say about this. It's just really bad. Operation is bad, the script is bad and editing is probably one of the worst jobs. It's so sloppy and dirty that it's just for audiences. There is no real plot to talk about, mostly this is really a fake looking monster fish attacking Europeans who try to leave themselves Americans abandoned. Forward it.
