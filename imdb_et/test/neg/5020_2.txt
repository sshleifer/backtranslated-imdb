First of all, I want to say that I rely on a liberal at the political level and found an offensive film. I managed to see the stigma of the whole movie. This film brings low and original ideas. Yes, it was original, so instead of my 2 stars 1. Are our filmmakers creative that they can only get out of it? The action was terrible and the characters were mostly unlikely. The story leader had no good qualities at all. They made his bf some bad guy and I didn't see it at all. Maybe I missed something, I don't know. He was the most characteristic, relevant sign of the film. I didn't get the money out of this garbage. I almost want PETA to come to the rescue and protest of this terrible, offensive film. DISGUSTING that's all I have to say!
