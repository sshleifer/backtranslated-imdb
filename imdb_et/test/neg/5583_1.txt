This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. The highlighting of the film is a comparison of the odor and the dirty vagina of natural gas. <br /> <br /> Operation is pathetic. I know that this is hard work and things, but it should therefore remain with the actual participants. Watching these people is like watching Michael J. Fox's brain surgery. It is at best shaky. One of the other remarks would be if you think the movie is recorded by Dan Gordon's ability to act Chris. Only Dan himself, or perhaps his mother, could believe that it was a good thing to do. <br /> <br /> The special effects of this movie were terrible. The worst special effects were the gas explosion in the lighthouse. It looked like someone went out of the orange light under a model made from a cold chamber. Of course there was a little computer animation up but it didn't help. I suspect that the special effects of this film were created and changed from the late 80s with a single computer.
