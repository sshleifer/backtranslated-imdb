It is high time that both American critics and fans began their indisputable, despicable respect for films like Sergio Leone's "Uncommon America". The squared history of this rich film (and the great, fantastic myth associated with its production and many versions) is mediocre at the narrative level. The film tends to go back and forth, fits and starts, its central lines alternate and seemingly outwardly surrounded by ersatz decadence, harsh sets of details, production details and a 1984 clich√©, but excellent cinematic sweets offered to the audience. The time frame of the plot is confusing, uncomfortable and laborious, so some critics imagine that Noodle figure opium is a precursor to the future dream reality and sepia-toned memories. This gift gave an overall fan-apologic interpretation of the fan, reflecting outstanding narrative irregularities. Even at this full load, the numbers appear and disappear with worrying astonishment: the character of Deborah is a short, cold and inaccessible "trophy" woman in the form of a child, who does not even hesitate to point out the severity with which she regains her relationship with post-noodles, said the union again. The deadly pace is somewhat guilty, certain sequences are moving too stagnantly for too long, celebrating very little, suggesting to the director, who has so little restraint and narrative economy, that he often feels obliged to show each screen time to show off his production, a deadly film that includes so dumb and marginal numbers. The trajectory of numerical life is presented to us as a microcosm that reflects the historical trajectory of the American teenagers with the ban and its spoiling, ending with the destruction of a decisive central number (indisputable) (except Deborah - the cosmetic department that shines or deliberately) one miracle. This term is common, even banal. Characters that represent characters in a single note script (less than seven in Italian) are played by everyone except the younger actors who have at least some facial appearance. This is understandable because it is an almost inaccessible material. Some critics argue that characters may seem like impenetrable peculiarities, but are actively looking for their goals, assuming others to match (for example, when Noodles gets out of prison, Max takes him and offers him a whore without asking him if he will not ask if that is what he wants and later deals, assuming that the noodles meet). This explanation of these abrupt abrasive dispositions is unsatisfactory to the stranger and simply helps to highlight the complicated endings that films are steadfast supporters to protect their views on the film, unfortunately in a short sense. Although Ennio Morricone's result is much revered, it is indisputable and repetitive, it shifts with emotional splitting, which scenes themselves, many violent, simply do not guarantee. It is questionable in the paragraphs whether Morricone looked at the same film that I was so inconsistent with, his work. As a pause in American filmmaking, this mood (by helping with some masterful editing of some time periods) and visual (not mentioned by the score) succeeds, but lacks narrative cohesion and fluidity.
