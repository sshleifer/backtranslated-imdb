How poor is this movie? Well, I got it less than two months ago and I hardly remember what it was about ... <br /> <br /> I also paid one pound on the DVD, the old story "pan-a-new cover -on-the-box-and-some-fool-will-buy-it syndrome. I just remember that the cast ran a lot, the use of cars had to be too high over the budget and the vampire was involved. Then I think you can find out about the title of the movie. <br /> <br /> Straight video to trash or directly to DVD as it is now. These things are in discounted packages for rental shops, supermarkets and charity stores until the sun is dead. Only cockroaches rule the land, but this garbage is still around. God blesses the dawn of DVD age.
