Jimmy Stewart is ineffective, molly-coded, selfish, sad, Carole Lombard. After falling down in difficult times, he endures humiliating work, trouble-shooting, a passive aggressive, over-living mother who needs a terribly epic smackdow and endlessly crying baby. The movie trowels failure and squalor that doesn't notice the end. Do you want to watch your mom for twenty minutes? Many scenes are characterized by a buggy child. The film does not explain why we would want to hurt mother hell or why Jimmy Stewart can't grow a couple. Who wanted to see it? Who wanted to laugh or see Stewart and Lombard? <br /> <br /> It's completely frustrating and insatiable.
