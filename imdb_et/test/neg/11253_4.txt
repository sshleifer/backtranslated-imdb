First of all, I'm critical of this movie because I really had great hopes and instead sucked this movie. <br /> <br /> * possible spoilers * (if you haven't seen the TV series) Where to start? ? Well, let's start with quality. The film was barely better than the original TV series and the two fighting scenes were very nicely designed. But CGI was terrible. <br /> <br /> Then there are plot holes and questions that will only remain after all the movie has been said and done. This film does not end as a successful completion of a very wide universe known as the FMA, and returns only to the expansion of the universe before leaving us with only our imagination to decipher what will happen in the future. <br /> <br /> And then the biggest mistakes. Adding World War II and Hitler ... WHY? The series was perfect ... and didn't need Hitler. He didn't even need Germany. <br /> <br /> Overall, the whole movie was very painful if a real FMA movie could have been and I would be directors, I had to break the CoS and make a new, more "end," end.
