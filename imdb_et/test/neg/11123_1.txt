Chupacabra: Dark Waters must be one of the most sparsely filmed films. I had been waiting for at least some satisfying entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved, and after seeing the film, I can honestly say that I greatly reduced Mr Davies' opinion. <br /> <br /> Why? The actor is incredibly bad. A great actor, like Davies, should have demanded more from the election and the director. It was painfully clear that Mr Davies was just looking at the clock and hoping that the check wouldn't bounce. To say he just showed it would be an understatement. But at least he appeared. The rest of the majority look like they posted it in their respective jobs at various Los Angeles restaurants where they work as rapporteurs. Talk about the pains of the unknowns! It's a cast that never appears in movies. They act as if they were waiting at the unemployment office. <br /> <br /> What are the special effects? Store purchased firecrackers, styrofoam, cheap rubber suit and CGI effects that look like they came from my 1980 Atari game. I've seen some terrible special effects that were used in Sci-Fi Channel movies, but this stuff looked like shots and stickers made in a child's kindergarten. I waited for Mr Crabs and Sponge-Bob to appear at the end of the fight against Chupacabra. Not to mention that all creature accounts describe it as a small gremlin-like critic. It would have been a good movie for a character like Leprechaun. Instead, we get a gigantic stray creature that is shown walking with stop-action accelerated effects that are ridiculous. Chupacabra is in one place and then blends in the hall very quickly and it's worth a little to see.
