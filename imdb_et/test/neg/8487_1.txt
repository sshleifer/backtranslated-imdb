Well, I was able to watch this movie the other day. I didn't know what to expect, because I never saw a trailer and such ... but what I just discovered in the first 10 minutes is that this movie is the worst I've ever had. > <br /> I wish I could give this movie a 0 rating. The first 10 minutes were bad, but as soon as he kept the party scene, I just wanted to enter the coma. There was no direction for the participants, there was no real story, I read some comments that show my good, if you have a small child, entertaining 90 minutes, etc., but really, why should we show this type of film to children? At best, it was bad humor, rude and raw comedy that focuses on bad special effects to fill 80% of the time. I'm sure some people in Hollywood will be on the streets of the movie bomb after that. <br /> <br /> 39 people get this movie out of 10. he has a mental problem and / or works for a film company. This movie should be on average 1.5 / 10 instead of its current 2.3 / 10 because it is 10 years old.
