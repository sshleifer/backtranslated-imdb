Like KODU KURSE, the creature genre was created, Jim Wynorski CHEERLEADER MASSACRE is a parody of straight-forward films, such as SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE. The Psycho, who has escaped from his padded chamber (.. sent to the loony bin due to the killing of eleven people), works in the countryside of Bobcat County, who is attacking someone at his fingertips. The load driver, their teacher, the two-handed hand and the driver are on their way to the race when their vehicle runs out of fuel while taking the expected short section to avoid rollback. Luckily, the group finds a cabin, but gets into a killer who attacks each victim one by one. A psycho who had gone to the county could not kill one girl because she was elsewhere where she was elsewhere, which means that the culprit is one of their own. At the same time, the county's sheriffs and his deputy continue their psycho location, trying to find the location of the missing cheerleader team. <br /> <br /> To watch the video inexpensively, Wynorski does what it can with a limited budget to find smart ways to assassinate the murder without being a luxury of truly effective special effects. In other words, many melons were sprinkled that the sound effect told us that certain victims who had been thrown into the dark by the hand of a black glove died freely. Wynorski includes a scene from SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE in relation to Brinke Stevens's character with Linda, who is trying to kill the drill (.. this killer and Linda both died, but I think Wynorski wanted to combine his film, though quite badly). it was still nice to see her, even if it was a glorious kame. Tamie Sheffield, as Mrs Hendricks has a teacher in difficulty, has a long shower in the shower, relaxing her naked body and fake breasts. The girls who make up the cheerleaders are a bit convincing because they are probably in their twenties. Soft core porn stars Samantha Philips (.. as a police officer attacked by the psychopath you are looking for) and Nikki Fritz (who is a victim who has been the victim of a dangerous bridge) need not be surprised. Wynorsk Veterinarians Bill Langlois Monroe (.. like Sheriff Murdock) and Melissa Brasselle (.. as Detective Assistant to Murdock) contribute to John Colton's serum killer McPherson search subset. Interestingly, McPherson's story is McGuffan because the movie's meat is dedicated to the cheerleading group and their dangerous situation. I'm not sure if Slasher fans take this film because they kill too much time to kill the burn and when they finally get into the picture, the violence isn't strong enough or shocking to satisfy.
