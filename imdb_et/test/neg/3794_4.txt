I went to see it 3 nights here in Cork, Ireland. It was the premiere of this world in the small cinema of the Triskel Art Center as part of the Cork Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I found "Strange Fruit" a great movie. It's a bit tough around the edges, but it's probably a low budget! In general, exemplary (especially from the main network Kent Faulcon) is excellent, cinematic and directional, and the script is very fun and thoughtful, with some nice settings and funny dialogue. <br /> <br /> The end was a bit sudden without ending the characters and events when the finals reached the end of their grip ... but maybe the filmmakers did it? It certainly made the movie more peaceful. I liked the fact that the main character did not come to an agreement with his mother: it leaves you wondering if he ever wants to, as in real life, sometimes these things are never solved. It was a good choice to leave it unresolved and not sentimental! <br /> <br /> "Strange Fruits" are very ambitious debuts and I have great hopes for what Kyle Schickner, the writer / director, will release next. He - and his colleagues - is worth what to look at. <br /> <br /> I hope that "Strange Fruit" will soon be more widely released because more people deserve this movie, a higher than average thriller, with some originals and attentive twists of homophobia and racism on America's deep south. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended: 7/10
