Okay - the title "Frankenstein House" was a reference to the original Frankenstein movie. If they follow this movie titled "House of Dracula", which doesn't really make sense, you know it's just beginning to become a franchise. <br /> <br /> Without explanation, Dracula is back and he has called himself Baron Latos. He penetrates the home of Doctor Edelman, claiming that he is looking for his vampire treatment. Edelmann has a horse sister who helps her (what are the hunchback assistants for these films), but Dracula is really interested in her second, more beautiful assistant. At this point, Larry returns "Wolf Man" to Talbot (again, no explanation), and it just happens that he is looking for the same doctor to treat his licentiousness. And then it happens that he gets into a cave where the plants can help him, which also just contains the Frankenstein monster. Dear God, when it ends ... sure that the other universal monster lines were stupid, but that is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> First of all, good things. There are some great settings and vampire pad effects are somewhat better than usual. Some of the other effects are pretty clean. John Carradine is not as bad as Dracula when you practice him, but he still doesn't like it, like Lugosi. In my opinion, Onslow Stevens plays a much better vampire in this movie, although he has the exact opposite of Carradine - all terrible and no class. None of the performances is so great, but it is rather a scary script than anything else - female parts are especially badly written. But as stupid as it is, it is usually quite fun. The best thing is this short length. <br /> <br /> Now bad things ... it's not scary, it's badly written and it doesn't work. I had hoped that the three monsters would start some supernatural struggle for power, but that would not happen. The focus is almost entirely on Dracula, who is not very well represented. On the other hand, it is the only film that Dracula infects another man, but it is done through blood transfusion rather than bite, because Universal was always uncomfortable with a potential homosexual subtext. Larry Talbot is decent, as always Wolf Wolf, but he plays a relatively small part. Again, the Frankenstein monster is part of the climatic closures. For God, Glenn Strange was fantastic as a creature! Why not give him more screen time? It is unfortunate that this series had to end with this notation (the classic comedy "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein" is not taken into account). After all, it was just sunlight and died like Dracula himself.
