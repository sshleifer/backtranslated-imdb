Dear Ram Gopal Varma, I do not know to what extent I write this letter to you. I've ever said he's a fan of Amitabh Bachchan, having ridden his jaw in jaadugar. I also need some important names in The Godfather fan club, having been watching Coppola's classics more than you have delivered your factory floppies. And, of course, I've been your great admirer as soon as you had a bicycle chain surrounded by Nagarjuna between your fingers. <br /> <br /> When you announced and called Sarkar for your attack, everyone wanted to know when the first appearance was on Sunday, when the ads would be aired, a film would appear on Friday. It was just a wish to work, knowing that you and no one between Amritsar's mustard fields and the Amsterdam lighthouse gardens had the task of creating Puzo leaves on Bollywood's big screen. <br /> <br /> Couldn't you cast more? working for the first time with a legend, pouring Abhishek into his screen-son, giving Kay Kay a role he deserves for years, bringing away forgotten faces like Supriya Pathak and Rukhsar, and choosing full members like Katrina and Tanishaa to join the list? ? Before July 1, Sarkar made the most anticipated film of any godfather who worshiped Bachchani. <br /> <br /> Open credits gave hope that your stunning sepia toned promo on the TV was innocent. But now you noted Sarkar's honor instead of the word "inspired", which you used all the time. You probably don't want to compare the two creations, but if the media is the same, the Canadian reservoir dogs and the reservoir dog city would be compared to the fire. <br /> <br /> Even when your first and last order? at the heart of any scenario treatment? talking about building and delivering power, you can't keep Nagaresit and Corleone apart, even if you replace the American mafia with the Maharashtri political power game. <br /> <br /> But you are wrong, Mr. Varma? You wanted to show Amitabh in your 70's avatars, like Salim-Javed pens pulled. You wanted him to lurk more than life. You wanted her to be her own trademark (o). Then how can you steal your voice in silence? How can you guide her to hunt for an interesting camera angle to her board? How could you leave him without his voice and dignity, two things that made B so big? Coppola's godfather Gordon Willis hid Brando's eyes throughout the film because he had no strength to match the husky's voice or unexpected fingers. But you were trying to repeat your own Malika act. But is Bachchan not Ajay Devgan? his fort is not stagnant in the enthusiasm and warmth of silence. You did that man looks like a comatose patient who has occasionally remembered to look at the smart cards and the mouth of these predicted single layers. To do this, Agneepath is there, any Saturday. <br /> <br /> Which Bachchan fan would go and look at Kay Kay Menon to steal thunder from his nose in a scene where Sarkar asks Vishnu to leave his house? Which Amitabh enthusiast would go and watch him focus on the achaar and carom, in a film that talks about the competition with the capital P? We cannot limit and undervalue so much! You won't let the camera rest for five seconds if he learns that his son wanted to kill him. Give me an old school camera-only-Bachchan style, every Saturday. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kudos made you act as an actor from Abhishek, first in Naach and now in Sarkis. You also allow him to show Mallika Sherawat that he can run both father and father. Even in a short jail order, you make Bachchan out of the text, and Shaad missed Bunty Aur Bablis. I want the film to be a father-son story rather than a chaotic conflict between caricatures for characters that appear like advertising windows on the Internet. <br /> <br /> You'll also let women run more script than Puzo and Coppola did, and again, you deserve all Brownie points to squeeze them so effectively. Pathak is a welcome return in the midst of her mother, Tanishaa, who loves loving love, Katrina's revelation of Abhishek's confusion, and Rukhsar's silence talks about volumes. <br /> <br /> But sub-plots are not a classic remake. If your free-flowing camera is trying to hack on every frame and your strong backdrop is constantly irritating, we'll remind you that we're in the factory. Well, maybe not the Nino Rota score, but Sarkar definitely deserves a better Govinda, Govinda song and an endless flute passage. <br /> <br /> Mr. Varma, some factory directors tell me that you are involved in every project, tracking the shooting schemes to monitor the editing session. Maybe Bhiku Matre was screaming in the midst of all the different scenarios in Subhash Nagare's silence. Maybe you need to take the shutters to the factory and work on one of the homemade products. Otherwise, your products would remain products, use and throw, not treasure. And just as I like movie buffs that don't have a hit and a flop, but a good cinema, I'd rather choose a factory-free movie, any Saturday.
