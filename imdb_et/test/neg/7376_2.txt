I am writing this when I watch a DVD. I grabbed the laptop and went to IMDb during the first song. I didn't know anything about the movie except that the friend said the exhibition should be good. This is also a decent Netflix rating, so here I am. <br /> <br /> Maybe at this stage. But I have to say that dancing and singing choral boys completely naked seems silly. And lips synchronization with prerecorded scores increases strangeness. <br /> <br /> Most songs and routines are related to men's nudity aspects. That's my idea, sorry. So far, the score is a general show of music. Nothing is memorable or particularly melodic. Everything is lyrics to earn. What I have to say is that they are written by the Commission. Each song is essentially one extended joke. If the jokes were ten seconds, they might work. These individual jokes lasting several minutes are not. <br /> <br /> Now I watch the movie by chapters - a few minutes until I get content. Definitely in the hope that one of them is different or entertaining to keep me going to the next scene. No. <br /> <br /> Okay, okay? I'm done. So here's what I think. If you have musical theater experience or long-term recognition, then avoid it - it's not just quality. But if you are gay twenty-something and have never seen or heard the music comedy, you can be entertaining. Or it may be in your interest if you have never seen many attractive naked men. <br /> <br /> I have.
