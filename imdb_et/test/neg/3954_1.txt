Bad, bad movie. When I saw the summary, I was expecting something similar to Ring with a video game tape instead. Nothing like that happened. I admit that the idea is interesting and it can be a good movie, but that's not the case. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the real life person, Elder Bathory, is a stupid move that absolutely does not add to the story. Anyone who knows his story even vaguely begins to think about why and how this Hungarian nobleman ended in this film. Choosing a general revenge spirit would be much, much better. <br /> <br /> Then you have the whole-in-real-life-as-you-die-in-the-game concept. As I said before, a ring story. But instead of developing it into good stories, it's just flowing with an explanation of why this game became as it is, why it was created, and so on. Good idea of ​​waste. Finally, this film doesn't even have funny parts that could, if not, save at least funny horror movies. Death scenes are too fast and action is too clean to be funny. <br /> <br /> Avoid as much as possible.
