Nothing hates the film more than pretentiousness, and it's one of the most terrible movies. It's self-conscious in every frame: "See what a deep, experienced movie," the manager and scriptwriters say to us and say, "lets see how we can make the audience even more." I'd rather look at Ed Wood or Edgari G. Ulmer the worst movie than something like that. At least they gave us a fair trash, and at least their films were cruelly entertaining. This film is as fun as the root canal with anesthesia and therefore equals torture. <br /> <br /> Have these scriptwriters ever heard the word "story"? It doesn't look like that. They have a concept, they can create an atmosphere and they were able to put together a great cast and bring out good results. And what? Did you feel for an hour and 45 minutes? Nothing happens in this movie. The only exciting part that only lasts for about two minutes will happen when one of the homeowners who is about to be evicted begins to shoot down the public officials who come to tell him he must leave. But there's nothing about it. Too bad he didn't have to shoot until he hit the screenwriters. The only salvation features of this film are the actors and some beautifully captured landscapes until the end. 3/10
