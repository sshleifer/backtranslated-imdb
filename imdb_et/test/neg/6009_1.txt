This is still the worst Hemingway customization. Rock Hudson was badly unsuccessful and completely unbelievable as a heavy bitten soldier pulled into a soldier. Jennifer Jones was too old for her and Vittorio de Sica thought she was in another movie. They tried to bring out a large epic from a romantic novel with a little key and the result is terrible. As if it were not enough, the whole thing is so slow, long-lasting and dated that it's virtually unnoticeable. Rock must beat himself to "Sayonara" and "Ben Huri" to make it horribly sad. <br /> <br /> 0/10. To avoid.
