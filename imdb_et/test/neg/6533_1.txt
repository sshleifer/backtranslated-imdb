This movie is ridiculous. It's trying to be a comedy, but the scenario is terrible. The whole movie is done with little light and you don't realize it's comedy. Really bad cinematography. You really have to sit and watch that you understand that there are some jokes here and there, but both are jokes. It is a wannabe drama that worsened. This is really a very meaningless film. Their expressions are nothing but fear and disaster that turns out to be like that. If you don't want your ass to get bored, I suggest you stay away from this movie gag.
