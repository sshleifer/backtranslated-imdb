Michael Bassett's "Solomon Kane" (by the same name created by Robert E. Howard) is a frustrating Fantasy Action-Adventure film that, despite some geniuses, is an inconvenient tempo, bad character, and general boredom. Solomon Kane (James Purefoy) is a queen of Queen Elizabeth's army fighting in Africa, where she is a face-to-face fucking reader? a demon who collects the debts of the devil, ie the souls? he simply refused to go to hell, quit the Reaper and start a new life in the English monastery. Because of this new life, Solomon has left behind its culture of violence and bloodshed and now has values ​​of peace and non-values. But when he is removed from the monastery, because he is afraid to go back to Devil's Reaper, he will return to his home in Devon and will travel to the family traveling to the New World for the Purites who travel. On a trip to the British counties, the family is attacked and their daughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd-Wood) abducted by an evil witch by the Malachi army led by a mysterious masked rider on the front line. Now, peacefully, Solomon must return to his former life, a man of moral salvation and destruction, to save Meredith. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that they have a great source of material to work on and create to create a potentially exciting and enduring medieval action-adventure movie, the film will not succeed in three main areas. The pace of this movie is terrible, which can have a lot to do in an incredibly short time, which is only one hour and forty minutes (and is probably due to the fact that they want to turn this movie into a trilogue). . Constantly jumping between drama and self-description between action and muddy bloodshed somewhat kills the thrill of action sequences. Instead of watching the audience with their eagle eyes waiting for their eyes, the film looks amazingly modest and follows the next criticism, boring. Despite being spoken of as an "action-adventure" movie or in some circles "act-epic", "Solomon Kane" is almost certainly not. Activities are everyday and boring and are generally over before you have the chance to admire the beauty of decapitation. Finally, in addition to Solomon, there are very few testimonials in the film. For example, we know little and for that reason, we care little about the younger woman Soloman can save on her trip. And I imagine again that the filmmaker refers to this criticism that there is likely to be another film that hopefully touches on those aspects that this film definitely missed. <br /> <br /> This is not a terrible film. James Purefoy is a fantastic result like Solomon, a mercenary who has to decide whether he will fall back on his conscience or his own grain, and how his decisions affect not only himself but also those around him. While respect, admiration and recognition must also go to Bassett and his team to create lively locations that reflect beautifully the time they are filming. Sometimes it is difficult not to take away when you admire the beauty of the places here, the shooting composition and the scene. It certainly shows that this movie has a lot of time and effort, but unfortunately it does not mean the same story and the signs. "Solomon Kane certainly had the potential to be more than just an" action poem ", but it seems that the lack of real depth of the story and the characters has led Michael Bassett to create nothing more than a sword game of one sword size in the Middle Ages.
