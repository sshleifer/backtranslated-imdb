As a physicist, my heart races speak of black holes and cosmology. But I found this presentation too slow and did not provide enough information to the interested person (who is most likely to see it). If there is more than a passing curiosity in such a case, go to the library and watch some books. You will find that they explain the current scientific cosmologies in more detail, while at the same time completing the hours that this film does. To set the record straight: Hawking is not considered to be the "biggest mind" or the world's "smarter person", as is generally the case with IMDb user reviews. Hawking himself has commented that "it is garbage. It's just a media hype. They needed someone to fill a disability gene role model. At least I'm forbidden." To be fair, he is probably a genius, but among the greatest scientists in history is Einstein, Newton, Gauss and many more. This does not mean honoring Hawking, who is undoubtedly a great scientist, but not respecting others who have done more than he is. Anyway, look at the movie if you're in science. But if not, I think it would be boring.
