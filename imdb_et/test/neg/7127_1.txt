This movie was perfect. It may be pollution. The exquisite atmosphere of the original remake is not where it can be seen. Sarah Michelle Gellar is not allowed to do anything, even in her death order, but still she is the best in this film and her death is the best, although she deserves better death. This is a sign of very poor writing and management. I think he made this movie to end his connection with the fact that it is a trash. <br /> <br /> Not scary. Not tense. Not funny. It makes no sense at all. And as stated above, Sarah Michelle Gellar gives the only cast of the only reasonable result.
