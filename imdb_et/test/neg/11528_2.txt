What a blender! <br /> <br /> It must be made for a TV or cable. <br /> <br /> Look: Forget the scenario - forget about the missing actors. Excuse me? Consistency? NSA / NIA / whatever or whoever he is (agent) will accept in F16 - is shown in F18, who is behind his guts, and later shown to be F4 Phantom! Oooh, I wish I could be so daring. <br /> <br /> After the male actors (!?), there are women WASPS: blue eyes and long legs, and finally they can cry for the heroes who save them. Even when a solid weld can save most of the cosmotrons, the blonde falls on the welding tool. Duh! <br /> <br /> One in ten SF movie. Like a movie per se: 1/2 (it's a half point). They should have kept the space station open and Mars. <br /> <br /> Bigger raspberries.
