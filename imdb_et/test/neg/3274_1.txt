My brother plays in this movie "Moose". Although most of his scenes remained on the floor of the cutting room. The funny thing is that the movie is something like "stats." So it's filmed in Portland, OR, where we grew up. The dance club is called "Up Front FX". What I loved about this movie is that the main character (who hasn't got the name of the box because Bolo brings more influence) should be a police detective ... a great way to ride around in a red convertible. I have to get this copy, preferably cut by the director, so I can see all my brother's inputs. The only scene she is in is when they're in a dance club. He got a seat because he was acquainted with this cheerleader from the semi-professional football team The Oregon Thunderbolts. This is interesting because his name appears first in IMDb. Celebrity has her, luck, not so much.
