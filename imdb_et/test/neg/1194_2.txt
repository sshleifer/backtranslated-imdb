I watched this movie at the Edinbourg Theater with three other Americans and our friend Manchester, and we all thought it was a waste of time. We would have spent one more hour to watch the Star Wars III steam dialog that played this hall. <br /> <br /> Opening with one of the worst jokes I've ever seen on a big screen dedicated to celluloid won't pull the bang. Throughout the film we felt that the jokes were just trying too hard, the writers thought so much that you can see the fun that comes in 2 minutes, when it came, it was so weak that you couldn't even smile; I quote a giraffe, which is the best example. <br /> <br /> The matrix, in my opinion, makes some interesting thoughts that entertain me much more than the screen. I think that much more could have been done at this angle (two different worlds, the fish's extra-fish experience, the confusion and the surprise when people try to understand and distinguish between characters and writers.) "odd" and "goof" as humanly possible. <br /> <br /> And to say that the characters of the 16th century show that writers are capable of providing intelligent writers and editors who could have thought of the film after 40 minutes; but no, its a full-length torture film that has failed. <br /> <br /> As we left the theater with very little smile inside it, I heard over a young hemispherical collision behind a British couple saying, "It wasn't quite as good as it was. What was next." "yes, quite surprising." and it was so. If it is meant to look at comedy from the British people: after 90 minutes, not laughing, but fun communicating between the two lovers, then this movie succeeded. But I have more faith in British life than this. <br /> <br /> I didn't laugh as hard as American Pie II.
