Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) arrives with Danny Ocean and his team and asks them to return his stolen money (Oceans 11) and interest. He retreats from violent action, as he is under the guidance of the world's greatest thief, the Nightfox. The team then has to pay back Benedict to test their abilities against Night Fox, who wants to keep his position as the greatest. Simply put, this movie is a complete mess. The masses may claim to be "cool" and that Clooney and Pitt performed great performances, but they are the same people who have a "Hello" magazine subscription and I think David Beckham has the potential to be a great actor. The story is complicated, it is not complicated or wise, and it does not have intelligent turns, it is just a complete confusion that goes in many directions, in the hope that the audience thinks it's cool and smart (readers of the Hello magazine). However, any respectable film reviewer can see the film he has. Although the oceans 11 were not a big film, it was a decent pace, was stylish and had some decent turns. This film loses its path very quickly and gives up its principle. Just as the director and the cast themselves said, hey, it doesn't really work, just lets laugh! Indeed, it looks like they enjoy themselves, but I wasn't. I'm not digging the plot because his confusion doesn't justify any investigation. Adding Catherine Zeta Jones is largely annoying. Scenes where Julia Roberts calls herself (with Bruce Willis, who performs a cheerful role), but the lightly amusing seems to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested. The film is so full of holes in the plot that, as Arnie has emptied Uzi's 9mm movie into the studio. Credit can only be given to a few scenes where Night Fox uses Caopeir for some funky music backward, but it is hardly justifiable to watch a movie. The final scene depicts a team with a meaningless drunken run; it collects the movie. Stick with the original.
