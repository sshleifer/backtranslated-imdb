Construction workers cut off a large, stray skeleton monster from a burial site of Indians that breaks down with its victims, touching it, breathing, or hernia! Krantz (Jim Storm) leads the resort project that his construction team keeps his skeletal discoveries secret when it stops the ongoing development of a nearby Katona tribe trying to wind up, which is still being excavated and disturbed. The aging Bruce Boxleitner, which is always pleasing, marks the adult Sheriff Evans, who is trying to keep peace between Katon and the Krantz team. At best, peace was tense, but with the skeleton of the skeleton that ran rampant, making its victims disappear, Krantz will soon ask why his team members are missing. Soldier Chief Storm Cloud (Michael Horse) warns Evans that an ancient demon, a bone-eater, has been unlocked and can only be stopped by the holy war ax (the ax removed an employee who found it remains a lunged gun) now in the back seat of his daughter Kelly ( Clara Bryant, who wears tight jeans and shirts to uncover how daddy's girl has grown into a pretty striking lady) boy truck. Evans must somehow defeat the demon when killing stops. And that must happen before Eclipse or its power becomes too strong to lose a win. <br /> <br /> Strong cast, embarrassing frightening outing. CGI is not very good, although a monster could be quite dangerous if done with a better budget. He drives Petesake a horse made of dust that traces its harvest. Some top performers are BUCK ROGERS Gil Gerard as Evan's Deputy Big Jim, STAR TREK's Walter Koenig as Coroner, & HOUSE William Katt as a doctor dealing with Evan's Deputy Wound. None of these can last longer than one minute or so. Adoni Maropi has been impressed by Katona, Johnny Black Hawk, in a printed role who wants to use a bone teacher to guide a white man out of his tribal land. Jennifer Lee Wiggins depicts Kaya, a delicious Katona female dish against Black Hawk's hate against a white man, and wants Evans to follow his Indian blood with the completion of the Bone Eating monster. It may be worth sitting down just to see the Boxleitner, dressed in military colors and in honor of India. I felt the actor was honest because Bruce was trying to keep a straight face in such a horrible movie. In another overwhelming and tiring clich√©, Bruce's sheriff has a strange relationship with his daughter, 17, hot and still wants a "bad boy". A plot of a killing skeleton and many badly developed characters.
