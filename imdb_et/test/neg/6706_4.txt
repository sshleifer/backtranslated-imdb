BLOOD CORRIDORS <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.66: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and White) <br /> <br /> London, 1840: When trying to prepare an anesthetic solution, the surgeon (Boris Karloff) is committed to drugs and is shocked by local incarnators. <br /> <br /> Riding the Gothic Revolution Coat The recent success of the FRANKENSTEIN COURSE (1957), Robert Day Corridors is an unusual blend of historical drama and the Grand Guignol Theater. Producer Richard Gordon attracted Karloff from Hollywood, where his film career remained on the B-film tracks (VOODOO ISLAND, FRANKENSTEIN 1970, etc.) with a few expensive shockers, where good men are prevented by their own control. At STRANGLER's GRIP (1958), he played a writer who stumbles upon a frightening secret while studying a series of murders from recent history, while blood at CORRIDORS is his drug-dependent surgeon who falls into the attack of criminals by Francis de Wolff, an East End pub litter. Fewer horror films than the ghoulish-decorated melodrama, the film protects its commercial transactions by adding a lot of enjoyable excitement (open-legged leg, acid-destroyed face, etc.), but the narrative is mainly due to Karloff's altruistic quest for an anesthetic formula that alleviates the terrible suffering of patients during surgery. <br /> <br /> Made under the title "Doctor from Seven Voters", finished the film until 1962 due to the indifference of the distributors MGM. Ever since the co-star Christopher Lee had earned a credit for the outstanding screen, despite having played a small but important role as a "resurrection Joe", an unfortunate Cockney thug who murdered carefully selected de Wolff's crafty pub patents and sells residues to local doctors. Lee's film glorified it at times before the FRANKENSTEIN COURSE covered him with the international stardom, which is his limited screen time, although his intense performance is one of the film's highlights. Adrienne Corri (VAMPIRE CIRCUS) distinguishes herself as de Wolff's offender and supporting roles include familiar faces, including Francis Matthews (DRACULA: FUTURE PRINCIPLE), Betta St. Currie and Nigel Green.
