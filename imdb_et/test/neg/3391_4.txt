Some of the biggest and most loved horror movies have a bad sense of humor, but when the movie comes, it's not as original as "classics," but just going to laugh, then a bunch of boys, want to be critical of the critics. This film made me laugh several times, proving how this film was viewed and shown. The two main lines look naturally and credibly together and it really helps this movie. You're driving them all the way and laughing with them, everyone has friends like both. Another highlight for me was the monster truck, it's fantastic, scary and really good. Inspiration (stealing completely) from the strain of films, most obviously is Duel, Jeepers Creepers, and probably also refers to Jack Black, while in Orange County. But you can really choose any route that went wrong and find a reference here. But what, it's not trying to win any Oscare, but give the viewer a good fear and laugh and that's 10! Obviously it is not 10 years old, I give a true reasonable overview and score 99% of IMDb people differently. This film has no chance of getting zero like so many lazy idiots that give too many movies and as much fun as it was when they didn't get 10. It's just a fun movie for anyone with a sense of humor and pleasant fears. You really can't get that easy anymore.
