This is a toilet picture movie. If the name of the production company is an indication of the smell of the film, then that would be the case. I think I'm not really a fan of horror films, it's not that I'm a chicken, but this year alone, that I haven't really blessed what is being offered so far, be it from the West or Asia. 9:56 is not a different, great assumption, but bad performance based on clich√© techniques (I think they are the only trade tools available?) To try and bring out some hearts. <br /> <br /> Se-jin (Ko So-young) is a lonely career woman who one day notices that some apartment buildings in front of her apartment buildings are breakthroughs at 9:56 am each day. No, he is not a voyeur, but a series of inexplicable deaths in the neighborhood, including one he meets on the subway, starts him deeper and deeper into the mystery surrounding death. <br /> <br /> Fear of film always has a pseudo-logical explanation of how the horrors come. This is almost the most interesting thing that is happening in the film, in disregarding the "truth", although it does not take flavored movie enthusiasts to count the plot halfway. What, of course, makes watching this movie a very inadequate experience. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of characters like a wheelchair girl, and neighbors who take care of her, as well as a schoolgirl, a detective, a mentally challenged boy, and a spooky trainer. But after the genre selection, these people are usually fed for death, or in this case, a red herring character, whose sole purpose is to mislead filmmakers, convict them when they convoy, or to add a little to pass the plot. br /> <br /> Don't start with the techniques used here. Fast cutting, unexpected appearance, long hair (ahhhhhhh, so passe!), Who can't move properly, a large amount of blood flows down the hill for free and the list goes on. But giving credit to engineers to create some ear-piercing bone cracks that are used every time the spooks move, although it seems to be one trick pony. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time even if you're a re horror fan. This is a total waste of a promising assumption and finally you feel like you're just driving. Very long and painful to withstand. It is high time for some innovations in this genre, otherwise one movie will look just like the other, ugly long hair monsters that are moving funny but able to make unexpected performances with loud sound. Oh, and can an oil in these doors even when they are.
