This is a very bad movie. However, I read that it was done by a high school teacher, so I should at least give TINY some praise for this ambitious (but terrible) special effects. Here's a plot: The monster appears in the trash and pollution in Milpitas, California, and starts a destructive rampage. I violate the "great surprise" of what a monster looks like, so please read the rest at your own risk. You have been warned! The monster looks like a giant, two-legged gas mask. In some scenes, the monster is an actor wearing a costume. In other scenes, a monster stop-motion animation is created. Operation is terrible. The dialogue is terrible. Special effects are terrible. The plot is predictable. Stay away!
