Have you heard the cloning aggregation theory where the copy is poorer than the original? Caddyshack 2 is a perfect example of this. They try to copy the first movie. Now, in some cases, it's working. Robert Stack is actually a little better than Ted Knight when they play the same character. I like Randy Quaid, who is not more or less offensive in the original than Bill Murray. But Jackie Mason is not Rodney Dangerfield, and worse still, C2 showed at one time that Dan Ackroyd is the worst comedy actor of all time. I love it very little and C2 created a coffin for my "comic" career when I'm concerned. He seems to feel the same way, getting more than tuffy like managing Daisy and hosting Psi-Factor. Moreover, for Caddyshack it is mostly "made there". See the original twice, not every version, and get more of your rent for the money.
