I think saying it is all a horrible movie would be unfair, but it's pretty bad. The Sub-Disney story includes football-loving dogs (aw, lovely!). The actor is not bad, but definitely could be better, especially the young Canadian actor Kevin Zeger, who throughout the film looks embarrassing as he doesn't even want to be there. Anyway, kids love it, but parents refrain!
