"Changi" is an Australian comedy / drama placed in the World War II Japanese War Camp. The story cuts between past events and modern times when old veterans plan to reunite. It is a much publicized and controversial ministry in Australia. The budget was over ($ 6.5 million Australian dollars); historians and veterans criticized its authenticity; and the critics put in comedy and drama (Pearl Harbor tones). Journalist John Doyle (half of the successful Roy & H.G. comedy groups) has tried to defend himself with the comments "characters are composites of real people"; "The troops used comedy to solve the situation"; "it is based only on actual events"; "one of our actors was actually there," etc. I have no problem with any of these points. Many great fictional and factual dramas have emerged from the Japanese P.O.W.st. camp experience: "King Rat", "Tenko", "Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence", "Kwai River Bridge", "Paradise Way", "Sun Empire", "Blood Swear" and "City as City Alice". Black comedy has often been used successfully in P.O.W dramas: "Life is Beautiful", "The Great Escape", "Seven Beauties", "Stalag 17", "Colditz Story" and even "Hogan Heroes". Why is "Changi" a monumental failure? "Changi's action is equally great, music and cinema are good - it's the writing and direction that has given it away." Every scene seemed to give me deja vu waves. When Anthony Hayes stood up in a relaxing sun, I thought, "Didn't I see Alec Guinness doing this on the" Kwai River Bridge "?" Suddenly blinking into a surreal song and dancing, Dennis Potter brought the "Singing Detective" back, but without the finesse. This borrowing took place so often, it created lazy writing, cutting and pasting, not respect. Permanent alternation between past and current stories did not allow me to focus. Lightning forward and the flash back can be a useful tool - here I stayed beyond the characters where intensity was required. "Business" is superfluous - every conversation seemed to contain "stone bloody crows" and such that I said "I get a point, I know they are Aussies". The stereotyping of culture also extends to the over-selfish young Japanese officer of Britain and Japan; brilliant British officer; wiser Japanese commander; fun loving, rascally Aussies etc. I thought I was looking at "Hogan Heroes on the Kwai River". After 3 episodes I set.
