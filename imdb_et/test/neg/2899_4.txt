Wow, this movie is bad. Think Ninjas "Flashdance". The worst part is when the sword should be floating, but you see a string. Or maybe the worst part is the gigantic eye wrap (which looks like diapers) that a good ninja carries. In fact, there are so many bad parts, I can't do my thoughts, which is the worst. I can't believe that someone actually made the money to do that. The only redemption value is that it is a good laugh.
