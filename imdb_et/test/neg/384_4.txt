Dr. Lucio Fulci (Lucio Fulci) is a leading horror film director who starts to feel too much of a bloody scene. He visits his local psychiatrist to see if he loses his marble; this is a bad idea because shrinkage is actually a crazy murderer who is responsible for harsh killings. Grabbing the opportunity to make Fulci his fallen boy, the mesh physician hypnotizes the fear of hacking into thinking that he is responsible for the series of recent murders. <br /> <br /> On the surface, it seems that the cat in the brain seems to be a fantastic gory to cure the spaghetti-splatter god Lucio Fulci. The chain, full of chainsaw breakage, ax attack and a variety of other bloody killings, will definitely hit the film hard enough for even the most hardened gore actions. But as they get closer, it turns out that many of the fearsome scenes are lifted from earlier films (mainly Fulc's own "masterpieces"); remove them from the equation, and one is left somewhat with the idea of ​​empty basic images, completely wasted, some welcome nudity, and Fulci's own and David L. Thompson's terrible performances due to psychological contraction. <br /> <br /> The film evolves, it becomes an incomprehensible confusion, with the borrowed gore film being randomly inserted without trying to work this convincing story. If you've seen Fulc's death touch and Sodom's spirit or the secret of Mario Bianchi's murder, you've already seen the best bits in Cat's brain before. <br /> <br /> The film surrounds itself quite quickly, leaving the viewer confused and somewhat deceived. Watch the movie when you're a graduate of Fulci, but I would recommend looking for movies that made the "good bit".
