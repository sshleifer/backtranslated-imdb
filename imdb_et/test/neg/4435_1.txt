The legend has said that the premiere of Hollywood's 2001 gala: A Space Odyssey, about 20 minutes from Rock Hudson, cried out "Can someone please tell me what this movie is?" Well, I have been rock knocking for about 19 minutes, 59 seconds. This movie didn't make any sense at all. Who were these people? Where were these people? What were the rules of the game called Quintet? Are there rules for Quintet? Did Robert Altman and his cohorts make the movie when they passed? What was Paul Newman's thinking when he signed it? Perhaps "fast Eddie" saw Zardozi and thought, "If Connery can participate in a futuristic movie that has no meaning, can I." Perhaps the good things on the floor of the cutting room and everything we see is inconsistent stuff. Did everyone cast in to keep their individual funny caps? You have never seen such a bizarre view of a hat in one place in your life. Quintet confirms exactly what I've always thought: if Altman's good he is great, but if he's bad, he's doing things like Quintet
