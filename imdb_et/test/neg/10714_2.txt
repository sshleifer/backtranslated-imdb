Maybe it's just that it was done in 1997, or maybe for someone who could get up to 7, AIDS is a soft place for children. But really people, manic laughter and chaos at the time of withdrawal? Didn't you see that coming? I'm surprised that there was no baby crawling over the ceiling and getting sick with the camera. Action was certain. But for me, this is just one example of a movie from a time when situations and subject matter can move on to cinematic language. Things happen, but that's the case. It is not possible to detect an adhesive or motif on the screen that would allow an object to use the existing emotional ties on the plot without the script doing the same as it should.
