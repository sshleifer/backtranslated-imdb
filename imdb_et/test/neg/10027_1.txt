Even under the lower standards of films of the 80s, it stinks. The calving of ordinary rogues leads the "forbidden" part of the forest that burned in the 1940s and apparently remained the only angry survivor. Fast forward (in fact, you want you to be able to do it quickly) to the present day where a couple of chamber houses are polished; teenagers follow their wakefulness, while the semi-car park (the drone Jackie Coogan) and his healthier cohort (who spins a lot of time setting up his banjo) manage to partially draw our attention from the shipyards to the mill's natural shots. Finally, more killings - but something you've never seen in Zillion before. If you want to see children polished, choose SLEEPAWAY CAMP or the first FRIDAY THE 13
