I don't remember the worst movie I watched. A waste of all the participants and the audience. If you prefer to sit on your TV and think when this movie is, it's the right movie. that people would believe that Moscow has a mystical past. But I have to say I'm not expecting anything else from Rade Serbedzija, but I've been waiting more for Vincent Gallo. The film lacks a plot, character, development, denouement.Entire film is about underground tunnels and how they are mystical. fair is some camera effect, but even it is too poor. Over and over have the same pictures.
