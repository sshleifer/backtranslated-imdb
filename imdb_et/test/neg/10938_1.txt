The Lord. Oh, this is really a bad movie. The actor is absolutely cruel, the script is pious and photography is just terrible. <br /> <br /> What makes this film stand out is that you never care about one soul - a good man or a bad boy, living, dying or dead - for the entire 87 minutes. "Oh, he died? Huh ... I thought they were" would be the best reaction I could have after every murder. The characters are so black-and-white that if the volume is off, you can figure out who was who. Although cast voices had an odd monotonous quality, their faces showed the impression that you were watching an old, silent film with lots of eyebrow strokes, exaggerated frowns, and "meaningful looks". Each character is a humorous, passionate, one-dimensional one-trick pony; if they perform, regardless of their particular role in this fiasco, they insisted on their creation; title: "Webmaster") decided to make a small budget version of "American Psycho" and got along the way upset. <br /> <br /> It's not a tough film; cold, passionate cast ensures it. It's not an offensive film; The director plays it so safely that no one can find it. This is simply and ultimately a bad film. <br /> <br /> Avoid this. We were not so happy and actually paid for watching this bomb on Pay-per-View. As part of my repentance, I write this review. <br /> <br /> Enough said.
