This exhibition is like someone training for a while. There are some good comedies and tons of mediocre ideas. It doesn't seem that writers know what is funny and what is just weird or harsh. <br /> <br /> It has its own moments. When Spike created a neighbor who had repeatedly grounded his dog's ground, it hit the top. But the fun moments are too small and too many experimental comedies that are missing the label. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is better than saying, watching a test or QVC network, but needs better writers. <br /> <br /> By reading the luminous positive IMDb comments on this exhibition, I am convinced that most of them are written by actors and relatives of Spike and personal friends. <br /> <br /> It's just not very good for most of the time.
