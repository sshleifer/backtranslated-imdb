Retro Puppet Master is a complete and perfect CRAP. Especially the dolls look stupid and crappy. The action was unforgivable and the story was rancid. This film goes back to the past where the dolls, where first created, it is not a Puppet Master .Retro Puppet Master is rated PG- 13, the first Puppet Master to be rated PG-13. There is no horror or tension in the film. The fact that this film was a Puppet Master film is a reprimand, because this contribution is not a bucket of blood, good acting, or some other entertainment as the previous films did not see. Don't look at this movie, don't rent it and don't even watch it on television because this movie is outdated, not violent and completely crappy.2 As a Puppet Master, I'm disappointed ... seriously.
