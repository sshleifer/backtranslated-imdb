A weak shelter that is looking for centuries of satanic Bible to make Lucifer's offer by giving up. The 17th Century Centruy bounty hunter named Redfern and his reluctant connotation Kassandra are in hot pursuit. Sound like a bunkum load? That's it. <br /> <br /> This writer, D.Thohy, gets a superficial treatment worthy of director Steve Miner (who led this romantic mess "Forever Young"). Twohy obviously doesn't know anything about real evil. <br /> <br /> Julian Sands is just flying around and trying to look at evil, while Richard E. Grantil is just wasting his rich talent. Lori's singer's career was also nervous. <br /> <br /> The Special Effects Team is fun and Jerry Goldsmith will give you a better result.
