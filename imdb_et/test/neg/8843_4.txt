Although it starts promising, a woman in the middle of the middle of the forest weaves in the middle of the dark roads until she almost hits a man with a lizard! This gave me the impression that we are seeing something special, almost almost Lynchian (if there is such a term), but unfortunately, the film starts to go to any place that does not have a core center, but a kind of inclined story about a woman trying to solve a small town's secret. Scripting goes all over the place and I couldn't really take care of any character, especially if a story suddenly goes back to rebound mode. I had some hopes for this movie, but it was a bit devastating.
