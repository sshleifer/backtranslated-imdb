I really can't remember the details of this movie except that the device seemed terribly familiar. Then I realized that it was filmed at the Utah City Lybia hostel in Moab. It was one of my favorite places where I was younger and wore all over the country. The man who manages / manages the hostel managed to get himself into the movie. All I remember about the plot of the movie is that it includes jeep and naked women. It's only nice to look at the landscape (I mean rock formations) ... If you're just looking for soft core porn, you probably earn it better elsewhere. I don't even know if this movie is available on tape or DVD.
