The worst thing I ever look at. <br /> <br /> The movie is a clean recycle bin. All this is bad in this movie. Direction, scenario, art, cinematography, cast or anything else. <br /> <br /> Can you say more? <br /> <br /> The main character is the boy. It must be around 20 years old, but the role-player looks like a 30-year-old, plus he's a very bad actor. <br /> <br /> Editing tries to save it, but with that very bad material they can't do wonders. <br /> <br /> As I said, the poor is cast, the text is bad that it doesn't help the participants. <br /> <br /> I learned how not to make a movie.
