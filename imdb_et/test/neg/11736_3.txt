Norm (a) Ally I do not mind remakes. There are some pretty good ones, but it's smelly! Given that it was practically a scene, he had a good story and great actors. Van Sant copied Al's direction virtually flawlessly and added color (I am not one of those who think it must be a classic monochrome). It should have been at least a mediocre movie ... but it was piss-pee caa-caa! I don't understand how it would be so badly twisted. If you think, look at it as curiosity, but I would recommend that you don't worry.
