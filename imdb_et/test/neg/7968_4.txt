Lina McLaidlaw is a bright, lonely young woman who suddenly falls in love with Johnnie Aysgarth, a very eligible bachelor who wants to lose money. They get married, but almost instantly with Lina depends on Johnnie's dependence on lying, gambling and getting into debt. Despite his mistakes, he can't resist his charming way until he suspects he may have murderous thoughts against him ... <br /> <br /> It's a good movie, well-made and attractive cast, good script and maybe one of the most common film history. Okay, maybe it's going too far, but not much. Many movies change the end of the book (Great Expectations, The Shining, etc.), but not only can the last two scenes be terribly flat, but also make the whole plot completely meaningless. The story speaks of a woman whose husband is led by her greed and morality - and what she knows about her - to kill her. It should end (as Francis Iles / Anthony Berkeley's book "Before the Fact") where he tries to kill him. This is not because the studio forced Hitch to complete, which is one of the first examples of the audience testing preview process. Hitch was clever and did what he was told (this was only his third film in Hollywood) knowing that when he played the game he would sooner or later get the creative control of his films, as demonstrated by his fifties masterpieces. But it still leaves us with turkey. It is very shameful because it is a very good movie with an intriguing theme - does anyone know your husband so well? The script is great because many off-guard moments (like Lina's father die and Johnnie assumes she's crying), the perfect performance of Grant (who has never played a villain) and fine photography, which ended in famous milk glass. Fontaine won the Oscar for her performance, although I personally prefer her confusion and vulnerability to her earlier role as a victim of Rebecca. I would like to appreciate this movie, but I can't really forgive that end; this happens when the movies are made for money, not for love, which I think is an interesting theme of the film itself. Quickly look at Hitchcock's home as a man posting a letter.
