It speaks a lot about the UK if such television programs can not only be made but also in three series. Unfunny, politically correct and ill-acted and written. Meera Syal has not been funny and has not achieved what she has been, tell me that I am wrong, and Jasper Carrott, a funny guy as he is, has passed since the early eighties. It is such a bad comedy that it could have been done by ITV, but even such stinkers as the upper arm and James Bolam as a parking place sender look like Fawlty Towers compared to it. I would like to sit with the writer / director of this exhibition so they can bring out the humor of this program. It is true that the majority of the UK population consists of poorly educated chavs, but it does not call their funny bones. This is when they could break off Brother or mobile phone, but that's another story. Complete and complete dirt!
