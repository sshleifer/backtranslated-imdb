I generally like the work of Sion Sono, but this movie was completely slowed down. But unfortunately this has not slowed down enough to make it entertaining. I just sat in the mouth agape, wondering when it would end. There is only a whispering whisper on the plot. I think it was supposed to be campy. I mean, haunting hair extensions - how would it be? But humor, as it was, fell gradually. Not funny. Not scary. Not expensive. I would say that perhaps Sono was hired for this project, but he also seems to have written this boring trash. Do I still have a couple more to do, what else to say? I think I could finish by saying: Better luck next time, Sono-san.
