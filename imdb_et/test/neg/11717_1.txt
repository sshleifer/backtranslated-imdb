After this dirty bin was filled, a friend and I solemnly vowed to say that we never talked about how we threw our life for the last 90 minutes. This film is a totally useless, two-dimensional hero and heroin we can't give, regardless of whether they survive, and some flat-bladed crooks who would ever darken the screen of the horror (or some other) genre. To further prove if the film is absolutely pointless, I would have liked to add a plot summary, but I cannot write a fiction. All and all, the only reason I ever think someone would want to watch this movie is whether they would have murdered their entire community and were looking for some self-conscious punishment that haunts you for all the coming years!
