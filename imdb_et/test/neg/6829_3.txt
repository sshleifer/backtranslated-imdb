So let's say you're a producer, you have the money, and you got some Richard's move and Bruce Willis, so now you just need a script ... but why? Look, this movie is really terrible, the actress is pretty good, but casting is a terrible move and Willis did everything she could to play the characters they just can't play. now, this film has no plot, or rather, something that tries to exclude a plot: there is an average hit man (Willis) who is cool dangerous and experienced (in fact, he is none of these things, but some of the other characters in the dialogue, you should get this impression) so that this person has to kill someone in his role, now there is a former IRA prisoner who is kind and nice and very pleasant (gear) who frees the FBI from helping him. So now the FBI is "exploring" to find this person, the investigation consists of a number of unlikely data - as some casual people lost their wallet and someone used their name to buy a car - which is always the right money. because there is no real plot and the script is so dirty, you can't expect the actual character to develop or tension, so instead of breaking the story, they just add the separated dramatic music that shows something very dramatic instead of to actually create something dramatic .. <br /> <br /> The main line is that it is a very bad movie and a total waste of time that somehow reached an incredibly high level, probably due to what manufacturers read.
