I just left when the movie started (because I saw the name of Juliette lewis on the screen). Sex object used too much movie unnecessarily and it seemed to me that the director ignored those who have a tendency towards opposite sex. In my opinion, a well-prepared script could not be embodied. anything at first or i just wait too much ... and finally finally ... end up being so mediocre that i wouldn't wait. The main character Cassandra wants to give a message about the child and how the baby can change life, I think this scene is a real disaster for the film. all the characters are funny and acted beautifully. But only the cast cannot record the movie.
