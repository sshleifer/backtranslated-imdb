As a resident of CA, I would like to see that the jackholes closing the power plants would also be in prison. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was pretty good and has some very informative pieces. Although they adhered to how Enron rose and fell, I found it really interesting. However, if the film was focused on the shore of Bush, it made me wonder whether they were really accurate. <br /> <br /> It is good to note the connection that Republicans had to Enron, but the monster was created when Clinton was president. The CA energy crisis happened on Davis's watch. Both were in office while abusing Enron, but neither is responsible in any way. Rather, much time is spent on how Bush was with his friends. So what? Lay played golf with Clinton and spent the night in Lincoln's bedroom. Why do Democrats have such a free move in this film? I think most politicians are a waste of our taxpayer's money, so I'm not part of any party, but I hate feeling like I'm under someone's political agenda when I watch a documentary. Yes, politicians deserve to be accused, but I really doubt that the only guilty after their names is Rs. I didn't find any value in depicting Bush as Kay lovers when Democrats got the same amount of Enron campaign money as Republicans. As I said, it weakens the rest of the film for me, as it puts me in doubt about the rest of the facts.
