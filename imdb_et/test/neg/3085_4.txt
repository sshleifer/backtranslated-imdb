I saw this movie in the middle of the gap. It was about 3 in the morning, and I fought with fast snacks with insomnia. It wasn't too bad at that time, but every time I tried it, I couldn't get into that night. <br /> <br /> At that time, I thought it was lovely and I loved different symbols, even though they might have done better than Goran V. But one thing I watched was Heather's character and his sad "commitment" "to his wife, who didn't want him anymore, which made me regret at the same time as he and his roots. (Given that I was in the same situation at that time, maybe I liked it so much.) Not a bad movie, but you have to be pretty romantic close to the character to rate it, and we hope you'll ever have.
