I can't believe anyone paid for this movie. Stupid, unreal and stereotypical. Immediately after the massive 747 start, the pilot pulled back the accelerator pedals to increase speed. then you have 5 armed persons with semi-automatic fully-fired weapons without any bullets breaking 38,000 feet of pressurized cabin walls. When the plane is below, a number of balls will hit the FUEL line and we will see that the fuel leaks from the plane. Operation was just terrible and forced. There just didn't seem to be any direction. I've seen pretty terrifying B-movies in my lifetime, but I was very disappointed with the names of this movie.
