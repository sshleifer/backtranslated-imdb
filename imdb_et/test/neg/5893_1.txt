It was full of holes in the plot, inaccuracies (timeout of injured players or disappearance of helmets in Texas football games?) And not so much redemption (so your father hits you? Well, do something at once and then he loves you and makes it all valuable.) < br /> <br /> Do we make a movie about the team and its endeavors for the championship OR make the film from the team player and his personal struggle, but instead he tried to do everything and came a few meters short. The book probably showed the whole story a lot better; the film should have chosen one element of the story and it was stuck. <br /> <br /> Instead, the movie jumped from one character dialog to blink the game and then another character's dialogue in the month, without actually telling you who they were or why they were important - QB invited her sister-brother to take care of her mother - What happened to it? Since the mother was ultimately connected to the final game, does it mean she is no longer crazy? Its one redeems quality.
