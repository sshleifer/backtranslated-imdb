This is a very bad waste of your time. I'd probably go see a documentary like this; it's really so bad. <br /> <br /> Action is really terrible and you can say that the producers' budget was terrible because of the picture quality. It's far from the low end of the scale; Don't waste your money on it. <br /> <br /> I really find it hard to believe the person who made this movie is going well. I had to watch it with the kids when my mother rented it because she thought it was good for the kids. Even children (3, 4, 6, and 8) thought it was quite boring. <br /> <br /> I agree with another comment, Spongebob would be much better off than that. <br /> <br /> Generally, just don't look at it. Don't. Don't.
