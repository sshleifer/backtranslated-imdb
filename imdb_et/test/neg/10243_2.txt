This is not the worst film I've ever seen. I didn't feel that I wanted to forcefully remove my balloons after watching Galaxina. It's not just good. Jokes are almost funny, but they are little. All of them. Few close gags collide, repeating them over and over again. Production values ​​are very non-existent. The sound is bad, the lighting is bad, ... it seems to be cheap to do; too much. Dialogue ... well, it's often missing - many awkward silences; they all stand easy and it seems someone should say something. The film even seems to be ambiguous as to what it wants to be - it is not always clear that it was meant for comedy, as perhaps what emerged after shooting. It seems like someone's movie project they threw at night before that, and if they'd been up for two weeks, it might have been good. <br /> <br /> And I'm just pleasant. I thought "mother and father save the world" was a hoot. I like "Pluto Nash". "Mystery Men" is one of my favorite films. "Spaced Invaders" are close to the classic. This turkey just doesn't do it. "Space Truckers" was more plausible. <br /> <br /> Avery Schreiber, who may be very funny, is trying too hard. His part requires a straight line and he plays it on sitcom. Dorothy Stratten is in her role, but not particularly remarkable. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, "My clock is always slow." the line was funny. I will give this film to all the voices he receives, it needs. <br /> <br /> Spacecraft models are not bad, but they are scarce and are not being used effectively. Space scenes are vague. Sweep transfers, detailed flight tickets, even inadequate steps when docking. (Infinity makes the crash very strange in one place.) Flight dynamics is terrible; worse than anything you've seen, they're shrinking, not smooth. The initial battle is static and static; Although two ships have just shown that they are able to maneuver in their nervous way, (slowly) shots trade in the near future in a way that is more reminiscent of the 16th century sea battle, except not so exciting. Aliens - Imagine whether all Star Wars was a scene in the scene. The fact that many rubber masks can fade quite quickly, right? Some of them are used as eye eyes that work OK for the first time, but not for the fifth time. <br /> <br /> If you try to look at Galaxy, you are probably asleep. (I did something else and missed it in the last ten minutes and didn't feel it was worth it. If that doesn't say it's sucked, I don't know what it does.) Unfortunately, there is a lot of potential, and that would be was easily a good movie. It would be easy to do this and it has a decent film. <br /> <br /> MadKaugh
