I loved this movie! This is a modern Russian cinema parody. Who else, but Sokurov could bring Tarkovsky so brilliantly. You thought the "Stalker" was slow? Well, step on the plate. "Mat i Syn" makes "Stalker" look like "lost ship Raiders". Under no circumstances should you leave this movie! Sorry - even if you live a busy life, you can still enjoy the movie completely by keeping your video recorder fast. Sokurov has given us the first full-length movie that can be evaluated in 12 minutes. <br /> <br /> I think the next big masterpiece comes when someone has a vision and courage to show a movie that consists of no sound or picture at all - 45 minutes with a black silent screen (wasn't it already explored "In the Soup "?). <br /> <br /> Probably the filmmaker (and fans) have forgotten this "motion" is the first word "film". <br /> <br /> !!! NOW SPOILERS AHEAD !!! <br /> <br /> Want to reach the genius that this movie achieved? Here is a step-by-step guide: <br /> <br /> 1. Find a talented photographer. <br /> <br /> 2. Find some themes and a scenic landscape (guess Tuscany!). If you need inspiration, check out some luxury car or perfume ads. <br /> <br /> 3. Shoot some 3 rolls of rolls. <br /> <br /> 4. Photoshop results that allow you to play around with saturation, blur, and aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> 5. Now just go out with your movie camera, the 40 best photos and let your "actors" leave your line. Don't worry about writing it - let the participants say what they want (lines like "Do you want to drink?" And "Let's eat something" is really all you need to spend 8 minutes). If you can't think of enough dialogue - no problem! Just ask them to repeat what they say a few times. If it is not enough, let the camera still work. <br /> <br /> Congratulations, another masterpiece! As a bonus, if you want to spread it over the Internet, there is no problem! Static images compress anything with standard mpeg encoding - a 73-minute movie would probably be about 2-3 megabytes, even at the highest level.
