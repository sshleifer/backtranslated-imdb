This film amused me to laugh with the actors who kept the movie moving in all kinds of crazy directions. If you like the desirable languages ​​and sexy looking galleries, they were all in the picture and gals and the boy who was looking to burn before they even finished high school. There is one scene where teenagers drive into their car in a very fake deer and then throw that lake or ocean that is repeated over and over again. There is no horror for this movie, except for the word Horrible for the whole picture, and Arnold, who is playing plastic, is really one sick character. Please don't waste your time watching this movie.
