As a child, I never understand why someone would look at it very funny. It was stupid and I always wanted Sprid and Jim-Jim to get some fatal accident (they were annoying). <br /> <br /> Now, almost 40 years later, I have a new comic attitude. Although I still think it was a complete mess, it's just an American version of the show. This is because I read a book about the anime and found that the observations we watched were completely different from those originally shown in Japan. You see that the idiots responsible for a series of ideas thought it was too violent to cut it out of episodes. It is bad enough, but what they still did not believe - they split the episodes apart and cut them together to create samples that were not something original! For example, one episode may consist of parts 3, 6, 18 and 27! As a result, I really don't know if the original show was really bad - it can be great. But who can say what we all have to look at is an Americanized mess?
