!!! Spoiler Warning !!! <br /> <br /> The point is, however, that I didn't think that this movie was spoiled at the end of the TO ... I just started looking at it, after Matt had reached Sarah's body, but then I snow machine plot odd, even for Channel 5 movie ... and couldn't see how Matt wld will be happy. What about her groom? At one stage he seemed to get to his best friend, definitely icky and wrong ... and then the whole "oggi oggi oggi" MUST NOT work as a friend-friend that is just ridiculous ... just come back to life? and how does he still live like a woman? and then the movie got over it, ending and not explaining anything at all !!!!! What is this? I was so cross, wasting my whole life all day without reason !!! :) but there was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, swings and ring roads
