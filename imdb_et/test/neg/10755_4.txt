What we know about Caravaggio offers a striker who has the right to live among the whores and thieves and hustler and put them on the canvas. The themes of her work were sex, death, salvation, especially the holy search of the Prophet. He lived at a time when homosexuality wore the death penalty and the political intrigue was usually in a fatal society, defined by the maximum "boy vengeance for the purity of his war". Jarman for his cinematography, as well as his Caravaggio paintings, and you certainly cannot blame the man for leaving homosexuality. But to be honest, Jarman is never a caricature of over 80 years. The patron of Italy is the 80's London art scene with pretty waiters and calculators. Sean Bean is a sexy bit of northern harsh oil on his motorcycle. Tilda Swinton performs a transformation worthy of Mills and Boon ("Why, Miss Lena, without this gypsy head, you're beautiful ..."). Jarman offers Caravaggio a particularly worrying murder that left him. the lives of ordinary people in the status of Renaissance masterpieces, viewed by emperors and kings. Instead of what you get, Pierre et Gilles is from Italy. The beautiful bodies of young boys are shown perfectly, but never by those who live in them. It seems Jarman gets into the scene of London art, showing it low and pretentious. When using Caravaggio and Renaissance Italy, the pig has a silk purse used to make the ear. In fairness, this film remains visually stunning, but ultimately as two-dimensional as it describes.
