I thought this film could be a good fraud or at least a good independent comedy like Friday. Instead, it was something that someone in high school does with their older camcorder. It was not just a small budget that makes this movie bad (many big movies are made with low budget), it's just a bad movie and it wasn't even bad enough to be a good camp. Example: Nothing happens in the first ten minutes of the movie except the 3 main characters sitting in the smoking room in your room, putting their makeup on and then answering the call. You are waiting for something to go, but it will never come. The sound was so bad that I had to turn on the TV completely to find out what they said (which wasn't interesting yet). When I pay for renting a movie, I usually suffer through it, even if it's bad, but it was all I could do to sit for 20 minutes. It seems to me that the person in front of me felt the same way because they did not record the tape and left the same place where I did. The only reason I gave it is 1 because the rating system doesn't have negative numbers.
