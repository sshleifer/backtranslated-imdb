Dr. Krellman wants to save his son Julio, who dies of heart disease. He decides that a heart transplant with a monkey cures his son (no - I'm not kidding). He makes a transplant, and (somehow) his son becomes a weak man a muscle-binding man with a mousetrap that resembles a monkey! Of course he gets out, kills men, tears women's clothes and destroys. It's all cut with the romance of police boredom. Arturo Martinez and Daamlitser Lucy Ossorio. We also get meaningless women's wrestling sequences that don't add anything to the plot. Everything ends with the end of "King Kong"! This is (probably) a pretty stupid movie. There is little point in the plot, female nudity (a movie of any exploitation) and a very graphic color that seems ridiculously fake (except for an open heart transplant). However, it has value. The whole cast takes all dead seriously and in fact they are not too bad as actors. The dubbed dialogue was well done (for such a film) and interesting with amazingly good copying. I also saw a bright strong color (which helps) with a great DVD tape. We are not talking here about the classic, but the OK movie.
