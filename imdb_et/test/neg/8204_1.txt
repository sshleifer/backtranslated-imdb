This distinction must go to HARROW DUNGEON. At least Ed Wood's erroneous attempt to make a high-quality science fiction film was a dubious "star" of power by Bela Lugus, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. HARROW DUNGEON has no redemption features. What could have been an interesting and varied plot of armadrates hidden in the colony, perhaps DR. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND is a trash can with heavy dialogues and a mono-tonic effect of amateurs, whose lines disappear like weights in the sea of ​​stupidity. "Special Effects", which took place in someone's bath, also punish this film for a bunch of manure. Even the treatment of leprosy is something about the Bible's Victorian interpretation. The fact that leprosy cannot be agreed upon in the last stages of an individual does not recognize the plot line that aristocrat Fallon and his lady Cassandra agreed with the disease, and ultimately, De Sade's fortress for the original people executed by insanity and inhuman cruelty. It is interesting to note that no cast member made another movie. No wonder talent generates talent; the lack of talent creates forgetting, which means that this film should find its unfortunate end.
