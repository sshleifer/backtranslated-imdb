This film serves every imaginary Greek stereotype. In a particularly frightening scene, Tycoon says, "I'm just an unknown peasant." Like the grandchildren of Greek peasant immigrants who gave their children and grandchildren the legacy of wisdom and love, I found this film despicable and disgusting.
