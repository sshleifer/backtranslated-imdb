I don't understand jokes. I believe that this is a problem with my contemporary cinema or those millions of dollars made by films, which it hopes will be the next biggest feeling. Isn't it strange? people just don't laugh so much and I believe one of the diseases of this problem is the movie "Showtime". There was nothing between the beginning and the end of the credit that was all between Murphy and De Niro, where Russo saw a candle, even with ordinary clichés that make the general population pre-programmed with a laugh, there was nothing in the film that made me laugh. At the time of the rupture of this film, there were no overwhelming physical jokes or calculated spiritual vowels. From the start, I didn't buy De Niro and Murphy as Hollywood excitement, but in his commentary, the director speaks vividly about the hijink and laughter that happens during the shooting? where was this movie? Does this fall into two problems? the director does not really have a comedy feeling or the editor did not understand the value of the film. Either way, one and a half hours of the Hollywood nightmare "Showtime" was executed in both cases. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to laugh outside, there was no reason to follow these signs at any moment. film. De Niro wished to collect the pottery as a hobby (the director had to write KILN on the machine so that the viewers could understand who was doing it?), But it was left behind, but it was left behind and never developed. It was a thought that Murphy was an actor, but no monologue outside would have understood it. He rents a room in a production building where he can afford a police officer's salary? It just didn't even calculate Hollywood standards. There was a bad guy who wanted a big gun, but the weapon was never developed, nor was the ability of the weapons a real test? even at the end. Bigger jokes laughed at the accent than remembering the weapons. Where was this television shown? Russo had to get this random man's permission from the start, but there were no consequences. In the middle of this movie, there were no other issues and meaningless drifting outside. Random characters were introduced, forgotten, replayed, and forgotten again. The director and the producer laughed at it, while we, the little spectator, need to suffer through internal jokes and cliché stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Was this movie interested in love? Was it a really bad bad boy who left the comic duo to bring the real evil on the screen? Were there any pop culture references that didn't come back to Robert De Niro? Was there a random chaos in the whole movie? If you need answers to them, you probably won't find them in "Showtime". The fact that I am questioning this question only means that this sub-parameter (actually down to sub-sub-sub-par.) Did not fulfill any quota or recall the value of the cinematographic world. Of course, it had big names and one really clean explosion, but it had nothing at all. Almost like the leader said before shooting that he wanted clichés, but not regular clichés? go bad. The plot had no linear structure. The jokes were boring. The characters were drab and underdeveloped. It's even below the best "friend-police" movies. I like to give the movies some benefits, but nothing in this movie worked. Even Shatner couldn't save that movie, and he even tried hard. <br /> <br /> Generally, I can't recommend this film to anyone with a pulse. The comment only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with the creators who are suspected of obvious mistakes, terrible jokes and their work. If the creators fail behind "Showtime", why should we? I didn't want a "death weapon" when I looked at it, but I wanted something like that. I understand that the corrupt being of "reality television" and the media was criticized, but this message did not leave it out of the page. Actually, I believe I saw the media first when I watched it. Shame carries the heavy hand of this film and I can't blame it. Murphy used to be a big star, comedy was his middle name (see "Coming to America"), but lately he seems to have lost his edge. De Niro obviously wants to get the picture that haunts her, but making her movies puts her back. One of these films is equal to one Scorsese picture. <br /> <br /> Leave it out. I promise it will make your last movie days useful. Oh, and if you laughed at this movie jokes? I'm really sorry! <br /> <br /> Rating: * Off *****
