Spain's incomparable Paul Naschy, a horror film icon, gives his talents to this entertainment, not a scatterhot film. What starts as a filament lamp comes to horror. All I can say is just sit back and enjoy the ride. Paul Naschy plays with a cold-hearted hit, hired by some shady Japanese diamond hunters (one of his flame carrying his baby) to pull the Belgian businessman's diamond cache. When it is done, the tempting Paul of the diamonds is too tempting to trigger, so that he kills his Japanese cohorts. His girlfriend, whose brother Paul killed, promises revenge and pursues Paul through the forest, putting him up and leaving him dead. But Paul is found with an egghead that has two grooved daughters and brought it to his estate to restore. with busty Silvia Aguilar decided not to lose sweet and prim Azucenale. But things get furious for Mr. Naschy, who is going to see the ghost house of her daughter's long dead mother. Connect it to a Japanese boy who wants to stop Paul's killing and pulls him from two sides. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (The story goes in many ways and does not fully match. The script builds a struggle between Paul's daughters, but Silvia, whose character is self-confident and volatile, just lets Azucenale win Paul Naschy in the race without a fight. Japanese woman.> <br /> ACTING: $$$ (Paul Naschy, as always, is fun to watch, but he spends some time in bed when he recovers from his wounds. She is again loved by Silvia Aguilar and beautiful Azucena Hernandez, who joined Mr. Naschy in the small pearl "The Craving." Both girls are doing a good job. <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$ (You can take pictures of both Aguilar and Hernandez very briefly, but they are strategically placed, Two nascent actors act as a nudity: a Japanese woman looking for Paul and an African servant working for Silvia and Azucena).
