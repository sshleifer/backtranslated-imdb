The maximum risk for a person who has seen more of his films is quite surprising. Director Ringo Lam made an average film that can be compared to most other medium-quality films, a special prediction for "muscle from Brussels". It has a pretty stylish style, an interesting atmosphere, and last but not least, beautiful Natasha Henstridge. Even VanDamme doesn't make you cry because of his show, he does a good job. Of course, you may not compare the maximum risk (oh, what is the creative title!) With `Ronin, but after watching 'Knock off, it's good movie hell ... of course in special standards.
