SPOILER - this film gives you the points of the plot and discusses the end. I hated this movie - mainly for political reasons, but also for moral and aesthetic reasons. Politically, this film has respected war and military technology - blowing things up really well. We are invited to rejoice because music swells and the Afghans use our weapons to blow the Ruskies bit. And no US soldier let his life line - so it's a fun war. Aesthetically, the film has no real human emotion, just cunning, privileged people who are sarcastic, know their boss and do what they want, regardless of the consequences. And when it comes to the consequences, the film only makes a few small hits that the Afghan army actually brought. I had read the earlier draft of this script and it ended on September 11, with Charlie Wilson knowing that things had gone terribly wrong. But it wouldn't leave the audience well. It's a good movie about killing Ruskies. And it made me sick.
