Extremely boring ... I don't care how much avant-garde bones you have in the body, this baby sucks ... and don't go and see it because I mentioned it was stored in Warhol's "Empire", it's far more entertainment! I've seen other Duras movies that were much better, so I'm stupid why it is considered a "masterpiece". As an art historian, I had to take into account the radical works of Marcel Duchamp, Chris Burden and Damien Hurst, and I still see artistic intent, even quality and entertaining in their artwork. "Indian song" is not even soft porn Anias Nin almost here - G-rated slide show about sex and voice that does not touch the slideshow / movie ...... pure crap and not even combed ... unfortunately only 2-hour cage and waste. To offend the injury, I added a print that I saw, faded and scratched! (Harvard Film Archive), if I want to see "fun boring", I look at Bunuel! Yes "Indian song" - keep your head high in the future of modernism and be truly bored! Watch the 70's porn movie, all the good parts of which are cut out and sounded off, you get "Indian song", but with better cinematography and no irritating music or vice consul !!!
