Some of the films produced by Roger Corman's new world film company in the 1970s represent the best kind of B-film, where the genre constraints actually act as a kind of liberating effect on writers and directors? such classes included classic films such as "Deathrace 2000", "Hollywood Boulevard", "Grand Theft Auto" and "Caged Heat". Unfortunately, his former American Confederates of International Pictures went out of steam in the 1970s, especially in the absence of Jim Nicholson, and they often produce second level imitations of Corman films, sometimes with his own letters. "Black Mother, White Mother" is one of those films. This is basically a cheaper "Big Doll House, where some of the same stars do the same things. Yes, this is John Ashley's co-production (yes, the same John Ashley who was fun in Elvis who wants to be)" How to make a monster "and pair with Debbie Walley's "Beach Blanket Bingo") in all her signature signatures, women's prisons, all but 2 or 3 guides, including prisoners and guards, are mostly Filipino participants in non-conversational roles, where we see supermodel-type women who accept the role of revolutionary soldiers and where the main joy of the movie comes from the original use of S&M. <br /> <br /> The last time it was terribly damaged by light (good is Has Viharo described it as a "yellow mother, yellow mother"), but I think even under the best conditions photography is and management is extremely routine and there is very little visual value - there shouldn't be much wi movie itself, because it was always funny enough to at least give your movies the value of the extra production in the movies in free public places that would make the film more impressive. This movie does not seem impressive, it has no impressive soundtrack, and you feel uninterrupted to anyone who shows talent. The only remarkably interesting performances come from Pam Grier as a hostile whore to escape from life, filipino actor Dindo Fernando as his grotesque self-conscious pimp and Sid Haig as a cowboy mercenary. The story puts Grier and co-star Margaret Markov on The Defiant Ones for a low-budget female version, but does very little for the melodrama provided by this premise. This is basically just a pretext to ensure that the two main characters can still end the good mud wrestling game when they try to escape from prison. All this is in the spirit of good fun, but the film may not even end up being exploited, because there is a certain edge and crude that should appear in such scenes, which is replaced by some predicament of horror instead of the leader's hand. > <br /> So the film has little value if fans have hard core usage value? at least in the version I saw, it's no clearer than "Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill!" more than ten years earlier and visually and thematically much less interesting. For those who just laugh at "so bad good" movies, it may be nice, but it is not in the top tier. It would be advisable for people to search for "drilled heat" or for someone who enjoys their cruelty so that it becomes a camp; it is similar to less ambitious efforts, such as Cirio Santiago's "The Muthers". Unfortunately, the best thing about this film is the title and the presence of Pam Grier, who was better than other films (especially Jack Hill's "Coffy"). This film, perhaps, illustrates Miss Grier's journey from the Corman secretary to the B-Queen-For-A Day, but besides this historical "importance", it has little value even for Grier's big fans because she has been given very little work to do. <br /> <br /> It is worth skipping if, of course, you don't see a cinema with many friends and a lot of beers like me. And even then, its value is questionable.
