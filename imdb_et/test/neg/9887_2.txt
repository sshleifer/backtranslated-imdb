I read the book after seeing the film and didn't care about it, I found it somewhat uncomfortable; but clumsy books often make good movies and it can certainly be. The story of a teenage girl studying her attractive power over boys, which she considers irresistibly stimulating, because it is undoubtedly controllable and has even a stronger handle than a normal girl because it affects her through her werewolves. - This story would obviously be a call to a young audience to make films: a one-time appeal to girls and, secondly, boys: and I don't understand how filmmakers can be blind and turn to someone who doesn't like anyone. <br /> <br /> First of all, take the title (which is the best for the book): it is made from the Hesse quotation, which is also used as an epigraph, about a person who runs fear and tastes both mouth blood and chocolate, one tastes so bad as the other. This is a wonderful metaphor for the heroine's state: it is torn between its human and wolf sides, worshiping both, but both in fear. The film is an epigraph that introduces the character of her aunt's chocolate shop! I understand how the title of the book could have suggested to filmmakers erotic charged "Like Water for Chocolate" chocolate, and led them to want to associate the same symbol with werewolves. But they didn't; why is this movie? In the book, there are characters in high school - or in and out, like five teenage gangs who prefer black jeans and T-shirts, and fall somewhere between the heroine and his pets. In the film they have become twenty decadent. In the book, the heroine is 16 years old to discover how her sexuality works with her and her boyfriend; he is the one who starts the contact, then comes back, starts again and so on. In the film, she is no longer a girl, but a woman, and the boy is no longer on the edge of the university's life as a poet, but from the law (and the comic artist who is starting up), this is what comes to him, both uncomfortably and his worm. Originally he puts him down, but then gives in as he is sure he: hey, you know you want it. I would have thought that a female leader would have taken the book to offer a female protagonist who has a contradictory and proactive role; but not. <br /> <br /> In the book, the heroine clan is driven from his home by the behavior of five criminals; in the movie it is because he went to run (!). He's a big runner, leaning out of the walls of the building, and both he and his clanmen are reaching the building. very similar heroes of martial arts movies and very different wolves or something similar to them. In the book they do not become wolves, but things that are bigger than wolves; in the film they are just ordinary wolves. In the book, they are metamorphic in carving style, with the splitting of vertebrae; it is one of the things that make the hero aware of the pain and joy of his body. In the film, werewolves have become magical acrobats, having large swan dives and becoming air-centered, bright yellow like Tinker-Bell; it looks cool, doesn't mean anything. <br /> <br /> The book has a somewhat white-trashy family that has moved from West Virginia to Maryland. In the movie they live in Bucharest, but all speak different accents, no one in Romania. In the book, almost all packaging wants to live a normal life and agree to ensure that - and their survival - one of the necessities is to keep their true nature secret from people. And so are the characters in the film; another clan leader is an underground boss, but probably not a criminal boss, because he despises criminals - and he has a permanent agreement with the police who supplies him with a "meat" pack. This seems to be a big exception to the rule that people would not know; but maybe the police are considered safe because they are known for their eccentricity and forcibly murder. <br /> <br /> At the end of the book, the hero learns that he can't be something he's not, if he lives a shared life, he's stuck between people and animals, can't be one thing or the other. His boyfriend is not sure or strong enough to receive him, the pack must not let him down and the two are forced to divorce. In the film, he rescues him like Lassie and they travel to Paris (why Paris?), Ending what is ridiculous, but not really happy, because conflicts between their nature - sometimes _her_ natures - remain unresolved. br /> <br /> But the difference in the film that hampers pleasure the most is that although bookmarks behave as usual, within the limits of young adult novels, the filmmakers for some reason are as annoying as possible. Every other row is a threat or another consensus story: you are sorry; you are not here; you are not free from me; I gave you your chance; etc. In this way, I prefer to manage the people who deal with it. <br /> <br /> There have been many good vampire films, never a good werewolf movie. If it had stuck to the book, it could have been the first. <br /> <br /> But no.
