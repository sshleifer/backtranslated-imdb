I agree with another viewer who wrote that this film resembles a fun Melanie Griffith / Jeff Daniels comedy "Something Wild", where a rather eccentric free spirit captures a conservative and very regular young man and two are a couple and basically influenced by his personality gradually . He loses up and learns to try his short life. This is what happens here, except to enter a comfortable shop-robbing eccentric, Alex (Rosanna Arquette) in the role of Melanie Griffith and a super-careful teenager, Lincoln (name is not a coincidence that Devon Gummersall played) Jeff Daniel. This film even shares the same twist and sudden change in genre, where a terrible, violent boy suddenly appears and things go quite badly. Only here, rather than Ray Liotta playing back the ghosts of the 1950s movie, is Peter Greene. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teen boy who is in his little world. He has some charm with his brothers' suicide, and his parents have been interrupted, behaving in a rather strange way (Mom is convinced that Christmas will soon arrive, despite being August). Then at night, when "boys" (one of whom has played Jason Hervey Wonder Years) tries to buy them, he runs Alex, who decides to rob him and his friend (of course with his permission)) and take over the desert of the West Coast for a mini-adventure, robbing Robin Hoodis offers convenient shops and, of course, a routine self-indulgence because everyone is asking more about another life. But Alex has fallen behind his partner in theft trade and he is not going away. Although we are not reminded of him or her, such as repeated rejection or transfer from his point of view, he is consistently reminded. At least so much was done wisely. <br /> <br /> 'Do Me a Favor' (aka Trading Favors) is mostly an underdeveloped story of criminal annoyance and self-extradition that is just below the first half of the movie, but delivers the goods a little late when Alex and Lincoln come home in the middle of nowhere. By the time filmmakers give you enough stimulus, this film is, unfortunately, almost over. I would recommend that if this is the kind of story you feel, and despite the fact that Rosanna Arquette always produces good results (even on a poorly written film), I would still recommend it in its best form, "Something Wild."
