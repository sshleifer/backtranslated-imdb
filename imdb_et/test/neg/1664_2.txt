Linda Arvidson (like Jennie) and Harry Solter (Frankina) enjoy a romantic test of their father Charles Inslee. furious, he drives Mr. Solter out of the house. Unknown, he goes to his balcony and asked him to live. Mrs Arvidson is pleasant and is going to pack. Then George Gebhardt, the abductor, arrives. Although he doesn't get much harvest, Gebhardt's stealing succeeds in using the Arvidson trunk to escape the police? <br /> <br /> Winning comedy. Note that during the balcony scene, the Solter leaves the camera so that the burglar Gebhardt can enter without detecting the house. Arvidson is very light, because there seems to be something in his heavy luggage compartment; maybe he just wanted to clean up the beau solter? Director D.W. Griffith, Robert Harron and Florence Lawrence are great additions. <br /> <br /> ** The Invasive Element (8.8.2008) D.W. Griffith ~ George Gebhardt, Linda Arvidson, Harry Solter
