Racing enthusiast Fabian (like Tommy Callahan) smokes, drinks, and suffers from blackouts, feeling an encouraging brunette with Annette Funicello (like Francie Madsen) and blonde Diane McBain (Annie Blaine). Complicated topics include Mrs Funicello's crazy racing car boy, Warren Berlinger (Eddie Sands) and his father, Jan Murray (Pete Madsen), who encourages careless drivers. Funicello's cow's eyes are sometimes enjoyable; but his drunken scene is irritating. "Thunder Alley" offers somewhat more NASCAR excitement than its predecessor "Fireball 500" (1966) *; warn, it's not much. The low highlight of the movie is a wild party scene with some light band tease.
