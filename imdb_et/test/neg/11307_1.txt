A terrible terrible movie, I still can't believe my friend told me to see it! No plot, bad show, ununny scenes and very very stupid dialogue. All I have to say is that this movie is the worst movie I've seen and it's worse than Halloween III, which I also gave 0 stars. So I give him 0 stars and 0 out of 10, well here 1, but you get a point.
