As someone has already mentioned on this table, it is very difficult to make a forged documentary. It requires tremendous skill, pace, patience, distance of directors, plausible assumption, narrative "flow" and really credible action (aka GREAT acting). <br /> <br /> This does not apply to Love Machine. It starts to show its faux hand about a 20-minute mark (with a 60-minute view) and the viewer understands that he has been taken in. It's downhill. <br /> <br /> Director Gordon Eriksen just got too fast. But in order to be fair to Eriksen, his problems began early on: as he explained in his appendix, he began to make a REAL doc, did not receive financial support and solved a cheaper way to make his film. The prerequisite - people who have a secret life posting on a pornographic website - was probably more interesting between 1997 and 1998, when the film was made. Eriksen does a lot of complicated things - a steadfast master, "handheld cameras, zooms, sharp blacks and whites - everything, I think to create a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn't work. The film is confusing and forced, but it ultimately leads to the credibility of the actors and quite a terrible dialogue.
