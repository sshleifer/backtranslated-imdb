An invoice made for romantic comedy during the early years of the Second World War is not filled. The problem is that, although beautifully photographed, it has no story or narrative. Starting from the mystery of murder, it does not offer hope to its participants because it refers to recent history. Depardieu wastes a trivial role that he apparently is not happy with playing. Adjani can't take a picture. The hero is not; apparently an imitation of Hitchcock's "wrongly accused" role, which has no balance. Not heroic, comic or suspicious. It could have been a good movie. I am reminded of "The Lady Vanishes", which combined tension, romance and comedy in a serious film about fascism.
