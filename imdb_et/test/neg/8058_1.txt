This movie was incredibly bad ... It's crazy, but violence is just too much of a point where it looks very fake and predictable. Since everything has been shown to you, there is nothing left to the imagination. And the plot ... what's the plot? There really isn't one! Stimulation is incredibly slow (despite random acts of violence), and the scenario must be written by a 12-year-old child who kills kittens for fun. So this movie was banned in 31 countries? I saw why ... not because it was clean (boring and tricked), but because it was a terrible movie. It should have existed. Avoid this as a plague. 1 out of 10
