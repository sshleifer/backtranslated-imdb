This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. The three main cast members just didn't feel good. Giovanni Ribis's character was quite annoying. For some reason, he seems to want to repeat what he says. If he were an "umbrella", it would have been good, but he is not. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
