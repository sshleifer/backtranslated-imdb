Daft boilers do not come much more than this, but it is Douglas Sirk's film that does everything well. Except in this case, it is not. The hilarious Lloyd C Douglas novel (written by "The Robe"), which was already filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, is more of a boom than the console bra. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is a lofty playboy who not only takes responsibility for making Jane Wyman a widow, but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight. To change the medicine, he becomes a great eye surgeon and restores it. (No, it's not quite that he was planning to become a doctor before a lofty playboy). Sometimes they're in love. Try it because I can't really find the redeeming social commentary and American men's criticism, which should be just below the surface of Sirk's films (it's not too deep). On the plus side, Rock Hudson is not half-bad, (I think I will discover him again), and of course it looks good (people in Sirk's movies live in cathedrals). Nothing in this film is best suited to his later work, and even in soap opera, it is definitely television in the daytime.
