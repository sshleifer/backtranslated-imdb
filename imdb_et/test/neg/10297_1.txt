It must be the worst thriller I've seen for a long time. Managing, acting, and adjusting the story leaves what would probably have been a good dimension to wasting time. Within a few minutes of watching the film, it was easy to find out the whole plot, and then there are more obvious clues that are no secret. I thought it was in the first few minutes and I was hoping I was wrong and worried that I wasn't. <br /> <br /> The film begins with two FBI agents who travel to a distant city to explore the murdering spree that has left three witnesses, a young girl, a drug addict and a cop. They are interviewed under separate surveillance cameras and everyone talks about their day. Each of them has something to hide about itself and the day is manifested when they talk about their accounts. This part is obviously a sustainable grace and if it had developed it could have made the film better. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: The whole story ends with FBI agents who are real killers and the young girl is the only one who has guessed why they pass the entire witness who interviewed the three witnesses and binds the young girl when their idea was first to kill? How did they get the FBI agents out of pretending (if you discover that the real FBI agents have been killed and their characters are found)? How do they know how to set up and use surveillance cameras? <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond are so convincing from start to finish. Perhaps the idea is to develop your characters for revelation at the end. Come on, they both look ridiculous, stupid and not worse. The nature of young girls is also a waste of potential. His actions have no meaning whatsoever and do not mean to whom he prefers the bond in his trial. He does not seem unhappy, but rather loose, which is not explained again. <br /> <br /> Intelligent movie as a whole.
