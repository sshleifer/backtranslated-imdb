They said it was a movie that was bigger than the Turks. How do they dare <br /> <br />? It's not even 10% of this classic. Bad action. The only sign I knew of sympathy was what Angela Schijf played. His action was the best of the film. The story could have been interesting, but it wasn't. Some scenes were very beautiful movies (lights and camera), (for example, <br /> <br /> opening scene), but bad performance made magic <br /> <br /> lost. <br /> <br /> I really don't understand why so many people voted this movie so <br /> <br /> good.
