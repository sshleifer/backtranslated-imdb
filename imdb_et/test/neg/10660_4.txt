I don't like Himesh Reshamiya. I also don't like his singing. But his songs are madness in India, especially among the ordinary. Now, how could he be an actor? it was a big joke! With the courage he must as much as possible in his main time. I never wanted to see this movie. But one thing changed it. The movie becomes a super-duper hit! In two weeks will Aap Ka Saroor have a 14-crate box cartridge? compared to Apne, who has collected 7 crores for the same 2 weeks. When can I sit through the absurd Sivaj of Apne and Rajnikant? I also have to give this film a try to understand what this film has got, which made it so big a blow? The story is about a real-life singer Himesh Reshamiya (HR) who has gone to Germany for concert and loves Riya (Hansika Motwan). German lawyer Ruby (Mallika Sherawat) loves Himesh. Himesh is now arrested for murder. The mission of Himesh (within the last 40 minutes) after going to prison is to prove himself innocent and find a real murderer. <br /> <br /> Let me say that Himesh has nothing to become a hero. He's trying hard, but he can't fail. He's pathetic. I was wondering what could have made the movie so much clicked? Let me find something positive. <br /> <br /> First of all, a movie-savvy arm is a script to the point of Himesh Prison. (But after the movie nose dives into intolerable fools) Second, the movie's songs are good, memorable, crowd-pulling numbers. Third, Mallika Sherawat? she looks proud and works well as a second lady. I can imagine Mallika fans seeing the movie for him. Fourth, is the film cinematic pleasant? Especially German locals are looking out. Fifth, the main part of the story is the love story between Himeshi and Riya? clich√© dialogues that would probably unite the crowd of young people. Sixthly, Director Prashant Chadha has done decent work to cover Himesh's pathetic skills as much as possible with frames that do not require Himesh much to do. <br /> <br /> Heroine Hansika Motwani looks like a hero of a small budget movie. Raj Babbar is wasted in a small role. In general, the film is below average. <br /> <br /> Did I mean the whole movie? what if the same film scenario was made with Salman as the chief leader. I think it would have been a much better thing. Maybe I would have given the movie 10 out of 10. But now? (Letters 4.5 / 10)
