The strange thing about Galaxina is that it is extremely bad, though it is. The odd thing is that, despite being extremely bad, it's not funny. Extremely bad movies have their own unwanted sense of humor - the secret of their success. But Galaxy is quite unique - it's the worst nightmare of MST3K, a bad movie in which deliberate * and * inadvertent humor falls evenly. <br /> <br /> It's easy to understand why deliberate jokes are a failure - and the reasons are quite different. Sometimes it is a matter of timing; sometimes this is a good idea badly developed (a person's restaurant * may have been fun but it wasn't); sometimes it seemed that there was a mixing in the cutting room where the punchline reached the floor; and sometimes jokes are just bad jokes. Such involuntary sniffers are laughing at the bad films. It's harder to find out why Galaxina can't laugh at this story. Something is flawless with the involuntary humor of this movie, just as something is wrong with (not at all) deliberate humor. This is a very bad film, which is not very poor quality of redemption. This is completely unique in my experience.
