You started looking at it but didn't believe any characters. In particular, the relationship between the baker assistant and the waitress didn't work for me at all. The scenes between the baker's owner and the assistant were nice, but the rest was very slow. It was a very superficial film and it made me feel like I was watching a movie rather than a game. The characters were very "stage-like" and the story was like a director's farce. By the time the pyromanians helped, I was bored and didn't care about what happened and so I turned it off. Glad I didn't see it. He didn't laugh or even smiled. It seems that Americans tend to classify their films as "comedy" when they are funny, not funny ha ha. I have finally learned to avoid what Americans call dark comedies, which usually turn out to be terrible and strange. Now it seems that I have to be a little more discerning when they call the romantic comedy of the movie. Perhaps the comedy means something different than it is used in film rather than America. I don't understand why America can produce amazingly funny comedies, like two and a half men, Will and Grace, King of Queens, but they probably can't produce funny movies without using toilet humor. This movie was not tough and nothing. But it wasn't just one big awake ...
