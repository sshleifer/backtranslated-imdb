It's the time I've ever experienced. not even the first. At best, it was difficult to follow the story - the plot was weak. The whole thing looked like three stories trying to put them together and make a movie. This and there were a few good lines - and trying the message was admirable, but they went from Houston to New York to Dallas. It was really hard to tell what time the current time was taking. The film was just over an hour and we seemed to be watching the movie all afternoon. Think of the points to be honest - but the son shouldn't do everything Kronk felt he had to do. Do it yourself - Kuzco again.
