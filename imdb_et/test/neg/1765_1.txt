That movie was so bad, I thought I'd be yelling in the middle of it. It was all I can do to sit through it. The beginning of the film, where they are in war, was promising. Only that created me "Saving Private Ryan" ... or at least tried it. Only we don't care about these people. Characters are not built. I think the child who dies should cry ... but for some reason it all irritated. Then we have to listen to the line after the happy dialogue that desperately tried to imitate "Wuthering Heights", which of course was also quoted in the film. Get your finger off. There was nothing original about the film; it was like sitting every day in a war movie, where a little humor was thrown to keep you in the hope that it would get better. Unfortunately, not. 3 hours later I leave the theaters cheated. Anthony Menghilla should be defeated to try to duplicate an English patient, which was a good film for this time, but now I don't know ... should I rent it and make sure I'm not just stuck in HYPE? Maybe I was, but certainly not the hypothesis of this movie. I really went to the theater who wanted to like this movie. I'm a deadly fan of Nicole Kidman. Save your money, rent it on a DVD and laugh through it as I did.
