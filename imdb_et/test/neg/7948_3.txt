Attack Precinct 13: 3/10: Let's forget for a moment that the 13th attack is an attack on the classic film. A wholly own-initiative attack is an attack. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the Rio Bravo-style scenario. About a dozen people have been detained at the Detroit's disintegrating police station (if Detroit's location gives you the Robocop's hot and fuzz stop. It could have been easy to say Topekat in open credits and nothing would have changed. In the woods it would have been better.) corrupt policemen. <br /> <br /> Now I know what your thinking is. Corrupted policemen? Were the Nazis and drug cartels busy this weekend? Of course, these are not ordinary cops. These guys are right on the cover of Tom Clancy's latest video games. Yes, we have body protection; helicopters; lasers; night vision protects works. So we have thirty S.W.A.T. Members / Special forces who are armed in the teeth of 4 cops (drunk in mind that this is a new year before), 2 girls in a party dress and half a dozen criminals. So how do our heroes defend themselves? The truth is they can't. They should all be dead within ten minutes. (Not to mention the characters in the interior, it's a tedious habit to walk through the windows.) Now it's not an illogical scenario to make the movie complete. B-style action film. But apart from Laurence Fishburne and Ethan Hawke, all the other characters seemed to be a comic. (At least I hope they were) <br /> <br /> The Ja-Rules and Leguizamo characters are bad enough. This is Aisha Hindi Minstrel Exhibition that takes the cake. Rarely is a more stereotypical African American appearing on today's screen. His performance is similar to a boy on a black surface and dragging a acting ghetto. <br /> <br /> In the original Assault, a gang member carries a Ice Cream truck and travels around the neighborhood where the girls with the head are photographed. Since then I have been an irrational fear of ice cream trucks. After this attack, I have a completely rational fear of remake.
