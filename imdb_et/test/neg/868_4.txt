The flat B-horror, which takes its material seriously into consideration, concerns an aging, expensive old man who has changed from the tenant to the space night, who has come to rent him. If the tenant dies, the mother must go to herself and cause some family tension and give some attention to the authorities. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is that this movie should have brought FUNNY. It couldn't do that, although it had some gore and schlocky creature makeup effects to make the B-film crowd happy. I've seen worse, but I don't give it a - 4.5 / 10.
