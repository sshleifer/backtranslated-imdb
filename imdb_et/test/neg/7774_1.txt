I don't know if I should be pleasant or insulted, like "Lifetime: Television For Women", which should be called "Lifetime: Television For Shut in Drama Queens" because I haven't seen a movie that wasn't a teardrop kettle. This movie was no exception. You know that film is bad when the biggest headquarters is Tori Spell, totally creating bad plastic surgery and corrupt privilege minus any actual talent. Everyone else was incredibly bad with her behavior and the story was in the dark, as if someone believed it. If I hadn't been helpless on the couch, looking at the same sight, I could see a nice car wreck that I would have changed the channel.
