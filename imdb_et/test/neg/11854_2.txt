I am a big Eric Roberts fan, I collect my films and so far I have reached 60. But I am honest to say that sometimes he makes terrible movies. But hey, why do I like it - it's fun. <br /> <br /> But it has to take the price, I can't wonder why. Somehow they got Eric and Corbin Bernsen in the picture. <br /> <br /> While Bernsen is just terrible (I don't like him), Roberts manages to be the best thing in the movie (and doesn't mean much). He practically does it on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> The female driver (Brasselle) looks like a plastic doll and works like one. And Tim Abell and his team look like man-plastic dolls and act like them. <br /> <br /> The plot is really embarrassing. I haven't seen any of the Carnosaur movies so I can't remember the stuff that came with it, but that explains some things. But the plots are still large under the plot. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALERT <br /> <br /> The first attacks are outside the laboratory in a nearby forest. In the end, they blow the whole laboratory into pieces and just relax that everything is over, but they forgot what's outside ?????? he didn't notice a T-rex that climbs into the chopper ???? <br /> <br /> The combination of orange boys is my favorite - what do they do for jogging or what ?? /> <br /> Of course, there is also a B-movie standard sex scene that is also associated with silicon characters. This time it is Lorissa McComas who welcomes us. I have no problem with it (he looks awful) but looks at a man who squeezes his tits and is at the verge of 8 !! minutes are just long. <br /> <br /> Shame on you all (including Eric Roberts) - Now I look forward to watching Con Games (wonder ???)
