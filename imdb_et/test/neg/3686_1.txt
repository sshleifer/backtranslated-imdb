Last month I wore this movie at Sitges Festival. If the film could be "filmed" to avoid the existence of a movie, it should be the first in the list. María Lidón is not a director, she is just a stupid woman pretending that holding a camera and shouting "action" makes her a professional filmmaker. What's wrong! The film itself is meaningless and a complete waste of good actors that could do something better in another project. Val Kilmer does nothing but puts his face in front of the camera. His character has no special weight in the film. The same can be said about Joss Ackland, Vincent Gallo or Joaquim De Almeida. The character of Rade Serbedzija is disgraceful. WARNING SPOILERS <br /> <br /> He spends most of his time alone in tunnels that talk to himself (now I'm doing this, now I'm bats, I'm looking for my bag, now I'm turning left, now we turn right ...), to clearly bring your audience into action. It is simply pointless and proves the absence of a director's talent. END OF THE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The usual joke about this trash can be that the title of the movie brought everyone to an evaluation: ZERO
