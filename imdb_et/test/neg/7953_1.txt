Maybe you have to be a former hippie to fully understand it, because in addition to some dated fashion, music and dialogue, it has nothing today. <br /> <br /> Four fun loving colleges, art students enjoy reckless daytime models and motorcycle rides. They take the acid into one scene and go to the zoo. The screen flashes a sign that says, "Don't feed the animals" and suddenly they laugh and hang the chain tire swing (?!) The evil artist (Larry Swanson) says (in rebounds) how his artistic career was almost violated due to hand sickness. He sends out zombie men dressed in black to rob people, then injecting them with a serum that distorts their face. He tries to create some new form of abstract act (I think that the details are a bit tiny, to say the least). Meanwhile, Jason (Ross Harris) tries to save the day after his friend Scotty (Chris Martell) is killed and his girlfriend Janet (Eugenie Wingate) is kidnapped. I thought the ZOMBIE LAKE zombie make-up was awful, but wait until you see it here! This is done by Douglas Hobart, who is the star of the TARTU DOG. A small role is played by Brad Grinter, Z-classic BLOOD FREAK, who is much more enjoyable than this deadly dull turkey (aka NIGHTMARE HOUSE). <br /> <br /> Unusable trivia note: 1984 The BRIDES WORE BLOOD, which is printed directly on the video label, is wrong! <br /> <br /> Score: 1/10
