Voor een verloren soldat is a sad example for a lost soldier how not to translate, to film a complex psychological study of the most magical time in a person's life when he is still a child but becomes a man. The novel records the real life experiences of Rudy van Dantzig, as said boy Jeroen, during World War II, when he is engaged in his original sexuality, and his deep fears of abandonment when he is sent to the province by Friesland, the northern parents of the Netherlands due to dietary choices in Amsterdam and is not they have been heard for months because postal services have broken down. The arrival of liberating soldiers in the film is a painfully shining way in which soldiers offer an entertaining vaudeville style. Then one soldier, Walt, Romance Jeroen and a couple of two frolicking men will be presented. This is a step by Jeroen in step 11. The reality was somewhat different: Jeroen describes his meetings with Walt, 6 in all, in detail, but in oblique language. But their nature is incomprehensible. Walt has created an intense passion for Jeroen, in which he begins to deal with him harshly, so that Jeroen has an impression and a painful wound on his shoulder, where Walt bites him. During this meeting, Walt will rape Jeroen twice. Jeroen could have easily avoided Walt after the second meeting, when Walt attacked him for the first time because Walt apparently wants to keep his soldiers from being abused. Why Jeroen looks for Walt is the mystery of the human heart and not so much explained. What the film omits is a wake-up call: nightmares, fraud, an insane search across Amsterdam for a chance to find Walt, because Jeroen loved Walt and nothing could shake it.
