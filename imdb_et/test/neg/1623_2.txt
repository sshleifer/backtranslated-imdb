One of the redeemable qualities of this movie (apart from Ator's hardly lazy) is the bad guy, Zor, having fun. This wonderfully played cable is sure ... oh, Shakespeare's presence that made this movie acceptable (hence 2). I worshiped every time he piroued, lifting an incredible eyebrow or hero eye. A real example of someone not getting enough pay. (And that is BEARD!) <br /> <br /> Now, what was the 12-minute hangout? Really, really bad. I can't emphasize that point enough. <br /> <br /> So, if you even see this movie, see Mystery Science Theater 3000. Many expensive films are tolerated with these expensive silhouettes.
