Am I the only one who thinks it's a bad movie? <br /> <br /> I admit that horror films often do not have things like a big story or good deeds or even good special effects. But how these shortcomings come together in this film is surprisingly pathetic. <br /> <br /> An insecure story: the idea of ​​a raped vagina, which tells revenge, making a man eater, sounds pretty funny, but what the writer wrote about it is stupid. <br /> <br /> Poor action: Actors move like puppets. They play and look like people who are really trying hard, but they can't. <br /> <br /> Bad FX: Especially the Van explosion is inexpensively cheap. <br /> <br /> It is surprising that a director who made some nice movies during his carrier goes over such a mess.
