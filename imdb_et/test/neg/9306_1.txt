I have the pain of saying this about an Australian movie, but Mr Accident is among the worst of the worst films. Even more tragic is that it does not fit into the category "it's so bad it's good". What most disturbs me in this film is a relatively large amount of money, which is pointless, pointless, underdeveloped, intuitive. Dark performances (What are Garry McDonald and Elisabeth Gore or Elle McFeast in this trash?), Inadequate direction, lack of plot and general mindset that take interesting product development and leave your truly terrible taste in your mouth. Comedy! Ha! Do it yourself and stay away!
