I just saw this movie and all I can say is where these days are going. It would seem to have been a great 2nd feature while driving in 1977 (maybe one of Joan Collins's movies is playing), but it's worth it now only if you feel nostalgia for the 70s. Silly plot that is full of holes, but it resembles one era it was made. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is quite attractive, though not many actors. In fact, there is not much action in this film. It's a kind of Hazzard adventure pins without a double or 1969 Dodge charger that jumped over things in the forest. But there is a Mecrury Comet who jumps into this dump!
