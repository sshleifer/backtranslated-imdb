This movie will be thrown away. No money, no action, nothing. I got it this afternoon at the thirtieth late show and I felt compelled to comment. There is nothing to recommend in this movie. I can't believe it's ever published on US television! No one in this movie can get out of a paper bag. Flat attempts in comedy fall on their face, special effects consist of a worm-like cartoon "monster" ... I can't even start to say how that production is. It looks like it could take $ 50,000, but just because it's 16mm and it's probably a generous estimate! Anyway, I quickly lost interest and had to settle instead of watching Matlock. This is how BAD this movie !!!
