I'm not one of those people who put on a movie based on old TV shows every time. Rather, I usually run out and see it (if I had watched the show) and tried to get nostalgic. But if somebody knows the decline of movies based on old exhibitions, this is an exhibition A (so you can actually say more than just "McHale's Navy"). "Mod Squad" is tough, tiring and sleepy. At least the original series was dirty before anyone knew that teenagers could be so ugly, making it a groundbreaking one. It's just annoying. Claire Danes is nice to look at, but does nothing more than mood swing and spying on the bad guys. Giovanni Ribis's scope of action on this flick is that Droopy the Dog is looking for an hour and forty-five minutes. And Omar Epps looks like he wants to escape from the kit, but the script's clostography has captured him. Of course, production is great, now a seemingly mandatory "rave" nightclub opening sequence and shootouts. Oh, and the kids scream and angry at each other and their superiors. It's sort of like deciding to use Scooby Doo Mystery Machine to go to your adolescents who know you and your husband need serious treatment and prescription drugs. I really wanted to like this movie and there were promising moments, but the next scene sucks it out. You can tap another spell, "Charlie's Angels," all you want, but at least this movie knew he wanted to have fun with himself. "Mod Squad" makes you think about where the original series inspired you.
