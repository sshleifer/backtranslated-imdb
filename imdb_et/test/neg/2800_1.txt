Few videos of recent history have been produced as amateurly as it is - at least none released by such a reputable distributor. Every frame in this film is plaguerism of the better films of the past. The word "clich√©" is given by a new thought talented writer / director who should reserve his imagination for smaller masturbation efforts that do not endanger the viewers of the film. There is far less amateurs to help "horror" than capable technicians who contribute to bad cinematography and ridiculous makeup and special effects. Unfortunately, there are one or two film amateurs who show off the talents that go unnoticed thanks to this cruelty.
