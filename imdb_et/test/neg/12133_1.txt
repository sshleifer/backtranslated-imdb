Heh ... I'm surprised that this movie is still there, not to mention that it can be rented! <br /> <br /> This flick is one of the many bad slips that exist only for R&D and cheap laughs. The story goes beyond the "Texas Chainsaw massacre", which has a "Psycho" -like mama-centered back attack and a bit of old-fashioned female chains, with a tough-nail-ex-con wide. for good action - in other words, full unoriginality, packed in half for naked women with spiced perfect idiot! Looking at how the director tries to bypass the country of Quebec when the South American bayou country is sad, I tell you! <br /> <br /> The funny thing for me is that I was actually in the premiere of this flick because I was with Ratchford, the movie star. It was painful to see Jeremy sitting on his seat while the flick opened his mangle wings. <br /> <br /> I'm happy that Ratchford, after being the first flick, has grown into one hell actress. He can see a regular Canadian police drama "Blue Murder", has appeared "CSI", not to mention his role in the classic Clint Eastwood movie "Unforgiven" - we andestame ya, Jeremy! It was a rocky start, but you did good, man! <br /> <br /> ~ T. Paul
