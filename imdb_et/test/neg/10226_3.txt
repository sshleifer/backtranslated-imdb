More than just a Mighty Ducks football kick, this movie was tedious in most aspects. It was one of those times when you are parents asking you to take your younger siblings just so they don't have to deal with them for a few hours. At least, my younger sisters liked it, but it turned out to be too much better than the mighty ducks. Okay, at least Olivia d'Abo was hot and Steve Guttenberg was still a job at that moment.
