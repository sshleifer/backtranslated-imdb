This movie is one big stereotype. Functioning (except Philbin & Harrison) is a terrible and terrible script that makes things worse. I have to agree with another review that "local" characters sound ridiculously, so also "Caucasian" characters. 3 stars from 10 to 1 1) Philbin 2) Harrison 3) Surf the scenes. (1/2 * out ****) See "Aloha Summer" (**) and / or "Beyond Paradise" (***) correctly for Hawaii, especially BP, which I find it fun and brilliant.
