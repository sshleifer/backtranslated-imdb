I'm a big fan of Shirley Temple. When I saw this movie, it helped me understand what a gifted child Shirley really was. Ashley Rose Orr probably made the worst screen of Shirley. Imagine playing 11-year-old Shirley temple from the age of 5 onwards. This in itself is wrong. But when I got him "mimick" to Shirley's voice? And his song is terrible. Dancing was good, I say it. As previous users have said, there were few dramatic scenes, something that would make the story interesting. Not even Amelia Earhart ... I would have liked to see more of the world phenomenon that Shirley Temple has created. Oz's wizard was paid too much attention, in reality, for Shirley Dorothy. The film depicts that it would be the end of the world if it doesn't get that role. Shirley himself said he was pleased that Judy Garland started playing. For me, the star of the exhibition was a lady playing at the Gertrude Temple. Otherwise, stay away! For the great Shirley temple movies, see Heidi, Poor Little Rich Girl and Little Miss Broadway.
