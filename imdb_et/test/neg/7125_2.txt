I'm a big fan of the first four June projects. I own them and look at them every few months. I lend them to fellow workers and friends to get the fear of making high quality Japanese films. I think Takashi Shimizu created an excellent story and presented it in very four installments. <br /> <br /> I was somewhat happy about opening The Grudge 2 in theaters. I saw the first American Grudge before viewing the four originals. Grudge was actually pretty good. Of course, the originals are better, but I got good Halloween intimidation from the 2004 American Grudge. <br /> <br /> Grudge 2 started badly and went down. I was waiting for it to improve to understand, show Shimizu talents - nothing like that. What's great about Shimizu Ju's work is the story. True, it is usually spoken of in a divergent style that you need to think about combining its components, but it is still a great story. There was no story from The Grudge 2. It was a number of free events that could never be taken care of. <br /> <br /> Editing was cruel. Separated (as in Japanese originals) is one thing, but the total randomness of the scene sequence was exhaustive. I just thought, "It's so stupid," and "No - he didn't want to sell that much?" It made me want to walk out of the theater, go home and look at the original work, just to convince myself that Shimizu hasn't always done this embarrassment, general, boring, non-sensual, thrown away. /> <br /> If you really have a heart to see this movie, I suggest you wait 2 months for it to rent. Really. Five people in the theater walked with me for about 45 minutes. I discussed whether to do it. Home and house cleaning seemed a better way to spend time at this point. <br /> <br /> I'm really shocked at how bad this movie was. Praying Sam Raimi doesn't make any more money to make The Grudge 3. It's not just worth it. Sigh.
