This film was disappointing. 15 years after he had recalled the review of information about Mariel Hemingway, all the regrets that were sensitive to the film had come back. Although I remember Peter O'Toole, I was not fully aware of the fact that the female "leader" (okay, she was a little more than the subject of the conversation) was Hemingway. I saw this movie back in the days when I wrote the film reviews, and warned people about it, because the stories just didn't work and fifteen years of my subconscious trying to sort things out have still not thought. Some of this may be related to the fact that it seemed like the original film (whatever it was) was filmed, the editor came in and tried to put something together. I don't know if it was a previous studio master's project, and it was sabotaged that his successor discredited him, or it was a disaster from the original scenario that rescue attempts were unsuccessful. The theater version just doesn't work.
