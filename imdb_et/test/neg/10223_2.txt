Walt was of a particularly good quality. So, how do Disney manufacturers come to this horribly edited, harsh action (even for family holidays!) Confused? GREAT GREEN was a good concept. And because it is Disney, you know how this movie probably appears. But the big green is terrible. Jokes are flat. And Steve Guttenburg, alive, pulls back into his terrible frightening performance. <br /> <br /> A child who has too little time in the small town of Elmas is offered his new teacher a chance to play football. Children don't know anything. And grateful to us, we see that Steve Guttenburg tries to defeat the teacher from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Speeding up the camera does not work. GREAT GREEN is full of character speeds to move the movie. Children are not idiots. They catch up when you give them enough clues without showing all this garbage. Guttenburg should have once in his life offered to bid for this movie. The beautiful Olivia d'Abo should also have called it. GREAT GREEN can be known as a "big bomb."
