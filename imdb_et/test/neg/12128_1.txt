Maybe I was young when I saw it. Maybe I haven't grown up with Grease and Elvis. <br /> <br /> I couldn't get it. I get "black" comedy (Black Adder, etc.). I get irony and spoofe. I can't, however. <br /> <br /> I made this effort to find the name of this movie (including the help of the Usenet and the most excellent IMDb bulletin boards) so it could be my first 1-pointer. Awful!
