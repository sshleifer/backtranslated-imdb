Well Wright could have been depicting a lifetime image of about the 1800s - as he continues to do so repeatedly, because when it was written, not published - but it's not Austen and he should not claim to be adaptation. br /> <br /> Mrs Bennett looks like a rural washer. It's a pampered woman - they have servants (remember the book scene where the maid dresses her hair, etc.)? But Wright depicts her with rough red skin on her chest, harsh hands and working in the kitchen. And the pigs are going through! If he wants a bucolic, he should try Tess. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bennett - The script makes it too light and modern and ignores its weakness. The scene in which he stops playing Mary should force you - not go in seconds. If not, don't add it. <br /> <br /> MacFadyen is very weak in this respect and seems to be doing Pride with numbers. The first suggestion he looks like a nervous schoolboy, not a man who prides himself over to make a proposal under his station. Most of his lines, he could also read the shopping list. <br /> <br /> Lydia is terrible. Completely up, moving and skipping. Indeed, Knightley plays Elizabeth more than the sliding character Lydia actually in the book, sometimes. <br /> <br /> And Elizabeth. Half of the time Knightley is clearly saying Ehle's voice and intonation - close your eyes to see what this copy is. And in his role you see Wright's bigger mistake - there is no PREJUDICE. <br /> <br /> From the first meeting with Darcy he clearly shows. When he comments to Bingley that he has attracted women in the hall, he seems to be initially hurt - not shocked and guilty. The latter should make things prejudiced. And when he and "caroline" dance around the room, he'll have to tease, probably around him. And when Wickham is almost cut off, you can't invest enough in Elizabeth to create the harmful aspects of such relationships. And apparently, Caroline is not Miss Bingley. And Bingley happily travels to Jane's bedroom. And - Wright can boast about how big he is with the time he wants. However, some of the panoramic photos of rural areas (showing Hardy's preference) do not relieve him of outstanding mistakes all over the place. <br /> <br /> An operator who wants to make a clear award would have had to hold him. He created the whole movie between Bronte and Hardy, and it wasn't the last proposal / lighting made by Tess? The need to see Darcy's walk along the "record" was just stupid. But most importantly, the most important thing - the Austen - is forgotten when these two very different landscapes are left. (She would laugh loudly at Elizabeth = sad, so = rain, running through picturesque madness, wet Darcy garbage). <br /> <br /> I admit that watching a movie is an impossible book as a context. I was ready to give her some room for maneuver because she had to give the story in a short time. However, in order to completely forget half-hearted bias and Darcy constantly looking more constipated than proudly, it made it almost unnoticeable. I only saw it as a confusion, which is generally bad performances (when Knightley didn't start to blame Ehle, he was worshiping or missed, or both, and just calmed down a few times to show that he had any promise - but misleads the language giving emotion does not replace bad script and poor direction) - although some were just a bad script case. <br /> <br /> Tom Holland alone gets unreliable. Although he underlined the Collins comic, he turned to a very interesting approach. Dench is doing great schtick what he can do during his sleep, be it here or Oscar Wildes - but it was supposed to be Lady Catherine De Bourgh NOT Lady Bracknell. He was just a little too reasonable. <br /> <br /> Would the shortened length be acted by a competent screenwriter? Not characters that fill gaps and contribute to the entire audience. Elizabeth couldn't bear a Â£ 10k figure. And while they wanted time to learn Darcy's participation in Wickhams married, they didn't fit with Lydia. It was the worst exposed exposition at work. <br /> <br /> It's really terrible. Anyone who appreciates this in the context of the book is someone who, frankly, does not believe it has read or understood the testimonials of the matter. Wright seems to think that his characters have been behaving in the 1990s not in the 1709s. I'm not sure he's read the book - he certainly doesn't understand it. He does not understand Austen's acute shortcomings or touch-senses - he certainly made a dull movie. <br /> <br /> What's worse, the devil's bad pathetic need for lovers. I love you, I love you all over the place so they can throw and go down. The fact that Austen has no place to work is clearly irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Anyone looking at it as a movie alone? Well, it is harder for me, except when I notice bad behavior, weak Darcy and all-embarrassing irritation. If you intend to adapt, you can change a lot - but if it loses the spirit and the main motivations, don't offend the book with its title.
