... and it says something. No matter how bad the film is, I am usually able to sit through it so I can evaluate the whole movie. Through this I did it in about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was a DVD, or maybe it was my laptop, but I couldn't hear this dialog even when the volume turned up completely. The sound effects were good, so when the volume was blown up to listen to the dialogue, I blew my headphones over. As much as I wanted to look at this thing, I was not going to sacrifice to hear it. <br /> <br /> Of the little I could talk about this plot, this was one of the main setbacks of the main character's daughter. It seems that the mother, the soldier, had to flee his ship because one person on his ship showed it to be one enemy, and now he continues on the desert. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about the film was the appearance of the main character; there was something I liked because of my hairstyle. <br /> <br /> Well, it looks like it's going to trash ...
