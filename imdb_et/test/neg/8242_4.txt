I've always loved Carry There are movies that have a double-worded sexual enthusiasm and moments of comedy, but I understand why critics give these two letters. Basically, many British people collect a bus to go to Spain for an island called Elsbels at the Palace Hotel. What they didn't know was that it wasn't fully built, plus they had to share the bathrooms with their neighbors, they had a run-down run and many other complications and complaints by owner Pepe (Peter Butterworth, putting a fairly amusing accent like peace that sounds like bad P word). Starring Sid James like Vic Flange, Kenneth Williams Stuart Farquharina, Charles Hawtrey as Eustace Tuttle, Joan Sims as Cora Flange, Barbara Windsor Sadie Tomkins, Kenneth Connor Stanley Blunt, probably nonsense (I personally can't remember who she is as Jimmy Logan as Bert Conway , June Whitfield as Evelyn Blunt, Hattie Jacques on Floella (a ridiculous action that is not as memorable as her usual Matron), Bernard Bresslaw as Brother Bernard, Sally Geeson as Lily, Carol Hawkins as Marge, Jack Douglas as Harry and Patsy Rowlands Miss Dobbs, I admit it's not big, but there's enough dialogue and of course Babs in the shower, and goes to her thumb with this iconic whistle and later with a quick bra.
