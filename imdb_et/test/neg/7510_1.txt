I work in a video store that rents this video to Lexington and I have to say ... it should never have been done. I even know some people who worked on it, who regret it. Bad impact, especially terrible, bad script. I swear that the original PSX Resident Evil wouldn't have gone through the dialogue; it's so bad. If you want to know how not to film, watch this movie to learn something or two. If not, don't waste your time. And even the director knows that it sucks because he continues to try to speed us up. No, sir. I looked at two-thirds of the horror and it is even lower than the 9th Space Plan. Even Ed Eood would have said, "No. It's too stupid for me."
