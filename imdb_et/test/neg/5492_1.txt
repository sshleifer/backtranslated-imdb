I don't mind the strange artistic film. But if they are wretched with symbolism and blind dialogue, and if it is obvious that this is the filmmaker's ego as a viewer, then I get irritated. I'm not a stupid person, but I just didn't understand what this movie was trying to say. Or tea. Film is a great form of human communication. Why do some filmmakers use it to confuse?
