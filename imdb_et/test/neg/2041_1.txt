WOW! What a terrible and outrageous waste of time this celluloid cruelty turned out to be. I remember it years ago and thought it was fun, but now ... it's just stupid. Not to mention that it is "Exorcist" blatantly breaking up to the point where it was reopened at one point under the heading "Sex-orchestra". The only real difference is that the producer has a gall to further discredit themselves by claiming that the film's events are REAL! Who's right to believe that such a bold face is? To make things even worse, there was a video release that obviously tried to cash out the "Rocky Horror Picture Show". How low could one sink? Don't be fooled by false statements, blatant lies, or headlines, because you're disappointed with SORELY when you do!
