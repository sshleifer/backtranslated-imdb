I've noticed that many movies in the "Mystery Science Theater" have received low ratings from IMDb. However, some films in the films were not so bad and it is not fair to evaluate a film that has received "MST" treatment - with the hosts who made funny comments during the film. Now, I'm not saying "girl lover in lane" is a great movie, but it's not nearly bad enough to deserve your current IMDb score of 2.1. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a meeting between Bix and Danny. Bix is ​​a younger boy, Danny and a younger man who has no special reason to travel in the country. When they blow into small towns, Bix needs to be rescued again and again, because Danny is quite naive - a nice way to say he has a tomato intellect. <br /> <br /> Sometimes something happens. confident Bix - she finds a nice young lady and finds she wants to pull her. And in an odd base plan, Jack Elam plays super-horrible illnesses who travel around the city, scaring out all the nonsense, but strange that the police don't seem to pay much attention or do anything about their activities. Ultimately, when Elam moves to Bix's falling girl, things start to boil completely. <br /> <br /> Overall, although not at all a big movie, there were many interesting plot elements in this movie - enough to earn more than 2.1. The biggest negative ones are the simple conclusions of the mystery that finally occur, as well as Danny's once stupidity. Given a small budget, this is a small film that is being viewed.
