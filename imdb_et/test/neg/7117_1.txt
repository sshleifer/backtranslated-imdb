Not at all well done, the whole movie was just Grudge who went around and killed random people somewhere. Random people with no story are killed, like three schoolgirls. <br /> <br /> At first, the family has no story, I believe they are a random family that never went into the house and never had anything to do with Grudge's killing. <br /> <br /> I wasn't impressed at all, I wasn't scared, I didn't jump in any part, and the whole movie was just a random piece to get more money. Gridge 1 looks like a crap that was actually the right movie. <br /> <br /> I believe Grudge 2 is like a leading film for Grudge 3 when they ever do it. They shouldn't have called it Grudge 2, they should call it the Grudge 2 Prologue and you see if you watched it because I wasn't breaking anything. Not that it would be important anyway. <br /> <br /> 1/10, not a scary, bad story and it's just totally random.
