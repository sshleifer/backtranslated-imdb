The theme was good, the direction was OK. Mohanal was effective as his ambassador. The acting actors were at best amateurish. The Chief Executive and the Director should be responsible for this crisis. Hawaldar Jai was terrible, he looked like a painful thumb with his bad histrionics. He didn't see that part or move like a soldier. There was a scene where the fighters were required to confuse satellite feed and they showed it from the corner of the camera. The cable is located in the sky hundreds of miles away, so the only corner is from above. It was a rather embarrassing moment. The target group has matured during these days and they feel when they try to pull the wool over their eyes. The director is great, so the story could be his personal experience. There is no problem, but the film is only as good as its participants and director. So when Major Treatment goes to other projects, she should pay more attention.
