What can I say? It was the worst film I've ever seen in my life (and believe me, some of my favorite movies are terrible). The actors were amateur, the sets were boring and the camera work was dirty and sophomore. This whole movie seemed like a college final project. I had to convince myself that the teenager did it to be a little good. The most disturbing factor in the movie is that it's not even a movie at all - it's a video clip. It was very disturbing. In addition, the dialogue is simply catastrophic and the plot line is so fundamental that it turns my eyes into water. Not to mention they steal at least four other horror films in the first 20 minutes. If such things were null stars, this movie would be sent. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this movie is how bad it is.
