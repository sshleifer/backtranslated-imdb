If Halloween 5 was a cruel joke for a series of fans, then Halloween 6 is similar to an offensive insult. The story has gone to dogs all. Michael is used in this film as helpless and is not at all scary. He reminds me of an overweight alcoholic man like boogeyman, who in our heart was hit by fear. There are almost no redeemable features about this feature, and I'm so glad that H20 came out because the insult to the fans would be fresh for us. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 had about 2 aspects I liked. The adult Tommy Doyle movie had a pleasant touch and it connected it to the original. Donald Pleasance is here (at his last stage ... which is a bad film to finish otherwise a nice career). When she's on the screen, she reminds me of good old days when Halloween was actually scary. <br /> <br /> It's my friends. The stem lines are original. One of them was blatantly chasing after Laurie / Michael. Other characters are terribly underestimated and just not like it. In this movie, music is tortured, Halloween highlighted even when the film is bad. we get stalk / chase theme silly rock version. What they thought about making this movie. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Their biggest mistake was to kill Jamie's character (which is now being played by another actor who is not worth mentioning). in the movie. We rooted her and when she was killed in this movie, you can't help but you know her and feel that the filmmakers don't care about the good characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILER * The less you talk about this embarrassment, the better. I wish it didn't exist. I recommend skipping this movie and even 5 and just go straight to the H20 because if you watch it, you may not see another Halloween movie.
