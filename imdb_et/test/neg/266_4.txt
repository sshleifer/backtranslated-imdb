I liked the oceans 11, I thought it was quite enjoyable by the productions and direction. But I was disappointed with this movie. Don't do it wrong, it's not a complete dude, thanks to Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Matt Damon for their perfect performances and Steven Soderberg's effective direction. However, the film suffers from a really lethargy temple, some of the film was so slow that I fell asleep between almost one sleeping curve. Second, the plot is very complicated and there are many turns that make it difficult to keep up. The camera's work was not as innovative as the first movie. If it was smooth and professional in the first film, it was cumbersome and uncomfortable and the music was not very memorable. The scenario was neither funny nor fun, and the film felt climate change. At the end of the day, it seemed just too lazy, despite playing and managing the experts. With so much potential but really a missed opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox
