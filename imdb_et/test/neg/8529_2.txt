My Take: Another flat PG-13 horror movie with predictable intimidation tactics and a derivative plot. <br /> <br /> The spirits are moving. The walls break. There is something wrong in the basement. These, along with the clichés of several other horror films, haunt the walls of another country house in The MESSENGERS produced by Sam Raimi, one of the tiny tactics of more predictable intimidation that was thrown out of the better (and sometimes worse: past horror films. When Solomon's family moves to the old South Dakota farm, Father (Dylan McDermott), with another attempt to reunite with his family, especially their own drunk - daughter Jessica (undervalued by Kristen Stewart), in a finer country than their home in Chicago, fear when Jessica starts to surprise little of the poltergeists in the house. The girls who shouted the wolf do not believe in her parents How could they? ”The real horror of the observers is what horror film he is following, is it an angry crowd who wants more than family crops (direct destruction of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece THE BIRDS)? Is it a haunting house whose history goes back to AMITYVILLE HORROR or POLTE Or is it a grotesque phantom taken from your recent horrors like RING and GRUDGE? Heck, the movie can even hang a scene or two really bad horror movies like AMITYVILLE 3-D and mediocre COLD CREEK MANOR. Maybe all Pang brothers wanted to make a B-level horror movie, but was it so bad? Could they not hang out of the best? Avoid this. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 5h
