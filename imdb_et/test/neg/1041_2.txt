I mistakenly thought that it was a 70's art bed from a bed that eats people that sounded interesting. This is not. Interestingly, I mean, not to mention a man's eating bed. <br /> <br /> I assume that Stuart Gordon put that name in the same spirit as Lloyd Kaufman puts Troma on almost everything that was done to build a video camera, the franchise library. There is little more to say about this opus than the driving time is less than 90 minutes. Of course, this is a bed that is haunted by a human spirit or something that once killed a woman with wig and long false eyelashes. Away along the road ** five-minute credit sequence (that's even the same for Lawrence Of Arabia?) ** contacts with the murderer Marylin Manson killing the same technique as "Cat's Eye" troll ** Sex Demonstrations Michael Hutchence can work * * preview of what Emilio Estevez will soon see and behave like ** soft core porn even Cinemax would deliver ** manbutt and one topless scene ** crazy (or is it "whack" -ee?) ending in an unintentionally hammering hit and remaining strawberry pie (well, it saw me) ** and a rudimentary surprise that ended with apros pos. It's like a scriptwriter who even fell asleep in "Deathbed" before finalizing the last draft. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not sexy, it's made a hi-def video and it doesn't look bad, but doesn't look bad T also looks good, acting is just good enough to be too good bad to be fun and so is everything else. No one would have even seen it or heard it if it wasn't on another disc, with a modern "double function". I did not pay attention to its parts, so I can leave something out. But for some reason I doubt. Rating: PASS
