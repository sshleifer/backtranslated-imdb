I felt that the two hours I was watching this movie could have been better served by going to a local used bookstore and looking for old fashion magazines and Halston ads. Or maybe looking at the color when drying. These two working relationships would at least have thought more than "Indian Song". The most disappointing part of this was that I saw what moods / atmosphere were trying to create and their concept could have been interesting if they were more developed. Instead of what happened, the inconsistent and foolish chain was presented, where the same scenes were played more and more to win some point in our minds. <br /> <br /> I was hardly able to devote more time to writing this movie except perhaps to warn other people about the waste of time.
