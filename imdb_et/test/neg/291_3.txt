I heard the stories of the robbers of the movie and it's great, but it's just 1/100 of the movie. The problem with this movie is fun. I never got a plot or a man stole girls. It doesn't make sense, but hey ... why they were curious about the club at random. Many parts of this movie don't make sense, but in general I was interested. On many levels, it was confusing ... maybe I wasn't quite indulged in this film, but when they searched for B, they went out of money, just cut some things and forgot the plot. Its a low budget and so it seems. I like to use little special effects that were bad, but they didn't use any quality. I would say that this movie is a basic bad script with dull production. Certainly it's not as random as many of the movies I've seen, but puzzle pieces just don't understand together. In the effects, I would give an exception to the final battle if all the effects went on my ass in the 1950s. Models and other similar sparks. See this if you want a movie about unwanted comedy. The Mystery Theater has a candidate.
