Unfortunately, this movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> Clich√©d, hackneyed, stylish dialogue and action make it almost invisible. <br /> <br /> The feeling-good finale is ridiculously flat. <br /> <br /> There is a reason why Judge Reinhold's career is gone. <br /> <br /> If you do not live in New York and are not Jewish, many jokes are understandable. <br /> <br /> I also found it necessary that the daughter of an unknown lesbian would be offensive at the end. <br /> <br /> I just don't understand how this movie was so popular in film festivals. This is undoubtedly one of the worst films I've ever seen.
