Why is this movie description so much? <br /> <br /> It is amateurish, uncomfortable and annoying. <br /> <br /> The only memorable thing here is the bright title song. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are small and the "comedy" (if you want to name them) ideas are weak, they seem to be left behind by the SNL, even if they dare not put in <br /> <br /> I'm getting IMDbi ratings trust in it. <br /> <br /> It's a light year away from Kentucky Fried Movie - not even on the same Galaxy. <br /> <br /> It's not even possible to write 10 lines on this. <br /> <br /> OK, another good thing: ugly street scenes and ugly people - something you don't see in today's television and movies.
