Hey, I'm a fan of such bad movies, but Rise Of The Undead is not so bad or so good. It's just so bad and so. No cheese redemption, involuntary humor, nothing! - boring apocalyptic Zombie ("Undead": some people who have almost no composition) nonsens with flat special effects (if you can name these effects), stupid plot and annoying actors. They also have a nerve to hang and quote other (better) movies (Resident Evil, Dawn Of The Dead & Comet) and managed to sleep on my side. But it was Rise Of My Eyelids when the final credits were rolled. My advice: Save your money. It's not even worth renting if you don't want to p * ss off and / or put some people to sleep, then go ahead and give it a spin. You have been warned;)
