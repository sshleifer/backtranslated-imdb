Maybe it was fascinating for the 1946 audience, but the movie is now a bit boring. I had a lot of time to go through the whole thing and it was very predictable: I know we know from the beginning of the movie that Welles is a Nazi war criminal and I give you one thing about whether he was caught and finally punished. <br /> <br /> Not worth watching. It is sad that Welles only made three films worth seeing during his long career: Kane, Ambersons and A Touch of Evil.
