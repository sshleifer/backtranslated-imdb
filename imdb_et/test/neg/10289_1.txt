It's a snappy film. I'm shocked that it is even being held in the IMDb library. And Bill, Julia and all other "professional" actors should be ashamed to be part of this sick flick. I thought I was looking at the classic classic horror film that the writers want to invent .... which usually doesn't make sense when writing horror movies, but as a viewer we try to rationalize and understand. This end was not creative. It was sick and he has everything from a nervous movie. I am shocked that this ending was edited and shocked that it will be distributed by the end of June 2009. It should not be shown in the theater. It is detrimental to innocent minds at many levels .... see the movie, end, and you understand this statement. The plus, which belongs to the plot, is the sweet little girl "another 9" of her character says. She's not in a snuff but she's an integral part of the movie. Why do directors feel that they need to be shocked by a sick flick to get recognition? The director is in the wrong workplace when he thinks it's an art film.
