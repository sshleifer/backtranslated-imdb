If you haven't read Tolkien's masterpiece; Prepare yourself for the best movie experience! But if you have ... After reading the books many times, I have come to love the characters and the story for many years and feel that I know it thoroughly. I have my own vision of Shire, Hobbiton and character gallery. So this film was disappointing. Why? It dictates the appearance of characters (inevitably), changes events, removes a significant storyline, removes the less important story. The big pieces of what makes the Lord of the Rings what it is are simply ignored. Even the special effects of 2001 cannot make Tolkien's (and your own) imagination. Peter Jackson has made an honest attempt impossible and I don't think anyone else could have done it better! But the fact remains, I'm sorry to see the movie. The next time I read the Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson jumps over the limited vision, not my own.
