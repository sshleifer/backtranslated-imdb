Seriously I can't why people are all like "Oh God God Up is the best movie ever !!!" It's a bunch of junk! First of all, they are ridiculous and will not even talk about dialogue because it was terrible ... Movies should be entertaining, and this, let me first say, was * not * entertainment. I actually smiled because I was so embarrassed when I saw it. Music and dance didn't do anything for me either. And what is the "heat" of Channing Tatum that all girls are talking about? What ever. The film was pathetic. Don't waste your time - nor your money. If you're not a dance movie, but such movies aren't * movies ... they're jokes.
