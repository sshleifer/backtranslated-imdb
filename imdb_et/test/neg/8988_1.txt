I watched this movie for a hot boy - and even he sucked! He was the worst - well, okay, I have to rape this freaky policeman, he was even worse. This man was not so cute that he was the most terrible pressure, and he was the most secure hicksville idiot who could not stand against his mother what he loved. In general, and if it makes sense to you when I watch movies from a video store, I think I read a movie that looks so / so, "Well, at least it can't be worse than Carolina Moon." writing, acting, plot - all that made my gag reflexes want to drag back. It was the most terrifying film I ever see, Gabriela there. I hated it, and trust me if I had 1 IMDb under the number, I would have chosen this heartbeat.
