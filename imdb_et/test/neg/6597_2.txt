While I was sitting and watching the whole thing, I have to say that it was not good. It was all over the place, with large pieces of information missing on how things developed and even in some bits inaccurate. you don't understand the thing. You need to build on your current knowledge that a bit would be worthwhile. The fight was a bit dramatic, Flex Alexander didn't know anything like Michael, which was down to me, and finally he was looking for a grey. as a very positive, gentle and loving individual, it was okay, even though they made him foolish from time to time. If you want to look at the story of MJ's life, see "American Dream". It is much better, but the only thing is that it covers up the "bad" era. I have no doubt that they will finally make the story of the big budget MJ, cos Michael You rock ;-) !!!!
