* Criticism mentions spoiler * <br /> <br /> I rarely use user reviews, but this is one film that has no problems. This film smells and its average estimates of 6 and a half stars are probably too big for such cellulose. The Bone Collector is not the same caliber of the film that the lamb or the silence of the Seven was, despite what his ads claim. This is a great example of how not to make a thriller. The pace of this movie was extremely slow - I left halfway in about 10 minutes and came to the exact same character scene without progressing (I refer you to the part where Angelina Jolie characterizes Denzel about cutting the body of a dead body). The film is not at all intimidating, but it tries to compensate for it with a love subfield, although it is a sexy Angelina Jolie character and Denzel Washington. Of course, what you get is comparable to the mentor-student relationship seen by the brilliant epic Silent Sheep Breeding with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, but even it lacks any efficiency and I personally directed the killer to kill Denzel out to avoid the hackneyed giggles between the two. With such a dirty movie, I was half-waiting for the plot to warp or some remarkable situation at the end to give the film some loans - things that mediocre films like Arlington Road and Scream pulled out. Anyone with a fourth grade education will see an end to how they are resolved (a situation that imitates Alfred Hitchcock's rear glass). The killer's explanation that his motives were explained was inadequate, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid that I had a latte over the screen. Esoterically speaking, I even think that the intention of the murder was completely lost, because Denzel happily returns with his proverb "chess game" and gets her pet project Angelina. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of films with original ideas and truly dynamic concepts (as I am), this movie is not understood. If you have not been involved in one film in your life and want to catch up on every Hollywood clich√© you ever wore (late night knocking from someone other than a murderer, ridiculous about the relationship between the main investigator of a serum killer), a terrible woman trying to get a man in a dominant workforce namely, SOTL), watch this movie .... but even then the slow pace and you would be bored.
