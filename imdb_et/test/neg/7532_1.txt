This is really a very bad movie. This may seem like an over-simplification. A minor unjustified offense that is comparable to a child's child. The truth is that I can't say enough about confusing pointless plot, really cruel action (I'm talking about disgusting here) or random images of violence against women that make up a radically frightening film of chaotic pasty. make mistakes that propagate this innocence to all who are in the cinema world, good and decent in human culture. Please take my word, don't look at it ... ever. I'm serious. Stop. You thank me later.
