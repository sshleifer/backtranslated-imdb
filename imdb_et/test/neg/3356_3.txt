When Pam Grier made COFFY in 1973, it was an exciting, though flawed, film. The plot was sharp and satisfactory - even if the actor was often amateur. It was so successful that American International Pictures decided to change the next year's FOXY BROWN formula - not a bad movie, but certainly almost like "COFFY II". Now, just a year later, the studio had apparently given up something new to Mrs Grier, like SHEBA, BABY was the same COFFY and FOXY BROWN again. Since the idea was so recycled and running and acting is so tired and low-power, the bottom of the Blaxploitation barrel is really scratched. <br /> <br /> Just like these other movies, SHEBA, BABY, will start with some of the local black mobiles that push and eventually kill Pam Grier's love. Previously, it had been drug dealers and blinds, now the mobiles were trying to get all the loan companies and pawn shops out of town so they could corner the market. And like other movies, Pam is a woman who has hit the team, giving justice and a good ass. And like other movies, the Pam and White lady have a "cat fight" right in front of Mr. Big. And like other movies, Mr. Big is a white boy who pulls all the strings. And like other movies, he's also Mr Big. And like other films, I DO NOT kill him right away, but gives him many ways to escape (here, leaving the knife comfortably). And like other movies, he finally gets free and kills his jive - @ $$. <br /> <br /> Although this formula seemed interesting in 1973, the film was fairly predictable in the film. Even if you haven't seen other movies, it was still bad because the action was so slow - hitting and hitting seemed so slow and staged. The same can be said about playing weapons. In one scene, there were four men with machines, an AR-15 and a shotgun attack. Pam reacts by opening a fire with a 357 revolver and killing 4 out of four and getting another assignment !!! Even if he's a good shot, he was pretty slow and the guys just seemed to wait until he killed him! Plus, even the World Champion shooter or Rambo would not have been able to make such unilateral odds - after that they had very impressive weapons on the boys and they had already directed him when he "smartly" fired out his pistol and easily sent out those professional hit men !! <br /> <br /> In addition to slow and flat action models compared to other Blaxpoitation films, the film has many logical gaps that show that writing was terrible, but the studio simply didn't care. In one case, his boy, Williams, yacht and Nu-tronic knew at the end of the movie, but Pam never told him how he knew about it? In another place, a boat filled with lockers is approaching the police and the hood immediately opens fire. However, the police had no evidence that something happened and that the scammers began to shoot with a small provocation. And the crashes had a .30 caliber machine gun and other amazingly powerful weapons, but in many cases they killed police officers using 38 knives. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that it is an excellent example of being "been there / made that ... is a whole lot better". I love Blaxploitation movies, but it's just too clever and slow to watch it, except for the very dedicated fans of the genre.
