You know that the commercial use of mouthwash, where the boy is full of Listerine or whatever it is, and is really trying to keep it in the sink? This is the big metaphor of this movie. I looked, though, it was really hard. But keeping the mouth of the mouthwash leaves you feeling fresh. This movie was in a bad taste in my mouth. I should have found it when I had the chance. <br /> <br /> The premise is pretty funny. For the first time in a thousand years, Gargoyles has returned to Romania and all the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things have long died. The task of Michael Pare and some other secret agents is to get to the bottom of things before Gargoyles runs. Unfortunately, this premise is completely lost in bad dialogue and less enthusiastic about human activity. CG Gargoyles is doing the best. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this movie looks like a poor male Van Helsinki. If you look at your brain at the door, it may be closed on Monday night. I gave him 3 out of 10 stars.
