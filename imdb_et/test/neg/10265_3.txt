(Spoilers more than likely ... something very important that you couldn't understand yourself) Yes, it's really weird. I rented it in Blockbuster because he had no description of the movie on the back of the box, but a list of the bands that had songs. But after that I had time to find, even here in IMDB. I confused it with "demons at night", but you know they are basically the same thing. <br /> <br /> The parts I loved most about this movie were in the garage. This black gym man was fun so he shouted ALL the times. Even though the shouting was not really necessary, he gave out "INVITE YOU! And so, they drove cars to other cars. But then he got the balls and won the zombie that had the bones I believe. the part that was outside the building crash with the men whom the girl didn't want ... What important part of the movie did it give us? What was it? Why was it there? Why did the man who shattered the movie ended up in the studio? I saw it was in the direction of the screen zombie, but he was very far away. I thought he might have turned off the TV. Yes, this movie was shot in a whim and yes, I hated it.
