I couldn't believe how terrible and boring this Hollywood remake was. It's so terrible. It easily lands in my top 10 worst movies in 1998.About this the only thing he had gone for was Bruce Willis, who should stick to action movies like a totally emotional killer who'd kill his mother at the right price But I'd rather listen Robbie Coltraine's American Week to listen to Richard Gere's nasty Irish accent. But this film is also unlikely, convincing, uneven, uneven, unimpressive, and lands with a possible career return with Sidney Poiter. One of the aims of film registration.
