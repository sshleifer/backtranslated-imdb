I think the film was one-sided and I looked at it recently and found a documentary that was characteristic of Western filmmakers and was unbiased without content. The fact is that prostitution exists everywhere in the world, not just in Tanzania, not because of its fishing work, there were prostitutes before Russian and other businessmen arrived in Mwanza. Indeed, poverty in Africa is endemic, not to mention Tanzania, and it does not come from the business of fish fillets; in fact, the fishing industry has helped millions to support their families in their daily lives. This film simply hides the good reputation of this peace-loving country. With regard to arms trade, the film could not prove whether it is true that watching a film critically questions the authenticity of the filmmaker, seems to be trying to prove their point by using some signs that may be doing something really. Yes Tanzania is a poor country yes, there are prostitutes and street children, but they are not the product of this company, it's just a general scenario in most poor countries indeed in the world even in the western world ... What a waste load. The pilot himself talks about sending weapons to Angola, which is more than 2,000 miles south of Tanzania and the war was also far from Mwanza in the DRC, the director was unable to prove how these weapons were transported to Mwanza in the Democratic Republic of Congo! <br /> <br /> In short, the films lack focus and respect, finding a character everywhere in Africa is pretty easy and has nothing to do with Darwin's nightmare or fish fillet. The truth is that the Nile perch has not destroyed all the other species of the lake that are the opposite of what the film represents, and less than 25% of all the catches of the Lake Victoria are exported, the rest being consumed locally, you get one better.
