I seem to disagree with many people here. but I really didn't find this movie sliding like I was supposed to read. Undoubtedly, the story was concerned and the partition fund gave the opportunity to an epic. but the movie was released. specially for the neon who has seen the "gadar". Despite the fact that the sunny deol and the incessant song play a leading role, I have to say that the gadar is better than both. the story is almost the same. the partition failed to create both symbols and scenes that had to impact. over the kristin kruek accent and small picture, which in itself was not an easy job. The characters just didn't seem too real. not that I criticize leadership. it just doesn't work. the atmosphere was well drafted, but there was virtually no film. it is not that I'm a dying rambo fan, but some activity has seen the movie through or some character development. it all seemed to hurry. and the end ended only with the dissatisfaction of the viewers. and if U hasn't seen the gadget then u mite even.
