Where do I start? After suffering through this evil $ 1.00 rent (thanks to LOT, Family Video) I just had to make some comments. I didn't bother to write the name of the 3 participants in the movie, but hopefully you know who I'm talking about. The monster truck terrorizes the countryside and rides two college parents to punish their punishment. They're in contact with a hot girl wearing slutty clothes. It simply means fantastic in theory. I smiled hysterically in the DVD box when I walked behind the counter in a video store. <br /> <br /> Action: A hot girl played by Aimee Whatever laughs visibly through many scenes where she should be scared. The other two main film actors, the fat yeast and the vanilla straight guy, are both terrible. The hard man thinks he's Jack Black. He's not. Another actor, our hero, feels overwhelmed and leaves all his hints closed and appears as some of the common signs you see on the roller skating of Nickelodeon's film made in the early 90's. Look: I'm not expecting great performances on such films, but at least the actors can make an effort not to be annoying. You may be an incompetent actor but still be pleasant (i.e., John Wayne). At least Aimee gal is attractive. <br /> <br /> Script: Holy ****, who thought this dialog was funny? I wouldn't want to play this joke in front of my classroom less than the movie script. Reasonably bad. More later on. <br /> <br /> Production: OK, this is where the movie will definitely succeed. The quality of production is amazingly high. The look of the film is very good. Probably the only talented person who worked in the film was the director of photography. <br /> <br /> OK, here's my biggest grip: 1) The car driver never drives faster than 25 miles per hour. / / <br /> 2) A man driving a car has realized before the country that his back seat has a greasy man in the mask. He is said to be careful about registering gas mileage and keeping his antique furniture in good condition, but does it mean that there would be 300 pounds of Jack Black impersonator behind? Come. <br /> <br /> 4) The characters will never change their clothes. There are two hotel scenes. Presumably, showers are still available for showers within 3 days of the film, no characters interfering with changing clothes. <br /> <br /> 5) Comedy. Lighthearted, slapstick comedy doesn't mix with horror. Period. It is not possible for our characters to run from the monster truck for one second and second for those literally against each other where some light / comedy music is played. Such stimulation virtually destroys all the tension in the film. Movies such as Evil Dead 2, which interfere with comedy and horror, realize that tension can be relaxed, but never eliminated with humor. Monster Man can't get it. <br /> <br /> I'm upset that what might have been a very funny horror movie has been destroyed by a driver who thought he was a lot smarter than he was. Oh well.
