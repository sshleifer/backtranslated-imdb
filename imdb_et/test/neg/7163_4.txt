This is an example of a textbook on how Hollywood did not trust (do) trusts and put on his big stars. The character of the Christian has been completely rewritten, practically eliminating anti-Semitism from Noah's army unit, Michael's story has changed significantly, and the end result is the destruction of the book's power and terrible beauty. I almost want it not even seen, because movies (sounds and pictures) can resonate so strongly in your brain; I'd rather just have the impression of a book. The book could have been written today, that is, honest and brave. The movie can't be. My advice: SEE THE FILM; Read the book.
