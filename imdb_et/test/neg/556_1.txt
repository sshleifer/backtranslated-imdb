Hillary Swank is an uncomfortable job in the movie's unpleasant work. Pat Morita, a desperate job of any kind of work, agreed that he would repeat his role as "Karate Teacher" and bring the Karate brand back to silver, except this time, Hillary "skank" Swank is a student. br /> <br /> I can see that Hollywood writers are excited by the idea that a woman has a "tortured, corrupt brat" who takes Ralph's role. The film does not work at any level and is completely boring. There is nothing interesting here, and not even a lesson to be taken by someone. The film was made without making money, because it is just so bad. <br /> <br /> I would like to rejoice at all those involved in this film to be associated with them and to have black lists of unhappy and offensive efforts for them.
