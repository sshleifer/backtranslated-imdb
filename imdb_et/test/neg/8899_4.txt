Another film from a mountainous country in Sweden that is always northern. When black people were shown in this way, racism and good reasons are discussed. But it's mostly tiring. Gangster comedy with bad Russians (as always) and bad (and stupid) Finns. And, of course, Norway is strangest, according to Stockholm's prejudices. That's not funny. It's not even exciting. Too raw burlesque that interests you in some way.
