Yes, this review may include a spoiler, but thank you for that. This is the worst film I've ever seen. I came to this board to wait for the same response I had, but there are many inexplicable people who love this movie and especially Spacey. <br /> <br /> Some robbing me of saying this, but I find Kevin Spacey acting quite limited, despite world admiration. I felt like I was looking at a more important version of Kevin's "American Beauty" role. His character in this film is ridiculously superfluous until his ridiculous insults he throws at his assistant. Equal to Sweat and Low. Somehow I suspected that this particular scene should have been funny, but by that time I was ready for the stop button (this is about 20 minutes of the movie). <br /> <br /> What is the faux-homage "Resevoir dogs"? Whaley says, "I think I saw it in the movie once," as he would cut Spacey's ear. But what does he use? Envelope! That's right, he's giving him some paper cuts! It must be one of Hollywood's worst scenes of all time, and the fact that the actors and the director tried to do it straight face makes it even more terrible. <br /> <br /> I testify that I didn't see the end of this movie (my DVD is mercilessly locked about half an hour before the end), but anyone who wants to say it can release me, which I missed with great twists and it would have been wise. Well, I do not care about what happened at the end, because it could never compensate for this bad behavior and relentless overflow. I even had the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this movie as bad as I did.
