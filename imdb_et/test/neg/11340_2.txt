As far as I hated the movie that this series follows, I can at least say that Zangief was fun. The animated series is probably one of the worst things ever produced. Animation is often inconsistent, even though it is permanently bad. The shape of the characters is even able to change significantly in the same frame. The script and the voice also act to leave something to be desired, as most of the cast seems to be about as talented as cast third-class drama play. Characters such as Cammy and DJ are forced into the stereotypes of these nations that episodes containing them are almost physically painful to look at, and not that the series is not hurting regularly anyway. The episode plots seem to be trying to reach the level of new wedges in each turn and are so full of holes in the plot that amazes me that they had time to show ads. Really, it amazes me whoever pays to advertise during the show. In addition to being a bad series, it is also an even worse adaptation of Street Fighter. Many characters retain the film's failed adjustments. Examples are Ken and Ryu, who are idiots (though Ken should be rich), Blanka is Guile's friend Charlie and Chun Li is a reporter. It takes the talent to take something as bad as a movie and make it worse.
