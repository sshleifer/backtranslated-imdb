This movie is so light! I was trying to wait for something bigger from this movie, but it was still a big disappointment. The story's basic idea is interesting and potential. It could have been so much better. The characters are really simple, not at all depth. Unfortunately, the previously talented performers Tiina Lymi and Petteri Summanen did not make the bad signs even better. The director just can't get it cr * p. <br /> <br /> emotionally into the movie view. This is outrageous !!! <br /> <br /> Why was such a situation so stupid and old? <br /> <br /> This is too much used element with an even more horrible way of filming. Oh no!
