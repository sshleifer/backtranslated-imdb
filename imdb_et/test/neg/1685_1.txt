Allows you to be realistic here. This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. My husband and children showed a real promise in their first season and then went down the hills. It's so bad that words don't describe. Action and writing are consistently so terrible that they do not know whether Damon Wayans deliberately produced such a terrifying exhibition. From top to bottom, every show is ridiculous. Damon Wayans fully subscribes to it and George Gore II is so terrible that I spun every red line. Can anyone actually look at this example and find it fun, not to mention a funny one? Please, I ask you. Don't look at this example. As soon as the TV subsidiaries terminate this in the syndicate, we can finally get rid of this absolute waste.
