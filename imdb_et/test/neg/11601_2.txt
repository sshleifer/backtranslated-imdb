I voted only for this 2/10 mainly because Hitchcock agreed to direct it. He had a day of predictable plot traits, stupid childish characters trying desperately to be funny. There were "twee" hygienic, disinfected, emasculated "sex" scenes at a time when Hollywood's production code was in full force. Singers in male characters in a movie who like "soap" characters will never do the work for which they are paid. It always irritates me when actors don't usually eat food (one exception was "Tom Jones" (1963); although a lot of drinks are consumed - the actors have to leave their mouths free for the next line! "Carole Lombard certainly installed Hitchcock's" cool blonde "ideal picture heroine, but who ever had to manage this precious unusual script would have had to hold her thrillers. That's definitely not a good thing for the past 69 years. I couldn't wait until it ends because it gradually irritates the end.
