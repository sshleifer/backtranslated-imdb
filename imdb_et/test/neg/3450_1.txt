It was one of the worst films I've ever encountered. The cinematic art was boring, with long annoying shots (like the camera's tripod in the film stage) mixed with "dramatic" corners that didn't give any meaning to the content on the screen. Editing was terrible, the scenes matched with the butcher. The movement of the plot was related to the viewer's historical night, where Mary Shelley wrote to frankenstien. The action was forced, with the evolution of character that continued you intensely, that each of them dies terribly (the sooner the better).
