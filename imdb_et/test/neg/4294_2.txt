"The Yoke on Me" is undoubtedly the most controversial film of the Stooges 23-year-old shorts. The reason is understandable; according to today's standards, this film can be considered racist. For this reason, it is rarely shown on television, if any. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that the Japanese soldiers were not in the record; they were Japanese Americans who were sent to a relocation center during World War II. They were processed and shown to be the evil enemy of this film. In all accounts - including the US government, which apologized and corrected in the 1980s, the Japanese-Americans were as loyal and hard-working as World America during the Second World War. Their time imprisonment is a dark bomb in American history. <br /> <br /> There are some Stooge in this movie, but memories of how Japanese-Americans treated during this time are a value for entertainment. Let us not confuse honest Japanese-Americans with their representation on this film as criminals. The Japanese-Americans and the Japanese Empire of the Second World War are not synonymous. 2 out of 10.
