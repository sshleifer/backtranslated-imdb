It's so fake! The plot seems to be the overall customization of the blaxploitation film. Blaxploitation, such as racism, oppression, and the struggle for the integrity of its community, have shared common themes so easily. And the jokes aren't even funny! Dolemite rises to those monologue comedy that is really painful. All the people around him offer this canned laughter. Even the soundtrack sounds like this funky funk. For a much better comedy blaxploitation try "Coffy" and "Friday Foster" with Pam Grier. Try the "Black Heat" to get a more realistic blax experience.
