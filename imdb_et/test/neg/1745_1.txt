If this is the best in Finnish cinema, then I would say that the big tax charges that have been spent supporting "culture" have been terribly wasted. The bad country is the worst example of how to try to make the Finnish "European film" a big audience. I am sure they wanted it to be all modern, smart and at the same time touching. The result is nonsense. <br /> <br /> To make it short: - the story is pretentious, naive, and not plausible. The same goes for signs. I can imagine that they are thinking about making a movie where "everything would be like *** and people would be hurt and feel, you know, really bad inside, because the Finns are so notoriously depressed and their self-defenses are so bad" brings us to the fact that ... <br /> <br /> - The film is full of clichés, mostly about "Finnish thinking". How it deals with people's problems and their causes can be from a regular women's magazine or from a cheap pull-psychology-self-help book. ("We feel so bad inside!") I am sure they also looked at some of Kaurismäki to find out about his films, which people love, completely misunderstood him and came up with a boring, depressing story about people. through any kind of other artistic goal than, perhaps, social pornography. It's a shame that they threw Tolstoy here. It's just a sign that you're trying to be smart. And not. - I think the worst fault is the complete absence of vision and depth. The film is extremely original. It is also frustrating to look at endless torture and suffering without true revelation. I can go through such a ** if the film is funny or comes to a complicated joke or even better, such as being exquisite. von Trier's waves. They weren't in the evil country. But in fact, at some point, I started to laugh because the events were just too predictable, intrusive and incredible. <br /> <br /> Who does that mess? And who does it like? I hope they pretend.
