Irwin Allen put all his talents behind it: he is a co-manager, producer and leader of the atomic submarine of the comic artist "epic", and its efforts to reduce the circle around the Earth. A potentially exciting story will not succeed, despite the eclectic pain. Many Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine players Frankie Avalon and Barbara Eden are interestingly mixed and offer color color, but this soggy sci-fi is quite exciting. For some stray laughs, it is good, but Allen didn't know what's the difference between a strong, solid adventure and campy nonsense. Later popular TV series. ** from ****
