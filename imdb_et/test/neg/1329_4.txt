The 1993 Stalingrad film is very disappointing with all its technical flash. Before viewing it, I had read the non-literary accounts of the Stalingrad campaign and saw many documentary materials and photos of the actual battle and its participants. I do not believe that any film really does not represent the actual struggle and suffering, but I still wanted to see what a relatively recent German film production would be. Although this film has some good elements, it is generally a failure. The worst aspect for me is that it contains important anachronies as well as some very viable and cliché elements that are most prominent in some meetings between a German officer and a Soviet woman. <br /> <br /> There are also some ideological elements in the film that result in very distorted imaginations, including that of German chaplain caricature, some overbearing class war messages and problematic images of "good" and "bad" Germans. Certainly the World War II German armed forces included men who were able to maintain some dignity throughout the war, and others who did very bad things, but the attempts of the film to show this contrast are very simple and children. I give "Stalingrad" credit in the sense that it does not fully represent German forces in a simple demonic quality, a stereotype that many people now possess, but the film also includes its own stereotypes, such as the very true infantryman with the 1990s. years of attitudes and two totally infamous infantry and ex post officers. <br /> <br /> Some recent films, such as "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private" Ryan, are often praised for their "authenticity" in graphic arts scenes, but these same movies are in the image of the attitudes, values ​​and behavior of 1940s soldiers and civilians "Stalingrad" and "SPR" have large and smaller characters that do not have the usual unconscious stoicism among ordinary people during World War II, and certainly have been known for their frequent exhaustion and accidental cynicism, but both films are absorbed by themselves. talkative and sensitive traits are something else and are more common today in our world than they were in the 1940s. Although many people today want to deplore war movies in the '40s and' 50s, giving more patriotic messages and not being so graphic, many of them from earlier films, such as "battlefield", the image of more typical soldiers es much more specific, attitudes are often successful, showing the terrible effects of war in more indirect ways. <br /> <br /> One well-done part of Stalingrad is the battle between the German infantry and Soviet tanks, which makes the horrors and confusion associated with this fight very weak. <br /> <br /> "Stalingrad" does a bad job, showing the common look of a front soldier. Some of this may be due to the difficulty of finding thin, haggard attachments in our pampered and well-fed America and Western Europe. Also, too many German soldiers in the film do not wear their uniforms and equipment properly and do not show the usual professional camp in German Wehrmacht even during the years of German defeat. If you want a good understanding of how the real German troops looked, I recommend the following documentaries that include the Stalingrad campaign: "The World in the World", "The War of the Century" and "The Russian War". Many useful photos include Paul Carelli's "Operation Barbarossa in Photos", Geoffrey Juke's "Stalingrad" and Paul Carelli's "Stalingrad". Books written about the battle between Antony Beevor and William Craig are also recommended, and the latter is especially good for both soldiers and civilians on both sides. <br /> <br /> Relatively recent movies, which I think are much better than "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private Ryan" depicting people's attitudes and character during World War II, and the general feeling, appearance, horror and sharpness of this war is "Der Untergang ("The Downfall") and "Winter War" ("Winter War"). Although the "Bridge Too Far" and "Longest Day" cover the events of West Frontier, not in the East, they are also excellent war films and are very close to factual accounts. The last two films lack some of the newest blades in films, but they compensate for this shortcoming with their other strengths, including truth.
