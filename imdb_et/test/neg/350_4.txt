It is this title that tells you ... the island where fishermen live. A missed doctor on the island of Claudio Cassinelli and a crew land, they are either taken out by fishermen or ripped off to work for a treasured lunatic Richard Johnson. Cassinelli discovers that Johnson, who believes he found a lost city in Atlantis, has kept the disgraced scientist Joseph Cotten and his daughter Barbara Bach hostage for 15 years so fishermen can open the treasure that is under the sea. Cotten is, of course, totally crazy. Bach and Cassinell have great chemistry. This madness was led by Sergio Martino and is not surprisingly without merit. It is fast-paced, well-behaved and fishermen look quite convincing (although it is unlikely that anyone could prove that they do not look like real fishermen). Luciano Michelin has a great music score.
