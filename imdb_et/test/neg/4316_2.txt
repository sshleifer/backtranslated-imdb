About Spoiler Warning? It is not "may contain" it - contains a spoiler. Readers warn. Okay, first I need to know that I don't attend the participants. They just work with what they have given. The problem was the script. It was terrible. There was no faith there at all. Of course, if you have a movie based on murderous migrants, here and there is a bad mistake that puts you in a terrible scary movie. But these girls made a stupid decision after a stupid decision. The only girl who was smart enough to ever try and call the police was the girl who was at the end because she was already dead and hit another car. Talking about hitting his car ... why was he trying to drive the truck rather than running like a normal person? Does the one who wrote the script honestly to God believes that the police are not going to investigate the blood-covered door? To be honest, it was not tense. The only relationship I felt was that the girls were as if they were slowed down. Well, this bead has gone longer than I did for such a bad movie, so I don't worry about being apart from reality and flat.
