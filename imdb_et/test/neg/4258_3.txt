Nishabd means word. This must be the state of the script before taking this movie, and therefore the whole movie cries out for content. What you are going through is an unusual love story between a 60-year-old and an 18-year-old girl, and what you get is very common, very common events that will not excite or surprise you. So what we are finally doing is with the picturesque places of Kerala, created by Amit Roy and the friendly histrionics of the new friendly Jiah Khan camera. This does not include the absence of a specific script. Producer-director Ram Gopal Varma, who has such a good number of films, has to pull his socks up. Mr. In the case of Bachchan, I do not want to discuss this in the context of the film. <br /> <br /> Looking through, I feel losing the word. I have literally missed the word! <br /> <br /> Personal opinion: This movie can be compared equally to a bad movie that was released some time ago, called BLACK. I do not see the difference between the histrionics of the guides of both films. What you just said - this was a world-class cinema blah blah and I have no taste. Well, walk. No, I do not mean literally, but the actual theaters showing this movie. Because in this case, you can find this movie in Oscar-level material.
