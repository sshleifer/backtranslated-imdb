All the grown-up people had a lot of time to live and there was a lot of leap to announce this exhibition. It is now easy to explain why it did not meet expectations: First, it was unable to show the real world of pre-teens as the Rugrats grasped the world and the imagination of the toddler. Secondly, the characters of the exhibition are stereotypes (Angelica: white spoiled blonde, not Suzie: a colorful girl from a modest family, ...) or boring (Tommy, Chuckie) and annoying (Dil). Finally, there is no one ounce of innovation or the original plot line. All in all, it is a waste of time and a bad idea for the next series, such as Rugrats. It is boring, there is no imagination, and it seems that the producers do not even know how the 10-13 year olds behave. To be precise, Angelica and Suzie should not compare bra sizes, rather than fighting for who is doing better work?
