Wow! This James Purefoy looks exactly like Thomas Jane! <br /> <br /> This is the deepest idea I took after I saw George and The Dragon all the time. For fantasy comedy, the story was very dull and its effect was obvious. <br /> <br /> The problem was not functioning. James Purefoy makes a good knight and his different sideballs are not bad characters. I even thought that Patrick Swayze in this role was also a pretty good idea. Flat-woven Piper Perabo also had great potential. I even liked the boy. <br /> <br /> But the story and everything that happens and how it happens was just "eh". Not interesting. Compared to the other recent fantasy comedy, Ella Enchanted, which was actually funny, comes up with a very short film. I'm sorry for the decent participants who were tempted by this trudgery. <br /> <br /> 4 out of ten.
