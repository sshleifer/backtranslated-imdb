Okay, it's a movie for kids and it's not one of the movies that adults enjoy. However, there are some unintentionally funny moments, most of which are holes in the story. For example, a child needs a computer part to bring the father back to normal and has no money. Does he ask his father for dough? No, she runs and gets caught. Children, if I'm ever invisible, I'll be moving with your support, ok? Even when this boy is in the police station (no doubt is accused of criminals' behavior), his beautiful blonde teacher comes in, tells who he is and where he works, then the BUS CHILDREN'S BIRTHDAY! Worse still, instead of having a quick escape, they are in the POLICE POINT PARKING PAGE and READ ABOUT OUR ACHIEVEMENTS. I know that I hate to choose, but the child DID steals something and should respond to the consequences, but maybe there is enough punishment in this movie. You Avoid It!
