Hey, I know Angel is not an exhibition that gives people a happy ending, and I know they couldn't make everything perfect, but I couldn't believe Angel was over. I love this example, this is probably the best show. But I hated this end, but also the whole way when the second half of Angel's season 5 went (similar to Buffy's 7th season). The deaths of my favorite characters were pretty much pointless and didn't do anything for the plot. Cordelia was one of the best signs of the show, and when she and Angel finally came together, she turned to evil and demon. I wanted her back, not getting me wrong when Cordelia came back, it's awesome, but I was still very crazy that she was missing. Then on earth, Fred died, just after he finally got to Wesley? There was no sacrifice, it was pointless, he didn't do anything on the plot and the blue hairy demon girl is terrible, useless. They spent too much time around him. Another big problem is that they didn't connect the elements well enough. I know these black twigs wanted to bring an apocalypse, but there wasn't even a date when it was supposed to happen. The apocalypse should have been performed and discovered throughout the season, rather than just mentioning that one hour before the end of the season, there are evil dudes. One of the biggest problems is every character to whom the audience's interests are either dead or who have nothing to live with. My three favorite characters died and Angel, Spike and Gunn (who I'm not sure to even survive) don't have an office, they're not even helpless, amidst a huge battle and lost everything they care about. Angel and Spike have never been redeemed, they lose the girls they care about, and almost everyone is dead, and they still have to fight this wonderful evil army. I get everything you would never fight, but it was stupid to stop it in the middle. Had there been no salvation knowing that there would always be many more battles in the future. I don't understand why this episode is so highly appreciated, because I think Buffy's end was 10 times better and I wasn't even that giant fan. Why did they end up slipping, the 3rd and 4th season and the first half of the five years were so amazing they went and got to the show.
