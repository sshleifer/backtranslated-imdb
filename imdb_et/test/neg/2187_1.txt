this is the best film that takes first place in the hospital and useful movies in this poor country. really u people do not even know what the word cinema means and u votes in movies, i'm really curious to know how many movies P.P.P. or L.Bunuel has seen. The result of this "faite experiment" reflects many things about how to understand things and to recognize a good / high quality movie when u see it. We have only one film for Romanian people and so far the status has not changed and this film is "Padurea Spanzuratilor". But I don't lose my time, thinking how many of you have seen it. This is a film that respects all MOVIE quality requirements. From script frames and even the quality / clarity of the image even passed over her 41 years. I recommend voters to look for better movies and then vote. KuDos looks like later.
