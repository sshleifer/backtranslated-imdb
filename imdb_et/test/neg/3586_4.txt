Short marital infidelity returns to the worshiping loving woman, Grace Needham (always represented by sexy Nastassja Kinski). <br /> <br /> She had left the city and her depressing husband to start a trip to sunny Miami, where she was Julian Grant, a pretty bad and manipulative business manager, who was very well shown by William Baldwin (William Baldwin) (why all Baldwin The brothers play so badly on the evil people?) Grace's seduction took place when two drank champagne on an abandoned beach that they sailed privately. Grace admitted that she drank too much for her good and revealed many marital problems. Julian got confidence, claiming that he would not allow this type of problem if he had a link with Grace. Julian's manipulation continued as he described the "lost sea" fantasy, which now encompasses the unharmed grace that sat near, listened to his every word, and increasingly changed his romantic dream. <br /> <br /> His manipulation costed when some fine nudges led Grace to soft kisses, paused for a moment when he pulled back when he suddenly thought to himself. What am I doing? I'm a woman. I'm a mother. I have a real life. Real responsibility. Of course, we've been talking about being together, losing at sea, but it's just fantasy. See what we do here. The consequences are real. We're really lonely on the beach. Will I give this fantasy really happen? "<br /> <br /> He's giving up his dream because his kisses became more passionate. Once guarded by Grace, who had responded to the men's proposals, saying "I'm married," Julian enjoyed looking back at her shirt, bringing more kisses, body care, and climbing to Juliet's lap! She smiles, kisses, moans, laughs, and often looks in the sun, which unfortunately was a short love scene where everyone seemed to have the most clothes. <br /> <br /> Watching illegal passion on Grace's face as a once-committed woman was completely satisfied with sex with a man who clearly enjoyed manipulating others, saying that the whole scene was undesirable for the "R" movie. <br / / <br /> Julian returned home to find her husband rejuvenating when she secured a high paid job, and she is excited to be able to return to a normal life where she can once again be a loving woman and a caring mother. br /> <br /> But the evil Julian Grant repeats the picture and doesn't want to give up Grace so easily. Grace has a plan to get rid of Julian, but does it work? <br /> <br /> Of course, I don't want the story left for you. However, I say that I always enjoy movies related to a sexual claim by a woman (especially if she exhibits unhindered attractiveness and behavior that is usually reserved for her husband), but in reality she is seeking revenge against an antagonist. This movie would have been a lot, much better if the film had added more of the story. My feelings are when the film brings it up, so the film should stop it. And this movie definitely brought out. Unfortunately, the story prevented certain restrictions from continuing to do so significantly. There are also many other movies that will be successful with this point, and I will include their titles in the "Recommendations" section of this section. I am also ready to receive e-mail suggestions for other films that contain a good story of a seemingly dedicated woman's sexual claim. <br /> <br /> Overall, Nastassia Kinski and William Baldwin are both very good. The film is not.
