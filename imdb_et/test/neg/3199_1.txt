Quite likely, the last 100 years of celluloid is one of the biggest waste. Not only does it suffer from a painful (and hugely predictable) divorced script, it is clearly a Alien II carbon copy. Within five minutes I had correctly predicted who would die and who would not (and in what order). Special effects are ridiculous; there is a scene where one team member has regrettably tended by two Krites who look like a teddy bear, and the rare humor is wrong and terrible. With a VCR it is better to do things when you watch this movie.
