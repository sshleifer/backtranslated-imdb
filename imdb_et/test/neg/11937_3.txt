I saw this movie in great hope when I saw this list and decided to watch it on television without interrupting the commercial sections. I liked Lee Van Cleef in many movies, but I'm afraid that when other characters call him, he won't repeat him repeatedly as a reasonable fax from Yul Brenner Chris. <br /> <br /> I found the complete disappointment of this movie - the soundtrack of the music tried to give the original the magnificence, but too much to bring the movie to the original standard. This film was mostly lacking in rich textures of original characters. I think if you haven't seen the original, it would be fine. Too many clich√©s and symbols too little. I missed humanity and compassion and the three-dimensional signs of the original.
