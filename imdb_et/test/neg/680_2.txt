The director seems to be a good, sure man. His parents are struggling with the same problems we all face. They were wrong with each other. They loved each other. They misunderstand each other. And the poor audience must sit for ninety minutes on what is probably one of the most boring families ever out of Long Island. <br /> <br /> This documentary has few interesting choices. Music is banal, unchecked, and this story is the same story played on every Birch Street in every American city. I don't want to sound too harsh - a rarer, well-intentioned documentary is rarely made. The director is the guy you want to be friends with. You just want him to have won as much material as his parents kept in their marriage.
