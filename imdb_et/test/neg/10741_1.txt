I disagree with Dante, who depicts democrats supporting zombies as creatures with an average IQ of 23. I believe that their behavior should reflect a lower IQ than anything in the Pelosi IQ order. The MOH series is quite uneven and it is the very worst episode. Dante, another nonsense Hollywood liberal (or apolitical nerd that sucks to the left to restore his merciless career?) Must finally realize that his leadership opportunities had been detained for almost two decades now, it came out of the Bush administration, Republicans and capitalism left. "satire". Perhaps he felt that he was not politically political before. He would not be the first non-talent who would use asinine political propaganda to advance his career if everything else fails. "Piranha", "The Howling" and "Matinee" peat maker Dante has been as useful as a horror musician, as Adolf Hitler was in peace in the world. <br /> <br /> TH uses humor of the lowest common denominator, cheap and predictable gags, which even members of all blue collars would have difficulty understanding. Or have you ever seen a smart, subtle, intelligent, liberal satire? The populist manure is the key to all messages, so this message must be as simple and simple as the name of Sean Penn. And what better people are to send this message to the popcorn splitting sheep than a few cocaine sniffing Tinseltown losers, all of whom have fallen so low that they are forced to write on TV ... <br /> <br /> I don't want political propaganda, not the left or better, in any movie. But what makes this fear - by all genres - evidences the endless stupidity that prevails so much in Hollywood anti-intelligence. So the coats of arms were Dante that he didn't even notice a fun suggestion that zombies would vote democratically ... (This is what you get to finish the film school: not a source of wisdom or useful knowledge with any imagination).
