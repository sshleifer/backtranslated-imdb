It could have been so much better than the clarity. Tom Pittman gives a good result and some older actors do the job they have to do, but it just doesn't work. First, the actors are too old to play high school, especially Howard Veit. He looks about thirty. Secondly, it is hard to sympathize with the bad Marv, especially since Betty isn't so hot to get started. <br /> <br /> ******* Spoilers ****** The end is so strange. It seems that the director wanted to have Pittman's character shot, but there are no strokes ... he just knocked on the cement where he was there until the ambulance drivers pull him up and put him on a stretcher (down!). What was his injuries? Skinned Knee? Goofy! Vince has just died of his girlfriend without any regrets, but he just hits Marva's land and rushes, despite the fact that he does not hide the fact that he hates the child. And to make things even quieter, Marv would ask the police to tell his father he was sorry. (Duh! Hey Marv. You just knocked around. I think you have a lot of ways to tell your father that you are sorry ... personally). And this writer did not get an Oscar nomination? Leave it out if you don't see it in MST.
