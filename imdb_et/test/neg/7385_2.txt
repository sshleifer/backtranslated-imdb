it was hard to see! it wasn't funny at all, not well done, and it didn't make any sense or plot. the act was terrible. it wasn't well done at all. it looked like a lot of kids who were just turning around in my age and meaningless making a movie. it is by far the absolute worst broken film. if you are a broken lizard movie like me, you will be deceived and eternal in your death. please skip this pointless film that talks about chicks. you will not regret the advice. by the way, do not say that you did not find this review useful because you did not agree with it. it's stupid like this movie. the only OK scene was when the main boy played rugby and got out of beating. I liked that I found my character's pretty fucking annoying.
