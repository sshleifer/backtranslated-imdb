** Possible Spoilers ** Three young people on the wrong side of the law are given the opportunity to transform their lives and become useful members of society by becoming the secret police "The Mod Squad", which has hit the resurrection of television series. 60s, directed by Scott Silver. Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi), and Lincoln Hayes (Omar Epps) can go to the other police because they are less than the stars and who they know. Captain Adam Greer (Dennis Farina) to break into a suspicious night in front of the prostitution ring. In the beginning, Julie gets a job as a waitress, while Pete and Linc just "get" to find out what they can. Julie quickly gets around with old boy Billy Waites (Josh Brolin) who is involved with drugs related to shady relationships at the bar. Before it is finished, the "team" is in its neck, but there are also a number of false police officers who are also involved in the drug, and so they are tied up in their investigation. From the beginning of the movie, it makes sense that you are late; as expected, you know what is going on in the team's origin and operation. All you get here is the three short screws that give you something other than looking at your past; there is nothing about how it all really happened. Thinking was probably that doing this would make the story faster, things would move. While this is to some extent true, some of the added backgrounds would have made the story texture a bit more interesting; the way it happened here reduces the credibility of the whole procedure. The plot's start is insignificant, and any time it takes for a character to design would be worth it. What is presented and rather unimaginable is less than a convincing story full of one-dimensional signs. The performances are satisfactory, but the actors do not get the script or apparently the silver help; Denmark, Ribisi, and Epps are close to Julie, Pete, and Linci, but given the time allocated to them, they still do not have enough help to give their lives. Farina, a good actor who deserves better than what he gets here, is more than just a "good police" caricature. There is a feeling that everything in this movie was once over; some details and nuances would have greatly increased this margin. Supportive pain includes Richard Jenkins (Detective Mothershed), Steve Harris (Briggs), Larry Brandenburg (Eckford), Lionel Mark Smith (Lanier) and Sam McMurray (Tricky). It is a shame to see that the talent here is wasted; much more thought and planning should have been done in making this film. As it is, it is so wrong and poorly enforceable. The Danes, Ribisi, and Epps are like great litters who played all marbles at the local sandlot; Instead of getting a hit in the title, they could all dry out. As Terry says, "On the Waterfront," "You were my brother, Charlie, you should have been looking for me." Well, it is obvious that there were no Charlie who would pay attention to them, and after "The Mod Squad" they could all hope that next time something would get better. I appreciate it 1/10.
