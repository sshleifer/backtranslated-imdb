No one takes SQUALL for a good movie, but it's definitely memorable. If you've come to Myrna Loy as Nubi, you probably won't forget the experience. When this movie was made, exoticly beautiful Miss Loy was still alien, often Asian and usually ominous. He's definitely outstanding. Her skin seemed darkened and her hair was bent. On most scenes, she is barefoot and carries a little more than a skirt and loose peasant blouse, while in one scene she wears a patterned towel. I think I'm focusing on Miss Loy's appearance because she is by far the best, if not the only reason, to tune and watch this crazy antique. You are not sure that a dialogue that is hopeless does not like it. In a typical passage, Nubi's outward-looking caravan and wax boy's window looks at "always gypsies, they sing. Weird and sad. When a big sun burns in a fire, and when a pale moon looks behind the cloud and breathe in the cold like death, they sing." what? Lilac Prose Lovers will receive an Field Day. But I can't be surprised, but if in his later years Miss Loy did not like to take part in this project. <br /> <br /> As many people spoke early on, it was also a success of Broadway's success. The performance was opened at the 48th Street Theater in 1926 and lasted for over a year. The performance evoked a famous episode involving humorous and theatrical critics Robert Benchley, known to have reluctantly spoken with characteristic dialects or English-language characters. A lot of repetitive anecdotes made Benchley uncomfortably stretch out the opening part of this exhibition. In a Spanish village (which has been moved to the village for some reason in Hungary) gave the participants the freedom to carry their accents with different success, but Benchley's patience reached its limit when the door was broken open during the family dinner and an actor dressed as a gypsy girl cut off the room, shouting "Help! He's forbidding me! " He then lied to his household mistress and shouted, "I am a Nubi! I'm a good girl! Then Mr. Benchley came out to his companion:" We Bobby. I'm a bad guy. I'm going now "and left the theater. <br /> <br /> The film version offers numerous examples of unwanted humor, but never close to Benchley's spiritual level. Melodramatic plot touches the family of Louis: father Josef, mother Maria and son Paul, student close We would consider this prosperous family as the "upper middle class" because they are landowners and landowners with all the comforts of life, but their comfortable presence has suddenly become confusing when a village arrives at a gypsy caravan and their home is invaded, yes, Nubi is an amazing gypsy girl He arrives at his door during a storm that symbolizes nice emotions, and the girl escapes from an abusive relationship and asks the temple. After discussing this issue, Lajos's family agrees to hide her from her angry lover who appears right after that but has been turned away. Goodness motivates the decision of the family to take him in, but soon it will be that Nubi mak they bring little good to them when he has attracted all the nearby mighty men, starting with Louis's servant Peter, then working upward for the Son. Nubi breaks Paul's relationship with his fianc√©e Irma (Loretta Young, still a teenager), causes him out of school and then asks him to buy his jewelry, stealing the savings of family servant Lena (ZaSu Pitts). Lena, for her part, still mourns the disappearance of her groom Peter, attracting and throwing Nub as he turned to Paul. Ultimately, Nubi sets his sights on the Josef family, and I think if he had run longer, he would have gone after Uncle Dan, Maria, the priest of the village, and God knows who else is. <br /> <br /> I think it goes without saying that such a scenario is just a parody, but in the first half of it, SQUALL reveals the indisputable charm of daily soap: we look, hypnotized, as Bad Girl works with her spell men-folk and destroys like an irresistible natural force (almost like a storm! Ah-haa, another metaphor!). But because the ground mechanisms grind the matured fun, it disappears. During later scenes, the nub is highlighted and the focus turns to Lajos's family's dysfunctional dynamics, and for some time these people will get a real blow. Especially the son behaves like an absolute heel, but the parents do not recognize it and see their shortcomings; all that is said to us is Nubi's fault, it's not a good tramp. <br /> <br /> Cast men are bored. In addition to Miss Loy, the only actor who can perform talks, ZaSu Pitts, is terrible as usual. The mother of Lajos's household is played by Alice Joyce, a long-lasting silent star who had left her role and retired after that. The fresh joy of Loretta Young gives an excellent contrast to Nub's twilight tempting, but her lines are so inconvenient that it is pleasing. No, there's only one reason to watch this flick, and that's Nubi himself. I can't think of another actor who could have played this foolish role and I was able to get off the side. However, I am not an objective observer. I have a desperate Myrna Loy and I look at her, even SQUALL.
