What's amazing is how this title in the middle viewer slips into something new and revolutionary (citing some comments). Mural K. Thalluri has to think for himself: "Oh, great! Elephant ... What a fantastic movie! I'm trying to make the exact same movie and see if anyone announces!" his outrageous idea. The film shows a complete failure. Considering that it is trying to catch the glow of Gus Van Sants' Elephant, it makes it even more ridiculous - to the filmmaker the most embarrassing faux pas. <br /> <br /> The film starts with a suicide student in a bathroom in the bathroom. This scene already shows the discomfort of every participant in this scene. You don't buy one word they say. In the resumes, the short interrupted interview style bits of children who "live in their married lives" with every bit rather annoying their empty foolishness based on every worthless monologue. Thalluri means introducing the signs in such a way as to give some quick-junk food insight into their hearts ... and fail again. Not five minutes later, Thalluri finally shouts to the audience: "Yes, people! I stole this movie and for some curious reason I'm proud of it!" From "Elephant", Gus Van Sants took the most unmistakable narrative style: he shot scenes twice to let the viewer observe the character associated with each event in his particular way and role at school. Does it seem terribly familiar? For me, a certain level of very forgiving tolerance in this respect was broken up to the point where I could no longer stand the terrible movie. Shame on you, Mural K. Thalluri, I say! I am particularly surprised that "2:37" has been in Cannes official elections since 2006, while everyone will definitely remember "Elephant" (2003) at the same film festival just a few years ago! So how was the most disgraceful rip-off in the name of the Lord shown there? I find this mistake completely puzzling. <br /> <br /> Leaders like Thalluri use audiences who are unaware of (and cannot be fully) aware of each independent film. Because Elephant has little to do with mainstream cinema (though this is undoubtedly a masterpiece), few people have noticed that the story, as stated in "2:37", was said before! I can't tell you how this can be done at a film festival attributed to Cannes. It is sad and disgraceful that such things are passed on and almost no one sees a real fraud in it. <br /> <br /> 2:37 in any case is just a commercial, independent movie and (at a certain level) worthless) rather an obvious parody of its obvious idol "Elephant".
