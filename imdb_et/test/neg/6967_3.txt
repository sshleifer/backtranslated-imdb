As many know, this is Edward D. Wood Jr. debut of a feature film as a writer / producer / director / actor. I've been a fan of Ed Wood for several years. Although I do not like it as much as some of his other films, it was probably the biggest understanding that cinematography goes to the public in his lifetime. Everyone knows he was a transvestite. This film discusses the exchange of your sex and how transgender can cause conflicts with your loved ones. This film is more time-consuming in dealing with and dealing with this topic. However, the movie still contains Wood's usual bad dialogue, meaningless stock footage and hokey special effects. Throw Wood's usual Bela Lugos overdose that he has, and you have Wood's first attempt to be a director. <br /> <br /> The plot is that the police inspector goes to the doctor when he discovers the transvestite body. made suicide for advice on how to avoid further problems. The doctor tells him the story of Glen, who is also a transvestite. Glen wants to marry Barbara, but she can't talk about her secret. She also tells the inspector about Alan, who has changed sex because she is really more suitable for being a woman. Bela Lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some sort of current comment about the current one (the part of Lugos isn't really well-defined and is likely to be Wood's tool for him to have a star in his movie and get money for Lugos). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the film shows Wood's career features. Obviously, it was shot with a very small budget and there are quite a few things that were thrown quite randomly. It's definitely a "it's so bad, it's a good" feeling. However, I have to acknowledge Ed for his progressive thinking in making this film. In the early 50s, transvestite and gender changes were not particularly open. Wood has taken on a high-risk film that depicts transvestites as people who are not sexual abnormalities and make a more human face to cross-cut.
