It's not terrible, it's just waste ... Disgraceful gags, bad music, bad drawings and animation ... <br /> <br /> With an impressive number of animators and intervals in this picture (from, hum hundred different studios Come on, how can you expect something like this when you make an animated movie!) I don't know if one man on credit = one drawing! The lines are tough, 3D work is inadequate (I'm not against it, but not in this movie) But the backgrounds are right. The story is quite stupid, far from BD's wisdom and is obviously aimed at an international audience. To spread the film around the world does not mean that everyone in the world needs simple thinking ... A cultural object is much more interesting than a foreign film, even if it is a foreign film (in this case French) it is even worse!). <br /> <br /> Some new things work well (Olaf's sign, sometimes just like a stone explanation, but it's not great), but modern references are irritating (music, not even a text-to-speech joke, just a stupid bird called SMS) : Does anyone know the imagination?). But hey, this is M6 / TPS output with some Celine Dion, ... pathetic. <br /> <br /> Asterix is ​​underwork and Obelix is ​​talking too much. Goudurix may be great (as in the book), but he is too clearly a "cool guy" with a love affair (with an uninteresting female name). In fact, only the Vikings (except the wizard) are funny. Too many actions, not enough to laugh. The best part of the movie is the final credits. Not music, but some of the photos in it. BD style. Definitely not for Asterix!
