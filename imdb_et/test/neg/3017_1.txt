yes .. what the waiver of the station's responsibility after the ads from this show say that some scenes can interfere with some viewers. <br /> <br /> It's not disturbing. The framing of this whole ego and showing chauvinism is actually on the COMEDY channel. Yes .. true and true comedy. NALI. To see that these "games" pass through their rigid faces really proves what is wrong in society. Especially the meat market bar. Both sides - men and women - are equally weak and desperate to mix up with this superficial atmosphere. The club is probably one of these scenes sponsored by cigarette corporations. These people have a choice and make it even more fun. <br /> <br /> These slippery tests are trying too hard. They shine with their grooves. It's OK. This is a lesson for the new generation of video tape on how to NOT focus on potential heart interest. Hopefully, the facade will collapse with the Bush / Harper administrations. The problem is who is missing these characters? One night baby kids stand?
