All the films I would have chosen should have been. When I was in New York, I went to the Times Square store and hundreds of DVDs I chose Joel M. Reeds Bloodsucking Freaks (1976), and I had a double DVD containing the seed of sin (1968). was sorry? Read on to find out. The film opens on the island (near the home of Milligan Staten Island), where two lovers, apparently, made a huge umbrella with paper, and at one point he gives a weed as a gift. Colin (Hal Borske), who has expired hunchback, jumps out and kills both without reason. After the opening credit, which has joined some of the worst headaches that make music I've ever heard, at least it became accustomed to being used throughout the movie, introducing the three pairs. Women are all sisters, Vicky (Ann Linden) and Ricard (Fib LaBlaque), Veronica (Eileen Hayes) and Bill (Don Williams) and Elizabeth (Carol Vogel) and Donald (Richard Ramos). Each of them is sent a letter from a lawyer, H. Dobbs (Neil Flanagan), who requests a meeting to read his late father's will. Dobbs informs them that they have to spend three days in their childhood "Crenshaw House" and fill it with "sexual harmony and marriage with love" that she never knew because of her father-mother tense relationship. He tells couples that will is very irregular but legal. After three days, the legacy will be resolved. Couples are also told about servants, Martha (Veronica Radburn), Hattie (Maggie Rodgers) and retarded Colin, who welcomes couples who kill and bite rabbits in front of them. Later, when one of the dead rabbits has left the beds of a dead rabbit at night, a note that says blessed is flat because they inherit. It begins with a series of events that end in a terrible murder and reveal dark family secrets. <br /> <br /> Composition, photographed and staged by talented Andy Milligan. This is a terrible movie. Allows you to go through just a few of its errors. Music, it's terrible and headache. Sound, you can hardly hear what the characters say and certain scenes have no sound effects, and on certain points you can hear Milligan shouts to your actors, oh and there is also a constant sound throughout the soundtrack. Functional, probably the worst I've ever seen. Very un-special effects, Colin pokes someone's eye in the opening order, this is the size of the tennis ball, the part where someone is tied and whether his belly is discovered in the saw looks really awful when there are different hands and feet that are cut. Photography, Milligan has absolutely no idea how to stage or film a scene, regularly cuts the top, bottom, or sides of peoples' heads, and looks out of the screen and its cameras and shakes it around as it is constantly controlled by someone. Also, at least one scene is so badly reviewed and filmed that the crew member is visible. The film is often so dark that it doesn't see it. Editing, again some of the worst I've ever sat on, seems to cut scenes before they're finished, cutting off, while the characters are in the middle of the sentence. The script, if it was, was credited with both Milligan and Hal Sherwood (two people writing it!?) All over the place and is incredibly stupid. There is one incredibly bad order where the killer follows the victim in the basement, the killer walks right behind him, at one point when the potential victim turns. What does a killer do to avoid spotting? They sit to her right, the killers are close enough to give the boy an oral sex, but she doesn't notice them right in front of her. You have to believe this sequence, I still can't believe what I saw. The Bizarre Sub-Plots just happen and then completely disappear, look out for the scene when Richard has to lend to his brother Walter (producer and co-author Hal Sherwood) who turns out to be a gay priest with his relationship. brother before he was married! A strange scene that has no reason at all. The house, the housekeeper, reacted to the first murder, he is more disturbed by the fact that he was thrown out of his dinner schedule! There's also crazy crazy dialogue, Patty and Martha are discussing Colin, Patty says, "If only I didn't hit him so hard," Martha sympathetically said, "You need Patty, you have to!" And don't start me when ugly wallpaper across the house! The only good thing I think is that costumes look reasonable for the time it is intended. I could probably go all day if it's amateur, but I think you get that idea. One to avoid if your serious masohh! I don't regret buying it or watching it for a second!
