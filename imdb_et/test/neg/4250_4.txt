Some people want to tell you that Deep Space 9 is the best of all Star Trek exhibitions because it emphasizes character development and continuity and includes more complex backgrounds and ongoing plots. In some ways, it makes it more satisfying, but in many ways it is not possible to show it completely. <br /> <br /> The series begins with the soap opera space station. characters. The characters are a good bunch and most of the participants are decent, but I think the writers tried to make them "normal". By "normal" they actually mean "normal and annoying". <br /> <br /> At the end of the second season we will introduce Dominion, who for some time threatens to finally fight with good guys in the fifth season. This is the main "story" of the show, but it only takes part of the whole series. We still get independent episodes, heroes still get forty-five minutes on strange planets, and there are terrible comedies with greedy, silly Ferengi. Many episodes are only dull and some are inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Dominion, DS9's main villain, is bent on galactic domination for a comfortable reason that they just don't like anyone. The whole war is equipped with a lack of naive moral complexity and imagination. The impressive pyrotechnic space battles appear from the three frequencies of the season, but they are carried out in a ridiculously simplified manner, such as two fleets flying parallel to each other and far from bursting. DS9 writers (including the talented Ronald D. Moore, later "Battlestar Galactica" celebrities) threw their monotonous exhibition, starting with the war, but in the heart it is still a pedantic soap. <br /> <br /> DS9 is still a very frustrating experience. The constant story is too flat and obvious to be truly engaging, and the characters will never figure out interesting ways. "Babylon 5" and "Battlestar Galactica" both fulfilled the DS9 promise and did much better. For Star Trek, stay with the original and the next generation.
