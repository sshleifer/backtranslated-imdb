Ah, this original title for a very dark movie. Duplication is fun because voices and mouth never seem to fit. As a result, I had no idea what was going on when I looked at this mess opening. Returns have repercussions and there is no real time before the end. At the Aztec ceremony, I was laughing. I repeated it twice and got the best abt training. Singing Aztec lady is comical and dancing and costumes are a hoop. Some boys get full of acid, there are many struggles, you have no idea who is any sign (not that I really take care of), and it's a whole noir. Oh, and the real struggle does not happen for a while, so during the movie you can freely rise, fall asleep, travel. You're not leaving something exciting.
