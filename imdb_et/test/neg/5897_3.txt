I tried. The Lord helps me how I tried. But there are only a few people who can hardly create quality. Brett Ratner, Uwe Boll, Britney Spears and Asylum. The "9/11 Commission Report" on its credit seems to be a fair attempt by the company to progress to a more complex narrative and film production state. But for all intentions and purposes, it will be another real movie in your gallery. At the opening, the accountability informs the audience that all the names have changed, but the names of the terrorists are the same. A man named Mussaui tries to fly by plane. A stone with a cold grimace that would make someone uncomfortable instantly can "learn" to fly with a small computer. And you have to think, not how he could easily get into this program, but how these people didn't even ask questions; because this scene is so far drawn in its presentation and the actor who plays this man is above. And you can see that director Scott is trying to imitate Paul Greengrass with bright grain photography, followed by a terribly dizzying and irritating hand-held direction that tries to take out the technique of making Greengrass gung-ho gerilla films throughout the film. <br /> <br /> You will feel Scott's emulation for Greengrass's realism realization technique, but it will become quite flat in half. In the meantime, the film arrives less than "Traffic" to take off and take away more "Law and Order", where we have a waiver of responsibility, which tells us that names have changed, the logo almost resembles the "Law & Order" logo, and then ninety minutes participants, who pumped their breasts and discussed politics. br /> Both of them are never as convincing as they are trying to be. And when the film seems to be trying to be an adult drama, Scott relies on his old safe, sex scene. Scott's new film looks like he really wants to think of as a low budget "Munich", but it is not, and it will succeed in every possible case. The "Commission report of 11 September" is gradually falling, because it is limited to attempting to imitate other films. <br /> <br /> Although I appreciate the ambition behind the camera, this is a new perspective of events. 9/11 is flat and boring. It's hard because it can try to be a low budget "Munich", it's really as fun as the usual Dolph Lundgren movie you found on Cinemax.
