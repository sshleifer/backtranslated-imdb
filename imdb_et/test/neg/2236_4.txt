Is this "realism"? When Rivette tried to give us a thorough study of a place and time, and how she was able to influence the world around her, she failed. Most remarkable because we never get a clue why thousands of men would have hit him. Certainly, there is not enough cultural / historical context to define a country's need for such a savior, and God knows that there is not much charismatic about Joan. When exhibitions of Bonnire's wood surfaces and flat lines should not show transcendental faith and determination. The use of the landscape is particularly unlikely - we will never lose the feeling we look at in the twentieth-century actors who are mistaken for a medieval landscape. And like the battle scenes (which, unlike some of the comments, claim a good 15% scanner) - they look like some local high schools who revive the medieval siege, though the kids would no doubt have put it more passion. I still give credit to Rivette for Joan's side by other films: a deceptive, na√Øve and narcissistic youth (played by a woman who is too clearly at least twice as big as she should be), which obviously fails to understand about him in the movement he helps to create, or in a world beyond his passion. Joan's resentment for his soldiers who scared and astonished the enemy for their lack of respect and obedience is otherwise stupidly spontaneous and credible in the "non-binding" representations "(you realize that such moments must naturally happen). Unfortunately, they help to pinpoint what doesn't appear on the screen - what did Joan SPECIAL do? I have to say that I am still confused and disappointed with some foreign film lovers who equate tedium and the lack of dramatic participation with "artistic" and "seriousness". Does this film really increase our understanding or involvement with the subject? Or something with it? 4/10.
