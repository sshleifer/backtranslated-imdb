Problems: 1) Even though "loving respect for the poverty line" is settled, there is not much old material even from Poverty Row movies - much of it is RKO "The Dangerous Game" (1932), some "The Lost World" (1926) silent (!? ) version! 2) a large part of the old film material is simply used as a filler (old ship film material) or as silent frames (such as Bela walking, watching or staring) often repeatedly; 3) Where are the line-masters of poverty (Bela, Boris, Lon Chaney, Jr., George Zucco, John Carradine, Buster Crabbe, Tom Neal, etc.), where you know the jokes about "new" characters (like Woody Allen) about their rhythm is Tiger Lily? "or Steve Martin's" dead men do not wear a square "? Even Mike Nelson's weak comment on painted" Reefer Madness "is more funny. High Point: Gregory Mank's long but extremely enlightening lecture that gives you new respect and admiration Bela, John Carradine, and George Zucco - it's worth the DVDs alone!
