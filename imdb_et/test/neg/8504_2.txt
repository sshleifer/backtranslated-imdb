I give this movie 2 letters purely because of its slightly liberal lines. Not too detailed. <br /> <br /> The action in this movie is terrible. Really terrible - wood, low. <br /> <br /> The graffiti on the show is weak, so bloody weak that I just don't know why they bothered to use graffiti artists at all. It was obvious at the spraying place that they would have worked with other people. They could also let the actors paint and save a few cents. <br /> <br /> I would avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> The child's loco soundtrack was previously something I was listening to on my iPod, it will be some time before I can go back there, if I'm afraid this movie will go back to my mind. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. If you don't think of yourself as "Wow, it's been a while since I've seen really including a movie ...."
