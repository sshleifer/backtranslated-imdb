This movie was pathetically horrible. The sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous and the effect was nausea. If you have a life, don't see this movie because you want to kill yourself. This movie is completely hanging on Blade (which is undoubtedly a really good movie ... or the trilogy I should say). <br /> <br /> I don't care who the actors are, this movie is just terrible. I looked at it for 10 minutes and I have to come to my computer and comment on how this movie is totally bad. I don't really know why my family is still watching it ... wait, yes, I'm doing. They are laughing at almost unfinished activities, dialogue and action.
