While babysitting in an isolated Colorado house, a teenage girl is terrorizing a murderous murderer in her phone. <br /> <br /> The remake of the 1979 semi-classic horror film basically takes 20 minutes to open the original movie and stretches for 87 minutes! So it's pretty pointless to say that the plot of this remake is pretty thin. The originality or interest of this film is limited. There's a lot of Camilla Belle who thinks in a dark house, wondering who's calling her and meeting all the wrong fears. It all becomes repetitive and routine after the first 30 minutes and will never be able to accumulate much distance or chills. It will certainly never reach the intensity of the original film, especially as it comes out and changes one of the important plot points from the original. I think we have the PG-13 rating to thank for it. <br /> <br /> The plus side has an impressive set and in a dark atmosphere, unfortunately, not going around it to save the remake of sub-par. Belle's performance is quite mediocre. <br /> <br /> It's just one unimpressive remake. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 Off ****
