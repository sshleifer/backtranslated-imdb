"Sexorcist" is definitely the most suitable alternative to English titles because it is basically a shameless kidnapping of William Friedkin's classic horror film, which replaced 13-year-old Stella Carnac with 13-year-old Linda Blair so she could get her poor naked body show. I'm not sure what exactly Satan is trying to do here, but it looks like he has a young girl who plays sexual trick with her! Poor Danila masturbates around the clock and tries to attract priests and even her father to sex with her. A young girl is introduced as a smart and ambitious theology student with an odd-looking boy (driving a fool-yellow car) and a loving, though adulterous parent. When he takes a peculiar crucifix to renovate his home, an ancient remnant comes to life and no less than Satan himself (playing "Jungle Holocaust" by Ivan Rassimov and "Vampire Planet") starts torturing him. Long-lasting masturbations and some odd nightmares cover about three-quarters of the film, and finally, director Mario Garriazzo starts with the actual exorcist. This latest segment is even more embarrassing and amateur! The priests really do nothing but say some vague prayers, but somehow, Danila seems to be healing. There are not many gore, the dialogues are terrible and manufacturers seem to compensate for every small mistake by adding more sleaze! This is one of the strange attempts by Italy to exploit the 70s (why do they refer to "Rocky Horror Picture Show"?), But certainly not one of the best. If you have "exorcist" clones, I recommend "Demon witch baby", "beyond the door" and "antichrist".
