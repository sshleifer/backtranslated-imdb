Harry Knowles has a quotation letter on the front of the DVD that says "Horror's Next Icon" Truly?!?!?!? I've heard a lot about what surrounds it, but I wasn't completely convinced. But I'm a deadly horror fan and I'll give you almost any horror movie. No matter what your budget or rating is, you never know where your next pearl will be found. Not here. Hatchet is poorly prepared, badly behaved and funny. Just because you have participants who played Freddy Jason and Candyman, and Buffy chic topless with ton of gore, do not make you a horror expert. I don't even want to describe the plot because it's so idiotic. Frankly, my money is Rob Zombie. There is a man who knows the horror of the old school. Forget it in the trash.
