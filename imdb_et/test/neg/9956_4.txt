First of all, I must say that I am not a general fan of werewolves in general. It's not that I don't like them, just that I don't like them. There are some I've enjoyed ... a London werewolf (1935, Stuart Walker), an American werewolf in London (1981, John Land) ... and some of what I thought were okay, but nothing special ... Hunt Man (1941, George Waggner), The Howling (1981, Joe Dante), Dog Soldiers (2002, Neil Marshall) are some examples ... but generally werewolves are not a sub-genre of my favorite. But I had one of these 50 movie sets, so I thought I'd give it a look and see how it was. <br /> <br /> Spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> The Mad Monster is a werewolf story, but the werewolf is mainly used by the mad scientist dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) Revenge. Dr Cameron has discovered a way to transform human beings into wild animals, especially wolves, but the larger scientific community was ridiculed and killed. Because of his prestigious position, he is crazy and is trying to revenge those who called him in the old house, where he lives with his daughter Lenor (lovely Anne Nagel) and his assistant Petro (Glenn Strange), who has limited mental powers. Using your serum, Dr. Cameron Petro is a bloodthirsty and sends him to kill his old competitors. Ultimately, the werewolf gets out of Petro's control and both the mad doctor and his creature are killed. <br /> <br /> The movie also plays somewhat of a murder / crime drama with a Lenora journalist (Johnny Downs) examining a doctor's strange behavior and murder scams. The story seems to borrow many elements from other larger images that were in front of it. The Frankenstein (1931, James Whale) reminders are created by a monster running amok, and a creature that kills an innocent child. Think of dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde's Visions (1931, Rouben Mamoulian or 1941, Victor Fleming) and Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner). This is, in my opinion, one of the problems of this film - it emerges as a mediocre melding of some great movies. It doesn't add much to the genre. <br /> <br /> True, there are some redeeming qualities. The performance by George Zucco was convincing and the scene that shows Dr. Lorenzo's visions / hallucinations of his enemies works well for me to show my madness. There is some reasonable character, at least for its character. But the character of Glenn Strange is not at all convincing and it seems that this comic quality is deliberate or not, I'm not sure it just doesn't fit the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me more than most IMDb users, based on my rating of 4/10, but it was still below the average movie.
