I recently looked at 8? Going and watching this movie in the movie theater. It was a waste of time, and the only feeling you get out of the theater is a little disgusting about all the nasty social pornography. <br /> <br /> It might have been interesting if it had a rather absurd twist, but it wasn't that it was just terrible for one or two scenes that could have been taken out and made a very nice short film. Another thing I was thinking of is the way the director uses all Finish stereotypes as a character. It is quite extraordinary how you as a Finnish director can make a film that has the worst stereotypes with your citizenship. It was sad to sit and listen to the audience while sitting and laughing at things they thought were typical, but generally just people.
