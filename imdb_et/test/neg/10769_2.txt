I have read almost all books and have seen musical production in two different languages. I honored everything I felt before. But lately I have run out of resources to preserve my resources. I have a couple of books left, but they are either in transit or they are sequences that I don't read. So I got the idea - Sink me! There are movies I haven't watched! So I have to follow them right away. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes of their series were ... acceptable. In fact, I was very pleased with the variation in the reason for denunciation, although it was different. However, it all went downhill. Chauvelin was too ... filthy? And I believe it's too old for this role. Not just that blind and terrible figure of his terrible. (And what was it with the random bed scene that characterized it? It was too horrible - his only love was Madamill and his only interest - his work and his only obsession - Sir Percy?) Marguerite ... Prettiest wife in France? Intelligent wife in Europe? I don't think so. Although whatever forced him into Sir Percy's research, I don't have the weakest idea. And what has Tony done to earn this death? Yes, all members of the League promised their lives to Sir Percy, but he would never have threatened them or wanted to be like a coward when his dear friend was exposed to mortal threats. And if he had to mourn his companion somehow, he would have done so by mourning, not just moving forward if nothing had happened. That brings me to another point, Sir Percy. His depiction was the most terrible. He was not a lazy fop or a gallant and hardly hero hero who is a champion of change. He didn't care too much about the collars (his pronunciation for that word alone made my ears bleed) and he had never killed anyone with his own hands. So, what was it about walking by accident and killing people? <br /> <br /> Costumes were also too good for this time period. It's the revolutionary France we're talking about! Not revolutionary. People in costumes, like this one, are quite easily visible to the people. It was just ... gah! <br /> <br /> Although I have to admit that after watching other parts, my opinion changed a little. Looking at it as a separate work, regardless of the Scarlet Pimperel series, it was acceptable. Just your second middle hero in the mask. But what they were trying to pass on is still unhappy.
