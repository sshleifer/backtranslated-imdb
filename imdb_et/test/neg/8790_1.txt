This film was apparently obvious and predictable. The scenes were poorly written and worked even worse. After terrible scenes, there was a terrible script that was full of pointless and ill-thought-out lines. I would never want to offer this movie to anyone who would have a good idea of ​​watching good movies. This film was not just about the same ideas as Bachelor and Bachelor studies, but also contained many parts in which you would know the next move and the line without having to watch the movie before. The casting was good, but the actors played dramatically more drama there, but should have used and said they wanted you to swap the channel quickly. Don't watch this movie as a note.
