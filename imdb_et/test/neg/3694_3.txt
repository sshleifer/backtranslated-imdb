I like 50-year-old sci-fi movies. I really like good things (such as the Earth that stands on earth when the worlds collide, the invasion of body snatchers and many others) and sometimes very bad because they can be really funny and good to watch with friends (like the 9th Space Space) plan). However, if a sci-fi movie is bad, but not bad enough to be fun, it should really be avoided. This movie is just such a movie. Posters make it visible as a sexy beast attacking humanity, while the actual plot is much less interesting. She is married to a female woman. She is contaminated and starts to grow in huge size and decides to suppress this worm and hit her tail and that's about it. Also, many special effects are really stinking - especially the giant papier-mache hand that comes into the room to grab the evil marriage.
