This movie has been compared to the fun British comedy "A Fish Called Wanda", although I don't see why. The only connection I find is one of Monty Python (Eric Idle "Nuns", John Cleese and Michael Palin "Wandas"). Otherwise, the two are incomparable. <br /> <br /> Idle and Robbie Coltrane are two gangsters who want to get out of business before they die, so they decide to rob their boss and make Rio. When the escape goes wrong, the two are forced to be in the monastery, like nuns. <br /> <br /> What begins to be a rebellion will soon become a predictable, medium-sized film with ordinary tasteless sex games and wonderful humor. Again, there are occasional big spots, but neither the cast nor the team can inspire procedures. Also, the "Wanda" type manic finish attempt fails with the effort of "rubbing men" in humor that is hardly surprising. If you mean, men who are trying to be women are funny, men trying to be nuns are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Friday, April 22, 1994 - Video
