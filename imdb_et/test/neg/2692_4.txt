Last week I watched the royal Shakespeare company Macbeth. It was 25 years old, filmed without props, except swords, furniture except chairs. It was RIVETING. The actor was super - all participants trained by the British. Contrast this performance with this ... awake awake. Al Pacino, like Shylock, was tragic, hard and could not lose the New York Accent quite a bit, despite the long .... breaks .... ..... lines .... The whole thing was nice even "comic" scenes were barely worth the smile, let the lonely belly laugh. It should be funny. They tried to do it tragically. It wasn't just boring. I give him four points for costumes, landscapes and Jeremy Irons, who is a good dumb, depressed, deeply tuned man (can he be anything else ???)
