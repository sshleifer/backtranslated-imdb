I saw this movie when it first appeared in Pittsburgh Pa. 85 miles. I didn't know anything about the plot or the players. I didn't read any reviews and talked to those who saw it. Believe me, I'm not making this mistake again. It was touted as I believe as the first feature length movie filmed in the new 3D process. That was what attracted me 170 miles back and forth. I could wait to sit down. If I knew at that moment only what I would soon know, I could have been Â¾ way back to Youngstown when the function started. <br /> <br /> When I first played the 3D scene, I nodded. The new news quickly swept the air and since then it has been a pure agony. If you've ever seen the famous movie PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, allegedly the film's worst movie, it is in my humble opinion over the head and shoulders above this garbage. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it is ever shown on the TV, if I don't know why I don't know it. If you can see it, do something else. Walk, cut grass, wash your dog, let someone melt with a rubber hose. Something. Your time is spent better. <br /> <br /> This is my first movie review. It may be my last, unless a worse film comes with me and I'm not doing what would happen. <br /> <br /> Invoice
