Standard "Outbreak in remote areas; an expert who happens to rest in the area will receive a movie". There are only a few deviations from the norm. One is that the involved children are quite reasonable from the start. Usually they are monsters who repeatedly work until they finally redeem themselves. The second is that a local medical practitioner / wizard, who is usually an early obstacle, is never fully discounted or redeemed. Perhaps, because it seems to have been made for a faith-oriented PAX channel, they did not want to be too decisive towards believers. Finally, there was no bad local politicians / leisure industry who tried to cover the whole thing. The lack of these stereotypes was refreshing - when we have a PAX channel to thank for trying out some of my offers. Moreover, it was quite common. You've seen it before.
