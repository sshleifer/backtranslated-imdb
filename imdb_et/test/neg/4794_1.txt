This movie is as bad as it gets. If you like logic (or lack of it) a la National Treasure and also bad action, it could be a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, spend your time in the sun and your beer for your money. In fact, it seems that a bad promo or demo image was produced to promote the people involved (eg actors, special effects, etc.). In fact, they really create a bad revelation of their lack of talents. <br /> <br /> In this case, the film producer should be required to pay back money to customers who are not satisfied with the product. <br /> <br /> It's really bad.
