It is difficult to decide whether this film suffers from the devil's dialogue, or if it is just the way it is seen by actresses. In any case, it suffers from writing songs that are at best mediocre. <br /> <br /> The first part of a film made in the late 80s plays like a 60's teen comedy (which doesn't let any real humor)), especially the "good girl" part that is just as annoying as Doris Day, As you might expect / fear, including a little bit of resistance to something "fun" for your friends. The net effect is when, after a while, you start to hope that it bites, so you no longer have to listen to your voice. <br /> <br /> Some robberies and free nudity, and some truly 80-style clothes, are your only idea that this film was made in the 80s. Oh, and also pretty satisfying music. <br /> <br /> Storywise, it's a pretty formal stuff. A bunch of horny (except for the obviously "miss nice girl") teenagers decide to celebrate Halloween night when a party is thrown in a haunted house. Participation and whoring, as well as a bad unwanted "seance" that captures the demonic possession that is the subject of the film. After that, the only stopping part will try to guess in which order the characters expire. You're not sure they care whether they do it or not. The actors are so bad that, as they become demons / zombies / dinners, their performance improves somewhat, and the ridiculously clich√© dialogue is so annoying that you worship in your seat. <br /> <br /> Special if you think cheese is special. For example, the demon head that appears from time to time is so scary that you don't know if it's a 5-year-old trick-or-treat. <br /> <br /> It doesn't mean there is nothing enjoyable on the flick. Some of the music is not half bad, and the first of our amazing Scooby gang, which has been conquered, fills a strange and truly sexy dance routine at one point before it becomes disgusting. <br /> <br /> Don't know why I really pulled the end of the flick. Most of the breaks in the movie had a late look, and I began to relieve the displeasure. What a horror movie should do. <br /> <br /> Maybe I can't give myself this movie from below because of some unexplained miracle (I don't mean I have this demon) I was actually a little slipped. <br /> <br /> Don't pay to see it. It's hardly worth your time, but alone hard money. Check it out on YouTube if it's there.
