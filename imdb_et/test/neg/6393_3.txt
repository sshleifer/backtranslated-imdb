Yes, I know the girls are warm and the scenery is beautiful, but someone who knows it is fun. <br /> <br /> If you want accuracy, this is not the movie you rely on. It starts with a flight to SÃ£o Paulo from Rio to 747. It never happens on a 400 km flight. Smaller planes such as 737 or A-320 shuttle passengers between two cities every half hour. Traveling to the airport home, as shown on the map, would reveal a complicated zigzag. Perhaps the producers tried to face tourists on one of the well-known routes of taxi drivers. Not that it would be a local habit, because I myself hung in very serious places like Switzerland. Girls, yes. All topless. This is something that an outsider will never understand. Brazilian chicks are delighted to have 100% of their incredible bodies on Samba school parades, and they wear almost non-existent bikini on the beach but never go topless. A handful of beaches across the country allow this. Everything is carefully separated and out of town. Oh, interior design; amazing wallpaper ... maybe in Disneyworld ... Besides, it's very fun and yes, Demi Moore is absolutely great.
