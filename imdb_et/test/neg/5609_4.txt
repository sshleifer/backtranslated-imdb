Romantic comedy films are definitely the most prolific genre of "average movies" and a source of disappointment for viewers. This is a great example of this and got my "ten worst films". <br /> <br /> History is far from creative and the jokes are weak. I couldn't find any laugh at the whole movie! The characters are ordinary and the power of the actors and just good. History is developing slowly, it is annoying and predictable. The end is also predictable and covered with sugar. <br /> <br /> This is what the movies look in the rain on Saturday afternoon if you have nothing better to look at in my modest opinion.
