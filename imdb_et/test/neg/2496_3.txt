The United States built an atomic bomb to show its higher military strength and end the Second World War. The Fat Man and Little Boy is an effort by American physicists to invent the technology needed to create a bomb, and the tension between scientists and the army about possible uses of the bomb and even its acceptability. its creation. Scientists thought the bomb should be created as a deterrent, a mechanism that would stop the war, wasting as little life as possible. Fist, they saw themselves competing with German scientists trying to build their own nuclear weapons. When the Germans won, many scientists hoped to end the bomb project because they knew that Japan did not have the technology needed to build a nuclear weapon, and therefore it did not pose a threat to great human loss. Those who supported the continuation of the Manhattan project hoped that the bomb would be used as a demonstration, inviting the Japanese Head of State to look at its placement on a small abandoned island. The massive power they felt would be enough to win the war - killing would not be necessary. Under the leadership of General Leslie Grove, the US military hoped to use the bomb as a real weapon to be used against the enemy, first against the Germans and then against Japan. Because of the persistence of Japanese soldiers on the small islands of Japan, the US decided to end the bombing in cities with a population, first Hiroshima and then Nagasaki. The display of this large number of troops signaled to the rest of the world that the US was a dominant military force, a message directed primarily to Russia, whose growing military power and economic weight in Eurasia threatened our upcoming world position. Fat Man and Little Boy were films that had good intentions but mixed them with the choice of actors, script and cinematography. One of the main points of the film was the fight between the killing of the military view of science and the scientific view of science for knowledge. The cornerstone of this conflict is the continuing disagreement with General Groves and Dr. Oppenheimer. Mr. Newman does his job in general, harsh, massive angry and radiates his dependence on the success of the project. In contrast, Dwight Schultz does not resist the general demand at all, always looking at the weak, empty and phlegmatic in his audience. John Cusack presents a stunningly insecure character in the role as I have ever seen - he just seems to read his lines. Laura Dern seems to be under the same illness. No character helps a script that is almost childishly ridiculous as he tries to explain the scientific concepts inexplicably, and offers the most unrealistic relationship with Mr. Cusack and Mrs. Dern, imaginative, do not even give us a cheap excitement by looking at the army's nuclear bombs in Japan and relying heavily on speech-based techniques that are bad at any time, even when explaining real inner thoughts or telling something that can't be shown on film , but it is used here to read some absolutely tricky choices in Cusack's diary. Cinematographer offers us many pictures of the ominous shield of two bombs, which can be amazing if it doesn't look like they were cardboard cutouts instead of bombs, fake atomic burning really looks fake-and why use it when the stock's current footage is so stunning and realistic - and the common brown tone does not seem to be thematically appropriate. Moreover, it is not a bad film.
