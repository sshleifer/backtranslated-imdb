I watched this movie in and out because it started playing about 1 hour ago and I have to say it's an hour of my life and I'm not going back. Action is crap and scripts need a serious picture, and anyone who wrote them must hit, maybe television explodes and puts me out of my misery ..... The only good thing about this movie is that boys and girls have a good eye for it. . Most of what I want would lose special effects on the film like sh * t, Dante? Who thinks that a boy dressed in leather with tight leather trousers and a half leather jacket is scary, he looks more feminine than most women in this movie, Dante's voice is pathetic, no one finds it intimidating or scary. please tv i ask you to blow up !!!!!!!!!!
