<br /> <br /> JURASSIC PARK III * ___ Adventure <br /> <br /> Sam Nell (Dishes), William Macy (Happy Texas, Fargo), TZ (Leon (Family Man) <br /> <br /> A better title would be: ESCAPE ATTENTION TO THE POSSIBLE DYNAMIC ISLAND, but no one should watch this movie, at this stage the rag tag will pay a group of dinosaurs to save the victim of the teen victim accident. Started filming without a finished manuscript explaining why the film has no purpose other than that, Of course, there are some smart scenes and some moderately funny bits, but no significant plot lines to tie them in. JP3 dinosaur dolls and animation are great and great and more than ever before. The movie experience may not hold the original JURASSIC PARK or even the JP2. <br /> <br /> JP3 is gracefully short 90 minutes - in the last 10 minutes. The audience I saw with it was silent from the theater. <br /> <br /> Better Contribution: Watch LEGALLY BLONDE. <br /> <br /> Dave
