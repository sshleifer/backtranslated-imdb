I'm trying to find something of value here. The best thing I can get together is that Truffaut wanted to make the movie tedious, painful, enchanting, annoying, illogical and meaningless as an experience of being in love. If it was his goal, he succeeded, but his exercise solution is really a zipper. <br /> <br /> There is one scene that screams for fraud: Belmondo compares Deneuve's facial features on the terrain. I thought all the time was a "glacier", an "ice wave", "two lonely fishermen who suffered the surplus of the frozen lake army in Minnesota." <br /> <br /> The only other point of interest was the resurrection of the Buffon climate determinism theory. The tropics are presented as paradise and things are getting worse when they are colder, hell is Calvinist French Switzerland. It was funny.
