"Invasion USA" looks like "Apocalypse Now". This can only be recommended for US skinheads, John Birch supporters or militia members. The message is very simple: we shoot them all - hooks, comedies, latinos, anything that is not American. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it has been badly behaved, poorly written, poorly interpreted, incredibly stupid but not fun at all. CIA torturers could use this film as a means of torture. oops, sorry, US torturers can't, because they are good
