As the greatest in Canadian history, saying my first thing: HISTORY KNOWLEDGE IS NOT FULL! How can a manufacturer do this? The deportation of Acadian was not in 1759 when we saw Franklin in London, but in 1755! How can he pass it on in the movie? Londo scenes were also useless. Then the story for anyone reading "Les Anciens Canadians" will have a story there. This is the story of La Coriveau, the "witch". Add a love story and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter. Of course it brought tears to my eyes. But that's it. Then it's the fact that it's probably created in the city of Quebec, but it's mostly in Forteresse de Louisbourg. Of course, this is a historic site and it is the right time, but it was obvious that not all scenes were in the city of Quebec. In general, if you are looking for a New France documentary, go to Candad: A People's History, a true documentary on the history of Canda and NEw France. If you want a story of love that will bring you tears, the story created in the magnificent forest, look at New France.
