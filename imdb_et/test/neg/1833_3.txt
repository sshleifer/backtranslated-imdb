Okay, I had quite a lot of expectations about it. The controversial topic was a good concept. Like a horror fan, I admit I was fascinated and very excited. Let's see. It seems this movie works in 3 modes: happy, sex and dark. The problem is that the film never decides what it wants to be. "Happy" parts that I believe were supposed to match "dark" parts, but it doesn't work. Soundtrack is one reason. There's sex in the most unpleasant and unerotic way. I do not complain, but even with Horror standards, they were unnecessary and stuffed. His friend from Munich is a slut and perhaps one of the most annoying signs I recently met. <br /> <br /> There's a little plot that I won't go into detail ... It's not stupid and in a more talented hand it would be a good movie. There's even a nice twist and cool conspiracy. Don't try to understand everything because there are giant plot times here. And guess it could have been great. I can say to one good thing that is, in the light of the film, today's unethical medical procedures. As genetics and contradictory science progressed, it could have been a great philosophical film that raises and discusses these issues. But you can't find it here, but a series of scenes that are loosely stuck with people and things you don't care about. <br /> <br /> Skip it and go to Flatliners instead, welcome. <br /> <br /> 3/10
