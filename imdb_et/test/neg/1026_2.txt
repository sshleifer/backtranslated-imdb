Although there are very few parcels and whatever exists, it is all improvisational, but it was a good start for a new director who had no previous financial back-up, as well as a smart move from Andy Warhol to make his cemematic productions more marketable and viewer friendly. In any case, this story of the street pedestrian is based too much on Joe Buck's naked show (almost all the time!). And the creative use of fancy editing takes hundreds of times and the interruption of the dialogue becomes half-cumbersome. It would have been much more fun or even more dramatic if they made a documentary about a daily actual prostitute or hustler, rather than letting the participants put their non-censorship plot and dialogue.
