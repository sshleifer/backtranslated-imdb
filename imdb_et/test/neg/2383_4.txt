Correction of the summary: The end does not show Ben's riding for boys. She is looking for Arabic language courses at the Presido Military Academy in San Francisco. Maybe to join Iraq as a war translator (FYI - many dishonest exemptions) Ask D'ont about D'ont have been translators (they are now a major drawback) "Ben also spoke Russian. Good time capsule in Manhattan, but here there is quite a lot of non-reality, mostly good laughing about Lame's social skills and sad picture of "grown up" twenty times that didn't develop over college party ... changing the scene in Manhattan (somehow always staying close to the same BS edge) <br /> > Watch both "New York in English" and "The New Twenty" for Nostalgia, and I think the film "Twenty" shows how far the blur between gay and straight has evolved. <br /> <br /> These two movies are GAY Time Travel For Sure !!!!
