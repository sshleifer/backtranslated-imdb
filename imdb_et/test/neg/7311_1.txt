This movie was bad. I believe Elton (or Mike) Wong celebrated it. Anyway, it was Wong, who didn't have such a funny smile, and looks better. He plays a man who has hit his head and is suffering from brain damage. He recovers and gets revenge. Gordon Liu is the only one to see this movie, but he can't do much. But what he does little seems to be sparse compared to others. The film also has some cheeses that Wong's boy controls. This movie is not worth renting or buying.
