Margaret Mitchell spins in her grave every time someone monitors this confusion! The exquisite costume and kits can't even start with the weak performances of Joanne Whalley (title character) and everlasting Timothy Dalton (like Rhett). Even worse than acting - and perhaps partly explaining it - is a script that is amazingly cliched and predictable. Add the score you have to this hellishly bad script, and you have a disaster that I wouldn't want for any viewer. SCARLETT is just amazing, and I can't imagine how it ever got, much less did this video.
