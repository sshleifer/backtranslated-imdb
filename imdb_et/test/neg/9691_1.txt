This is the most inaccurate and shameful biblical film I've ever failed to watch. I would like to know why anyone on earth could look at it. I'm so surprised that a big name like Jon Voight would agree to act in this shameful waste bin. Many people who have not read the Bible are misleading now, believing that this film was accurate and that its thought really disturbs me. I think the makers have a lot to answer. The worst thing is that I believe that no one can make such obvious mistakes in a biblical film because they can study the Bible for the truth, so I believe that the makers knowingly twisted what the Bible says. and I find it very offensive. There is no word that is strong enough to describe exactly how I feel about it.
