I ordered this movie online because it is very difficult to get the Turkish movies we live in. I have heard so many friends and practically everyone about TV series in Turkey, I was waiting for a breakthrough in the Turkish cinema. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> I and my husband (who is a fan of some film with a bit of Turkish landscape and Turkish dialogues in it) just looked at it because we paid $ 20 for a DVD. Well, it was a boring way to waste it. <br /> <br /> It was confusing, sometimes redundant, while other times were gone. The story was not only confusing, but also adding a gay man who walked with his dog on the beach, and using some toilet humor in the script to make it Hollywood didn't work for me either. <br /> <br /> The American characters were almost too stereotypical that it was neither funny nor realistic and, like the other mentioned user, the Turkish customs and lifestyle were not insignificant. <br /> <br /> Camera movements were not important. Adding some Dervishes (never seen in the Cappadocia) and crushed plates -Greek style - made the movie even more confusing. <br /> <br /> I am ashamed of the film and all the noise the journalist has done about it. Turkish directors are definitely worth watching movies that deserve more attention and respect. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this movie 10.
