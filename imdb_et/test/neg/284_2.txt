SPOILER !! Terrible camera work, terrible writing, missing plot and numerous parcels. Wonderful action! Except Julia Roberts. Who plays badly someone who embodies Julia Roberts. Catherine Zeta Jones is adorable in this film. <br /> <br /> During the movie, we repeatedly increase the number of twelve (!) characters. Twelve are too many, even for a classical like 12 angry man. The problem is that we significantly increase these symbols when they are all in the same room, doing the same thing. <br /> <br /> Yes, Clooney eats. Yes, Pitt eats. Yes, the "Jew" eats. Yeah, geek eats. Yes, eating bodybuilders. Yes, Mr Sensitive eats. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yes Yes. Yep. Phew! It happens in the movie at least three times. Yes, they all sit in cars, bored. Yes, they're all arrested, scared. Yes, they're all driven out of prison, depression. <br /> <br /> But only when I arrived home did I realize how badly they "told me" about it. It's a movie, right? That's what I went to see, right? But when I went in and set my car keys in the swap, I only realized: NOT THIS MOVES ATTENTION! This is correct. This is a movie about them, where nothing is stolen. Oh, they're trying. They're going to try and steal some boring documents from someone, and it turns out it's already stolen. 20 minutes of my life, wasted. Then they try to steal an egg from another museum (YAWN!) And they screw it up and are arrested. <br /> <br /> Then we see how some fabulous French boys stole the egg before we did it, and we get all the joy of "Entrapment", except for the one who is in a tight roof dance fake lasers around ... ugly french man. Um. <br /> <br /> But it turns out he didn't really steal the egg. In fact, our heroes stole an egg, LOOOONG, in another movie that would have been a big movie that would have to be seen if they had made this movie. and the white about how they kidnapped their backpack college student. You heard me ... a bold capri, the ultimate attack - its two and a half hour boring boredom - are they stealing a college student's backpack, creatively battling over baseball teams and disturbing him and replacing the backpack with an identical back side? What ?? <br /> <br /> Ugh. I'll tell you that it was so bad, I didn't even think how bad it was - how badly I robbed - until I got home.
