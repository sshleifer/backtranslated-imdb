One of the worst films ever made ... If you can get this movie without falling asleep, you will do pretty good, given that no matter how hard you call, what you don't know by "participants" (?) and if you can barely see what's going on in a terrible movie (i mean hell if you can't find something that works better ... use the camara of your home movie. /> <br /> My imagination is not how people break this movie and fleeing the video ... and more ... how people don't know how terrible it is ... good god ... (!) <br /> <br /> After what I just said ... If you expect me to give you a summary of this trash from the movie, there's nothing to say ... a group of campers motorcycles disappear in the woods and a number of people terrorize them ... or somthing that ... whats more act movie than horror ... this "movie" "(?) is NO interest ... if someone loves to feel it to me .... <br /> <br /> Absolute trash ... not even one of the cheap funny buttons to rent.
