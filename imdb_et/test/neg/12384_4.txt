Pilot Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees UFO when flying on an airplane, but the radar has nothing to see. Then the planes and ships will disappear and the announcements of UFO increase. It turns out that this is a giant monster bird that attacks and kills. But what is it and why is it here? <br /> <br /> It has all the right elements for the classic. It's actually a fun script - I was never bored. Action is good (a monster movie of the 1950s). Morrow does not exceed the macho hero act and Mara Corday is pretty good as the required female love interest. She is also strong and takes care of herself - although she has been getting food and coffee for everyone at the time of the movie. The problem here is the monster. Dear God - it's sharp! It seems that turkey is expensive! It has a long neck, a funny stupid BEAK, some teeth, a couple of hair layers and claws. And - oh yes - it hits! Not roaring! The actor had no idea what it looked like - it was added after production. The actors Morrow and Corday were scared when they finally saw in the theater. Morrow said the audience was laughing and left the theater quickly before the end of the movie! Sam Katzman was responsible for this. He wanted to save money and gave the world a fool monster. And you can also see the wires moving! It only gets 4 stars because Morrow and Corday are so good and the script is well done. It doesn't give the pathetic monster stars - wait until you see that it attacks what is probably the train of the toy! It's worth checking out if you're a spooky fan to see what must be the stupid monster ever.
