This film is worthless of the value of the kinematic example. It's terrible, you can forget about a plot or good behavior because it's not there. And because of any decent story or ability to act, or even the release of some terrifying scary features, there is usually only one plus for a horror film. Complaint for those who love soft core porn. This movie doesn't even have it. Women show a little skin, but not really more than an Xena show. Except for the main star who is not particularly attractive and has a few poor, and I mean scenes of bad sex. So, briefly, if you like good movies, you don't have any interest in this movie, if you like cheese, you still have no reason to rent this movie if you like erotica and soft core porn, which really isn't the rental of this movie motive and most importantly, if you value your time the least, you can't do better than avoid this movie.
