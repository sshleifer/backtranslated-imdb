Awful, terrible, terrible ... <br /> <br /> I loved the original movie. It was funny, charming and had a heart ... this spam is nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Originally filmed jokes, foolish plots, bad animation, different voices (except Kronk and Yzma) that don't sound like originals (especially Pacha ... * shudder *). <br /> <br /> Characters are off, animation is flat and boring, it's just bad work and why is Kuzco again jerk? I thought he had reformed ... but then, these TV spins are loyal to the original * roller eyes *. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but there's nothing redeemable ... at all. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
