The only good thing that this movie created was that it made me hungry for ice cream, which had been cut off by dead body parts. The film has been seen for the longest time. When "Ice Cream King" dies early, I laughed so hard because the child took the ice cream from him and started eating it. His mother asked him to say something and he should have said, "Leave me alone and let me eat free ice cream so I can see how my acting career falls for a young age." This seems right for the line. Then I wondered why the ice cream prince was behind his ice cream truck. Has anyone kidnapped him from his twenty cents? I've never seen bars in an ice cream truck window. It seemed pretty stupid. You may also forget about the actors because it is just terrible. Forget this movie and go down to the milk king and get the ice cream.
