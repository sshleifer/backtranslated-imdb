This film contains the worst of all times. There is little energy at Spilsbury. Energy is what Clayton Moore gave us. I never felt that movie that Spilsbury was worried about. Revenge, Love, Justice? Not in the depiction of this man. <br /> <br /> There are no chemistry between Tonto and LR. If the plot did not force these friends, you will not get the impression that they want to get together. Plus, the sidekick is a more interesting personality. The dialogue is predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> Talking is amazingly bad and if you are familiar with the Duke of Hazzard, you can watch it. I can't believe the director would agree with it. It offended me as a viewer, explaining the line of every plot I just saw. Hey, at least horses and places looked good, maybe it happens when you hire an operator as your director. br /> <br /> RATING-2 Maybe you can watch it laugh or show an alien that is a bad movie.
