I love B-movies, but I like to know from the beginning that I look at it. I can't believe anyone could be confused about aliens and predators. <br /> <br /> Aliens and Predator are AWESOME. This movie made them a big joke. The creators didn't take this movie at all. I'm very disappointed how Strauss pulls this movie to handle. They made amazing signs. It's like they tried to be serious at first, then their writers got high and gave up. Almost none was constant, the main characters were terrible and were not foreigners or worshipers. I'm so ridiculously sad that nobody takes Alien and Predators seriously. These characters are American pop culture icons, and the creators of this film did not show any respect for the original films. They should not allow money to get into the names of previous films and they should be ashamed
