A woman as rich as she is insecure has been experiencing alcoholism and nervous breakdowns, undoubtedly helping her fluent gigolo spouse deceive her. Of course, no one will believe him if he claims to be a giant man who left the giant satellite. To rejoice in her husband, this may be the case that eventually puts her good. From very open scenes with ridiculous news and ridiculous satellite gatherings, you are probably convinced that the only redemption value of this movie is that it is so bad that it is funny. Although not far from the mark, it is certainly not true. <br /> <br /> Unlike most of the movies in this genre, it's not really a sci-fi or horror movie, but actually a serious drama that intelligently includes a sci-fi scenario on the plot. It is not a good or even a mediocre drama, but it goes beyond your expectations if you did not expect any legal drama at all. Such a low budget effort is surprisingly good to operate and, most importantly, it is well-edited and well-paced. It is never boring and manages to generate more than little interest in seeing what follows. Nonetheless, it is still a film that is strictly designed for those who cannot pass the title of the 1950s movie, as the title "50 Foot Wife Attack"!
