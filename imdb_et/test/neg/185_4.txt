Don't do me wrong. I really love the "arena martial arts genre" and I'm surprised at how many such movies there are. It's one of them, and it's not even one of the best. I thought it would be good with Mathias Hues. He can't record this movie and, frankly, he wasn't very good. Just don't pay attention to what other people say; The scenes in this movie are not good at all. I know what I'm talking about because I've seen so many such films. There are also a number of scenes that have nothing to do with the plot. I think they only added them to make the movie a little longer, plus a bad guy, uuuuuuh ....... bad (as we didn't already know).
