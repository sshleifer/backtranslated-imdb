Truly terrible movie, really low budget, terrible effect, complicated and ugly plot, innumerable reprocessing of vampires mixed with modern science. <br /> <br /> The result is complete confusion without having in most parts with very limited and inexpensive effects. It's not even fun, like several of these low budget independent films <br /> <br /> Waste of time
