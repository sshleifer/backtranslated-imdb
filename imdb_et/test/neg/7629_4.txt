This derivative erotic thriller is mostly traceable, mainly because the viewer is randomly curious as to how it comes out and because the director Peter Hall is able to play a pretty warm (and rather bold) sex. But the final, though unexpected, is unpleasant and the whole drawing (along with childhood traumas and multiple personality disorders) shows that it is unbearably cliched, especially in terms of motivation.
