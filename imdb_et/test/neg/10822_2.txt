Mixed projects of "experts" (researchers, divers and scientists) are located underground miles and go another 2.4 miles beyond the underwater place where they find salamander, giant albino bolts (??) and some large, shaved, winged computers beings that lurk. The cave is sealed and the monsters attack and all die when they look for the exit. And that's all he wrote with this low-target effort that doesn't even combine action, science, and horror at the most basic levels. Imagine giving someone a $ 30 million Sci-Fi Channel to make a monster movie. This is exactly what KAVE is; from time to time, surprisingly full of clichés and almost entirely dependent on special entertainment effects. The only difference is that they have more money to build kits, more money to polish monsters and more money to hire supposedly professional actors who will in any case give terrible performances. Otherwise it is normal. Some of these movies are still fun to watch. This is not and there are many reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1.) It takes itself too seriously and does not feel any sense of humor. So you get a completely unigiginal and predictable movie that doesn't even know how big it is original and predictable. <br /> <br /> 2.) The opening order has no purpose other than killing a few minutes and increasing redundancy. <br /> <br /> 3.) Uneven looking CGI creatures don't impress anyone on that day and age. <br /> <br /> 4.) Using Shakycam and fast editing your horror scene is just a lazy, unimaginable movie. And why further dazzle action, making things too dark and adding tedious distractions like fire and bubble explosion? This makes these scenes not only difficult to see, but also impossible to enjoy even on a non-brainer level. <br /> <br /> 5.) Although it wants you to take it seriously, the script is full of clichés, the dialogue is terrible and there is no experiment in characterization. The assignment of 25-year-old models of models as researchers of brilliant scientists and veterans can offer some eye candy, but it kills completely the credibility of a film that otherwise plays perfectly straight. Sorry, you can't do it in both ways. <br /> <br /> 6.) There were two exceptions to the rule of the model, because they chose the old boys and the average viewer Joe. These were the first two characters that were killed. 7.) For their diversity, they also squeezed the black boy and the Chinese boy. Strangely enough, this film does not give much voice and basically stands in the background when whitey discusses what their next move is. Solvent. 8.) In addition, how many movies should be done when black characters sacrifice their lives to the end just to ensure a hot white woman's lead and a hot white guy that will eventually end? Ugh. Give me a break already. <br /> <br /> 9.) HORRIBLE was a big part of the action. The result of Cole Hauser was completely ridiculous. Another male driver looked like he just went out of the soapbox and traveled with the patented twilight-smile-make-all-ladies-swimming technique, which is a PG-13 gender switch that is equivalent to my big breasts-make-all-the-guys -swoon technique that ladies often use in R-rated movies. In both cases, his performance was fully invoked. Daniel Dae Kim (the "Lost" series) and Piper Perabo also emphasized the space where they were upright and monotonous. <br /> <br /> 10.) Is it the end of fun? Absolutely terrible. Please, God, we don't need to continue this garbage. <br /> <br /> So basically I'm not worried if you have never seen a monster movie before or if you are just very hopeless and the only other thing is "Simple Life". Sets were good, blue tinted photography is OK, and some actors (Lena Headey, Marcel Iures ...) tried their best so I decided to increase the rating to one degree "2".
