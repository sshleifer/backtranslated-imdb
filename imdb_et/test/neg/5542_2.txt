Writer / director Michael Hurst's Sci-Fi Channel sequel to Stan Winston's classic courageous revenge is his moments and some decent gore, but ultimately remains the same as the original. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure filmmakers didn't try to do comedy, but I was trying to laugh at myself. The cause of this accident is the family that has started as a result of a car accident. The families of Hatfield and McCoy live in a city on the dirt road, pickups, drink moonshine, and catch each other. Jodie Hatfield (Amy Manson) and Ricky McCoy (Bradley Taylor) decided to fall in love when they thought they were hateful and happy to live. One night, two loving birds decide to go to the woods for a while, while Ricky's sister plays the viewing tower, but that is the same evening that some Hatfields accidentally kill Ricky's sister and her and Jodie together. You know what happens. Ricky finds his sister's body and decides to visit Haggis so he can make his revenge through the powerful Pumpkinhead. Ye Haw! Harley (Lance Henriksen) has also warned potential exhausted souls about using Pumpkinhead to relieve their pain. What really strikes the story is that Harley had to call Pumpkinhead years before this story, but the device and characters look like dirty pilgrims who somehow traveled over time to bring the truck back to Plymouth. Then there is the sheriff (Rob Freeman), who has his ties with the demon, and looks like he belongs to the 70's revenge movie instead of making a cable. special effects were cool, but Hurst used some terrible 3D shots for some scenes instead of thinking about the human-in-a-suit way of thinking. One particularly embarrassing picture shows that Pumpkinhead jumps from tree branches like a badly modified 3D monkey. The film was extraordinary and did little to improve film quality. The action was quite decent, except for some badly done accents. Family feeling never ends well, especially when the enemy families have to deal with Pumpkinhead. I didn't enjoy this flick every minute, but it was much better than most of the movies that the Sci-Fi Channel hung out. Perhaps this is a sign that the channel is trying to match the quality of its films to the quality of its original series. I don't waste rent coins, but if you get the chance to try it again from the boob tube, I'd say it out. This is a non-killer movie, but it rises just over the trash that makes these DVDs these days.
