This film attempts to succeed Richard Curtis's films, especially "Love Acently" (which I loved), a series of scenes that follow the love life of various couples. This is a great idea that is badly filled. The script tries to be a little too smart and just doesn't resonate. Most of the activities are stylish, reflecting the director more than the actors. <br /> <br /> The version I saw (on the airplane) was named "Scenes from the Park", which is a more suitable title because not all scenes were "sexual". <br /> <br /> I was so waiting for this movie, but in the end it is disappointing. Do not worry.
