There is an increasing trend in the media to condemn and ridicule men. This is seen in TV commercials and program projects. Scammers are a great example of how they could find many female fraudsters, but most of them are men, why? The main threat to the power of any government is the male population, they are less able to exercise authority and are more at risk of physical struggle. The opportunity to reduce the threat is through mediation of men in society. Other examples of psychological propaganda are criminal dramas filled with righteous policemen, including large jaw-aggressive women who accuse everyone who has doubts about their rights and makes these men nervous. In Australia, a number of major male sports events have recently been detained for suspicious attacks and drinking prices, another example of a government that controls the male population by arresting their heroes and affirming domination. Fraudsters, in addition to the political mechanism, are violations of privacy and rights, and most of these women are attacking men! If that were the other, the men would be in prison! If it were fair to show, they would find female fraudsters because they would not usually be detained because they love a man in an accident and can't escape without a boat swinging. Men's mistresses want men to get themselves and want men to own and manage and get men anyway.
