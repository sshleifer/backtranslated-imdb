I happened to hang up on the TV and wanted to watch it because I remembered Spin magazine's article on which the film is based. I was very disappointed. First, if James Belushi is the film's leading actor, it should be a sign that it is not exactly the production of the A list. Gregory Hines was a world-class dancer, but unfortunately not a big actor. <br /> <br /> In fact, everything in this movie is either flat or hammy, which can only be blamed on the director who is the weakest link in this movie. Charles Carner tried to tempt Oliver Stone's "JFK" when he depicted an alleged conspiracy to cover the "real" murderers of children, but without a good script, from the A list, or to be said talent. It just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that such a worthy film did not get better treatment for the film.
