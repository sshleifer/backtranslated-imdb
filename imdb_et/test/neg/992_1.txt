Saturday matinees in my hometown. I went with an older friend (he was about 12) and my mom promised me to go because he thought the film would be OK (it's rated G). I was attacked by loud music, STRANGE images, no plot and stubborn refusal to make any sense. We left halfway because we were bored, disappointed, and our ears hurt. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a reborn theater 22 years later. My opinion had changed - it's even WORK! Basically everything I hated was still there and the movie was VERY 60s ... and is dated from time to time. I have all the little jokes ... too bad that they weren't funny. The constant change in tone quickly became annoying and there is nothing firmly grasped. Some people love it. I found it frustrating ... at the end of the movie, I felt like I had to throw something hard on the screen. <br /> <br /> Also all Monkees songs in SUCK (and I like them). <br /> <br /> Only for former hippies ... or if you're stoned. I'll give it 1.
