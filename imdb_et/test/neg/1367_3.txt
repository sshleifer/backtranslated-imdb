"Satan's Brotherhood" is a confusing combination of elements of conventional horror mixed with some imaginative characterization and direction (Bernard McEveety). It all starts with father Charles Bateman (like Ben), who rides west with his beautiful blondes: lush Ahna Capri (like Nicky) and daughter Geri Reischl (like K.T.). Things become more complicated and strange for the trio as they approach the city of Hillsboro, which is covered by the Satanic cult! <br /> <br /> When good travelers hit Hillsboro, "action" turns into a more interesting collection of towns: townies L.Q. Jones (like Pete, Sheriff), Strother Martin (like Doc), Charles Robinson (Jack, Priest) and Alvy Moore (like Tobey). Their communication is sometimes fun. Soon, it's all going to be very stupid and predictable. Mr. Martin is stand-out (as you think); he believes that the possibility of Satan's culture is a "cock-bull's story", but is (of course) their leader. "Come on, kids" ends up being puzzling; unless it was the original title of the film.
