I saw this movie last night, from reality style programs that are currently in a round, satire. <br /> <br /> What can I say? I hated it completely. About as interesting as color drying and maybe one or two just a little amusing. <br /> <br /> Maybe he had something to do with not being a fan of Survivor and Big Brother-type displays, but if it had been a video / DVD or if I had been watching the movie myself I would definitely have more than the first 5 minutes. <br /> <br />
