I'm surprised at the enthusiastic response to this film. I felt bored as I enjoyed looking at Penelope Cruz, and the plot details were often poorly developed. It also seemed to be an intense sexist film: if the sexes were reversed, almost everyone with any idea would be grieving, the film's intensity was very uncertain. This does not only mean that both major men represent a complete twitching and sexual predator, but also that women are portrayed as virtually flawless, forming a utopian community without any conflict and based on relentless generosity and good humor. Utopia is notorious and it is no exception. But it is also interesting to note what happens (and here comes the plot donation, although it refers very early) when a teenage daughter kills her father. (1) His mother rushes for responsibility, and (2) the daughter seems to have almost no regret (and her emotional life disappears from the film). This is not a very commendable killing, although the bleeding of an Aldomovar camera bleeding, as if it were an attractive painting, and then it is infiltrated and inconspicuous without the daughter or mother, neither materially nor emotionally. Later, the film reveals the killing of another woman's wife, and again, it is the killing that the film indirectly supports. In short, Volver is an ideologically driven film that has an unpleasant and actually reluctant ideology, and so I write ideological criticism. But besides that, it's just not very interesting. It has no depth, such as talking to Aldomovar about what I loved.
