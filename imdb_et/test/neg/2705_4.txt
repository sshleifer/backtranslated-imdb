I like Errol Flynn; I like life stories and I like movies. It contained all three of them .... but I didn't like this movie. It just went too long, though the last 20 minutes were great, especially in photography, where there are some great low-angle images. However, it seemed to me that it took six hours to get to it, and I really can't say why I feel that way. <br /> <br /> Action is interesting, Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland are good. In fact, it was refreshing to see that de Havilland actually supported Flynn instead of playing her as a normal antagonist. There is still something missing from this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has been critically criticized for historical inaccuracy, but I do not hear the same criticism of many other films. In fact, it is RARE when the film is historically accurate. For some reason, this revolutionary history was criticized by most critics. If the film had made Custer much worse than it really was, they would probably have liked it. Too bad. Critics prefer their heroes to heroes in a choppy way. <br /> <br /> I really wish I could have enjoyed it more, but I take many other Flynn adventures over it.
