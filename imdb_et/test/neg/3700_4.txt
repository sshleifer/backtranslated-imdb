"Haaaarrrryyy!" <br /> <br /> A mighty, unpleasant female voice could have been in the heat of Leona Helmseley, but no, it belongs to Allison Hayes as Nancy Archer, headed for a 50-foot woman. In his most notorious role in his film career, Allison's performance literally attacks the roof. In fact, do this on a couple of roofs. <br /> <br /> Jaak-droppingly sticky, "Aot50FW" is the story of Nancy, the neurotic, cozy heirs, and his love of Lothario's husband Harry (William Hudson, who is with The Amazing Colossal Man). Nancy has a third kind of close-up place in the desert, where there is a bald giant in space, wearing a mini-skirt and gladiator sandals and having something of Nancy jewelry. What he does to him when he has taken him is probably the best mystery, but soon Nancy will grow. The giant giant is leading the low rental cabin where Harry laughs at Honey (Yvette Vickers). The confrontation becomes ugly. <br /> <br /> Poverty line f / x makes alien giant and Nancy opaque due to incompetent images taken over. You understand why director Nathan Juran changed his name to Nathan Hertz for credit. Juran was not stranger to the leadership of giant creatures, humans and not, having led the "The Deadly Mantis", "Sinbad's 7th Trip", "Jack, the Giant Killer" and several TVs "Giants World" and "Land Giants." <Br /> <br /> Lots of laughs for all the wrong reasons.
