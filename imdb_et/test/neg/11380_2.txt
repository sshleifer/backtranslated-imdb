First of all, I personally adore Demons and Demons 2, I saw them, although it was hard to find good horrors without sharing a good official movie here in Russia when I was a kid, and that is the unchanging part of my boyhood. Then I didn't hear anything about Mr. Bava. Then I saw her Ghost Son. Well, this is definitely not a good adventure! Why was the leading character we never knew at least in the midst of an empty road? Why do African servants say so stupid and stupid things to people's souls? Why is the plot so primitive? Have we not seen enough spirit for 100 years of film production? It is clear that Lamberto Baval has nothing to show so far. Damage.
