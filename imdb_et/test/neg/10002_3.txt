Not even the Beatles could write songs that everyone liked, and although Walter Hill is not a mop-top, he is not in second position when he thinks to provoke action films. The nineties came and the social platforms changed in music and in the movie, the rapper's reversal of the film star was in full swing, acting as a back seat for every man's powerful regional accent and transparent action. It was one of the many ice-films I saw as a child and loved to watch and eat later. Bill Paxton and William Sadler are firefighters who have the basic elements until the tenant of the burning building, who plans to go to the flames, has a gold-related card. I'll give it to Walter quickly and properly to determine the main characters and location. But I blame everyone who participated in turning off Lame-o's performances. The ice and the cube must be red at this time, and although I have enjoyed both career rappers, I think they fell in this movie. This is a ninety-minute-old man, who ridiculously turns his boy to another point on a point that is closed to many unbelievable situations. Now this movie, it's not a documentary, so I'm not wasting my time, describing all that stupid plot that has been twisted in this movie, but there was a lot and they didn't go anywhere. I had the feeling of looking at everything being confused and just playing things out of the cuff. I have two more things I still like, one is related to the needle scene and the other is Sadler's huge 45 pistol. Bottom Line This movie is like a domino pizza. Yeah sick to eat when I'm hungry and I don't feel like cooking, but I know it tastes like crap. 3 stars, meh.
