After sitting and watching this movie, I can only wonder the reasons behind the movie. It was undoubtedly one of the worst films I've ever seen and had no redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> If it were to be funny, it could have been a very weak comedy, but the action, the thriller, was terrible. <br /> <br /> Slow, lack of plot, real action, some good approaching dialogue, and I don't know what characters. What else to say. Avoid.
