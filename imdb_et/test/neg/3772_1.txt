This film is an incredibly self-conscious character, which assumes that the story alone is as good as the actual story. It was completely painful to look and if I hadn't bought a DVD because of John Travolta and a positive buzz, I wouldn't have seen it. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing interesting to say. and it seems to be based on profound (and frankly, hard-handed) characterization. There is one alternative scene between Purslane and Bobby Long, where the television that is being played is destroyed is incredibly insecure and badly timed. I watched it. It was probably a lot of fun, filmmaking. But it's just a terrible look. A pleasant and pretentious film school project that you should not waste money.
