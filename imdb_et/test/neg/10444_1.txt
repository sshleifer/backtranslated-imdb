this is one of the worst movies. Hai is boring and it's just this great slow computer created by the silly thing. Antonio Sabato is terrible, I mean even worse than usual. How does this guy work? Leadership is the worst and nothing in the movies is redeemable. I love shark movies and it just destroys. I've seen this studio movies before and everything they do is under your star, doing a bad job. I see an unknown actor who cares about making a good story.
