This film started well enough, sticking to the mood of the book quite well, even if the actor was not the upper limit. The soundtrack was embarrassingly bad. Saxophone and Electric Guitars? It was uncertain. Female singer was positively harsh! In the second half of the film, the story becomes much darker. It's too dark for Austen. The Norther's monastery is in a dark and scary place, while the book was disappointing and modernized into Catherine's eyes. <br /> <br /> Who is this martial line with strange makeup and wig? Completely remote and unnecessary character. One of the main elements in the book is general, not a Gothic monster, like the characters of Catherine's books. His fear is much more complicated because of the oppression of his children's spirits and his treatment of Catherine because of monetary problems. She does not lock her wife or kill her, but she sends Miss Morland alone 70 miles away for paid employment that doesn't have enough money to pay for her home. Only her friend Miss Tilney's way of thinking out of the door when issuing money to her would not leave her. This whole point becomes seriously confused in the film. They make the general darkness from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Peter Firth shouldn't have been singing! This part was painful to look at. His depiction of Tilney was not too bad, but it was darker at times. Henry Tilney from this book made Miss Morland's imagination on a trip to Northanger, but she was never in the dark. Firth would have got a better direction. Noah's lady who played Isabella needed a better actor. John Thorpe was appropriately disgusting. The striped vest and the combo he wore was strange! It certainly fits his character. <br /> <br /> I think the film would have been much better than a completely different soundtrack. It put an all-over ball under the movie. When I look at it again, it's sound OFF and subtitles. Maybe I'd give movie 4 then. <br /> <br /> The quality of the DVD sound was quite poor. The picture quality was not much better. This is amazingly noticeable on digital TV. <br /> <br /> When I think what this film might have been, I mean conviction with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.
