When I saw the Comeback trailer for the first time, it seemed terrible and I had no interest in seeing it, but when I appeared on DVD today, I thought nothing was caught with my interest, I rented it and gave it a shot. I watched this tone and it wasn't that bad. I think it was immature and stupid at times, but there were some funny moments that made me laugh. I don't watch a lot of sports movies, so I don't know if I saw more, maybe this film would be more meaningful to me, but that's all good, I still haven't looked so much at Comeback. I admit that these "fools" attacks are sheep, but what is silly at any time? Comebacks aren't really as bad as giving you a fair chance. <br /> <br /> Trainer fields are not alive in life, family, and careers, but when he gets the chance to bring his career back when he can relax in a football team for the championship. But the team is really terrible, as well as terrible. But with little work and teamwork, they try to give their all, even though it may become more sad. <br /> <br /> Comebacks over everyone is not the worst film I've ever seen. I think it's good for a couple to laugh and strangle. I know it was stupid, but I couldn't laugh when the coach was in the middle of a struggle in the dressing room, and he beat the rope against the shelf, just he and the nerd were so funny together. If you have an open mind and don't take this movie too seriously, I think you have a fun time watching it, if you look at it as Oscar-worthy material, it's not a movie for you. <Br /> <br /> 4/10
