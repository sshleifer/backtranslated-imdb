I think I should now comment on the fourth picture in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN franchise; descendants and deliberate _absurdisms are surprised or amazed at me. They make up or create a fourth road, not a classic, not a revolutionary, rather than a European, but a disruptive relative of the absurd trash in the Americana, which is a violent 70's film. This contribution is also bombastic and unexpectedly inconvenient and even somewhat strange. but the fans simply do not feel any difference between the style of the original and the after-effects. "<br /> <br /> These sequels are not boring or uncomfortable, but weird. Of course, they are very badly written? Dirty scripts, garbage lines. It's just crazy; In this contribution, every gunman gets several women? Van Cleef's young wife asks her to release a young prisoner; he will end up. The young man continues his life, lets Van Cleef, kidnaps, rapes and kills her, then joins wrong. Van Cleef, who has previously refused to defend the village, now assembles a small cluster and institutes an action against the offender; then the criminals blame the village where Van Cleef has set. <br /> <br /> I liked the cast. <br /> <br /> Van Cleef is Chris; Stefanie Powers, pretty active in the 70's screw cities, is expensive for Van Cleef. Callan, who is very reluctant, is Noah, a writer and a Chris' sidekick. The rest of the aggressive bunch is Askew (one of three survivors), Armendariz, Lucking, Lauter; Rita Rogers is a truly hot and plump beauty.
