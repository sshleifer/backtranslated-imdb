First of all, the genre of this movie is not comedy, it's rather a drama. <br /> <br /> I had little expectations of the film and they still didn't come out. As some other reviews suggest, the movie has nice music. But if you want to listen to good music, I recommend spending some time watching the recording of Bon Jovi or MÃ¶tley Crue, which is more of a quality time. <br /> <br /> Last, if you want to watch a good movie in this rock'n'roll genre, I recommend "Almost Famous".
