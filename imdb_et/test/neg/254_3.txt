normal disclaimer - I don't give a 1-star rating to movies that are harmless, bad, low budget, and silly, even though they deserve it. These films are often funny and are estimated to be 2-4, based on entertaining value - not as a representation of their exemplary film work. This film is perfect for this model. This is a Mexican monster film that has been talked about with storytelling and extremely weak non-special effects. Makeup is not so bad and acting is sometimes quite fun, but this movie is almost as stupid as foreigners vs. Predator and the script is not so slippery (Aliens vs Predator can get me one, but I want to see it again before I commit) . <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous but delicious. If you have read this far, you really need to know ... Mainly the characters make up remarkably unscientific scientists. Most of them are heroes - sort of - but one is (of course) crazy and quite perverse. This crazy scientist discovers a robot with a ridiculous core (who looks like an Ozz wizard, but a man's face is inexplicably inside that head). A stepmother who was discovered by the same "scientist" whose woman just happens to have been the princess of the last lifetime Aztec (not asking) is a little "climax" for the robot. makes the most stoic filmmaker laugh on the floor. <br /> <br /> Because of its value, given the budget and the complete stupidity of the script, this is a very fun and low budget monster movie monster. If you are into this thing, go to it.
