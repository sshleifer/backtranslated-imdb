The main problem with the ninth company (9 Rota) is that it is not sure if he wants to be Ryan or Full Metal Jacket. The experiments of sentimentality by Spielberg are embarrassing, such as the burley sergeant, who is crying on the red flower fields !!! The training sequences given by Kubrick for the masterpiece are neither intense nor realistic. Here they attack almost a strong Russian language, uncovered cover. I'm sure tactics have moved on from Waterloo. <br /> <br /> The scene of each of these films has been seen in other war films and made much better. <br /> <br /> Do I have to ask why all the talented soldiers have to chew during the game? <br /> <br /> Finally, I am always suspicious of a movie that starts without narration to qualify for the end. <br /> <br /> "We won!" ... errrr ....... you don't.
