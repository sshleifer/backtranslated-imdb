There were so many reasons why this film might have been great. I'll give you three. <br /> <br /> 1. Sienna Guillory. He's extremely hot in this movie and that's why I decided to watch it for the first time. <br /> <br /> 2. Tim Curry. Amazing bad guy and I'm always excited to see him in movies (even at home Alone 2). <br /> <br /> 3. Jason Donovan. For all Aussies and Poms out there, it's a rare treat. The former neighbors of the 80's are heartbeats that are dressed for selling drugs. <br /> <br /> But none of these things, or the fact that the film is about drug / rave culture, could even make this movie interesting. The script was boring, normal appearances, and despite the scenes of S and Scene Sienna, I found all the passports for this movie. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
