It was so bad, I want God to give me two more hours of life that had to sit through it. <br /> <br /> First of all, it was a bad one. There was hardly a plot where "Shaggy dog ​​story boy raincoat and skeleton mask instead of dog" counts. <br /> <br /> Editing was all over, and slow mo "Gore" shots (a red corn syrup flying through the air - no doubt a spoon), irritation after the tenth time and rage after a century. <br /> <br /> I like Michael Rooker. He has done a good job. It wasn't good. It was less than good. And with that I mean it sucks. Hard. <br /> <br /> God doesn't watch this movie.
