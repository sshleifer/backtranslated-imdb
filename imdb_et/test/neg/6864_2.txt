This film was a waste of cellulose on which it was printed. This is a catastrophic scene that is very similar to a striking attack. <br /> <br /> Watching it is like explaining the meaning of life. The main point of the plot is that the party played by Steve Guttenberg is a party animal that shouldn't play because it would violate his condition. The children he interacts with friends refuse to play him as a coach for a while because he plays. But ... a few minutes later, after winning the championship, a big amount of money will be saved. And where did they get the money? GAMBLING !!! Add this to the terrible scenes of funeral life (why exactly the bedrooms are in the funeral home?) And the useless peripheral character
