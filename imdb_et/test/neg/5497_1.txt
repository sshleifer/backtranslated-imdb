The film that this stupid should ever see in daylight. Action is flat, violence is just over the place, the sliding end is just stupid. <br /> <br /> It's all a lawyer who saw R.I.C.O. team. No one has ever seen him, not even hit by the men themselves. So she and the beautiful lady have tried to find it in R.I.C.C.O. then before finding the movie. <br /> <br /> Then the film goes to a novel, a weapon and a voodoo. Now, how the hell voodoo came here. Never see this movie if your life depends on it. Trust me!!!!!!!!
