I wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't. It might have been really cool, hip-hip version of the hip show, but that was where it broke down. It was too clean, too cool. First, all the cool lines and scenes on the preview trailers were presented, which I saw many times. And the editing was very different, so the scenes didn't look like and they all seemed inappropriate. Claire Danes, whom I love as an actor, was unable to make it a breakthrough for the roles played by high school. The only bright spot was Giovanni Ribisi as Pete. Its a little stupid, but in fact the smart style was funny and refreshing. In general, I would rather look at previews instead of watching a movie, and I want more.
