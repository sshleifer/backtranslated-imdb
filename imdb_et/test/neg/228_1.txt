The first few minutes that show that Willis is cold and harsh were quite enjoyable, especially with Jean Smart, but it was really dense. It's just a hackneyed big man and a little irritating guy to get things back without innovation at all. I know that casting apparently chose this child to show that Willis was as irritating in his younger age, but I found this child especially irritating and fascinating.
