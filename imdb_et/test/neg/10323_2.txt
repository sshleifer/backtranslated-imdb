Wait until you have watched most of the other released films, wait a year, then see if you are willing to value something with such low productivity that doesn't put anyone into imagination. <br /> <br /> I agree that anyone who produces this movie as a ten-star movie must give the data a falsehood. Anything over 8 would be strange. <br /> <br /> Well, to see a very young Sandy Bullock in her poofy hair for a short while she had emerged, though she exceeded New York's accent, but at other times in her south (Virginia & NC) stressed. In the old history for the accomplished actor who has grown so much after this film. <br /> <br /> The DVD I rented had two bonus features, a mini-bio part that was only Sandra's biologically taken from IMDb. There was also a bonus trivia quiz - 3 questions. I hope you get them all right!
