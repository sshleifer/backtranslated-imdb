In some ways, this film does not compare to the novel. However, it was good to see the visual vision of what Congo saw and the natives, if you don't see when you see when you see. I never recommend reading a movie, not reading a book. I can't even talk about watching this movie, not to mention the other of this literary work. This movie; and many others did not fill this book. One important part of the film that is missing is that of MArlow's sense of how African poor government formed an early genocide. Also in the film, MArlow and his companions did not stop to get the sign and the wood. Similarly, Kurtz's African mistress knocks the end of Marlow's story with a story that was not in the book. Kurtz died on the ship, but he died in a movie house. The fianc√©'s reaction to the interpretation of Marlow's Kurtz's last words was also different. This movie is only effective if you want to visualize the novel more clearly.
