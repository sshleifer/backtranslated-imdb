**** SPOILER ALERT **** My boyfriend, some friends and I rented this movie as part of a really bad marathon. We knew what we got into. But the lack of plot, direction and special effects left us in the hope of a great (or satisfactory) fight between the two main characters ... a badly melted swimmer and a super violent giant Komodo (who ate people like a snowball ice) ... we can get it finally yet, but was it due to budget or time constraints? Its one redeems the quality so ridiculously bad, with many important details that other readers point to. I recommend this movie when you start to cut onions to cry.
