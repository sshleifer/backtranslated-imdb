Since I have to write at least 10 lines, and this garbage deserves not only one, I start with the following: 1. I voted for this terrible "movie". <br /> <br /> 2. Let me explain why these turkeys David Varod mainly produces in my beautiful homeland, Bulgaria (just for BTW, for illiterate people - this country is located in Europe, located north of Greece and has absolutely no to do with Mexico and Uruguay) A few years ago, NU Image has invaded our country and started mostly direct videos. Why here? Because here they pay the Bulgarian team and Bulgarian actors (most of them outstanding) a low fee that is in many ways better than most American colleagues. Personally, I am ashamed of this fact. The reason is, of course, the greed of the Americans involved and their desire to get the most, if not all, profits. In fact, it would not be so bad if only production was not so dirty and pale. It hasn't been a good picture for years. Currently, the NU image is being challenged for the very questionable purchase of the national cinema production center, Boyana Films. There is no doubt that corruption has taken place, there has been fraud, this recent purchase has been wrong. Bulgarian cinema is dead. Long live the cinema in Bulgaria!
