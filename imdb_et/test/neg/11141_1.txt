It is an absolute friction designed to shock and tune the 60's mindset. The action is entirely of wood, mainly composed of ad-libbing, which results in the sub-standard participants moving for the first time they think repeatedly. The end result is a poorly written game that is read by people who have no idea and who could not take care of it. One exception to this is the "Joe" flag (played by Joe Dallesandro) who spends a lot of movie with naked stupor (either stoned or the only one who works!) Please don't think I can't "Warhol" - it's a clear and simple Stinker that doesn't should never have taken it out of the film class.
