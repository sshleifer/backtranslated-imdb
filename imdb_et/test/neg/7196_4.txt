It is the core, it is quite typical revenge of the western, heavy spaghetti, and if you follow it as such, the protagonist will be through to successfully win the main villain. However, there is so much that does not affect the story you need to think about what the filmmakers thought. I refer to things like Miss Rosie's song number just pops up somewhere and a boxing game in the middle of the city. OK, they have an open connection with the influence of Mash Flanagan, but why he suddenly turns to a pseudonym - Mr Donovan. <br /> <br /> On the flip side, I thought it was quite innovative, as someone who has the actual ball on the shoulder was able to shoot the picture shown on the wounded Wallach view trajectory. And wasn't it great how the Donovan girl uses the old headache routine when she's a little terrible? Don't let me forget if the gravel bad guys like Wallach guns them as part of the finale. <br /> <br /> However, there was another thing that was ignored, and I was waiting for the whole movie. What happened to the trophy of the closet that Flanagan / Donovan recruits at the beginning of the picture? You know, Mr. Martel, the funeral shop wanted the power of his weapon, the fucking Mitchell, and the Lincoln Tate. Each had five thousand dollars on his head, and they had to protect Donovan from the man who survived the massacre of the opening. They never heard them again! I like to think that perhaps Donovan just had to kill them and keep 15K for himself.
