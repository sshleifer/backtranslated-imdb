I've been a fan of Jim Henson and his characters since the beginning. The most exciting of them was love and innocence and friendship. Kermit was a model for deep thinking and problem solving. Spiritual nature, but sweetly and credibly so. All other characters were somewhat eccentric, but showed how different creatures can co-exist together carefully, respecting each other's differences. <br /> <br /> The following movies are somewhat the same. But this "this very cheerful Christmas premiere" would be Jim Henson turning his grave. These characters are completely rewritten to be horny, nasty, selfish and cheesy. <br /> <br /> It is forbidden to portray God as the head of the company, the average. The angels as spineless, non-spiritual corporate workers and the film were so bad that I had to look. I had bought it for my great nephew, but fortunately I looked at something I give to my child. <br /> <br /> This movie instead served as a trash and has no socially redeeming content or charm. <br /> <br /> Shame, shame on people who re-wrote characters and left Jim Henson's original heart-conscious, socially conscious version. It makes a terrible service for a big cordial person who is no longer protecting his creation.
