The disappointing thoughts of the film really did look forward to the pretty cool cat and mouse stuff that goes through the film and has little of these cat and mouse materials, but it was just pretty stupid. And that basically showed all the good scenes in the trailer, in fact, if you saw it with a trailer, you basically saw the whole movie because it's just predictable. Basically, there are some armored truck company employees on the plot who are trying to steal $ 42 million they need for transport until one of the members grows into conscience. I thought this film would be better known as well-known actors, but I was wrong. I mean, this is not necessarily a bad movie, but it wasn't that good or deep. This is definitely the best rental, just not worth it in theaters. of them <br /> <br /> 4.8 / 10
