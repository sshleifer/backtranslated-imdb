This is absolutely terrible. It's everywhere and there's no point anywhere. I've never understood what is good about Jeff Garlin or Sarah Silverman. Bonnie Hunt is such a generation that she would have been personal friends who are involved because there is no chance she would have read that part of the so-called script and thought, "Yes, I want to do it!" Most movies find at least one or two things that are redeemable or funny. Here's ZERO. It's very stupid. There is really no other word to describe it. This is probably the biggest waste of money in making a movie I've seen for a long time. Skip it at all costs, you're happy you did.
