Yes, it is the right people, it is undoubtedly the worst in television history. If you want to watch the sad, lonely and ununny cage comedian attempt to amuse the masses for half an hour of pale and tired social ramblings that your slightly slowed cousin commented on Thanksgiving dinner table then this may be a show for you. It's a bill like my friends, but to be honest, Tim Allen makes Richard Pryor. Avoid at all costs. If you're not a masochist.
