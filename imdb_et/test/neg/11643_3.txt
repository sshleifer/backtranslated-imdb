The best thing about this flick is that they seem to have used a lot of legacy over Pearl Harbor's Tora Tora Torah attack. My favorite was a P-40 frame that fell on a parked P-40 line, but was filmed at the top of the hangar or crane. Unfortunately, it gets worse from there. <br /> <br /> There are two black men and two white men who are American military, as well as some Filipinos and Japanese guards. The American Americans ranked a White Navy Lieutenant, of course in the Navy O-3. In any case, he needs bad, disturbingly bad discounts. Hockey hair is not part of World War II movie. Oh, and he's racist. He does not want to divide the quarters into "negros". Of course, he didn't want to share a quarter in a real life with a white boy. I think the Geneva Convention has a clause on officials and it is involved, but it was not here. Well, I think the plot is of secondary importance to other problems with this flick. He gets in position and goes into a lot more than the prospects and the operation of the diver's air pump. <br /> <br /> But if you're going, it's not a bad story. The bellows want the divers to raise the silver cast by the Americans before Corrigador falls. The resistance of Filipino wants them to take time. And the violence is doing its best to help. I think this is a potentially good story and not what is badly done. It is a little incredible when the military is using the camp to swim the dinners every day between the camp and the village of Filipino. Maybe I'm not as selective as I know it's not an attack film. I think that's why it comes in a 20-pack of 20 DVD war movies. It's at least a mess. Operation was not so bad. Probably better than I did. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of football, I found at least that Jim Brown is a real person and not someone Richard Pryor. That in itself was worth 25 Â¢ for this movie. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at TCM or paying a quarter. <br /> <br /> One star for a war movie, another one for WWII and another one because I feel generous.
