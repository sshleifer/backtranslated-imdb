First of all, if you want to make a good movie, don't waste your entire exposure in the last 10 minutes. It is assumed that the viewer is almost two hours of confusion, only that Margo's father would explain to Alex in the film very late. Worse still, the scriptwriter decided that it was not enough to solve the basic mystery, but added a completely unnecessary murder that we knew nothing about (involving Alex's father!). <br /> <br /> Also motivational issues with characters. Margo's father's choices do not seem to be reasonable when the film is over. Why didn't he just kill Philippe's father and do it? Instead, a complicated plot has been made to conceal the truth, but what ensures that everyone is physically at risk for years (including a completely innocent photographer who gets murdered by Philippe's father criminals). Although Alex is a physician (who thinks it is relatively brilliant), he decides to escape from the police, during which he not only endangers his life, but also those whom he involves on the highway from pesky piles. Why did Margo's friend be so eager to Margo for keeping his promise when everyone beat Alex's fan? And do we have to think that Margo's father would kill himself rather than go to prison? But his wife? Did he keep his wishes? These are some of the main problems. <br /> <br /> Then there are some nasty details, like: why was his father there with his fake death that night? How did he get the junkie body in a short notice and got it back quickly to bury it to the other two? Alex's friend Bruno seems too eager to be part of the chaos he and his friends have to kill Alex, despite the perceived debt he owes Alex to save his son's life. What would be Margo's photos? They don't affect Philippe at all. And why would Margo be a safe key chain this night for his kidnappers to take? Did I miss some other things? Probably. My little excitement is that while Alex is a doctor, he smokes like a chip. This makes her marathon police even more impressive. Even when he travels with his lawyer in a convertible, neither of them has a seat belt. How bright could they be?
