The box in this movie contains the wrong one. The cover shows a short skirt with legs and panties. The title is "Tart." On the back of the box, the cat, the main character, seemed to be called, who became one of the popular pupils, but this popularity leads to a strange lifestyle that he could not escape. Everything that the box built on this movie was a terrible lie. I was expecting a kind of "Heathers", which is aimed at today's teenagers, a sort of dirty, direct-video version. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you what Tart really touched. Yes, it is really a plot; so if you don't want to know what happens, stop reading. We have one unlikable, boring rich girl. This unlikely girl is the best friend. Skank goes out of school, so an unlikely girl interacts with some British girls. This leads to an unlikely girl who introduces this boring man who refers to the box as "the most popular boy in school." If this boy was the most popular man in their school, I'd like to have gone to that high school because I could have been out of him. Anyway, as every movie tells you, the most popular boy in school is always a murderer or a drug addict or a thief, or in this case all of the above. Anyway, everyone is unlikely to be the main character because he is a Jew. Then, at school, the most popular boy wins his best friend, skanki, dead for a stone because skank was caught in a homosexual act by the most popular boy. Ultimately, she is unlikely to be a girl's stoic mother and younger brother of hypochondria. Oh, and the whole movie is also rich in dirty children and their terrible parents. Is that wrong? It sounds like a fantastic movie! Well, I thought. But you see that there are no pleasant characters in this movie. The main character is boring. The filmmakers did their average, but during the film he continues what he is. Skank is not enough and he has little time. A popular boy has nothing to write home. Popular girls are just your minted rich girls. There are no moral lessons. A cat who is a dull main character, not a freak, has never become a really popular girl and (worst) after she's all gone. Dorky girl. Frankly, I have no idea why the film is called Tart. I asked who is the cake? Is he tart? Are they all cakes? After 94 minutes, this is not a long film. But after watching this terrible waste of VHS tape and not knowing who was sour, I was surprised that the movie was only one and a half hours. The film felt it was two hours and a little change. After some time, I hoped the movie would be pop-cake. At least when you look at the pop cake box, you know what to expect.
