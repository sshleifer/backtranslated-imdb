Man, is it sad. It does not deserve much commentary because it is short, Rebecca DeMornay is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who falls to the Latin Lover Antonio Banderas in a wine shop, she is a ponytail and a prison house. When he cuts off, he really relaxes. Other than the rushing thing he has (and we have to admit that it's a breakthrough), he's a pretty cold fish. He broke, his sick father first appears for years and he gets him out. He is also adept at keeping his horny upper neighbor (Dennis Miller) on the bay. And there is a prisoner Harry Dean Stanton trying to maneuver him to give him a diagnosis of several personality disorders, so he doesn't have his private wall against the serum murder he has committed. and maybe more suspected as soon as something strange happens to him. Someone sends her dead flowers. Someone makes inexplicable things for his pet cat. (Next time, when I see a household pet, put it in a pack or put it in a cupboard or boil in a pot, I'm going to have a makeup.) So who does it? Think. No force can be forced on the earth to uncover the end, but perhaps the hint will help: abuse of childhood. <br /> <br /> An abuse abuse is an interesting business itself, much more interesting than a movie. What does "child abuse" mean? Do we think about sexual abuse? Physical? Both? How about a child with a wooden baking channel that is heavy enough to break it? It happened to me and my brother when we were children, just as similar things happened to other neighbors. Sexual Abuse? It didn't happen to any of us, as far as I know, although I'm not sure it was somehow rejected by animation. In the Samoan village, where I was studying for two years, there was one case where a teenage boy found sex with a much younger girl. The girls' family beat him in hell. The boy's own family sent him to live with another family in another village, exile, lasting two years. By the time he returned, everyone, including the child, forgot about it. (By the way, the little girl we see here is under five, so it's unlikely she'll remember her father's nightly visits anyway, because long-term memory hasn't really been created before that time.) DeMornay's experience leads her mental disorders to be called trauma social construction. That's not where we don't. Enough psychiatric lecture. That's fifteen cents. <br /> <br /> You want trauma? I'll give you trauma. The film forces us to identify Rebecca DeMornay from the very beginning. When he has the first trial with Antonio Banderas and the Pio Donnagio score has turned his eroticism into our heads, the camera gives us bare torso tips on the tip of Antonio that climbs over our furry breast. Now, it's traumatic. It makes every man's viewer feel like he is on the floor of a San Luis Obispo California men's colony laundry room. Don't do me wrong. I don't like Antonio Banderas. It's just that I don't love her. Rebecca DeMornay's elf body is not nude enough to compensate for such anxiety throughout the universe. <br /> <br /> Here's an interesting way to survive this movie. Instead of just sitting there, try selecting the scenes shot in Toronto and separating them from scenes shot from Budapest. It's really a challenge and all we know is to maintain your peace of mind.
