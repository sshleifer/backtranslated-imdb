The shortening of John Irving's novel boldly strives for courage but ends up being absurd. It is a peculiar, funny and bittersweet sketch string that attempts to explain the growth of a person from birth to adulthood and how he deals with the lust and fanatics surrounding him. Garp was born to a grandmother, Jenny Fields, played by Glenn Close. (The different stages of Garp's childhood are played by three young actresses before Robin Williams takes over when Garp reaches adulthood.) The story is followed by a kid's â€œpreparatory school, where Jenny is a school nurse, her high school passion, writing and sex-marriage with her high school dear, with children, marital problems and written careers. Meanwhile, Jenny has become a famous feminist who talks about an unusual cause. The plot details are full of comic and tragic episodes and extreme adventures. Williams faces cherub. This script did not fit his wildness and anarchy, and so his talent was wasted. It is like sputtering the damaged birds out of control. John Lithgow as a father like a transsexual role that gives wisdom, also makes no sense. This film was able to attract some reasonable attention in 1982 thanks to the popularity of Robin Williams and his new film. Williams recently had his Morki and Mindy exercises and more focused on stand-up comedy and movies. This film confused the viewers, especially with his arbitrary and unexplained ending.
