I remembered the terrible movie I bought from the Camelot music store in the summer of 1989 when I visited my grandparents. It was a time when I had just discovered movies like Re-Animator, From Beyond, Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. I was ready to offer all the horror / gore genres .... or so I thought! I was only 12 years old at that time, so I can't remember it all well. I remember a psycho running around with corkscrew and killing people, and a couple of policemen (I think) who were driving in a car that didn't really move, but bowed to the side to look like ... a real cinema. I also remember that it was the worst movie I had ever seen, and I threw it right away. <br /> <br /> Today I did something to think about this movie (I can't believe I really remember the name) so I jumped to see if it was listed. To my surprise ... it was! And 5 more people have seen it .... Amazing. Although I remember the movie's hate when I wish, I had hidden it somewhere hidden because I would like to laugh again (it would probably be a good drinking film). Anyway, I'm glad I'm part of a few elites who have seen this little "treasure". I'd like to take a few dollars, but be careful, it's not a recommendation ... it's terrible ... it's just nostalgia.
