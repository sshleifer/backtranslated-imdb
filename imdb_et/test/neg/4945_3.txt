I'm watching this movie when I write it. There's about 45 minutes in the movie, and there's so much back and forth and empty drama, I don't see exactly where it's going. There are no facts, just enough to leave you with assumptions. The behavior of the head of the head is painful. How did it ever get? The best of non-life films.
