Spoilers !! <br /> <br /> I hate it, but it's better than others after they just get worse. I hope Gibson has the wise to stay aside. Much with the same humor, ie toilet, children, etc. How far their relationship has evolved. Drugs, bad guys, why South Africa! I found this incredible, perhaps South American, country with a golden triangle to have improved this script. In the early '80s, blonde boys, ie Die Hard, powerful Ducks, played Ice Land Gary Busey in the last weapon in the early 90s. Hollywood repeats itself. One with a similar story must go over. Attack by the police, the beach apartment scene and the fight at the end and over the Gibson girl who was attacked by copper was too much. Like many of the second part, they deepen and 3 or 4 in this series accelerate downhill. 3/10
