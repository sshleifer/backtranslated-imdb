It must be one of the absolute worst films I've ever seen in my life. Writing and acting are simply pathetic. It's in the right place with Uncle Sam's worst movies of all time. However, when I see the nonsense that can make it into the video, I really inspire me to live the dreams of making movies because I know I can do a better job than Killers.
