For God's sake!!!! It was the first Broken Lizard made as a group (although it was just a video recently), and I've never been disappointed in my life! I'll tell you if I had seen this movie before I saw Super Troopers (which by the way is $ $ movie !!!), I would never have watched it! I had read several online reviews, as well as a DVD cover that attacked it as "the most fun movie ever made by the Broken Lizard!" Now that they refer to Super Troopers as their most fun movie, I would agree that this would not be the end, but not the end. Talk dry. The film took 45 minutes to go, and then I was so excited to see that it wasn't worth it. Maybe you have to be high to really be funny? I do not know. I love these guys, I really do, but this movie is by far the worst. Club Dread was a pretty good movie, but it was just wow. I'd love to laugh at Super Troopers, but if you want more romance, drama, some funny spots, I'd say you would go with the Puddle Cruiser. Just my opinion is right for everyone! :)
