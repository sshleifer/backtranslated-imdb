I watched it in the cable because I was a big fan of Leele. Big mistake. What a terrible movie. One does not care about any character of the movie. Chris Klein plays a man who is a complete jerk in a movie and steals Josh Hartnet's longtime girlfriend. If the writer knew what they were doing, this film would have followed a proven formula and made Hartn's ass and Leele as a girlfriend who had been trapped in bad relationships, where she saved Klein. But Hartnett is really a cool guy who shows a lot of emotion and love for Leele. Then I hate the lame because he deceives Hartn with Klein, who is for every city trying to help him and really stick to the jerk. <br /> <br /> It's really a comb and characters do everything but run through kitchen dancing and lip synchronization, using hair and spoons and fake microphones (though they come very close). <br /> <br /> What a terrible terrible movie. You don't care what happens at the end, because the director doesn't let you deal with the characters.
