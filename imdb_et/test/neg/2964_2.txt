My wife and I remembered that this movie is much better than it is. When we rented it last weekend, we wondered if we were watching the same movie we had seen 22 years ago. Both agreed that we would probably remember the TV series that had to draw with their one-hour segment in reality. This film leaves many loose threads, as others have mentioned here ... basically the story of every main character remains unresolved. <br /> <br /> Like the title song.
