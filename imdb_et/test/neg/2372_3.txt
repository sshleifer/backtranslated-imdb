This is a comedy version of "Strangers on a Train". It works pretty well. I'm a tough grader, so 3 ratings mostly reflect characters and plot. Performances are all very good. Of course, there are no more than two stars, DeVito and Crystal. Every speaker acts well enough. Comedy works at a level that is just short. DeVito characters work best when they are lost. His character, written in the form of a cage, would probably be more realistic if he were published and praised as much as most cages. His reality would be a great agent and a multiple offer in real life. The characters are one-dimensional, which is good in comedy. But the character of the crystals is not written very well. His desire to kill "moma" suddenly does not make any sense. It looks like it's a bad sense of humor. The unfortunate attempts are not too often and the film flows quite well.
