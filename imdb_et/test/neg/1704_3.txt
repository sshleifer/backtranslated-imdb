This film, if properly done, has such great potential. Parody films are always funny and people tend to like them because they are light hearts, stupid and stupid, but fun. This movie was funny in some parts, but it could have been a lot more fun. The act was OK for all the actors, but ... I wasn't happy. It seems to be empty and the title of my summary says about its impact. The right green screens were not used for this movie ... backgrounds that were just terrible. No wonder this movie went straight to DVD. It wasn't all a complete loss, it's funny and gives you a good laugh (AT, not that time).
