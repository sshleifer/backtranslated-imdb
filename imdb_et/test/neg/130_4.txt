Looking at the trailer, the movie seemed quite interesting. Film production is also pretty good - they seem to have a good budget and it doesn't look like a cheap movie. They work from good (Joe Morton as Professor Simon) to OKen (Kelly Overton as Eve) Halban (James Haven as Don). The film begins as it may become interesting and ends with a badly dead, disappointingly boring, twist. Watching the first 10 minutes of the movie and the last 5 minutes would have changed this movie OK, but all in the meantime makes it totally boring to watch the movie. It would be like they made a short film and tried to force him to be over an hour filling the center with one hour of stuffing. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste a good hour and half your watch this movie. Otherwise, it will be away from this very boring film.
