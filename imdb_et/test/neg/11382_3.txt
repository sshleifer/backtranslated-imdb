Unfortunately, the golden times of stylish Italian cinema seem to have been forgotten. And the recent spirit of the recent filmmaker Lamberto Bava is another obvious proof of this assumption. <br /> <br /> I was happy to see many of its films from its fruitful director (such as Body Puzzle, Delerium, Macabre, and both demons). Although not entirely satisfactory, they are never so boring. <br /> <br /> The suspicion that this new record in my DVD collection was the money that was thrown out of the wind soon arose after a car accident scene with an uncomfortable and unlikely body position under the flip-over car. <br /> <br /> The sense of perception grew during the tempting narrative of events that followed. <br /> <br /> Dumb dialogues, unstoppable script and a waste of international talent talent. The only sign that gave more or less satisfactory results was the son of the naughty Mark who experiences all the boredom. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mario's job was not easy on all accounts. <br /> <br /> I expect his Murder House to improve.
