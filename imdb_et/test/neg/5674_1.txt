This show is based on the concept of picking + unpleasant + repetition = funny. Comic writing is non-existent because I even have serious consequences, even when compared to any entertainment. Here's the premise. Two girls accidentally got their shenanigans on the internet, and after their initial success they appear fun, they create the idea that they should make a web to show their shine. <br /> <br /> OK, so where should I start? Let's start with a laugh, often used, but never successful, reminder that we are looking at the audience laughing. According to Foley's boys, this show is the most funny thing on the planet. We should all be dragging our pants, because the humor in front of us is brilliant. The laugh is serious every few seconds. Quite likely, Scooby-doo will talk too much about the king of laughter. <br /> <br /> Then your face-amazing-your-most-our-anti-lung-astonishing words-to-look-stupid trick with little success. Let's not forget to create new words for a funny trick. Is it web-o-licious and poop-tastic? What the hell ... <br /> <br /> Finally, acting. I can't complain here completely. Actors are young and inexperienced, but should and can be corrected with good professional help. As a result of experience, the nick should help participants define their crafts. Instead, the participants are routinely placed in front of the camera and said "act". What a great deal of robots' perception, timeless time, and overall epic failure. <br /> <br /> The absence of this exhibition makes you reluctant to be funny. Don't waste your time. This exhibition is humiliating for all mankind
