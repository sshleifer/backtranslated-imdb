Every time I post this show on TV, I want to grab my eyes and put my ears in absolute and honest terms. It's so terrible. The jokes are not funny, the actress is absolutely terrible and the whole show is terrible. there is one big disappointment. I hate Charlotte Arnold's courage, and I just want to hit my face or a knife every time I hear his speech. He's not a talented, low IQ, a big waste for society, and I think he's making the world good when he just closes f * ck and went a long way. Please, I say it with all my heart, DO NOT SEE ONE OF THE EPISOOD OF THIS EXHIBITION !!!!!! It's not even 30 minutes of your life and thousands of better things to do, including killing yourself if you look at this example for half an hour.
