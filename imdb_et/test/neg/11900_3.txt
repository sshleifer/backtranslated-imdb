I rented this kind of "soft core" before, but I can honestly say that I don't expect it to be the same as "Rod Steele: You only live before you die" - which was as sexy as funny. It had a good script, a sincere leader and a goal. It also has a hot Gabriella Hall. The reason I didn't expect this movie was because the box was missing a sticker, which must be "18 to be rented". I was looking for more cheese and less cheese cake. <br /> <br /> First of all, I think films should not be allowed to start with "participants" who practice part of a talent agency (or where "actors" practice). In this film, we see that practicing "actors" highlights the lack of preparation that went into the real characters of the film. <br /> <br /> Okay, having found it to be a soft core movie, I didn't do it. â€¢ Be sure to turn it off and reclaim your money. However, the embarrassing way of adding "erotic" scenes to the expanded video to what was probably the release of a paid cable at a late night is very annoying and can easily move back and forth without the constant quality of Rod Steele. You know they have to have money because I think some of them are filmed abroad. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the main actor who doesn't want to get into the invisible drink is one of the most shameless jobs I've ever seen. And I've seen Torgot Manost! It may actually be worth the dollar rent (this and Gabriella's hall). However, it is better to rent good movies with friends.
