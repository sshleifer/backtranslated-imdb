Considering the praise of this chip from the viewers, let me once again tell you how important the dirty thing is, as Lowell Weicker said: I scratch my head as many commendable comments. "The Queen of Africa" ​​is not. The taste of the period is wonderful, yes. Action is good, but no actor, no matter how big, can bring to life a seemingly endless, completely annoying and irrelevant party and dinner table conversation here, and I don't care how much of it is taken from Joyce's text. Imagine spending an hour and a half on a wall of a very interesting group for Christmas dinner (it is not clear to me that it is a family, like one recommended person) who needs to listen to their daily chart and have a great experience with this movie. Nothing will happen. And nothing important has been said, but it is said indefinitely. As I said, the popularity of this film is a mystery to me. Speaking of secrets, look rather good than that.
