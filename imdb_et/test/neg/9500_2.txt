Yes, yes. I know. It has the title "Sinatra" in the title, so how bad is it? Well, it's bad, trust me! I rented the way I left in theaters. This is not. This is a garbage "movie" made by people at Showtime (cable station). Geez, these cable stations make a few bucks they think they can make every garbage they want! It's not good. I'm the same big Sinatra fan as every sensible man, but this movie was just stupid. Bored. Tuim. Unfunny. Interesting. The only redeeming quality is that (assuming they confirmed the facts) you will find out what happened to the prisoners of Frank Jr. Otherwise it's just a stupid movie.
