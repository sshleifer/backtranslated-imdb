This movie was one of the worst films I've ever seen. This movie drags in and out and I almost turned it off, but I gave it to the picture. I didn't expect anything big, but I waited for more. The good thing I work in a video store and saw it for free, because I didn't spend one dime on this film. I gave this movie 2 just because I got worse. If I were, I'd stay far away, very far.
