This is by far the most terrible movie I've ever seen. I've never rated 10 movies ever. My advice is not to look at it. It doesn't even classify a movie. <br /> <br /> You'd better sit on the couch when you watch this movie. Action was terrible, but what was worst was talk. A very unlikely sequence of events that is not even funny. They are really very flat and stupid. Ashton Kutcher and Tara Reid are a very silly choice to act in this film. Maybe even upset their career a little. <br /> <br /> Walking on BlockBuster was mainly focused on this movie, so I decided to rent it. I sincerely regret it. <br /> <br /> After 10 or 20 minutes of a movie, you could basically predict what will happen. I hoped it would improve, but it worsened. <br /> <br /> I don't overdo it. The film is terrible. Don't look at it. I hope this helps.
