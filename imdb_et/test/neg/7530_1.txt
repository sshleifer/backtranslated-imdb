I do not want to be reproached here, but to name it, the next cult class is another example of filmmakers of lower standards. This film is offensive to everything we have a holy, not a good "artistic" insult. This film will become the archetype of the PAINFUL dialogue, which will be given even more by the pathetic actors.
