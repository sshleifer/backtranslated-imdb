Time when I saw this movie, I want back! After that I felt sick, but not because it touched me somehow. It's conscientious to try to get the audience into the people involved, but I don't care less. The characters are breathless and stupid. You will not get an explanation for some scenes and this will leave some thoughts later to explain. All film students have problems, but because you don't know them, they don't believe in their problems. <br /> <br /> If I could write better in English, I would never stop. But I can't, so I'll stop now. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it.
