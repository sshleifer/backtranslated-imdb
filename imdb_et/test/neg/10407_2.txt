Louis Gossett Jr returns once more as Chappy Sinclair, who goes to Doug Masters (played by Jason Cadieux, who was wisely abandoned by Jason Gedrick) to teach a new recruitment band, but this time they discover corrupt air force pilots who are dealing with toxic waste . This is a series that is getting even worse with each subsequent entry, but it doesn't have any zipper or even action that would make it worth watching with the cable. Iron Eagle IV is aimed at the indifference that dogfights will come out as if we were looking at a game played by two lobotomized teenagers. It is terrible to look and Gossett Jr, who has made his part of turkeys, seems to be here. And I saw Cover-Up, Firewalker, Aces: Iron Eagle III, Toy Soldiers, and Jaws 3D. What is mysterious about Louis Gossetti Jr is that he seems like Christopher Walken in his quest to do something as long as he works. I look at his post for an Oscar victory. Some of his best films are Iron Eagle, The Punisher and The Principal. Given that he has been with Dolph Lundgren and James Belush in the last two films, there is indeed something to say that his innocent work is underway with three innocent joy. Of course, Enemy Mine and Diggstown are still the best Oscar competition entries. <br /> <br /> * 4- (bad)
