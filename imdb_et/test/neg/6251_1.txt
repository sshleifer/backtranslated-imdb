Even as a big fan of the small and not budget horror genre, I couldn't easily amuse this disaster. What a terrible thing, a painfully generous "plot" and no dimensional signs, no matter how boring and drunk you are, it's not worth your 81 minutes. Don't make the same mistake I made. Rent something else. Something else!!!
