Right now I would like to see that Koontz's work has been given to a decent scriptwriter, director and producer! JUST ONCE! <br /> <br /> This is a good test for Jean LeClerc and Chris Sarandon and even better for Victoria Tennant, but everything else is pure rubbish. The scenario creator's work in this way and the director ... must be defeated. <br /> <br /> The story is a well written story, but the scenario is quite boring, incredible and terribly executed. The only elements that work are LeClerc, Sarandon and Tennant. <br /> <br /> From a personal note, I really wanted it to work. I adore Koontz's novels, but they have never received the attention, support and talent they deserve. If they put the same money into the work of Koonz, which they shovel, they have quickly risen to Koontz. But sadly! Without powerful people who believe in his work, I'm afraid he'll never get a chance. <br /> <br /> Customizing this movie with a novel was a complete breastfeeding. As an independent film, it was not so bad, though very weak in many places, with holes in large parcels, and a terrible, rigid, unprofessional dialogue that should not have made it a final piece. This film was unable to fulfill its potential. If they had followed Koontz's original work, a little more closely and invested in decent production money, it could have been much better. <br /> <br /> But all I can do is it could have been and not. <br /> <br /> This price is 4.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
