Czech movie visitors could enjoy and appreciate this movie because it was Czech, but I found it tricky, annoying, moral, boring and uncomfortable. Again, I suspect "ramping" to increase the sales of this dog movie. Amazon describes this film as a couple of companions who refuse to grow, but I'm going to each other - I think it's about two companions who have entered a state of dementia and perform activities that make no sense to anyone. I have been told that one of the filmmakers committed suicide after the movie and I believe it. When he saw his performance, he obviously understood what he was doing and realized that the only way to avoid terminal torture was to "make a big deal", which I am sure was a much more dramatic and much better result he did " in spring". Don't waste your time or money on this pathetic action. It's nothing but a dog.
