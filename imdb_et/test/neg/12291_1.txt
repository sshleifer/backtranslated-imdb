I'm sorry, but I don't understand what people smoked when they wrote how big they thought "Ethan Mao". I've seen porn, better action, character and plot development! WARNING: I'll give you the basic element of the "plot". After the transfer of his family hostage at night Ethan lets his whistle, evil, hate step-mum go - ALONE !!! - Restore your later mother's jewelry she desperately desires. Guess? He calls the police! Wow ... what is wringing! I didn't see it at all. The only good thing about this movie was that it was less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Clean, non-destructive garbage!
