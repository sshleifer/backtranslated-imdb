"Michael Myers Curse" is a very frustrating piece to deal with a Halloween series fan. After a very disappointing disappointment at Halloween 5, a series of line lines came near, silly capturing witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to Michael Myers. "Michael Myers' Curse" provides blood and gorees ante, but it really is a breakdown of serum integrity. It's too bad because it's the last movie about Donald Pleasance's character as Dr. Loom. Pleasance has some good moments of the screen (valuable as a fan of your series), as it is very old now and when it says "a very retired doctor". Unfortunately he died before the movie was finished, and when the movie ends, it is very obvious that the stories have never appeared. From the very beginning, Halloween 6 has a lot more to do with the television film than the one that was the fear of blocking it started in 1978. Any loyal Halloween alumni should have demanded more of this movie ... Loomis and Donald Pleasance deserved more.
