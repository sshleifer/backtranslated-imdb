Why don't you have good comments? Because this film is hysterically bad. <br /> <br /> In Japanese prison camp World War II, we have Jim Brown as a hero who puts together a hysterically incredible racist officer and just as hysterical is the way Japanese officers brown the character Jim Brown. <br /> <br /> This is probably the worst film ever made by any of these artists. Stereotypes are not only rich but they dominate this movie. The music of the sixties and seventies may be the best thing for the film, perhaps because it has nothing to do with the film. <br /> <br /> It's even hard to sit back and enjoy it as meaningless fun. This film is even more racist than the message of racism he is trying to offer. And believe me, I was alive in the seventies and we thought it was so stupid. It was never popular.
