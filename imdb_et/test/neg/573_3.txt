This is a film about people who receive a letter of love. No one knows who is sent and no one knows who it is. Kate Capshawi, Good Seller led by Tom Sellec and Ellen DeGeneres. But this is a completely infinite plot. For example, one of the leading citizens in New England's small town is Capshawi's mature college student who works in his bookstore in the summer. He chooses him as Tom Sellec, a city fireman who's crazy about him. If it's not stupid then I don't know what it is. Just an example of how this movie is crazy. Tracking Kate's Capshawi race is a joy, but you realize that she has never run in her life. Another obviously skillful part of living film.
