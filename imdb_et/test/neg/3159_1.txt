Okay, your hippies probably know what I have against "education" and "informative" exhibition "Barney"? Well, I have a lot of hatred for them: <br /> <br /> 1. It teaches that having personality and individualism is immoral. Whoever has no personality. Everyone dresses like this, speaks, acts like and dances. Even with the episode "Being an Individual", children try to tell Barney what they want and everyone on the planet should do what I like. Do you want to teach your child that the individual is wrong? <br /> <br /> 2. "Stranger is a friend you haven't met" Episode. While seemingly harmless, the exhibition's producers discovered that it can be very dangerous for babies as well. In fact, many young Barney lovers across the United States fell victim to pedophiles who used an exhibition-friendly message to attract children from their parents. Since then, the episode has been pulled out but the damage has been done. So-called Innocent programming errors, as it is, clearly shows why parents have to watch television with their children. <br /> <br /> 3. If you're not always happy, you're a bad person. No one seems to show any other emotion but happiness, no matter what the situation they are. If for some reason the child's parents are angry or sad, the child may think differently for the mother or father. There is no good message at all. <br /> <br /> 4. Magic solves everything! Every problem seems to have been solved with magic. At least in exhibitions like "Fraggle Rock" it teaches us that the magic CAN backlash is best solved by the problems itself. Does Barney teach it? No, of course not. There must be magic there. And the problem is that many two-year-olds can't say fantasy about reality, and one might think that their parents, siblings or relatives can solve everything with magic, but become confused if they can't use magic and think they're weird. Another fault pulled again. <br /> <br /> 5. Barney makes no distinction between stealing and sharing. He has even said that "stealing is okay if the person you steal doesn't mind". Children will learn that if you want something, stealing is a perfectly acceptable way to get it. This is not what preschool children need to empower them. <br /> <br /> 6. "If I just have the right thing, I can solve all my problems." Every time children have a problem, Barney gives them the solution they need. The message you send here is "Don't try to solve it! It's too much work and the solution probably won't work. Just use it." That is why children can stop thinking through things (Barney said it was too much work) and became dependent on the "right" object. (The right shoes, the right food, the right computer, the right training machine ...) This is obviously a good message for Barney's marketers, but it's not good for pre-schoolers. <br /> <br /> 7. The message that cheating is fine. In the second episode, children participate in a spoon without dropping it. One child puts the peanut butter on a spoon and easily wins. The child will then be rewarded for her creative thinking when the child actually bent on the rules and changed the game so that she could win. It teaches that cheating is good, you win and people think you are creative, if in real life you are often disqualified or worse, and other competitors who play with the rules do not like it. <br /> <br /> 8. Do the children of this show eat anything other than cakes, cookies and candies? It teaches that it is good to eat tons of junk food and avoid healthy food, despite Barney's "Health Food" songs. In addition, all junk food is served at the show. No wonder America and Europe have so many obese children. <br /> <br /> And finally ... <br /> <br /> Most of the other children's TV shows teach you how to solve creative problems without the need to use "magic". Barney could have done this, but instead decided to use A) for the best marketers and B) took the least time and money for scripts. It is brutally sold, which shows how little Lyons Group actually cares for children. <br /> <br /> It's for everyone.
