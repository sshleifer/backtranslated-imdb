Pretty visuals and many struggles don't make a good movie. That's what happened here. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me admit that I'm still playing FFVII (I'm going to order it soon). But I did research to get to know the characters and the story. But not everyone has the luxury of exploring such things, and Advent children demand that FFVII knowledge be needed. new. We've seen it in Final Fantasy: The Spirits within, and after a better move, I can't say they've done a lot of super-bold things. <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes - well, they're a little fun. However, how can we ever question these results. It was a boring classic - following the usual procedure, there were three battles with the bad (the hero, Cloud, breaks, it goes almost there and gets broken and finally wins). The reason I say it was boring classic was that it is used a lot, but in that case it is badly filled. I'll touch it later. <br /> <br /> English dub seemed good to me, although I didn't look at it in Japanese, so I didn't understand Japanese dub, but only English. I say this - I've heard much better, even in my limited repertoire. <br /> <br /> And now, the plot. Ummm ... what's the plot? Let me be honest, this movie is empty, but it's a fan service, a chance to see the FFVII symbols on a big screen with a cute eye candy. As I said before, the struggles just seem to be for some reason. The open fight is never explained, Kadaj does not seem to have any purpose of destroying the world itself and no real motivation to do anything unpleasant. The cloud is sitting around the whole mop of the film and almost everyone else gets a mandatory hangover. <br /> <br /> Really, FFVII was a piece of the band. Advent children are nothing but. If they had been able to give everyone an important story role (Star Trek: the first contact proved that it was possible, I could add), it could have been much better. Of course, it would have changed the plot, which, frankly, is almost better than what we got. <br /> <br /> Signs were generally either unused or virtually forgotten. Avalanche members (that is, the Cloud worked in FFVII for those who don't know) get 2 scenes (3 for Vincent Valentine and some even less). Hell, bad guys get more lines than these guys, and it's pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Music ... well, I don't care if Nobuo Uematsu is God himself, he made this movie a great time. The Advent One Winged Angel was the only decent piece. Otherwise, he could not decide whether to be an epic (and an orchestra) or a fun (electric guitar). When he changed from one to another, you knew it as if he had slipped his head. <br /> <br /> And this last point, whether this movie was epic or fun ... he tried to be both and failed. To be honest, you can't do everything and do everything. The film also tried to be deep (you can go epic and deep, fun and deep, but all three are too many), but here too failed. The last scene that resembles a baptismal ceremony was thrown into what looks like it. You don't have to be a Christian to just shake and cry. This scene just didn't belong to the movie (nor the frequent appearances of Aerith - he's dead Jim!). <br /> <br /> Given how fantastic I have heard Final Fantasy VII is, this movie is not a little disappointing. Due to the beautiful visuals I give it to 2 out of 10.
