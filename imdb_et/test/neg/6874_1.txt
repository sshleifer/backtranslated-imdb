this movie wasted my time. I only saw part of it and I cried for the wasted time that I could spend on a useful and useful land. For anyone who has watched this film more than once, I blame them for global warming because the amount of black balloons that came from this Tibetan land was not needed and forgave them when they came from other films. Robin Williams lowered his standards to take more than 10 seconds in this movie and Tim Robbins, how he went from shawhsank to this movie, I have no idea. please do not look at this movie for ground safety. Stop releasing black balloons from the movie that they should never have financed or released. please burn all copies before anyone else has to watch this mess.
