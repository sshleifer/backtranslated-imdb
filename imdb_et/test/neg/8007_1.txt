Would anyone want to explain why someone would want to "british neo-noir" into a criminal movie that is almost entirely American? The accents in this movie are bloody terrible! But in line with the performance that is so woody, there is one fear of striking a fire. <br /> <br /> Really, what nasty, moral, cynical crud is this? Even neo-Noir films have some kind of character that you feel or want to feel, even if they are sad and destructive; they have at least some intelligence for them, in a sense that what they have done is wrong or that a seemingly good plan has gone wrong and that they are somehow responsible for it. <br /> <br /> Not in this stanky stew. These signs are dirty, betraying each other, yourself and the audience. <br /> <br /> Also, note that they are inflexible - it's okay, there's nothing wrong with it - except that they look like a lifetime of luxury. For a film that is said to be desperate for small thieves, this is the main point - you forgot. It's all so terrible and dross, doncha know. So we kidnap some people or maybe kill them and go to a luxury hotel. What ambition! <br /> <br /> Grasping all this confusion into the swamp is profoundly uneven; predictable "action" sequences that are not; banal and inconsistent set-design; working and editing a bad TV camera; forgotten result; and the lack of any imagination or innovation in production and directions. <br /> <br /> Fully unbelievable, unlikely and less dedicated film reviewers (or masochists), like me, completely overlooked. There are other nasty things I would like to say about this nasty movie, but they may not print them out here. Suffice it to say that you will probably find something useful in your time when you watch this movie - actually something.
