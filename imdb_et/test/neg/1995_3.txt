After killing a big dog, a stray cat thinks, "Why can't I be a skunk? He sees a junkyard around and gets the idea: white color, black color and some Limburger cheese and some garlic ...... hmmmm. Next thing you do you know, we have the predecessor of "Pepe Le Pew", although it is still a cat in this comic, he is it, and just a hidden skunk. <br /> <br /> The cat also enjoys and uses its new status as a smelly junk He is now a happy, meaningful man ..... until a real skunk comes out (Charles Boyer's imitation voice)! <br /> <br /> I appreciated the cat that put Bugs Bunny's clothes on. characters, I found a stereotypical dialogue that was superfluous and not really funny, so I only appreciate it as "fair." However, I do it because of the morale at the end of the story.
