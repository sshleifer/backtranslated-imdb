The Rutger Hower fans are no longer nailed - he's just a cameraman in this movie and it's IT. This movie loses an extra point for this fraud. I think Rutger Hower has about 2 very short scenes and 2 very short voice commands. <br /> <br /> The female driver of this movie has a superior look and talent when she's great, it's a great movie for a dog and she wastes it. The story is a lawyer who hopes that this partnership will one day go into Boss's brother's countrywide. They have many clashes on different oddball and this is a vehicle of various skits and a dude playing the sunset is thrown into the mix as a good character. <br /> <br /> This is a road trip where extreme circumstances put our repressed hero on the test and he slowly relaxes at the end of the film, ah not love grand, yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> See it movie only if you want to see a hot chick who has an hour and a half truck.
