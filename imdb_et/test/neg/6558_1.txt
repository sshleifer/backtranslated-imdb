Welcome to the Space 9 Star Trek movie. Come on, trekkers, admit it. This movie is so bad that every department is so amazing that it has become a classic. <br /> <br /> Shat is the worst performance ever devoted to celluloid. "Ships! Hello, Bones" Brilliant! It's not just Ham - it's several big pig farms in Kentucky! <br /> <br /> "Special" effects. This should be done on the basis of commercial descriptions to use such a term. The company is a moving cardboard in this movie. Really! Even the Star Trek TV show was better. <br /> <br /> Bones, Spock and The Shat Sing! Yes, Spock sings the Row Row line on his boat. After fighting the meaning of words !!!! "Captain's life is not a dream" Bad Leonard Nimoy, he really needs to stifle Shatner for that. Wouldn't Shat have given us his Tambourine Man transfer and did not harmonize with Nimoy Bilbo Baggins Ballad? Really disappointed. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Sean Connery is played by Spock's brother. Only cos they didn't get Sean Conneria! Uhura makes a fan dance! It would have been sexy in 1966. In 1989, this is how you look at your drunk grandmother during a Christmas party. <br /> <br /> Cat Girl Jumps Back to Shatner! Shat spins him a few times, like the WWF wrestler, and pulls him down. Yayy The Shat! It seems that Connery 2.0 was a little Vulcan insurgent. This explains why Spock hadn't mentioned him before in the 79th episode and in 4 films. McCoy obviously killed his father, as Cure followed. Tell me it's not hysterically funny. Spock's antigrav boots also support Bones and The Shat amazingly. Should you have used Star Trek IV! Shatner meets God! Or what one wants to be God, but I assume it's really a stranger. God looks like Charlton Heston in 10 commands. Sean Connery, the second, invites God to share his pain and die immediately. Or something. God punishes Shati for questioning his identity. So Spock kills with photon monitor with God. I would like to know what Jehovah's Witnesses did with this scene. <br /> <br /> Shat, who has killed God, will go back to his singing song with Spock and Bones. Total line line in your boat .....
