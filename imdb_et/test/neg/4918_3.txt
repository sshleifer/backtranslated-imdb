Heldeke. In this queue, this time there is a mirror with the evil spirit of psychopaths who murdered Amityville's home with a shotgun. The mirror struck the terrible incident of a terrible family who had no time to prepare for their uninvited guests. The mirror is given to a photographer, Keyes (Ross Partridge), who is a son (.. who just happens to be his crazy father, and a man responsible for killing the family) and it is bad to terrorize those in the attic soon. like Keyes painter Suki, depicted by Julia Nickson-Soul, where she lives when they watch it. Soon, Keyes will have nightmares looking at his father's eyes when he attacks weapons with cold blood, worried that he could follow his footsteps. Soon he will see other events through his father's eyes, such as this terrible day, when the sons of the mother head to the floor of the institution or experienced inside the cell when the doctor administered the medicine to immobilize it. <br /> <br /> Casting pretty solid supporters who deserve better than a junk, such as David Naughton (American werewolf, London), the floor owner with whom Keyes lives, Richard Roundtree as an eccentric sculptor / artist, Terry O 'Quinn as a psychologist - defensive and especially Lin Shaye as a fun ditsy, a rather strange secretary-nurse in the shelter (.. who kept Keyes father) soon to be shut down. <br /> <br /> Rounding up a movie, sexy, leggy Lala Sloatman, like Keyese's supporting girlfriend, Barbara Howard (Friday 13th: Final Chapter), when Naughton's betrayed woman (.. she was at the beginning of communication with Nickman-Seoul), Jack Orend as a sadist who wants to kill his son to kill innocent people as he did, and Robert Rusler (Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge) as a rejected lover (.. Nickson-Soul) who meets unhappy deaths while hitting paintings as dismissal. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bad special effect film that simply uses Amityville's title as a down payment. Franchising has never been so great to get started, but since every succession was green, it grew worse and worse. After the third film, furniture from a notorious house becomes "overwhelming" by torturing people. However, cast casts hard, but the material (.. reflection that causes chaos and murder by supernatural means) is lacking in quality .. and rather mediocre special effects do not contribute. O'Quinn, as little as he has to work, shows why he is such a big actor, he can even show such stools. Not everything is gone, you always see Sloatman wearing extremely short skirts (.. or his men's shirt panties), showing off the legs from the collector ... they need to find somewhere with a silver lining. Believe it or not, AMITYVILLE: NEW GENERATION was the seventh film in the franchise! The coolest part of the film was the portraits of demons painted by Nickson-Seoul artist, which can be inspired by the evil mirror after watching it.
