First of all, I'm in no way a funny movie observer. I'm not one of those people who just get movies to pick and criticize mistakes, like most other people, to watch for entertainment. I basically look at any type of movie, no matter how bad someone says it is (sometimes the movie is so terrible and written that it refers to some bad humor that I get out of). All this was lil pimp just pathetic. I saw it on television and just didn't know what I was looking at. Adult film was too badly written and cheesy, and it was too much sex, enthusiasm and swearing to be a child's film, I really doubt kids would be entertaining. Humor (pretty generous even by calling it) was both pretentious and campy, I couldn't see how someone with a half mind would even be funny. The only thing that made me laugh was how people like Bernie mac and ridiculous were able to put their name and time on such sick. The nature of the snow was so cheap to laugh, which fell very far. There was no point in the plot, the story must be the worst sequence of events ever assembled on the screen. I could go on, but I want to see what people think of my reaction before I talk about cases of specific pathetic scenes. All I have to say is that you really have to think about how much time their writers had on their knees, trying to do it. <br /> <br /> J
