I also made a mistake when I thought I saw Geoffry Rush upstream in 2003. It was worse than the many student films I've seen. The script was forced, the operation was subpar and editor annoying. It was so slow that I managed to stay there. But I always give the film a chance, so I suffered until the end. Obviously there was a memo for this movie because my friend and I were the only ones in the theater. Why didn't anyone send me this note?!?! That's why I post, as a warning to others who think about throwing good money. I just hope that you actually arrived at this page and did not get in as I did, looking up "Swimming upstream". P.S. Sorry for the cast and the team when you read it. I know you did it hard. I know what's going on in the movie ... try!
