It's hard to decide who or what is the target audience for this movie. Perhaps Jean-Pierre Limousin was able to seriously investigate amnesia problems and decided to use it instead as a pretext for making soft porn movies. Having seen, loved, admired and respected the choices of Se Souvenir des belles that thoroughly study the heartbreak of memory loss - albeit as a result of Alzheimer's disease - and especially the luminous performance of Isabelle Carre, I find Novo's insult to Se Souvenirs. I have no problem with soft porn - and even if I had consistently abandoned movies that are so widespread, it is today - but I have a problem with writers / directors trying to hold it like here in the shadow of medical research. The sad thing is that beautiful actors like Julie Gayet - so wonderful Clara and Moi - and Anna Mouglal ​​- who seem to have hit a double game after last week's Le Deluge and now - are wasting such time.
