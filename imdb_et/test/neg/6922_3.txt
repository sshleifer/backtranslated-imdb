Seeing that it got to the theater all over the world, it's just a reminder that the career of these talented ladies Denise Richards and Milla Jovovich went. It is also a specific grate that thinks they are smart, funny and original while being poor. A complete blame can go to Brian Burns, who wrote and directed this potboiler. His manuscript takes a rather unigenous situation and does not go anywhere. Situations develop completely without internal logic, except for a desperate scriptwriter. The characters are thinner than the cardboard cutouts, behave like fools and without real motivation. Nowhere is this more obvious than the involvement of Mrs Richards. We don't think his relationship with David Krumholtz's character is one minute and how he's been playing back after one hour. Why should someone fall into the egocentric, self-obsessed, arrogant b ** ch like this first, much less the second time? Especially after allegedly finding ... true love? And if any of these things is not enough for the film to sink completely, the middle pair. Binding Krumholtz and Yovovich is only a little more plausible or more advanced than the Richards one, but it is unsuccessful. There is no chemistry, no sparks, something we could accept as a reliable couple. Worse still, these two average characters are particularly annoying and irritating, making annoying and irritating things that the viewer ultimately doesn't care about. <br /> <br /> Generally very bad. Even die-hard rom-com fans could pass it on because there are dozens of movies that are made of more skill or more charm.
