Perhaps this was an excessive weight gain for Seagal. Or maybe it was Wayans' terrible act of momentum. Or was it the complete absence of chemistry between the two main characters? These and other considerations lead me to the conclusion that Seagal should never have performed this nightmare. True, the story was good. However, as a keen follower of Seagale's career and background, his physical appearance was not a pure, pure, healthy genre of Zen-Buddhist life, especially during his discussions with Wayans on his screen. (Then his real life was "controversial" with the babysitter!) <br /> <br /> If Seagal wants to become a more versatile actor, he should do what his fellow "Kindergarten Cop" did. ... put the script in humorous material or situations where the actor has no choice but to react in a comical way. Otherwise, leave the series behind the killer with clever cracks and unnecessary humor. Seagal is not a natural type of humor. It didn't work. <br /> <br />
