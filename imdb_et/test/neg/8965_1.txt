This movie is truly incredible in every sense. I couldn't believe what I saw and heard, and I didn't believe it. Hepburn is probably my favorite actor, but it was ridiculous. Being myself, I know what it should know, and it's not an accent of Kate Back Bay. The only thing I was more fun about was that a man who played Charlie Chan so many times, Sydney Toler, was poured into another mountain pass that matched. Maybe it was a practical joke, think about it. I do not think of other reasons for such a peculiar casting. Well, maybe that's it. I noticed that Nathalie Schaefer, Lovey Howell on the island of Gilligan, appeared in this game on Broadway. Can you imagine what part he could play?
