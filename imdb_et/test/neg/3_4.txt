Wow, another Kevin Costner hero. Postimees, Tin Cup, Waterworld, bodyguard, Wyatt Earp, Robin Hood, even this baseball movie. He seems to be the focus of films. The characters are almost always the same ... heroes, imperfections, greatness, fall, redemption. Yes, in the first 5 minutes of the movie, we should be scared of our character and grow more and more. <br /> <br /> And this time the story ... story? ... is just a collage of different movies. You don't need a spoiler; you have seen this movie many times, although it had different titles. You know what happens before it happens. It's like mixing an officer and a gentleman with Backdraft, but both are easily better movies. See Backdraft to see how to make such a movie ... and see how the hero plays a good but slightly underrated actor Russell.
