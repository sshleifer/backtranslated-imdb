The Heart of Darkness is an insult to Joseph Conrad's book! Frankly, the movie made me sleep. On the other hand, the book was certainly extraordinary. I feel the film missed several important elements and missed the main points of the book. In addition, the actors were bored and lacked originality and enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> The book, though not an adventure story or easy to understand, is full of hidden meanings and interesting twists. The book, though very confusing and complicated, is amazing. When you finally understand it, you will feel like you have learned something. The short story or short story had a number of key ideas such as nonsense and madness that the film left out. In addition, several important scenes were changed, which in turn affected the entire plot. Many scenes seemed to be very "insignificant" in the sense that they did not match. All in all, it seemed like a bad interpretation of the movie book. <br /> <br /> I would recommend watching this movie only if you can't see or understand the book, but I missed it. It was terrible and completely confusing. If you have never read this book, be sure not to watch the movie because you need basic information about the film. The film was a terrible spin-off of an outstanding and detailed book.
