Plants in the structure of the ancient Mayan pyramid that kill everyone who goes. Yes, it is weird because the passengers don't know how to do it before they all get crazy. In such a film, I just wanted it to be absurd and to be marching in attacking plants that use masses. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a group of people from American vacation and going to the mountains with a couple of other newly made German friends who know this place. When they got there, the Mayans began to yell at them and hide the structure. And if there is, then when the plants decide to take them out, they mimic the noise of the cell phone, the people and the dead men of the ancient Mayans. <br /> <br /> There was nothing frightening about the film and it wasn't even fun. Even this weird end won't save it. I was looking for something really good, but nothing. Oh well. "F"
