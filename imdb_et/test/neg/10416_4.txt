Although it is definitely well-crafted film art, it is completely without entertainment values. <br /> <br /> If you're already depressed, this movie will send you over the edge. <br /> <br /> If you feel somewhat depressed, this movie is another thing in your life to feel bitter. You feel that your luck has chosen watching a movie that is a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you can pass it through this movie (mine, BTW), safe knowing your life is so much better than Jim. Then again, you might think you are stupid and it is actually a lot worse than before. Jim may feel a bit annoyed to draw your attention. Maybe you want to hit her with a little wet fish. The sad truth is, as I wanted to like this movie ... I hated it. The road of oblivion took a rather long unhappy road and then suddenly, without any reason, looked back and stopped. <br /> <br /> Jim has no epiphany, at least not the one that is transmitted on the screen. Jim has a life of unhappy life and an unhappy choice. He does not discover anything that could be related and unable to make significant progress on his discovery journey. <br /> <br /> Of course, no one in life can write a happy ending for this movie. As others have said, this is not a Hollywood story, it is sharp and real. It's well done. Life is sometimes a struggle. If someone had to know the "answer", they would do well to kick it off the roofs. <br /> <br /> Still, I feel cheated because this movie says it has something to say. You feel it says something that if you just suffer from it, you have something to say. It makes you stop and think. <br /> <br /> This is not the case. <br /> <br /> Again, I say it's a well-designed movie. And so it can be valuable for a film student who wants eg. lighting palette lighting methods. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us it is absolutely impossible.
