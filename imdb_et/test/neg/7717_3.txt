So flat it's not even funny. Zombie infection transcends a small college university and a secretive government unit backs up a few scientists who have been sent to find the origin of the outbreak. Zombie DNA collection is not easy. If you are bitten, you are one of them. The whole university is infected with an inflatable run. <br /> <br /> This sequel will not even let the terrible original house (2003). Pointless entertainment is achieved though. A few glances about the female nudity attached to gore and exploding should keep all zombie freak happy. Authors: Emmanuelle Vaugier, Victoria Pratt, Ed Quinn, Sid Haig and Nadine Velazquez. The word "F" together is an unimaginable script.
