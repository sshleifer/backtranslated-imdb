I left the theater and I was only 10 years old. It is so bad to suck. The plot was terrible and the behavior was worse. Leslie Nielson should be ashamed of the person who made the film. I was only ten years old when I went to see this catastrophe with a friend and even in this young, innocent era when I didn't laugh at the movie. We (myself and my friend) still laugh at how bad the film was. We got the R-movie where my parents were. Bottom line - this flick was scary. Mr. Magoo - more like Mr. Ma-who? This movie would love me for life when I watched a popular comic book on TV as a child, but luckily it had never been seen, so I was tortured, but I'll never get back the valuable minutes in my life that I wasted.
