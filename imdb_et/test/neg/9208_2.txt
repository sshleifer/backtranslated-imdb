This is a film that could have destroyed several quarries if garbage could destroy those days. <br /> <br /> Melanie Griffith took off her shirt and, on her pre-cooling surgery days, she should be really wasted, but fortunately she and us, she's gone for much better stuff, because ... ... well, hell It is strange that all of his main players have moved on to bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work here was also wasted, but worthy of shameful admiration. I mean, something that is not worth it is not worth it. But he still did well. <br /> <br /> However, there was one brilliant and brilliant aspect: Ray Liotta, who is named after a creditist, just stole everything. Liotta was admirable! Hypnotic! Amazing. <br /> <br /> I saw this garbage when it was still relatively new in a friend's private theater. For some strange reason my friend loved it. I think this is because Melanie Griffith took her shirt off (and indeed, she shouldn't be), though she tried to claim it was other, more artistic, for reasons. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought that even after the first scene, Ray Liotta became a big star or at least a big, highly regarded actor. the whole story made Liotta almost worth it. In fact, you should see once to see how far Ray Liotta has come. I want to say one thing, his name is now usually up or near. <br /> <br /> Even then, even with a bunch of garbage, shine Ray Liotta like a diamond. <br /> <br Just when you see it in the trash, be prepared to keep your nose. Every great character is either immoral or immoral. Terrible movie. A terrible movie idea. <br /> <br /> Added comment: too many people answered "Was this comment helpful?" "No" because they are not in agreement with the opinion. Perhaps IMDb should submit this question instead: "Do you agree with these opinions?"
