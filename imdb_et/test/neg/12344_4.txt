The film begins to be a bit of an interest when the son is interested in the teenager's age. Clayburgh's frightened man is killed in a car accident when he is ready to go to Rome and sing as a song. But the objects of Matthew come together. He's reuniting with a young girl, but this time Matt is cocaine. His wonderful voice, cute, booming mother, is a limelight. He doesn't know how to deal with Matt's addiction. The movie drags the plot while searching. Clayburgh is in the wrong role and Bertolucci may be in the head when he directed the picture. The moon's symbolism is great. <br /> <br /> Save time. Maybe I'm very generous with 4 *.
