Casper Van Dien ... what can I say? I enjoy this guy! His films bring them some fame, which is not actually produced by the director or the producer, but by him! Recycled plots ... control. Taking better movies ... look. Wooden ... control. It's not that Van Dien is a bad actor (he has been an effective Starship Troopers and Sleepy Hollow in Hollywood shades), he just didn't offer his talent-worthy script; and yes, he has other actions than candy eyes. This movie offers some clues about what Van Dien can offer, but what is inappropriate. The script can be better developed (see Oliver Stone's U-Turn). Leadership can be better exploited (see Robert Rodriguez's Dusk Til Dawn). DP could have made the desert more exotic (see Russ Meyer's fastest Pussycat Faster Kill!). This script is weak because it is something we have seen several times before, so we expect double / triple lines. The direction is weak because it does not offer anything new and telegraph from many weak script moments. The film is sometimes painted by a lovely autumn desert, but at other times it does not use scorching light, and the starting sequence is blue horny in a horny flower-plant. <br /> <br /> Now acting. .. Van Dien demonstrates some grace and charisma to his Jake. He does not get too methodical or too shy in his tasks. A nice balance, especially since the rest is too puzzled about how they should act in this movie (bad script or bad direction ... you make your opinion). The only other person worth mentioning is Bryan Brown's villain because it provides unique credit for acting in this movie ... Actors wanting to forget that they are trying to act on the green screen, try to learn how to act in a terrible script and make notes in this movie Bryan Brown. He adds extra depth to his role and is a great counterweight to the Van Dien character. Jake always seems to be one step forward or to control any situation whether it is out of control. Femme fatale is weak (this is ultimately a desert noir) and is another nail in the coffins of this film (you decide ... script or direction). The characters of Rosalita should have been postponed in the movie, instead of entering later, to make room for a real femme fatale. Vaadake movie Van Dien and Brown; and for fun, try skipping the cliff over the holes in the plot inside the film.
