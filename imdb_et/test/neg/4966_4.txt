I was just a cautious enthusiast when I rented "All the boys love Mandy Lane" when I immediately remembered the hearing and read the different opinions? both positive and negative? in a short period of time between this short cinematic release and the distribution between video-close shelves. It was supposedly the most brilliant and refreshing new horror film over the years, with no stereotypical teen characters and unpredictable parcels. Okay, the basic concept may seem rather innovative, but inevitably, the scenario will return to the same old and irritating clich√©s, and once the point has passed that even the stylish brands will not save the movie from the terrible mediocrity. The opening sequences are indeed terrible and literally a bath in a melancholic atmosphere, which in fact makes it even more painful to see the film as a "normal" rudimentary slip. After an arrogant intro that introduces a drunken macho boy, he speaks of his jump from the roof to impress the beautiful beauty: "All the boys love Mandy Lane" is just another textbook and uninspired horror film about idiotic children with stones and horny lonely ranch before killing off a non-unknown maniac. The whole terrible structure of the film collapses faster than the dirty house of the cards: we never get the right explanation why Mandy himself is so harsh and haughty about all his admirers (as he grew into an orphan, maybe? Oh, boo-hoo), guys soon enough show that they want to have sex with any random bimbo and not just with the "divine" Mandy and the final twist? though undeniably amazing? is just pointless. The middle part is quite boring and does not even offer really terrible excitement (killing shotgun? Please!) Or authentic filth. My excellent rating of 4 out of 10 goes completely into a grainy and uneasy 70s film style (with faded colors, strange but beautiful photos) and a surprisingly wonderful sound. Director Jonathan Levine chose the classic Bobby Vinton song "Sealed with a Kiss" to play on the trailer and the final credit while I was originally convinced that the film would inevitably have Barry Manilow's cheesy love song "Mandy".
