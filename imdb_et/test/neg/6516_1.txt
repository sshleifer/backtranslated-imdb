If you have never read a book and are not going to read it in the future, continue and watch the movie (6/10). This is a nice fantasy movie with a well-done CGI, a nice actor, a beautiful environment and a story of average fantasy. <br /> <br /> If you've read a book about 10 times more and love it, don't wait too much (or better: don't expect anything). The story is completely different from the original book. This may explain that 1/10 of people around the age of 40 or more (like me) vote for the film and much better for people who probably never read the book before and so did not expect anything. The differences between film and book are not really necessary and make the provision (in my opinion much worse): <br /> <br /> - The magic of the book works with rituals of classical magical effects. (Changing the weather, creating illusions, transforming the animals, ...) In the film, magic is rather a "Medieval Jedi School" (TM) (wooden sticks instead of luminaires). The fact that the devil looks like emperor palpatine (after part III) doesn't really make it better. <br /> <br /> - The mill in the book does not let the world completely shut up like a movie. In the book, the story is placed near Dresden, which Krabat visits once with his lord and also visits some nearby villages for celebrations. (This part could have reduced the cost.) I also don't understand why the film has a mill in the mountains, while a nearby graveyard is on high mountains. <br /> <br /> - The entire environment is the average duration of the mill's fantasy style. A lot of mud everywhere, dirty faces, not a regular kitchen, just very harsh houses. The book has never offered such an environment. <br /> <br /> - In the book, Captain Krabat tries to make him his successor, but Krabi rejects it. Krabat is somewhere between admiration, distance and silent rejection. In the film, Krabat always pushes the captain openly as a stubborn schoolboy. <br /> <br /> - The film was set up in 1647 until 1720. This makes it impossible for the captain to tell his youngsters stories. 170x. OK, studios are still missing in the movie. <br /> <br /> Also, some of the explanations in the book would have been useful and not costing so many minutes: <br /> <br /> The work done all day in the book is effortless and working at night is like normal work. This explanation is missing from the movie. Sometimes boys are sweating and sometimes they are happy. <br /> <br /> - The book explains why only a few "Gesellen" try to resist the captain: if the captain dies for everyday reasons, "Gesellen" is free and holds his magical abilities. If the captain dies during the confrontation, all will lose their power forever.
