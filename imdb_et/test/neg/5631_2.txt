STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday evening *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Unusual journalist Mike Sullivan (Vinnie Jones) slips off Constellation and trying to become a police officer for romance. But everything changes when a pub keeper, often abducted by the Thames, is found next to the Thames, and the confession of the printed novel of the legendary writer Charles Dickens is found. As he digs deeper into both mysteries, he is forward to mystical and dangerous as he wanted. <br /> <br /> In 1998, Vinnie Jones, a former footballer, shot somewhere and took a surprise with his gangster culture classic Lock, Reserve and Two Smoking. Okay, nobody blew up his ability to act, but his presence as a hard man foresaw a decent career as a tough guy in the movie. But all of this turned out to be a hit, and all that he actually achieved after that, played a role in the status of many more acclaimed actors in films such as Gone in Sixty Seconds and Swordfish before falling directly on DVD. being a confusing and capable thriller that could have been okay if he didn't take along with him other recognized and promising new talent such as Derek Jacobi, Julie Cox, Vanessa Redgrave, Jason Flemyng and Mel Smith. What made her so fast (if perhaps one along the pony) to fall from the hit heights is someone's likelihood (one evil personal life is possible), but here she is. <br /> <br /> Script A is so far drawn and incomprehensible as it would have been in someone's hands, but in an insecure search for Jones' leadership, it is even more important. Jacob's rhythmic role as a former tramp and Dickens himself, who speaks directly with the camera, are obviously tips to build something and the script is predictable in other areas. Add this cheap looking product values ​​through display and debut leader (including writer) Brendan Foley has made a bad first impression. <br /> <br /> What exactly did I expect from the Daily Mail free of charge? *
