I love oddball animation, I love lots of Asian movies, but I didn't love this Japanese product. Fuccons is said to be an American family (they are all dummies) who have moved to Japan and are a somewhat 50-year-old sitcom-type family, with somewhat more modern feelings at times. The DVD has several very short episodes (like less than 5 minutes?) And I didn't find it funny or fun, not even in a strange way. I'm not sure what its complaint is. I took it here and there from some satires, gosh, who didn't, but satire is usually somewhat humorous, isn't it? And something I saw and didn't even hear a little smile. I picked it up and it was definitely amazing, but I think I'm either missing or just LAME. The box even says it is Fuccon fun, right there, but I would like to differentiate. 2 out of 10.
