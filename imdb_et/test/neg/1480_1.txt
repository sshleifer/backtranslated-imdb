It's really one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. Rod Steiger, who stands for ornery-grandfather, Charlie, is in full-fledged mode, hoping that the more he is, the better his performance (Cue buzzer sound). Rod Steiger is one of the last true legends of the film and seen him in this movie (although at the end of the Days, the second worst film I've ever seen) is truly a heartbeat. From the bad scene to the non-existent, it is quite clear that the only reason why this film was made was that the producer's surname ended with DeLaurentis. The only good thing about this movie is that it is so bad, it's really hysterical. Look for a feedback scene where Rod with Jor-El wig Superman and big black porn mustache. Only hopes that Uber's Kevin Arbouet, his post-film, "I Believe in America", will redeem and leave a good taste in everyone's mouth.
