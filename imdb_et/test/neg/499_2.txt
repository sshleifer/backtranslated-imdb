You have to admit Cimino's contribution to the cinema. He gave us both the most appreciated film of history (The Deer Hunter) and the worst film history (Heaven's Gate). And before you start, "It's bad, but not the worst, let me explain. <br /> <br /> For 20+ years, I listened to critics and avoided the "Gate of Heaven" - it wasn't really difficult because you didn't bother with watching the movie. Then, a few days after you saw the documentary "Final Section: Making and Removing the Heavenly Gate", I entered a long version of the used $ 9.99 DVD. My advice after 229 minutes is to look for the most negative review ever written about this movie (you will find a wide selection), and imagine that the reviewer is Cimino's dedicated mother and that she does everything she can to make a positive inclination to her expensive son's movie. Then you have an idea of ​​how big Cimino is. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is pretty much wrong, what ultimately hints about the scale is to make it worse (and less classic) than zero 'example' of its shameless distortion in history. Although the bearings association sent Johnson County group regulators / armed forces and had a list of targeted names, the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. On April 9, 1892, the master of Nick Ray and Nate, who was finally killed by 50 soldiers and weapons hired by Texas, who came to Johnson to clean up the "rustlers", was restricted in the morning. The county's citizens then restricted the regulators who were finally arrested (or rescued) by the army. Women were not actively involved in the fight and, along with Ray and Champion, there were minimal victims. After all, these attacks were not - and the wagons of the immigrants did not circulate around the circles (it was early western, it was the filmmaker, not the actual tactics of the Indians). And for weeks before the arrival of the regulators, many of Johnson's inhabitants hanged without trial, including Jim Averell, a modest road robber, and his wife Ella Watson (who Cimino resurrects as his two leaders and even shows Averell's life) into mature age. <br /> <br /> The sin of making a movie is no greater than a fictional history, if you want to quickly and loose the historical facts, change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who may go away from the movie that believes what they actually saw. Fortunately, a few people saw this movie that the damage was minimal. Maybe it is hard for Ciminot to tighten up its history. Probably he can blame the accusation of crazy defense - the film offers a lot of support. If Cimino were crazy during the production of the sky gate, it would explain a lot. But my voice goes to "lack of talent" instead of madness. <br /> <br /> There are some good things in Heaven's Gate. You can actually see the screen where some big budgets went; expensive kits - beautiful epic camera shots. Isabelle Huppert (a strange election that actually worked) gives a pleasant and pleasant performance, although most of her scenes are very boring (this usually happens when the director forgets that there are no reasons for looking at the characters). Dialogue is generally confident if it is normal. <br /> <br /> But don't let the pussy that this film experiences with storytelling by mixing carefully designed moments of character interaction with textured competitive community-like explosions. That means Cimino's madness was there. "Tests" is another word when a filmmaker loses in his project so that a single story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that Cimino has no scene or tried any control or organization. He seems to have turned his DP into a stage action and got an endless selection of colorful shots - 1.5 million feet loosely staged. Then he tried (without success) to prepare it and match it to cogeneration. <br /> <br /> The final battle scene is really fun because babushka, who is wearing urban games (perhaps borrowed from Fiddler On The Roof), gives the regulators countless dynamite spikes. Unfortunately, every explosion just falls to the target and explodes safely. After seeing it 50-60 times, you can turn to the woman (the one who looks like "anger from grapes") who puts a huge weapon in her mouth and pulls the trigger. This is probably what Cimino's mother did after writing this review. <br /> <br /> So believe what you've heard about this movie since 1980. It's a sloppy, disconnected, poorly paced, and historically distorted mess. Only an example of a film historian and a source of fun for those who know the real history of America's West are only worthy of appreciation.
