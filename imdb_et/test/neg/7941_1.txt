The original "Assault on Precinct 13" is sharp, witty and, perhaps most importantly, short. This remake is ruthlessly padded and spoken. Worse still, the first film of the African-American hero is replaced by the beautiful white boy Ethan Hawke, which makes this "attack" less progressive than in the 1970s. God, how I leave John Carpenter and his unlikely plot line and his strange sense of humor. I even leave my B list actors who are leagues better than Hawke and the company. <br /> <br /> I can't say I take care of the new villains in this version - they stretch what the story has ever been to the limit. Female characters are useless, criminals are all the common hoods, and Gabriel Byrne gives one more boredom. The music is also wrong - it is a dull activity that actually stops tension. Just terrible.
