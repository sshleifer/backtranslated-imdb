David Dhawan copied HITCH and such an unofficial copy The film is not even half as funny or amusing as it is boring with forced stories like Lara's story with a child, and not hubby Plus is an unwanted stupid Chota DON and David is also trying to drama stifle, but the film seems to be scattered, boring. <br /> <br /> Songs just seem to be so romantic, and all of the funny Govinda scenes, some dance before the interval is not worth mentioning. it's pretty funny, but it's usually too long <br /> <br /> David's direction is as bad as MAINE PYAAR KYUN KIYAA, he needs to change his style or try something good Music saves grace, some songs are good, but Govinda sees good overweight and seems too picky and punishes her lines in the original rolls, but she enters into the grooves and gives Salman and her end in her booth the best and to the end <br /> <br /> Salman just plays with herself and her nose tone plus her fake style is headache <br /> <br /> Lara is avoidable, Katrina is as usual <br /> <br /> The child is moving over
