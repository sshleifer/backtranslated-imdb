There's the potential to "Tell no one". A curious and intriguing plot and French take a very American story. But for me here the options were not used. <br /> <br /> Although I liked the aspects of this movie, there were three outstanding shortcomings that drew it to four out of ten. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's silly, the secret of clich√© murder. Especially experienced murder he wrote or Bergerac. The French ban does not eliminate this problem - it is just silly and French. It's full of unlikely coincidences. Secondly, it seems that the transition from the US to France seems unsuccessful chronically. This French doctor hung on the "streets" of the French city with his new "home troops" and their SUVs ... and then there are cars ... <br /> <br /> Third, and for the most part, it's just too long. For me, the film has a good reason for it to be over 90 minutes, and for more than two hours it's a serious justification. This procedure was not.
