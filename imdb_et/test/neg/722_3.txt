Derek Jarman has shown us again and again that this dialogue is not his strong suit. He is a painter and the color he does. His films are almost always visually excellent, but the same colors are as exciting as they are. Watch your movies fast, really a fast device that you can only get on DVD. In The Tempest, Jarman makes very little of a script or characters, simply using them as a grid to hang a very long and well-designed cinematic frame. He goes so far as to contradict Shakespeare's original script to achieve these extremely slow and inanimate scenes. There is no romance, magic, trick or speed the script requires, little spontaneity, and especially the Caliban character is reduced to a shaky and crazy idiot similar to Gaveston in Jarman Edward II. It is too bad that it is almost the only movie version available at Tempest.
