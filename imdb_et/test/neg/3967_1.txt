How Much does a 101-year-old English-language version of 1984 from America have to suffer? "Gosh, this is a great book, but such a downturn. I know I write it just like everything works well. I also replace Orwell old, I used the thirties political perceptions of my own Think, think, political understanding ... Evil Politicians , I'm a genius! And there are clones that they do for themselves for some devilish reason ... I'm working on it. It works. "No, that's not, Bob Sullivan, the writer of that story. It's really all you are. You could have stopped them early and said, "Boys, our budget and ability to act, thought more of a romantic comedy, or the ability to remove the form, taking it so seriously and making it tired, familiar to the genre of the movie." . "Did you do this with a bob? No, you weren't, and you have 28 years to think about it. <br /> <br /> I don't want to be so malicious. I'm sorry to scream you for Bob. You obviously had this mistake Some will blame Ron Smith who helped you adjust the scenario. He could have stopped you at any time. You were young and naive and he used you. Now he's playing video game plots and you, bob, well who knows what you're doing .I'm sorry if it sounds tough bob, but that's it. You were sold by Hollywood hotshots. But when Ron wasn't enough, Michael bay saw your movie and even without any rights or anything without demand I think this is the most disgusting part of the fact that with a little eye candy your script can easily be enough for a larger Hollywood production, which I hated as much as this movie and did not feel any harm to you at all <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that things worked for you in this way. Ron and Michael walked around you, leaving you with a shrunken man who is the height of the movie's writing joke from the Mystery Science Theater 3000. Don't focus on this Bob because Karma works mysteriously and one day they pay for what they did to the poor little Bob Sullivan.
