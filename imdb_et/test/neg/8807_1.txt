"Hood Rat" is absolutely terrible. This is the city version of "Willard". I just can't believe this film got, not to mention the distribution. Someone in Universal Studios thought people would watch this movie. The only good thing about this is Ice-T as a landlord. He was funny. <br /> <br /> One thing I hate in movies has picked up. One or two times is bad enough, but the whole movie is like that. The transition of each scene is a special fast-moving effect. The director should be banned from making films forever. <br /> <br /> Trust me, never see this movie!
