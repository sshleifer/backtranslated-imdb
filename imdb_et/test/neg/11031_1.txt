This film is an example of small budgets, ineffective starry, weak style and poor entertainment. Such films are made for business breaks and no entertainment for fans of Bollywood films. I went to this movie because I thought one of the gangsters was tolerant, so it is. The only thing I appreciate is how the new actor made the most bold things in the film, very much reminiscent of the ninja das of the Bollywood actor. he is good, sexy and well-functioning. He's definitely on his career. our mithunda was good at all times in his work. I did not like the imra for its role, that he should repair himself now, because he has made several new films as films and has been considered an established actor. This movie is nothing more than a new actor made a bold scene.
