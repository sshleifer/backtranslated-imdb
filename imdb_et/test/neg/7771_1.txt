In 1970, feminists invaded London's Miss World and stopped the event by putting flour and eggs on stage. Why? Because rightly or wrongly they found that the event was humiliating and humiliating for women. I do not offer any criticism of their activities. It's the free world in which we live. What I want to know is: why not today's equivalents penetrate into studios where such exhibitions have been made and the same way? <br /> <br /> "Sex and the City" are all about four self-absorbed women from New York: Carrie is a fashion slave who turns into a pussycat, as a person as many eyes on her eye, Charlotte longs to find the perfect person (they don't not there, love) to be able to use sex to hide the poor devil, lawyer Miranda scares people when they are frustrated, like "without touching my emotions", and finally we have Samantha, the old Martin advertising lifestyle "anytime, anywhere, everywhere ". Feminists keep these signs - especially Samantha - a bright example of today's femininity. Well, if the shouting of busy restaurants is successful, I think feminists should look at themselves for a long time and what they should represent. <br /> <br /> "Sex and the City" was the creation of a man, it would have been drawn from the waves to be sexist. Instead of "Charlie's Angels", it has bound allegedly intelligent women to think that it has acted as a positive force for good. There is something very clinical and cold about the exhibition. "Benny Hill Show" was also sexist, but at least it was funny.
