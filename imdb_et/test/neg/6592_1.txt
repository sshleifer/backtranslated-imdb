You may suspect that the plot of this movie is written in the filming process. It starts with the movie "pants versus vigilante", but in the middle of the movie, the plot changes sharply as the vigilant becomes an honest man with his honest girl and honest gym, and he has to fight corrupt "businessmen" who want to change the gym at any price to build a mall or something. Then the plot changes again and we forget the corrupt guys. The criminal is now a friend of the leading person who thinks he is Ninja. The boy becomes "mad evil" and wants to win any martial arts competition. Seeing this movie is like a nightmare with television.
