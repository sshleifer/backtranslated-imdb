James Cagney plays Richard Gargani (nicknamed "Patsy!"), A former gangster who is now watching the harsh boys as a new superintendent of a supranational reform school. High Genre Entry where Cagney is the whole show; he dominates the picture, but only because there is not much interest in it. Jimmy gives you exactly what is expected of his hard-boiled person, which may be satisfactory if you have made a quick solution. Direction (Archie Mayo, even though Michael Curtiz had said it had helped) is easy without being particularly gripping, although the narrative slides on the other side, grinding the film to dirty conclusions (even the Cagney Patsy lost the shuffle). Restore in 1938 as a "crime school" and again in 1939 as a "hell kitchen". ** from ****
