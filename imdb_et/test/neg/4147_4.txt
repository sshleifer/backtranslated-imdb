I really wanted to like this movie because I love Tromat and loved the trailer and loved "Ghoule", another Ferrin movie. It had some pretty good moments, like the old love song that plays in the car accident scene, and the end of the scene where the main character closes. But in general it was just boring and slightly unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The "unimaginable" shocks that Ferrin had created were really predictable and worn out. Murder of prostitutes, incest. Maybe it would have been good, but badly done. Not sure if he tried to insult, amuse, or both. Ultimately, we didn't watch Troma movies because we wanted to hear movies. This film didn't feel the heart constantly. There were some good scenes, but in the end it was boring and unpleasant.
