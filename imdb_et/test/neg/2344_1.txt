I watched this movie the second night in Telly and I knew little about the bright festival ... I knew it would be stupid but not bad! This movie illustrates everything that is terrible in Australian comedy. In addition to the most annoying, endless scenarios and characters I've ever encountered (besides these suspicious French-made American tax breaks comedies!), Most situations were boring, incredible, stereotypical, and so funny just ... terrible! One such scenario that was very irritating to me was the bus scene jokes. From the point of view of screen writing, writers used the most interesting - not to mention incredible - scenario to get these three sides without their baggage ... They are on their vacation vacation and they risk all (including $ 300) deposit, luggage and space) to exercise their right to dance on the bus? I mean, they're about half an hour away from your destination! At least they could have beaten the bus driver, but they wouldn't leave cos 'they can't take it anymore!' And to destroy your holiday ... Anyway, I can't believe the writers didn't work in this terrible scenario. I think ten years old could have been 5 smarter, more fun, and more plausible. <br /> <br /> I can continue with many other people - a truly unimaginable stereotypical psychopath, a whole relationship angry with a girlfriend and tag next to a virgin, "Wow Man! Out there goth girl" inhaling stuff on the train - everything was just weird! I can't think of one of the redeeming features of this movie, except that perhaps the third wheel of the nerd was kind of cute. Damaged his career, appearing in this trash!
