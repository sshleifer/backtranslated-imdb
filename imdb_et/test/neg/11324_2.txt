Oh, I swear it never happened to me before? I was just looking at "Golden Temple Amazons" yesterday and I haven't got any memory of what happened in this movie. I think this movie is great. By now, I remember being tempted to look at this incredibly attractive DVD cover design that depicts a rich drawing of a sensual Amazon that made her bow a fireless target. Am I often deceived when an attractive DVD covers? especially Jess Franco these? and I still haven't learned to resist even after hundreds of terrible experiences. Oh well? After reading the comments from other users, some memory materials were returned, although I still suspect that this movie is confused with another Jess Franco masterpiece that I watched last day, namely "Kilimanjaro Diamonds" (and yes, one was a fantastic DVD)). "Golden Temple Amazons" opens with hot white African Amonon? I'm aware of the contradiction but don't blame me? kills the parents of an insecure young girl because they broke the green space with the intention of stealing the golden treasures of the temple. For many years and hormonal changes later, the girl returns to the jungle to get revenge. He is accompanied by a number of foolish adventures who are less interested in easy revenge, but would not want to return home. The primitive assumption is obviously secondary to any poor female nudity and free compensation. Analía Ivars, Eva Léon, and other unnamed ammo are all common Franco choices and are happily walking their breasts proudly together. You'd better enjoy all those perfect female curves like the rest of the "Golden Temple Amazons" is a boring and incompetent mess. There is hardly any violence or action, and no less than half of the film is a story and kind of material that is a national geographic documentary. An amazing DVD cover would surely be a great addition to your collection, but opening the box is completely pointless.
