It was a strange film. A little horror and definitely a movie noir. Some fifth columnists meet and mysteriously die with a Japanese dagger after Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi) appears. <br /> <br /> The Lone Ranger FBI agent will soon arrive at Richard Dick 'Martin. (Clayton Moore). Martin is ineffective in finding a murderer because he is more interested in the lost doctor's brother (Joan Barclay), who is part of the gang. <br /> <br /> After the last person's death, the doctor is terribly strange by the strange serum, the group's real story goes out and this is where it becomes interesting and strange. I can't fit it. <br /> <br /> Lugosi was an amazing killer.
