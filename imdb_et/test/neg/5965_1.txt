This movie is a complete and perfect waste of time, one of the worst films I've ever seen. And that's for me, it certainly says something. In fact, I would have liked to have given it to negative letters, rather than just appraising the terrible one star. <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie, I had an open mind. I think the chupacabra legend is interesting and I have a fondness for fake horrors. But I'll draw it to the line. <br /> <br /> Functional sucked. The conductor gives one of the worst performances, watching and sounding unnaturally when he presents his poorly written lines. Lead female gives a little more delicious results, but it doesn't take much. <br /> <br /> Chupacabra ... well, given the low budget for this movie, the creature was acceptable. But it looks exactly like someone in a mask and body suit. The mask is quite detailed and may seem personally cool, but not so on the screen. <br /> <br /> Talking on the screen, you think they might have used a better camera at least. It seems to have been fired with the camera to make a loud noise. Not very good either. <br /> <br /> I don't know who wrote this sadness. Dialogue sucks and just ... I can't describe what I feel. At least not without the site having difficulty. <br /> <br /> My advice? Avoid it at all costs. It's not just worth it. If it is on television and you have nothing to do or watch, * find * something else to do or watch. Read the book, listen to music, * nothing. If you do, you can't say you're not warned. And do not rent this mammal for the Lord and the Lady. It's not worth it, even if you have the opportunity to rent it for fifty cents. Trust me, I know.
