It looked like a number of 3rd greeders who stole the camcorder, borrowed some old editing software since 1995, and played jokes.

It was a group of friends who had a good time and the video was recorded. The story was very difficult to follow. The angular tests of the artistic camera helped the story, and they themselves always had a cheerful experience. Functional, though comic, was very amateurish. The concept is OK, I think. Maybe the next time manufacturers should raise capital and hire real professionals and try again. I must say that I think so much that making a good movie is easy. It's not easy ... This fact seems to have disappeared or many people ignore who believe that without any training / experience and talent they can make a good product. Finally, I think they learn how difficult it is that I'm so disgusting that I don't know how Chrisite wrote on August 5, 2006 (post no. 762):
