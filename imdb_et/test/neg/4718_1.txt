In this terrible attempt with the Blair witch, a number of people went to Africa to explore a creature called a semi-box. It is quite obvious that there was no script to talk about and that everything was improvised. This can work if you have good actors that this movie didn't make. <br /> <br /> This movie tries to get points for originality by exploring more hidden myth and exotic culture. As a result, the shrub has many scenes where the characters "peculiar African stuff" like eating elephant manure. There are also some pretty good shots of lions that eat (from the perspective of National Geographic), but there is no fear in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the Cannibal Holocaust or Blair witch project, this movie won't surprise you and you can probably look at a better lion material on Discovery Channel. <br /> <br /> Definitely Half-A-Tension. <br /> <br /> A note for filmmakers: guys, make us all useful and next time save "How I spent your African vacation" on your movie to your family and close friends. No one wants to see it.
