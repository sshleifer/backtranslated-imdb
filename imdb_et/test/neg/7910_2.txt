After the degrading experience on the plane, Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) complains about the airline and uses the money he wins to start his full-service airline. It makes it special that it has sexy stewardesses, a dance club and no less than Captain Snoop Dogg in the cockpit. <br /> <br /> Soul Plane is a very racist comedy, except that it is occasionally funny. Soul Plane is described as a "city" version. The problem is that Soul Plane does not even make a laugh at the plane. Soul Pane jokes are too insulting and are mostly single. I'd lie if I said I wasn't laughing because there were funny moments. However, I was expecting more and I left the theater disappointed. <br /> <br /> I'd compare Soul Plane's plane 2. The latter was just the first movie rehash, while the first one is just obsolete, raw jokes. There's really no creativity behind the movie, and there are just a few fun places. But I don't think Soul Plane is "bottom 100" bad. The film is currently ranked 82 and it's a bit harsh. I'm not saying it's a good movie, but it's not terrible either. Running time is only 86 minutes, so it's not too much pain. For stupid comedies, you can do a lot worse. <br /> <br /> Someone's cast is not very good, but everyone seems to be fun and it helps. Kevin Hart was very annoying as Nashawn. He had some funny features, but he's a very poor leading man. Snoop Dogg, who was a little funny in Starsk and Hutch, moved here completely. Tom Arnold was actually acceptable and it was the biggest surprise of the film. The film's most annoying person was Ryan Pinkston. She wasn't funny at all and she's never funny. The funniest cast members were Miss Pyle and Mo'Nique. They gave the best lines and they made me laugh the most. Finally, Soul Plane can be posted if you are looking for a foolish comedy, but it would probably be better to just skip the movie. Rating 4/10
