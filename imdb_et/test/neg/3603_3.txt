Another direct video from Disney, which is basically ideal for kids. The problem with Kronk's new Groove is that everything that made the first movie a fun ride is replaced by a sad and terrible movie. In this film, Kronk learns a lot of lessons from many other expenses. Kronki New Groove deals with two stories: Yzma returns and one Mrs Birdwell hopes to win the Kronk Camp Counseling Championship. It all leads to Kronk, who faces his father and condemns his son's life. <br /> <br /> The Lord of the Rings to Michael Jackson's thriller, Kronk's new Groove circulates every time it allows entertainment for its viewers. If you love the original or are waiting for the upcoming Kuzco TV series, I recommend Kronkit to your loyal fans.
