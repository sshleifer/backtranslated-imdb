While I think that the film's hated reviewers have encapsulated exactly what it does wrong (all!), I have to add my two cents. If you want a longer version of how horrible this movie is, read the review of coinlightning. <br /> <br /> Here's a short version: the shameless use of actors NAME to promote the plot as opposed to their talent (no one brought it "game"), blatant trade (I think Pepsi can afford advertising - or 40 - the film stuck) and the plot (???) that was so complicated "rock star" clich√©s that it was completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Let me put it to you like that. . . I was thinking of the Wayne World while watching this movie, but I didn't laugh! Every time you try to throw Steven Tyler (Aerosmith) to help your movie plot, you have serious problems. <br /> <br /> Please warn your friends and family - this movie sucks.
