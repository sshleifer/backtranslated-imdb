OK, usually fascinating Z movies. Some of these films, actors, directors, writers, etc. are talents. They want to give this talent to them, they have to associate crappy people with their movies. However, some Z movies have at least one thing that can be remarkable about them. <br /> <br /> Not here. <br /> <br /> As soon as I saw it, I thought ... the blade is off. Believe me, if this film could have lived on that label that would have made it a better film. <br /> <br /> Instead, I was subjected to the most terrible activity I've ever seen in my life. Master Kao was bad, so bad I believe some of my brain neurons exploded, trying to understand his behavior. I still try to understand my pronunciation and why he raised his voice by adding some words ... to add a dramatic effect, but I'm sure. Just remember that it's amazing. <br /> <br /> Oh, there is a black man at the end of the movie with a flower. The purple cape guy fights the hero for about 30 seconds, but he's so bad that it actually looked like he was scared of fighting. <br /> <br /> The main hero and main villain were decent jobs. The main hero (Derek Washington) seemed to know that he actually knew martial arts.
