The first 4 episodes of the 6th season are just a throw, predict, and worst scenario I've seen. No and hopefully not buy it. It is also seen in the season that space episodes made it even more. All I want to say to people who do this: don't make the whole episode of space, because they suck. The thing is that season 6 sucks even more than before. Worse from season to season. I was so disappointed and disappointed to watch the first 4 seasons of the 6th season, which I just had to write. Only people who have washed the brain can watch this mess. It seems that the people who wrote the script will get out of ideas for a long time. Think that my two-year-old nephew had a better episode idea than these people do.
