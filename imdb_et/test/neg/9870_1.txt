this is the worst film I've seen in my whole life. Period.This film goes ridiculously beyond, it's like the director wants the actors to blame their ass for presenting their roles in fantastic four forms, I believe the movie should have appeared in comic stores that the only way to say this is desperate geeks who don't get enough joy and want to see more and more movies. At the end of his paradoxical statements and dissertation, I believe this film has had great drawbacks to the future of cast participants, except for the nature of jay underwood, where I believe it was his best result, considering such roles as the non-human films in which the story is spoken in such a way that the story It has been told he has no character. The catwalk and the people have made good decisions not to watch his films, so he is probably not a big role unless he shines his career in the most rare, but interesting way.
