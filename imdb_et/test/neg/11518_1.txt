I'm in my school in a movie club, and I was forced to sit and watch a bad movie. The story of the film is not depressing, but the whole film itself is extremely frustrating. Operation was absolutely terrible. Children were superfluous. The metal side could have done a better job. I wanted to fall asleep desperately, but because television was so loud, I stayed calm. Monkeys are neither cute nor funny. Drama is ridiculous. I can't remember seeing a terrible movie. The story is weak, thin, predictable and completely fake. Adults try to be good actors, but they just can't break the stereotypes. The girl even seems to want to leave the shore at the time she leaves, to leave her, I don't blame her. Micheal Anderson should publicly apologize for this movie. Not just me, but everyone else who was forced to sit through this terrible movie. Actually, I'm sorry for you. Even if I had nothing to do with this project, I apologize for this movie because it means at least someone. This film even goes beyond the inconvenience of Rob Schneider and Cheetah Girls. I would even say that it is even worse than Hilary Duff's film collection, but it pushes it. Please just don't see this movie, or else you will be forced to write it like a movie. I am very sorry.
