It was so bad that I had to turn it off at last. I've never watched such a pathetic movie. I love B-movies and waited more for the same, but unfortunately I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is the worst action / plot / direction / writing, etc. seen in my life! <br /> <br /> My recommendation to anyone who thinks or watches / buys / leases doesn't go there!
