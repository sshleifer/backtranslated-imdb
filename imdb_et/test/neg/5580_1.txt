From time to time it is good to see a very bad movie so you know how decent Keanu Reeves is. The prerequisite for this story is good: teenagers go on a boat, a meteor in the water, foreigners kill teenagers. What is not this love when you start screaming thrillers? But I should have known that when I read that it was only 75 minutes, something was known. I thought, "I hate movies, judging how long they are. Who says the movie must be 90 minutes?" But when I took home from BBuster to DVD, I was shocked by this terrible product quality, targeting this completely amateurish garbage. The only reason I looked at it at the end was that I didn't have cable TV and I paid four bucks for it. However, there was one beam of light: an actor who played "Chris" is actually decent, and this class is far from this dreck. First, the special effects were cheap and convincing. Then the foreigners - costumes were interesting (rubber suits), but because most of the film is in the dark, they can't really be seen! And hardly any participant was convincing to stop the disbelief. Finally, I have to say that the DVD jacket is made of much higher production standards than the film itself, which looked like a rip-off, so be careful when renting other DVDs. Save your $ 4 and buy a pint of beer.
