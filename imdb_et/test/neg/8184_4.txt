I have barely managed to watch the whole movie ... Only after about 85min of the 110minute movie, Mars started and then closed for 5 minutes. These 85 long minutes were very boring and did not give the film anything. When he finally reached Mars, it wasn't much better. All this could have been placed for a much shorter time and nothing would have been missed. <br /> <br /> I don't understand what the trivia says about the movie because the newborns are called "Aelita" ... Why would anyone want to give their baby a name after a villain who, despite having only one eyebrow is probably 3 rows ??? <br /> <br /> The only interesting thing here is kits and costumes for Mars scenes. They are an interesting experiment with constructivism, just like "Dr. Caligar's cabinet" was five years earlier for expressionism. <br /> <br /> I'll give him 4/10 for great design ...
