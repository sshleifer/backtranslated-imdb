Very Slow Deadly Series Chapter 7. It is very obvious that the budget was extremely low. This film was made for one reason and for one reason only. For Sale Puppet Master Toys! Fans like myself have decided what I have read and heard that the only worse in the series is the Puppetmaster curse. In turn, turning us away from the series. <br /> <br /> Selecting a PG-13 movie for some reason didn't work in movies. The plot seemed almost to be there, but it was easily lost in a consistent mess. <br /> <br /> The only movie worth looking at is the Decoteau-led part 3 - Toulon's Revenge. <br /> <br /> Allow me to support the film landscape. <br /> <br /> Yuck!
