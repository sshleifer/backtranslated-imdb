I'm rarely motivated to write a review if it's not inspired by film quality. For Comanche Moon, I was so unforgettable that I felt the need to warn others how bad this TV mini series is. Here are some thoughts. <br /> <br /> Indians: They arrived as they were on a Saturday night with a live skate, having fun as Indians speak. When McMurtry writes a dialogue in his novels, it is so interesting; I'm not sure how they ended up with what they got. <br /> <br /> Gus McCrae: Festus seems to be an old Gunsmoke series. Acting OK and Robert Duvalli McCrae's guiding principles are correct, but the look is a pure comedy cowboy. <br /> <br /> Clara: Maybe you could use some dirt or sweat next time. Ever in Austin summer before air conditioning? I promise that women did not see this. Do you think they have never seen any of the Dearwood episodes? <br /> <br /> Gov. Elisha Pease: Again, when they're in the governor's office, it looks like a live skit on Saturday night, and the squirt is bombarded. <br /> <br /> Woodrow's speech: The call is the most reasonable, of course, he speaks so little about how you take it? But hey, how's that hat? <br /> <br /> Blue Duck: See above and add the fact that it isn't even a little scary. They should have been able to play Javier Bardem. <br /> <br /> The Rangers: Right out of "Oh brother, where are you?" I waited for George Cloony to ride and break them. br /> <br /> Maybe I'm premature because minicomputers are not complete, but I doubt I'll look at it any more. <br /> <br /> I don't expect anyone to have the amazing feeling of Lonesome Dove, but I look at it and they don't seem to feel old at all.
