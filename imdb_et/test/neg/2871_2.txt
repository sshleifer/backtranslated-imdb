I didn't think Haggard was the funniest movie of all time, like CKY and Viva La Bam much more. I think it was just really stupid and had no plot for the movie. I recommend not paying much for this movie, but anyone who likes viva la bam, CKY or Jack Ass should see it. I loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out. I think Jonny Knoxville should have played in the movie because he is a much better actor, most people from Haggard and probably would have made this movie more fun. I think Ryan Dunn was probably the best actor and he should have had more skating.
