Supercraptastic slasher fare that seems too long for 80 minutes. Years ago, "gypsies" living in mountain caves were burned in a forest fire. Years later, the camp fire area is lost. The bundle of horny children is, of course, a journey to this area where there is a separate camping trip. Despite the health of the ferocious attacker (Jackson Bostwick), children are in any way in the mountains. Before long, the children begin to get into the monster who remains invisible at the end of the film, probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad. No surprises to talk about: they are killed precisely in order to dictate their film formula, leaving the "ultimate girl" to take care of her, although in the refreshing recession the last girl gets imprisoned and impregnated with the monster. <br /> <br /> The story itself could not hold the weight, so it was padded with seemingly endless wildlife and insects that were apparently shot for another movie and were randomly added here as a medium for a long enough time to release the movie. On the plus side, nature decorations are pretty nice. There's also Bostwick, who talks about a baby deer, a climbing corpse, OK gore and a big Jackie Coogan in his final movie role as a scuffling local sheriff. It's far from Charlie Chaplin, but he was nice to see. It is only for graduates.
