For the first forty minutes, Luna is a real pleasure to watch. The characters and their situation are interesting, and photography and locations are beautiful. Then Jill Clayburgh discovers that his son, Matthew Barry, is using heroin and the film starts to get used to it and then his illness begins to ridicule. <br /> <br /> Clayburgh asks why and when he started using the drug and his or her audience will never get a direct response that would be a little helpful. He mentions not caring anything, but it is not right because we can clearly see in the amazing early scenes that he has a lot of interest in his mother's song, baseball, sex, and apparently well-cared for taking marijuana off. This film is for people who think that junior gets into heavy drugs because mother and father were workaholics who lost their piano lessons. I think that such a dangerous and emotionally volatile drug, such as heroin, was chosen as an intellectual catalyst for subsequent incest scenes. There's a lot of discussion about mother's love for her son, but that's actually Bernardo Bertolucci's pretense. Luna would have been great as a nice little family drama. <br /> <br /> How old was Matthew Barry in this movie? I was more concerned about the things he had to do as an actor of the film than what his character had gone through. ** end ****
