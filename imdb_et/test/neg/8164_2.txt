I love movies, all genres, and big dollar glasses for small indie projects. But even support for this 25-year-old jubilee and the 1950s tribute is almost suffering because we appreciate movies. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I was reminded of a number of "student films", I have had the opportunity to watch, the effort where creativity is needed to fill the gaps where money is needed. <br /> <br /> Overall, the 90-minute lifetime is far better. <br /> <br /> 2/10
