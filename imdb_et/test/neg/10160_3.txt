I had seen this movie when I was a boy (before World War II) and I was surprised that the local library had a copy. I saw it after sixty years and forgot how bad it was. This is an example of a movie that was not A-film. No editing, poor script, weak action and not much redirection. It should not even be as high as "B". Did you smile how I have changed for years. It seems to me that I thought it was good when I first saw it.
