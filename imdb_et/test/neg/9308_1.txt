Yahoo Serious is like a $ 3 bottle of wine - there was no substance to start with and just getting older deteriorates. This movie proves that it is completely toxic. We can only hope that this is his last film and that its serious lack of ability to finance future ventures will be undermined. This is where "Lightning Jack" and "Les Patterson Saves the World" are the most likely example of Australian comedy. The tragic thing is that with so many endlessly comedic talents in Australia, Yahoo is being given such vehicles to express the comedy of their cheerful school yard. And think - he had 7 years to run the script. A true genius!
