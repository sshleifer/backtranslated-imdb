First of all, let me just say that after watching this movie, I felt I was selling a bill. Remember that this is not the fault of the movie that IMDb has it as a comedy and a horror (although I don't know how it came in ... maybe some movie crew member put it in). Being a fan of the horror / comedy genre, I checked it on the basis of it and I'm so sorry. Where to start? First of all, there is no comedy in this movie to return to my beginning. He's trying one or two times, but can't get any more than the best. My reaction was mainly rolling the eyes and wondering why anyone thought that such tired material would be funny. There is no trial here either. No other tension is found. You think I'm exaggerating ... I'm not. There is no tension, very little blood, and not much violence on the screen (sorry, but dropping a horror, like cutting just as good things begin, is a big mistake). Hell ... there's even nudity there. Call me a purist or a youth ... I prefer some terrifying if he can't find the original plot / premise. And is it tired like all the hell "reality TV show went wrong"? This has been done earlier and much better. Like the wrong turn 2 or ... ummm .... any movie was named Edward Furlong. This is such a bad film. I don't even remember the name of this movie, but it was better. I also liked one comment that claimed that its timing was good because "reality TV takes over". Did anyone tell the past about the time machine? Are you kidding me? This thing is trash ... and not fun.
