A real, stereotypical, good-looking story, the story is a broad and confusing arch that will take you down to the end of many garden gardens (without the accompanying fairies) that will come to the end that feels like you leaving - hollow. <br /> <br /> If you're after a movie that is at the peak or ends with a satisfactory jump, it's disappointing. In spite of the sexuality of the protagonist, which was meaningfully expressed, I felt that he was an androgical, without a clear male person, rather than his pure French personality. Even if it is fixed at the end of the film (or rather naked naked), the viewer is as conscious as the nature of motivation - the little thing called the plot. Probably a stereotypically English-speaking position, at least when you take a movie.
