It seems to me to be in a minority, but I thought the radio was quite terrible. It seems that it contains almost all the clich√©s in such "heart-accelerating" films. <br /> <br /> The motivation of characters in love with the radio was never really explained. We just had to accept that everyone was fond of a couple of bad apples on the radio. <br /> <br /> You saw the story almost 100 meters from almost all the great moments. When the film wanted you to go to "Awww" or pull out your tissue, I spent my eyes and wanted to see "Rudy" instead. <br /> <br /> Some good results were cast. Too bad for not showing a better movie.
