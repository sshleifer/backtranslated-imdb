Well, what I'm saying. WHAT F ** K? There is not much to say about this. The only way you would like it, if u like me, like a bad bad fear laugh. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION - VERY IMPROVED! Just look at the last scene with the main actors! Turn off Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE! but bad! Just terrible! <br /> <br /> Gore- I don't really believe. In one scene, they use one of those knives that are cut out of them that fit over the body part, and so on. Using it with the addition of red ketchup, he seems to be out of 2, but it is not really true. br /> <br /> Predicted "children get lost in the forest in the camp weekend" hanging on Friday the 13th. <br /> <br /> Killer Quality - A scary mask, if you are afraid of clowns, unbelievable that someone has chosen it for their costume. The director obviously realized that all the good costumes were used in all other horror camp films. <br /> <br /> TOTAL- 3/10 * / ***** ps- away from CAMP BLOOD II it made it look like Lord of the Rings.
