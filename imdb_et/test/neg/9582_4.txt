I can't believe how many appraisers it really realizes. I'm a million miles away from being an expert and I'm never going to climb the mountain; but even the very basic knowledge gained from Thin Air's reading and Everest's boundaries and some other Everest document meant that this film was still more ridiculous. At first there are some good climbing materials; and when the billionaire mission manager asks the film early "How much experience is over 8000 meters?", I was encouraged to hope that it could be a sharp and accurate human-vs-natural odyssey. Instead, you have a number of climbing tools that increase mountains without acclimatization; climbing in the sun with safety goggles and they are hardly ever breathtaking, making admirable stamina. There is little fatigue near the summit to dramatically emphasize such a monster peak, almost as a result. If you do not have the knowledge of climbing, look at it: be prepared with some cliché hero (though no longer a cliché as a hundred other passively directing valves) and a cliché result. I've developed little interest in high mountains and look forward to seeing K2; but after amazingly beautiful landscapes it was let it go because it was so far from reality. I can imagine that some experts have been recruited to make this movie, but then they are conveniently ignored when struggling with a heroic and unfortunately fantastic story. It also seems that you would hear a little chick when you said "Welcome to the Dead Zone" 200,000 feet.
