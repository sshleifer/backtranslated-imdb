I believe that the value of the output is OK .. it is probably worth the 4/10 or 5 / 10th traditional film with good looking people in the quality of the model and the small class .. <br /> <br /> but the premise allows me to be annoying. a decent woman would do such dirt? I mean, he's getting married to a man who's having sex with another woman? <br /> <br /> And even more serious in behavior ...... only in de Laclos's mind .... the film also has many aspects that make Eastern Europeans immoral <br /> After all, this is just a movie, if he does not intend to worsen women in general, then I give one more point, but obviously it makes a <br /> <br /> conclusion: a nasty piece of crap with a little taste
