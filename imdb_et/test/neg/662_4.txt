I had no idea that this movie was created by "WWE". Wrestling is flat enough. Why did they have to go to the ground, making the film nervous, as it was? I found it to be a complete disappointment. If I had known that the movie was as stupid as it was, I would have stayed home and some other entertainment. Of course, I will give them a cool effect; but the killer didn't seem as scary as he could have. He didn't have many things. But I'll let you get them out. The plot was a great idea, just might have done a lot better. Maybe WWE will stick to its moral wrestling in the future and stay out of the film industry.
