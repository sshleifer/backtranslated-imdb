My grandfather gave me this DVD. With these friends. The front cover was quite scary to see it. What a bloody mistake. <br /> <br /> In principle, the movie follows three people on the bus and what happens to them, involving friends. <br /> <br /> The first one is the man who buys the car that talks to him. The other is about a man who wakes up to find a catarole clone in his refrigerator. Thirdly, there is a woman who gets to know the net, but it turns out she has a robotic hand. <br /> <br /> The DVD cover rated this movie 18, but even 5-year-olds can watch it and not be scared or not. entertainment. The film should be bloody with 12 small intimidation and swearing words. <br /> <br /> All this movie is absolutely bright.
