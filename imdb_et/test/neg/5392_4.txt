Dear SciFi Channel: How Have You Been? How was your summer? I've been OK, but I feel that our relationship is no longer the same and we grow from each other. I don't understand why you don't love me anymore. I've just finished watching my original "Skeleton Man" from the SciFi Channel and again you have shown a blatant respect for my feelings, killing all the hot girls in this movie !!! I mean, I understand that you are just about to rejoice instantly. All you care about is creating a movie where people get sliced ​​and diced with a giant Indian spirit / creature / legend. So you don't really have time to do some thought and effort to do something else - like finding a Skeleton Man costume that doesn't make him Skeletor's gay-lover "He-Man". Seriously, her clothes look like a satin lining and her skull is smooth as a child, she almost looks like a killer Halloween costume-to-6-year-old when she travels through a desert for a terrible rage. So we throw you bones because we are not looking for Oscar winning performances, intriguing plot or realistic characteristic reactions to handy situations. Because we understand that although Michael Rooker, Caspar van Diem and all the girls should be trained as special opsagents, they all become a mysterious Lung who can't shoot or see as soon as Skeleton Man appears. And we also assume that nothing - bullets, explosions, blackouts, anything - can kill Skeleton's man until one minute is left for the film and we have to find a way to get things done properly. We look forward to blood and courage. But you have the skill to take the least attractive actor all over the cast and make her the only woman who lives. And frankly, I think you are just doing it against me. Because this film is as stupid as it is, it can be "so bad, it's good" classic and just destroys all the hotties - and forces me to downgrade. All I ask is that once, once, you take into account my feelings and let the sexiest girls survive the film. Please.
