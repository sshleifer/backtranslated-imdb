This documentary was boring and quite silly. <br /> <br /> I think the documentary does not even know how Darwin's evolution works? It's a theory and the name is just plain. Reading the College biology text book could have told a documentary filmmaker what darwinism really is. Darwinism is a good theory, but it is bad if it is done in politics. br /> <br /> The documentary was also boring. I mean, it could have been edited for up to 35 minutes and then it would have been much better. <br /> <br /> There are many better documentaries than this ... it wasn't worth it ... get better information from Wikipedia = D DO NOT ATTENTION YOUR MONEY AND TIME!
