I loved the first "American Graffiti" with all my heart and soul that I thought it was the best movie to be the best teen flick I've ever seen with a zero roll. The first film made George Lucas a career who later blocked the epic "Star Wars" before making two decades later prequels, making Richard Dreyfuss jaws, closing third-class meetings and other films. /> <br /> In some way, without these two, magic died. <br /> <br /> "More American Graffiti" shows viewers what happened to the rest of the characters later in the 60s, when Steve (Ron Howard) and Laurie (Cindy Williams) protested against the Vietnam War, while their friend Terry "The Toad" Fields (Charles Martin Smith) is himself in war and is trying to get out. John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is still a California Driving Racer where he never left home. The rest are supported by actors in Candy Clark's Debbie (Terry's Girlfriend) movie, for Pharaoh's gang members, with Harrison Ford and others not really doing much. The original film showed teenagers on the streets without bloodshed with early music by Buddy Holly, The Fleetwoods, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Bill Haley and Comet, Buddy Knox, and other worshipers. classic music. The "More American Graffiti" soundtrack is a mix of rock, soul, country, hippie music and any mood from the late 60s to protest, drugs, sacrifices and more. <br /> <br /> After Watching More American Graffiti ", it seemed like he wanted to show the audience what happened after the first film's four main character headlines (except for Dreyfuss's character) where it wasn't necessary. because I was happy to see that neither Lucas nor Dreyfuss moved to bigger and better projects.
