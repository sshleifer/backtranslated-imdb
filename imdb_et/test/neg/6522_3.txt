This script was slightly original in 1935, but it is impossible to suggest poor results and inconsistent quality levels. Some vignettes are absolutely terrible and the dialogue is never natural. Some of the plot's twists were creative, but I was very surprised to see that I appreciated so much in IMDB. Some scenes are worth it, it's a movie that can't be completely entertained. If you like this kind of assembly, then don't run and get a "Tales of Manhattan" (1942) wonderful film that follows the life and times of the top layer.
