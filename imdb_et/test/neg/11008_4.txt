Although I found the actor to be excellent and cinematic beautiful, I was very disappointed with the adaptation! continue. It is never shown in the movie, they show it as if it were a sledding accident. <br /> <br /> The Mattie and Zenna symbol will almost disappear. When they almost change places in the novel, at the end of this customization they seem to be both disabled. <br /> <br /> The change of narrator to preacher was one effective change. <br /> <br /> Neeson and Arquette are great at depicting them. Joan Allen was also wonderful, but his character was alleviated by the Whartons short story. In general, I wouldn't recommend watching this movie if you haven't read the book because you're confused and frustrated.
