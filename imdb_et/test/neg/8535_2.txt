****** Spoilers ******* Inside What a boring, predictable, scary snore festival. The film lacked character development: I didn't feel any empathy with any character (except for the little boy) and didn't care what happened to them. There were so many elements stolen from clich√©s or other horror films. <br /> <br /> The film was so predictable. Sometimes I would say to myself: "Let me think {fill in guess} will happen next?" Yes, I was right. Even in the opening scene, I predicted that the "attack" of the family was a man, probably a father (because only women and children were attacked). Of course, this has happened (of course you should definitely wait 79 minutes). And, of course, another "evil human" scenario. Why was he evil and killed his family? Because he's a man, duh! <br /> <br /> As someone else has pointed out, this movie may be scary for anyone under the age of 13, or for a movie dating back to the 1970s, but it is a frightening film by FAR according to today's standards. AND, like many other fears, many fears were "fake". Frightening music, scary music, frightening music and ..... The crow's suddenly stealing crow! Wow, scary! <br /> <br /> How did the old bank lead the boy a few times to walk through the open lot without seeing his father? I thought the old man was a ghost. No, just a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I appreciated this movie out of 10 out of 10 because it keeps my attention enough to sit through the whole thing.
