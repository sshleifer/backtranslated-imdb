Sound: <br /> <br /> Seriously I've never seen a movie with a worse sound. There are scenes where people go through the grass and you can't hear them in the footsteps. They have to microsphere their feet. <br /> <br /> You know how they forget the line in some movies so they have to shoot it with their head on the back. Here the editors were not so clever. There's actually a scene where Shannon Tweed's character says his line without moving his lips! <br /> <br /> I am pretty sure that the background noise they played will have effects in the loop when shooting, because in many scenes the sound effects are different or missing when the camera angles change. <br /> <br /> I could write a lot more about how bad sound is in this movie. <br /> <br /> Other Nuggets: <br /> <br /> In this movie, they are likely to consider opening credits as special effects because they seemed so difficult to produce. The main title and some of the first names of open credits are white texts over white skies and they discourage them from being carefully hand-painted with each frame. <br /> <br /> The reuse of this movie is unbelievable. Most are around 15 rebels, but thirty or more are killed in each battle. If only the film was of a high enough quality to distinguish which ones die over and over again. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to note that rebels are usually killed due to explosions that are always 30 to 200 meters away. One scene has one scene where some rebels run out of the rebel base, and one repository shakes when the rebels leave the door. This will make you wonder if the hold will last so long that there will be an inevitable explosion. <br /> <br /> There is a blue helicopter that looks like a menacing couple, but somehow equipped with infinite equipment. rockets. When they show that missiles have come out of helicopter fields, they are often fired in unpredictable directions that resemble very large bottles. They can still easily capture their targets, which, as noted above, is always a very safe distance from the rebels they kill. Note that by pressing the LIVE button for a rocket fire, the pilot recycled materials (because it is printed vertically, the first few times we saw it, we read it as the "EVIL" button). <br /> <br /> Note how the grenade launcher they use will create identical explosions on helicopter missile plates. It is also fun in many scenes how the foreground actor takes a completely different direction than the group of enemy soldiers he kills. And often, characters shoot disproportionately many bullets to killed soldiers (such as when a short fire kills a large number of enemies). <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie is very bad. The plot's almost 5-year-old football game and editing is the worst I've ever seen. But frankly, sometimes it is fun to laugh for 90 minutes in an adult group who sincerely took part in such a terrible movie.
