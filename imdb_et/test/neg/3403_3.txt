The first movie I saw from these people was "The Children of the Grave" and when I heard it was coming, I thought it would be good to look mostly because Waverly is the real place to be declared haunted. This documentary / film was AWFUL! There were too many fake comments from producers, directors, cameramen ... they needed their face out of this movie. Waverly has heard that he has been haunted for a long time if anyone doubts in the film that they will undoubtedly believe that every story is fake than this documentary. Paranormal proof was terrible and almost non-existent. I've heard better EVPs from high school students with bathroom recorders! They tried to scare too hard things and the end result was that nothing was scary. Not stories, not blurry, too dark to see any video, not pictures, not tapes! The tomb's children were also bad, but at least it had some substance and a little bit of a factor. The only reason I give it is that the history of the exhibition was very good and informative. The only thing it was with this 2-hour mess was learning how the hospital got there, everyday life there and how it ended.
