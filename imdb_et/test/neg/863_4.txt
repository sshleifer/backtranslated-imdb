I happened to catch up with this movie late in the night. I saw an open credit and thought it would look good. Well, I was very wrong. Though it was not scary (he had funny and delicate moments) he had no sense of belonging. <br /> <br /> It started well with Kathy Bates, who had a medieval crisis when her husband left. his singing idol is murdered. But Kathy has played these failed women so well - think Fried Green Tomatoes. The problem was not Kathy, but the husband's scenario that was wrong all over the place. That is how writers should have thought about what we will do next. The script also seemed very natural. <br /> <br /> Some others who have commented on this movie have wondered why it didn't get cinematic release. The main reason I think it would have been embarrassing and murdered by critics. <br /> <br /> Having said all that I thought a little woman who played Maudie was fantastic and stole the movie, not to mention how beautiful she is.
