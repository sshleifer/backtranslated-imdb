Of the 8 comments on this topic, this movie was rated as a review, so let me improve the balance. <br /> <br /> If it is the best that British independent filmmakers offer, they will have to pack their cameras immediately and find jobs in another industry. Unfortunately, for me it was 82 minutes, which I never see and hopefully save some of you wasting 82 minutes. <br /> <br /> Although the idea of ​​the movie is interesting, it is not developed enough to hold the viewer. Student characters are nice and uninteresting and, frankly, they don't care what happens to them. Soldiers have practically seen quarries on every film, and I expected Captain Markovic to turn the imaginary mustache. Some of the consequences were quite good and depicted some imagination, but they had ruined shockingly bad performance, poor script writing and uneven camera work. The budget may be better than sending "actors" (and I use this term loosely) to classrooms or Thomas Brothers to a film school, or perhaps a spellchecker, because the subtitles were misspelled. The fact that the misspelled letters were not taken and corrected speaks of the immaturity of the whole production. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that positive comments are staged by filmmakers, whether they were watching a completely different movie. I ask Thomas Brothers to never give up their jobs if they continue in this area, they will definitely starve to death.
