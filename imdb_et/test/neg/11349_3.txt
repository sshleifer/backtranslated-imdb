No matter what the law and order, CSI (pick a city of choice) and killing: life on the weaker episodes of the street is better than the strongest episode of bones. <br /> <br /> David Boreanaz is anchored in angelic mode, and Emily Deschanel also depicts "bones" ... unrealistically. All participants have terrible scenes, whether they are forced or just terrible. <br /> <br /> Murderers are predictable for some time because the predictions and hints are too obvious. <Br>> <br /> The music is fine, although it is sometimes unnecessary. <br /> <br /> All in all, the bones are hardly an exhibition that I would recommend to see on weekdays, because it is a carbon copy of better exhibitions with unreal characters and increasingly faded stories. <br /> <br /> Skip if you can.
