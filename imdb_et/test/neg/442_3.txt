I was a fan of the London film AMERICAN WEREWOLF and so interesting whether a 16-year sequel can be made in French and local in large, supportive and small letters. Today I looked at the "edited FOX Network" version, which was a curious hybrid of several hyperactive queues. Scenarists and directors respect some key concepts: a tourist can bite a wolf, a full moon, a boy meet a girl, a boy gets wild, a boy dies after a ghost victim kills a hero. For me, the "strange aspect" of this "formula" of the special effect-driving of horror was the casting of the interest of a school comedy-love of television comedy "ED" as a victim of a werewolf spouse who is more or less uncertain. the lines they gave them. I have not seen another horror that this film is "consistent" (anti-vampire flick called BLADE), but I think some of this line must explain how the fucking werewolves (they are buggy) threaten the "good" werewolf couple during the long part of the movie . There is also the latest conflict at the Paris Metro Station, the SPEED. This 1997 studio product is an odd hybrid of the film, because for the intimidating purposes there are significant technical effects, but the real fears of the original are, in my opinion, completely damaged. Such a strange rewrite of the werewolf legend and "film mythology"!?! My suggestion to those who are considering this in a video store - go to the classic "top" for Thriller: Alfred Hitchcocki PSYCHO!
