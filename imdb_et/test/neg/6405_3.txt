You might believe that this game is related to a man who has been guessed by the number. And certainly, this is an interesting topic - can a person be so obsessed with something marginal as a simple number that he completely loses with reality and becomes hopelessly misleading and paranoid? <br /> <br /> Someone may have made a movie ever since. Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with the above, never like what the trailers (or even the film itself) would like to believe. I would like to say that this number is just MacGuffin, but that's not the case. This is pointless. The trick. Hook to an unsuspecting audience. <br /> <br /> What is a movie? A dog catcher (Carrey) who gets obsessed with a cheesy noir crime book because he feels that it somehow reflects his life. There. Of course, the character of the book - Detective Fingerling (sigh) - is (for some reason) obsessed with number 23, and Carrey himself becomes obsessed and starts to see that number everywhere ... but it's just cushioning and the story is totally irrelevant. In fact, you can cut out all 23 references and have a main character or cheese or something and you have exactly the same story. It is painfully obvious that all "23" things have been written unexpectedly after the story has been completed, rejected and sent to "rewrite". <br /> <br /> What would be OK. the film was not boring, boring, boring. Half of the movie has been told for crickets. You're not watching the movie, listening to Jim Carrey's movie. About a quarter of Carreys begins reading the book, and from then on until the end of the clich√©, we are forced to observe the "real life" scenes of the life of the dog catcher (where nothing happens) surrounded by the narrative artistic film Noir-Ish. "Scenes That Leave You Wilt Or Just Pressed. It's Like A Poor Man's" Sin City ", where all the violence is cut, what Carrey told you and what is slowly shown Ugh. <br /> <br /> It's a simple case where the C-film script is filmed somehow with the A-movie .. probably because the "number 23" hook, which I think is paper-intriguing enough to provide Hollywood premium treatment, but - as I said - the film is about 23- year, if it is related to cheese production in Switzerland, nothing can be felt, but cheated. <br /> <br /> I give "Fingerling - movie" 3 out of 10 because I think it didn't insult my intelligence as much as "Forsaken "made or put me directly into suicide, such as" Battlefield Earth ", and the bottom of the scale must be reserved for abominations such as these, but fear it is still a sadness.
