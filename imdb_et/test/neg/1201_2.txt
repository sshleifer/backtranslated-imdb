Without giving away my age, I saw it for the first time 20 years ago when it first appeared on the video (maybe it was a beta tape?) And I was old enough to drink (barely) and maybe I had some because I I remember this movie was great! Since then, I've seen this sober and I have to admit that it's a pretty bad movie. As mentioned in other posts, the plot is completely ridiculous, and the poor are just doing worse. It's a bad attempt to imagine that teenagers can also be "Mavericks" (although I'm surprised to know that it was the same time ("aprox") as "Top Gun", and in fact it wasn't a bad imitation. is worth - i find myself when it is on and i have time. This is one of the movies you look at because it's just so ridiculous and trying to take it so desperately. Like this other "great" movie - "Moment by Moment" with John Travolta and Lily Tomlin ... don't let me get started!
