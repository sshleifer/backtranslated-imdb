I'm trying desperately to watch Solomon Kane. I have about 20 minutes to go. If it gets better, I'll be back here and tell you, but I doubt it happens. Solomon Kane looks like it is based on the Dark Watch video game, and it seems to be based on the Legacy of Kane video game, but unfortunately it's not true. I hear that it is based on some comic book or graphic novel or paper, or something that I have never heard of, but whatever it is, is not original in this extremely boring movie. The atmosphere is a stolen movie 300 that was not so great in the first place. Strong overactivity takes me so seriously that it is almost hypnotic and clear that I do it badly. The plot is practically non-existent: a violent man who tries to be violent, meets a friendly family, murders a friendly family, and a violent man becomes violent again. All the characters are stereotypes taken from Waterworld or Eli or mountains with eyes or whatever, just choose another apocalyptic slash fantasy slash movie you've seen and there. Somebody, somewhere, said it was making a movie: use a blue filter to make everything mysterious, add plenty of filthy pictures that splash in dim mirrors, add snowflakes that move around, while two boring characters tell each other and oh yes rain color to ignore the fact that nothing is happening, and don't forget that the black silhouettes that come to us come on fire and burns a lot and of course the blurred fighting scenes at a time that is not clear what's really going on for special effects, so just throw away the metal sound, and by the way, don't let any sign survive long enough for the audience to understand, associate or sympathize with them and between your fingers, hope the fans of sword and witchcraft will eat it, even though it is a complete doo doo , and go straight to the video, not going to the GO. . .
