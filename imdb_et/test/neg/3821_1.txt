I read the latest comments and couldn't wait to see the movie. but after passing 80 minutes of predictable "surprises" that didn't make me jump and unrealistic cable, I was very disappointed. I thought the cartoons were the only movies that were still just 80 minutes away. I thought it might be due to changes that make it an "R" value, but the original contained only "Kill Bill" blood for ten minutes. When blood flows like hoses, reality loses its appeal. Add to the killer who should be a "ghost", but can hang someone out of the jaw (the area of ​​King Kong with T-Rex), live through everything and finish like the end of the soprano finale, and you can be the most overrated movie in recent years. After watching the film, I felt that I had seen countless movies with the same plot and method and felt a lot of dissatisfaction. I don't get what everyone else saw, but if you want a good horror movie this weekend, look at Halloween, it's definitely worth $ 10. With Hatchet, we hope that the next IS is based on the book.
