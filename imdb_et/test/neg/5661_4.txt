The first time I saw this example, it was OK. There were some funny moments and I laughed a few times, but this show is getting worse and worse. Carly and Sami's web exhibition is not a little funny. They play stupid video from the internet, scream at the camera and make very bad jokes. And then the laugh is gone? One of the problems with the exhibition is that no protagonist is funny. Carly is not funny. Miranda Cosgrove's behavior is the best. Acting at his show is not something he does with Drake and Josh. His friend Sam is very rude and crude, and the play is written in a way that makes him look like a mountain. I mean, they're kidding their mother who rides on a rusty old truck, her mother shattering an old TV with a bat, and then joking at Samis school, capturing all the time and running from the police. None of this is funny. Then there is Freddy, who is a computer geek. She's not too funny if her mother doesn't treat her like a child. The only funny full-time character of the exhibition is Carly's brother Spencer. He makes some funny jokes and does some pretty funny things like pretending they're driving a spaceship, making a spacecraft noise, tapping the baton of girls scouting when they did the same thing to him. His material is the only thing that deserves to laugh. In addition, the characters of other factors also show bad. Like the fact that a couple of kids who show up on a local web from a Seattle apartment have been hit all over the world and got a free trip to Tokyo? Another thing is how a 26-year-old single man who does not have a real job can pay for a 2-level apartment in downtown Seattle and raise his 13-year-old sister and pay for a room full of camera and sound, including remote control projector and green screen and HD camera? It sounds like a 10-year-old. The worst thing is that the exhibition contains some pretty suspicious content. There are a few times when Carly (I remember a 13-year-old girl) appears in her bikini head for her internet exhibition. WTF? Then I saw an episode where Freddy tells Carly and Sam that he "sleeps JUST with his socks before the evening." I mean WTF? Then there is an episode where Carly's rival Nevel agrees to use her website's rights and agrees to give her back to the site for a kiss. Creepy! And I just saw an episode where Carly meets a boy who just moved in his apartment house and has a backache and pulls his shirt and Carly stands where he flees. I can't believe Nick even allows them to show such things, and I can't believe it's created by the same man responsible for Drake and Joshi. This exhibition is not suitable for children under 12 and is even questionable. iCarly is just another long-term list of Nick's programming.
