I found this film a great disappointment, especially considering the lie. The characters are not plausible, as are the ridiculous circumstances in which they find themselves. Only part of the movie I enjoyed was when the most annoying characters finally killed. Special effects consist mainly of scenes from dead or dead bodies. A typical unimaginable slip. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that it would be impossible to believe that a reclusive creature slipping in the middle of the night can be caught by a clumsy, noisy idiot. . It is also impossible to believe how they knew exactly that it is, despite the fact that the creature has refrained from catching or even taking pictures. <br /> <br /> A person who makes Chupacabra impossible in life is our one-dimensional dr Pena (Giancarlo Esposito). The only thing Dr. Pena is obsessed with is the creature's throwing weapon. The Dart weapon, which just worked for the bullets, can't. <br /> <br /> The ship's captain (John Rhys-Davies) is introduced as a war veteran. He uses his military ability to shoot his men into the creature, no matter which ships they are. Naval seals that do not appear anywhere, repeat all sorts of imaging models. <br /> <br /> Dylan Neal plays the cruise ship insurance gauge to catch the thief. He spends most of the film tagging with someone who is currently trying to kill the creature. <br /> <br /> The creature is not even close to Chupacabra. Nor does it work. Instead of a small, shy, secret animal, hidden at night, we get a bullet-proof Freddy Kruger, who kills everyone on the horizon. A simple search on Google would have been very helpful for writers and the special effects team.
