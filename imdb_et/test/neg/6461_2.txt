This show is fantastic and we have enjoyed it thoroughly. In Alaska, I disagree with homosexual content at today's exhibition. I feel you're pushing too hard to bring New York Alaska. One thing about this is in New York, who is fighting for Alaska's wildlife, but is trying to change the city of Alaska to New York? It's a nice show of funny women and real Alaska men, and bringing the same sex pair to the mix is ​​throwing a balance. Alaska should be portrayed as a man and a New York woman. I think the first nine displays have the perfect balance with what you all do. Don't we get a beautiful sample without the imbalance of nature.
