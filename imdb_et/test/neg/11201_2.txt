Has it ever happened to you? I'm going to my local video store and see some new arrivals in the "movie noir" section. I spy a copy of the arrival of a new movie I never called NAKED ALIBI. This is one of those mail order video companies that offer (mostly) "dupey" looking copies that are hard to find. The description in the box sounds good. I like the players (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame and Gene Barry). So I'll take it home and watch it. About ten minutes of this movie I started thinking. About half of this movie I did not like. By the time the movie ended, I didn't just like it, I despised it. The film opens with the police, who have doubts about Al Willis's suspicion of robbery. Outside the drunk, the police have nothing. When he pushes the police and demands that he be allowed to go home, the police beat him. Arrives Detective Conroy, lets the police stop beating and then Willis clearly announces. Willis swears that he will get revenge. Later, one of the police officers is dead. There is no evidence that Willis is "painful" about beating, Conroy will make Willis his only suspect, despite the fact that his boss calls two mobiles a suspect. Conroy arrests him, but due to lack of evidence Willis is released. The next day, another two police will kill the bomb. This time Conroy goes to the bakery that Willis owns and tries to confess. Conroy doesn't know this, but a local journalist whose paper has blamed the Conroys police cruelty department hits Conroy's picture trying to strangle Will and Conroy. But Conroy continues to work and Willis escapes to Mexico, where Willis has a mistress. Conroy can convince his mistress (who will treat Willis quite harshly) to prove that Willis is a killer. This movie is not a convincing script. The script looks just like a rough draft was written and filming started before the finished script was completed. Things happen, characters' personalities change, plot jerks happen for some other real reason than what the script requires. Besides the fact that Willis now wants to look for a glass, there is nothing in the beginning of the film that would make us think he is a crazy killer who deceives his wife. He treats his wife, his child and his employees well. At the beginning of the movie, you get the impression that his Conroy is the one with the cannon. He seems to agree with the brutality of the police. Conroy, for some reason, is not convinced that Willis has a criminal past. He seems to be acting in the motto of the Bulgarian old Communist police; "Everyone is guilty of something we haven't yet learned." Later, Conroy shows friendliness to Al's mistress and young son, now we should like him. Sorry! Early impression that Conroy stayed with me for too long. And he's a stupid cop. It is only after he has been fired and goes to Mexico that he checks Willis's background check and finds out that Maryland has been ordered. Why didn't he think about it before? Because this movie was not enough worn out of time. The cast is good. Gene Barry is good at how badly he imagined Al Willis' role. I'm a big fan of the 40's and 50's criminal thrillers, but not only did it think the movie was good, it left me in a bad taste (something many modern movies do, but older movies rarely do).
