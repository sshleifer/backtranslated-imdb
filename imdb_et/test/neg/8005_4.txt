The circus could have been so much better if they had reduced the number of twists and developed every better movie that has very talented emissions, which usually works well, but it loses the audience in principle, because everyone is back and everyone is not beating them at the same time because they are persecuting someone else and working .... did I lose you? well the film is still confusing clearly written by the first timer writer, it has some redemption properties though acting especially in Famke Janssen looks like Lily, but unfortunately gets a lot of USELESS screen time just standing there doing something ..... dialogue is a bit cheesy and accents are sometimes irritating However, viewing it is worth it if you are a fan of some actor, especially John and Famke, who get the most time on the screen, remember it with a laptop so you can write who is double overrun, every second.
