I got this North American premiere at the Chicago International Film Festival. I was disappointed. I wasn't the only one in the audience's mood. <br /> <br /> The film takes a long time to reach the conflict and then refuses to resolve it by choosing to tell us the story. "Continues". Is it a spoiler that shows that the film has no end? I find it more of a warning. At best, it's just half the movie, not a good one.
