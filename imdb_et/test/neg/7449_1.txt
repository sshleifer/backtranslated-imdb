The first Robocop had a sense of cynical reason and sick violence. It was a good thing to walk, but Paul Verhoeven pulled it off and made the film so well, he made a sequel. How terrible. (Possible spoilers in front - though everything that can spoil it is outside me). <br /> <br /> Irvin Kershner is not the director of this movie. He obviously did not understand the original concept and as a result, the seemingly massive seemingly meaningless violence seems very bad - and worse, it is very unpleasant. Even worse is the musical result. Leonard Rosenman was an old man of another era and heroic, light music doesn't match the pictures on the screen! What did he value?! Great American Hero?! The worst thing is that he completely removed Robocop's theme from the first movie, which was so memorable and perfect. Can you imagine a Superman movie without John Williams' fanfare or Indiana Jones etc? How can he do that? !! <br /> <br /> The plot is just a set of ideas that do not gel. At first we see Robot in pursuit of his old wife. Good, good idea. But they fall on it. Then it's a stupid idea to program Robot into a beautiful company. It will be thrown for 10 minutes and then immediately off. Or it is a foolish idea that a 10-year-old reluctant drug addiction reminds Robo of his son - once again, a weak motif that is briefly shown twice and dropped. It may work in a comic book, but at the time, the film and Frank Miller did not have too much inexperience and all the ideas with the kitchen sink. It does not work as a whole. <br /> <br /> Some of the people here are praising this film and police privatization. This is the best part of the film that is in line with the first. However, the old man in the original was a tough businessman to make a profit, but in the end it was fair. In this film he is just pure evil for the lust of his money and power. You just can't change such signs without reason. And Nancy Allen's character is useless in this movie, while at first she was very important in searching for Robo. He's just as free as violence in this movie. <br /> <br /> And violence, yes violence. I enjoy many violent, bloody movies when they serve goals and are meant to tell a story. It seems that Irvin Kershner gives up people who are being blown into pieces, fired into pieces, children die of death and torture, and people's desire for drugs. He doesn't know when to stop. Do we really need to see every last innocent bystander (even people trying to help others)? This is inferred when we see bad Robocop shooting repeatedly! Instead, Mr Kershner proves that he has very little taste for this work and creates a terrible confusion that is a terrible piece of pop art and, worse, the nasty message of violence for every young person watching this movie. <br /> <br /> No, this movie is not meant to be a message, and I definitely don't look at Robocop movies or an alien or Predator. However, if you go too far and cross the border, you have to question what you are doing. And like this movie, the evil child's drug dealer, according to the latest words, when he dies, "It still sucks".
