Why Wes Craven's filmmaker wants to give his name to such an annoying clich√© collection as anyone thinks. And if he made money for it - all 50 pounds, judging by appearance - he would have to return to the director's door when the movie was released. There are many "alien" attacks and this is one of the worst. Even reliable Lance Henriksen, who is foolish enough to let his children move around in a dangerous government lab, cannot save it. For the treatment of insomnia it determines 10+. For quality filmmaking - forget about it.
