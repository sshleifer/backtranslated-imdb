I've never commented on IMDb, but when I saw this movie, I can't be quiet. I just set up my account here because of this terrible movie. in two words this is PURE CRAP. the movie doesn't make any sense! There's no point in this movie. Watching this movie was a pain. I don't understand why Val Kilmer agreed to make this movie. He plays violence as a gang leader, says a few words, and he is there like 5 minutes together. <br /> <br /> I bought it on DVD just because Val Kilmer's name is in the box and interesting pictures As the second review said, Moscow stole my zero money and I want it back! The title of the film brought an assessment that everyone should give: ZERO
