The problem with making such a lyrical film is that you make a masterpiece or a lemon: there is little middle ground. Gently, it's not "Berlin - a city symphony" or "a man with a movie camera". Unfortunately, it is not so much to look at. <br /> <br /> The problem is that it is clean and half baked, as if Michael Moore had come on board. It really has nothing to say or rather show us pictures and sounds. Koyanisqatsi cumulatively uses pictures as a thesis. It's just a bit of a search on the site. (In spite of this, unintentionally, the film speaks of Uncle Sami's intentions as it intends. The anti-technology, anti-civilization, anti-media film that is so deeply built on technology is something deeply paradoxical. "Do as I say and not as I do. ‚ÄùYou just have to love Yanks, maybe there is something sour and misanthropic about this episode. In both episodes, there were moments of lyricism and joy, this time the tone is consistently glowing. Mahler tells you. <br /> <br /> Naqoyqatsi is a stylistically confused. It is particularly misleading whizzy digital stuff. It gives the whole thing a totally cumbersome, overprocessed look, and it also undermines the "realistic" nature of a similar "found footage". part of Koyanisqate's joy was that it was a tribute to the use of an optical film. historical artefact, they have to "accept the digital domain" but i Digital stuff often look like CNN or BBC World video links.) And "found with footage", digital manipulation is often ugly and usually just stupid and wrong color and solarisation Think of me ... <br /> <br /> ahem ... <br /> <br /> James Bond's title sequences. <br /> <br /> Ahem. Strange, as it may seem, is the possibility that the film is simply stolen by Yo Yo Ma's performance; it is about as remarkable as Lawrence Olivier. These pictures should be joyful to resist all this charisma. <br /> <br /> Philip Glass is odd; has never waited for him to knock Verdi's requiem! (I smiled, which of course is not the answer to this film). There's even one piece of music that sounds like Brahms. (?) Maybe they have changed their pills. <br /> <br /> From our "Idle Questions" Department: Is Geoffrey Reggio actually an Hop Indian? Or did he just sweat in the Hollywood mountains? Oh, and are the bits of different fragments of the earlier "episodes" of trilogy a comment on how these films are part of the global media outlet?
