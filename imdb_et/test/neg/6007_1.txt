overpriced, poorly written, ill-acted. did the academy even follow it? I don't think so. political content guaranteed him an Oscar nomination - the Indo-pack border - a little boy, terrorism. Attention is paid to the word "terrorist" in the post 11-11 world. his similar Holocaust films, guaranteed to the Oscar candidate, regardless of their content. <br /> <br /> and cinema doesn't mean taking landscapes that are in a good place. You have to be a purulent shooter to make the wilderness beautiful. at least it won't win the Oscars. they got this right at least. would have been travesty.
