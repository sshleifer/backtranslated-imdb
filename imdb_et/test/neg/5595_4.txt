1 review 9.09.2008, 4 out of 10 (Dir-J.S. Cardone): Sexual-political thriller that can't really succeed in these areas, except early on, with interesting soft cores. The film begins to portray a couple who is studying their sexual fantasy in their work environment or wherever they are and fits their fiction. The couple will take a tour of the retreat and the sauna, where they will get to the woman who is ready to take part in the three and fill in some of her fantasies. Here we only know that this couple is good, but we do not know until they return, that the bride is part of a well-functioning political family. The man hopes that he will rise to the point where the marriage will be the seat of the congress. They then receive a package from the anonymous source, with clear images of their accumulation from the bath and their beginning, how and why they were filmed, who sent the package, what they want, and how to delete their names before they get out of it. This qwest becomes an obsession that takes them deeper into the seeding world and takes a lot of time until their friends and family think about what they are doing all day and why they are taking care of it all the time. This film is sometimes interesting but moves to ridicule because they are looking for the problem personally, rather than getting the police involved early in their pride. This mistake, of course, keeps the movie going. The performances are good, despite the non-listings, but the situation is badly ignored and the film starts to change to about half. And, of course, they finally throw a twist that breaks and challenges everything that happened before (as is the norm these days, if they don't know what else to do to film the film). However, this doesn't help this movie a bit.
