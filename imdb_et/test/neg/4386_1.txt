This movie was like collecting people from other movies and they decided to make a very bad movie. She was "The Cosby Show" girl "Detroit Rock City", a guy who kissed a chick and bought this sausage, was a "corporation boy" and there was more. OK, that doesn't make a bad movie by itself, it was just something I noticed. The whole thing with a whore and the same French name was a stupid and thing where 37 people wrote these notes and if you think they're going to get mixed up ... ... enough shocking ....... you called it. And the purse was just stupid. It was so bad that I watched the movie in two parts, and I still made only a 50-minute mark. If you look at it and wait for "Van Wilder" or such a movie ...... Don't.
