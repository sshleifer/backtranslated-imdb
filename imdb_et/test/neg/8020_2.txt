This is a weak visit to just about anything: refugees, Croatian-Slovenian relations, globalization, sexual orientation. A very clumsy metaphor about Slovenia's crossroads between the past, symbolized by all that is the Queen of the "virgin" household and its future, symbolized by listening to music in clubs and lesbians and never by children. <br /> <br /> He plays a pretty recent Slovenian legend that includes a virgin and a "king of the forest" taking his goat shape (Zlatorog Beer's images are also based on this legend), but unfortunately, the treatment is inconsistent. that the end justifies the means: he can use all kinds of "dreamy" sequences and then choose and choose what are true and what are imaginable. How can the "king of the forest" ride a jeep be real for all three girls, but the scene outside the tent is real only Simona's imaginary? The end just pulls on and on (I can't believe the movie's running time is only 98 minutes, have I looked at the director's piece without knowing it?), While three girls watching the camera for about 10 seconds, I'm afraid and happy at the same time ( so obvious. <br /> <br /> I've never thought I could do a bad thing about a movie that I don't understand, but it didn't take long to see "Simona" works mostly as if she was playing in a silent movie. <br /> <br /> It wasn't as bad as I thought the director was just about to start and wanted to capture what he thought his generation was about to film, making a semi-experimental movie until I realized that the director was in the film actually 37 years old and his work is probably "serious".
