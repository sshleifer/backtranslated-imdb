This seventh (yes, you read correctly - in the seventh) Puppet Master movie shows how the demented puppet group came; by a French puppeteer who uses them to revenge a group of fairy tales who are after him to find out that he has a secret of life. She was taught by a witch while she was running before she died. He used this power to bring normal dolls to life. This sequel is basically nonsense, scattered even more senselessly than most Puppet Master queues. Thanks to PG13 rating, we don't even get any fun puppet error. Come to think, there's no murder of a fucking doll. If there were one franchise that would have to be interrupted, it would be. No more ... God, please don't ...
