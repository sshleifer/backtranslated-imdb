John Waters owes me 2 hours. I saw this road in 1990, and I'm still hurt. Not before or since I have seen such terrible film waste on the screen. There is nothing positive about this movie. Action - terrible; plot - ridiculous; music - cruel. After the movie, my friends and I asked for money from the theater organizer. He explained that because it was a free screening, he couldn't give us anything, no matter how much we tortured. How Johnny Depp's career over the disappearance of this film train is likely to be somebody's.
