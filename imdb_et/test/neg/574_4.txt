"Letter of Love" is one of those films that could have been really smart, but they wasted it. Focusing on the letter that causes destruction in a small town, the film has an adult star that has nothing to do. Tom Selleck and Alice Drummond had recently played in a super-fun "In & Out" (also in a small town upset) where they were both big, but here they look like drugs are scattered. I can't say what the people behind the camera are trying here (if any), but they certainly didn't do anything. How tragic that a potential laughing attack could be wasted.
