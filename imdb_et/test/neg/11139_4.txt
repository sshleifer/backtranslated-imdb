Andy Warhol's images in the films I Shot Andy Warhol and Basquia, this is a film I would predict that Andy Warhol might be thin, illogical, snobbish, amoral. The film's (almost non-existent) plot, which is sometimes incredibly incredible, compensates for the film's harsh, real cinematography. The film has the potential to be unrealistic but dictate to the viewer reality. The only valuable part of the film is the development of the relationship between Joe and Holly, and all things in it should be seen as a characterization tool. There are a couple of comic scenes that I admit that they are funny, but the trash is really just a typical study of freed up people who are pleasantly enjoyable if you don't mind watching nuds and i.v. drug use.
