The time I look back at high school, and it amazes me that I never went to Marvin on this BAD movie. <br /> <br /> Poor Marv is the main character who is bad for worse and worse. Despite his intelligence, he succeeds in harassing, exploiting, supporting his evil dead father, and much more momentum, including a brave gossip that says he is not completely planning. Of course, the viewer does not recognize empathy in this film, so all this catastrophic darkness collides like harmless zeta. Recommended these days, when you feel down, pop this movie and smile and say, "I'm so glad I'm not Marv!"
