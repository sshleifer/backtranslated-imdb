The original Australian Kath & Kim is great. Why do American manufacturers need a classic show again? Remember the original version of "Office" with Ricky Gervais, it was an absolute masterpiece and didn't need to be redesigned. The producers said that the British humor "The Office" and the Australian humor "Kath & Kim" would not translate to the American audience ......... WHAT ??? In principle, they say that Americans are too stupid and stupid to understand jokes, so they have to rephrase exhibitions at all with childish gags, so that Americans understand humor. Kath & Kim's original Australian version is fantastic and very funny. Avoid American version like plague!
