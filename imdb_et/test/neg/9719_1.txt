OK ... before I even start with more or less constructive criticism of the film, I would like to say a few words that come from my heart ... This movie sucks !!!! DON'T BE NOTING THAT POSSIBLE TO STOP AND STOP, NO-PLOT STORIES. So let's see why I think the film is so bad: 1. There's no story. No plot. The director tried to create a mystery that was not there. 2. The whole thing looks like a big, an hour and a half promotion for some-go-wanna-but-still-looking-like-"BSB" band ... All school boys are perfect abs, no fat or young people. .. not a good looking girl in the movie, not one. The main character in the pool is wet or all sweaty in bed ... a bad man. Must be terrible to go for such a date to sweat. 3. Can these men do something good with their authority? Something good? As the fire in this old one is pushed away, your friend who got into the accident helped or help, rather than just running around and showing one another. 4. Woodwork. The main character has only two expressions in its form. Expression number one: sad. Expression number 2: trying to look seductive, but still looks sad ... In this boy band there are 4 men: the main, his best friend who got into an accident, blondy and the fourth ... what was the fourth name? I think he was talking twice during the film: once in the beginning (he said jumping from the rock using the "power" didn't kill them) and the second time he lost the blondy girl. the movie could have been done without him and no one notices ... Anyway, my decision: 1 is the perfect result for this movie. Guys - don't go see it. There are very few actions, not intercourse, hot girls. Girls - at least the actors are good looking ... What would I recommend to you to get the soundtrack for this movie - that's the only thing I liked about it.
