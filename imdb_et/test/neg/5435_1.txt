Anyone who has seen a ghostly stinking poo called Congo understands my name. And I know you. This movie wasn't just bad. It was painful. The book was stupid, the script was even sad and the cast was terrible. Dylan Walsh? The rumor is that Julia Roberts shot her ass down because this film was so bad. Large Diamonds? Killer gorillas? Talking about Gorillas? Hmmm. Sounds like a hit! Oh! Tim Curry's accent in this movie is so bad that I would be deaf! I recommend this to filmmakers who want to crush after heavy meals or Kavorki patients who just need another reason to die. If it is faithful to the book, I would say that we will burn a good old fashion Footloose book and destroy every copy. If future generations look back and find the rubbish, how do we explain ourselves? Listen to others who hated this movie! Don't look at it! Run away! DON'T watch this movie! If you think it's full of action or temporary or cool effects, you're bad! If you think it blows more than Nicole Ritchie, you would be right. So if you still look at Crapo, Mean Congo, I say you do it after taking 50 Tylenol PM.
