The only reason I saw this little-known Irish film was whether Mike Myers had played a normal and dramatic character. Well, he was and his action was pretty good, but unfortunately it was probably the only good thing I could say about this movie. At first, the film follows the life of the 12-year-old Mickey, who lives with his brother and sister somewhat eccentric grandmother. Despite some strong language, it seems like a family movie, but after a while it turns out that Pete Meteor is hardly suitable for the drama of young audiences. And the worst thing is that it is both a ridiculous and even a totally incredible schedule with drama. One superfluous story becomes second, and there is little point in the events on the screen at all times. I think when life's drama needs a meteor or something else that looks like a more ridiculous spiritual content that is really a bad sign. The characters are not much better than the story. Despite all his worries, Mickey is by no means a pleasant character, but it was obviously something we had to take care of and even feel compassion for him. It does not work. Same thing with other characters. They are mostly as ridiculous as the story itself with the character of the title (although it was not the main character) as the only bright spot. At the end of the film I still had a great hope that something unlikely and absurd was behind. Unfortunately, even if the author of the story had such intentions (and I am sure he was) in the movie they are hidden and virtually unknown in the case of such a strange script. Rating: 3 out of 10. Those who want to see Mike Myers as a drama actor can look at Pete Meteor for this reason, but the rest of the viewers are probably bitterly disappointed.
