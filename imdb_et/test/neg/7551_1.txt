Perhaps the worst movie in this genre exists. It was proclaimed comedy, but is simply tragically pathetic. I don't think anyone would have got any terrible and irritating when specifically asked. It is a toilet with humor in its poorest, even avoiding looking at the trailer. I was just going to look at it because it was reported that if you like Monty Python, it's definitely in love. Who wrote it was either biased or seriously dropped. I am still confused about how to believe this statement honestly. I rarely leave the cinema, really, for the film, I have a lot of trouble doing it for me: it only took 30 minutes.
