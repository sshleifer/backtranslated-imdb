This belabored and sloppy spy melodrama with two buffers (one idealistic, one drug addition) KGB children who deal with KGB secrets does not seem to have the strength to maintain tension and tension before it dies two hours later very slowly. John Schlesinger's finished product gives the impression that he, under the direction of his director, mostly lingered when the film breaks down and the actors are sleeping, except for the very annoying performance of Sean Penni. The childhood altar boys and friends Chris (Tim Hutton) and Daulton (Penn) are working on a plan to sell secrets to the KGB when Chris relieves a job that allows him to gain access to secret government material. Disappointed by what he sees as US intervention in foreign affairs, idealistic Chris and drug-hungry Daulton are contacting the Russians and are beginning to relieve them of classified material. When Chris decides he wants, things start to unfold at an insufficient pace. <br /> <br /> Eighties were not kind to the kind director John Schlesinger. In the 1960s and 1970s, he was so critically acclaimed in both England and America, but then in 1981 Honky Tonk Freeway came to an end. Falcon and the snowman put it on the cover more or less. Between Marathon Man and high-quality performances (Hoffman Voight, Christie, Jackson, Finch, Olivier) he was absent from past leadership in the past. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn sees the landscape from start to finish in such an unpleasant way that you find yourself encouraging your tormentor to do more with him. Tim Hutton is led by his limited foundations and most of his scenes show the need for more trial time. Lori Singer as Hutton's girlfriend plays it quietly with Schlesinger to film her coat of arms. When she emits, you understand why. Only David Suchet, a KGB handler with a penetrating eye-catching presence and security system, is doing well.
