Another sequel! Why do they do them on earth? It must be the weakest "franchise", but it is financed and spawn continues. SCARECROW GONE WILD - what I just looked at to officially bring the whole series to the trash - brings back an evil man who once again carries out a college child for butchers ... It's basically that. Functional sucking (as usual), death scenes are not pathetic and must not be deceived by the title, this is not as much nudity as you think. Couple of nice topless girls, but nothing too pants tightening. Allow me to end my continuous insult (or review) of this movie, saying: When I come across SCARECROW IN SPACE or FREDDY VS SCARECROW on the shelves of video products, I am in absolute awe ...
