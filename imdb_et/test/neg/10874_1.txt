Because this is what Hell Ride is pretty much about. Larry Bishop and Tarantino compete for Weinstein's money with the promise of sometimes filming off the line. I'm all fake horses and as much as the next boy, but did we really need a movie? Really, nothing is worse than the used waste of old trends. And I'm not even talking about the cinema of the 70's, because Hell Ride does not have the raw and unpolished feel of the era he wants to respect. No, it's a slippery and shiny MTV Hollywood. The old trend I am talking about is a self-conscious pseudo-hip quirky cinema, where Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie and Robert Rodriguez. All three men were at least talented and found success for a reason. Hell Ride is simply a used copy, prickly and intrusive, polished to the maximum cost if it should be raw, "supercool" aspect to be forced and silly. <br /> <br /> There is no reason why such a simple and completely naughty story should be spoken in a complex, occasional round-trip. It's just a descendant of Tarantino. There is also no reason why dialogues should be so meaningless, people worship their gums, saying NO: at least when Travolta spoke about cheese markets in Pulp Fiction, he felt fresh. Dialogues are a little more than pseudo-macho posturing. There is also no reason why the rock'n'roll guitar on the grid should be bluntly confused with the whole film. Maybe the lowest hit of hell when he tries to be quasi-existential. There is fun and dream / illusion where the bishop eats peyote and sees the colors. I was half-waiting for the old Indian language to come out and offer wisdom clothes. <br /> <br /> The only savvy grace with this abysmal turtle is the boy and the Vinnie Jones monologue from their wings tattoos (and maybe some out of the desert). Lots of boobage and hot little clad babes. Now I have something behind, but a movie they're not doing. Everything else is just an empty shell, an imitation of other endlessly talented imitators.
