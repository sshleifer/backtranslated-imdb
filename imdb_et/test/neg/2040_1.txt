Rome is an art student ... or something. He has dreamed that they are crucified and Satan himself has raped him. She owns her (think) and makes her sex-dependent. That's all I can and I turned it off. <br /> <br /> The meaningless "exorcist" hangs. I got it back with 80s cables and was terrible ... and not in good shape! This movie should be a horror film, but it does not change anything other than a sex film that is a hidden horror movie. There's a lot of useless nudity in the woman, and the leading player has to break down more than once. We see that Satan has raped (a hot-looking man), masturbating, coming to his father ... I have to give my points for bravery. Add to this bad copying, editing (rape scene looks like it was a bit cut), nervous action and story that makes no sense. One disturbing order (nailing it perpendicularly) ALMOST works, but the sad "special" effect destroys it. This is one of the few movie films that was so bad that I stopped. Skip it.
