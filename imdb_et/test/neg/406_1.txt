I picked it up, because after spending some time in New York in the Albany area, I felt a few people in the movie and I happened to happen to it. Comedy experiments are flat, the compulsory girl-scene is sick, the plot is non-existent, one of the worst I've ever seen, and I'm not even starting to get special effects. I understand that this is a very low budget movie made by a small independent company, but if you are going to make a huge sci-fi horror, don't make huge mistakes completely unbelievable. People want to see huge mistakes. It's a lot of fun there. And if you are going to make gigantic mistakes completely unbelievable, at least get the actors out of this fact some sort of language-in-cheek allusion ("You are idiots! They aren't! Doubles!"). Be prepared to live two hours of your life so you can never come back.
