I was watching this movie just because I had the impression that I was treated with a cheesy horror flick. I mean, look at the label line: "They're men out! And worse ... they're still alive!" Does it shout to you cheesy horror movie? And then the title itself is "Screamers". I thought it was a great horror movie. Unfortunately, I did not know that the real title was "an island of fishermen". <br /> <br /> So, looking around for an hour, I realized that it wasn't an exciting horror movie at all - it was a fun "adventure" story of mucus fish from Atlantis. "Men turned out"? There was nothing like that. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Damn you, misleading characters! I want these 81 minutes back from my life!
