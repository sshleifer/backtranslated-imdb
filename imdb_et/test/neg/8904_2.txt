This movie is in the right place in the heart, but unfortunately it's not much of a movie. It is a hidden documentary of a narrative. Bamako is basically a newspaper that is put on celluloid. However, your average well-researched work is much more confident and shorter than the one presented here. The filmmaker tries to look at the difficulties of the African life, especially in the state of Mali, based on the unethical practices of the IMF, the G8 and the World Bank, using the abovementioned test rush. The film is scattered for another 10 minutes, which makes the narrative plot a favored and bizarre Hollywood western-style shootout scene, where the director feels quite pleased with his serenity (hence the frequent Godard comparisons) <br /> <br /> Of course, when the film begins, what and who has ever been explained in the trial, but as we now know, the French refuse to give their audience a spoon. <br /> <br /> There are many surprised arguments, but they are often long, presented in a slightly monotonous (one that becomes somewhat fairly easy to set up) and very special. The last point is the most depressing, because there is a very well-founded case against the institutions. Unfortunately, what we have after 2 hours is that the IMF and the G8 are evil stressors and should give the third world a debt. We are only given a random hint of the specific reasons why the organizations involved in the trial are guilty, but never a clear case. The study's arguments and the shots of the surrounding village make the suffering of their African people clear, but wonder why we need to sit down for 2 hours when a 20-minute Newsweek article can paint a much more accurate picture or an episode of Bill Moyers. Finally, there is something very important in this matter, it is simply not presented very well or very clearly in this pretentious, tender work.
