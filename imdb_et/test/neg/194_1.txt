This movie is an insult to the game on which it is based. Claude's character has been left out of ignorance, leaving painful results that are not even vaguely similar to the original plot. Shame, shame, shame. They have also cut a fair number of initial scores in the context of the changes in which the songs are sung. It throws the movie into the air and causes the viewer, who is aware of how to give this screen writer, a wife of Hud, makes Sheila a corrupt rich girl, characterizing Claude as a cowboy and killing the Burger instead of sending him Vietnam. If no one knows the original plot, I assure you that this is not a bad movie to see, but if you want to see the original or you are, as I am, a fan of the classic game. it would be best to avoid the movie at all. One must really stick to one or the other.
