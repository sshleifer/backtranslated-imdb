I was thinking about this movie when I looked at the plutonium nash ... why ... since both films have a randy quaid that plays a slowed robot, this movie has been made for years, but probably the scriptwriter who drank the same biotoxic coffee or wrote something like that. ..If ... EVERYTHING EXCEEDS EVERYTHING, even with respect to the late great Andy Kaufman, it is hard to do ... find another movie or just look at taxi transfers on latenight tv ... the nature of his ladka gravas is so much lovable ... ATTENTION YOUR BERRY OTHER
