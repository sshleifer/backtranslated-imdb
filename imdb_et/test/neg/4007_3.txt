Finally. Here is a film that does the same as the reputation of Greek and Russian men as "Gigli" was made by Mr Affleck and Mrs. Lo. City EDGE details the sad and bad lives of young Russian emigrants living in and around Athens and spend their time on car ignition, invasion, female emigration and prostitution ("But we are not gay because we are not, you know .... And if we do, it will only be one or two times, only the locality of Athens will add a little bit of novelty - even then there is only a scene or two that is picturesque. Writer / director Constantine Giannaris ("3 steps to heaven") offers a relatively general 95 minutes, where extraordinary moments are related to how stupid, sexist and (from the appearance of things) pretty much irreversible to most of these men. (Interestingly, the boy the more reusable he appears.) What is actually the treatment of women. Russian men look for Italians for their money for this famous madonna / whore complex. Have the lives of women after Plato and Socrates improved in Greece? It must be wondered. <br /> <br /> When I see a Russian and the Greeks equal in this review, sorry, but even the non-refugees (such as the cab driver) shown here are slipping. According to another review of this site, Greece actually filmed a film (a blow to its home security) for the Academy's Best Foreign Film Award. What it says about the situation in making a Greek movie, I wonder without hesitation.
