I am a fifth-class language art teacher and after this book (which the students loved) we read the film. They laughed out loud! Unfortunately, this is not a comedy! The action was so terrible, I felt like I was looking at a number of kids playing in the neighborhood. My students imitated the lines and made fun and the whole way. I have to agree with them, sometimes it was pretty bad. However, I would show again to the students, just for fun and to compare the film with the book. We later made a Venn Diagram (the teachers know what it is) to show what was in both and the difference, so showing it is an educational value. I noticed that in 2005 another adaptation was being made so that we could only hope that the action would be better!
