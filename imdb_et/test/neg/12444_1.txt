Everyone has already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were probably people who either had a film presence or had friends / family who had a movie presence, and that's okay - if I made a movie, all my family members and friends would be there too over it. Frankly, there are also good things in this movie. Unfortunately, bad things are a lot worth considering. Good: The general plot was interesting. Music was generally pretty good. Several songs (when you heard them) were really cool. The only musical issues I had: # 1) The first temporary scene with some kind of quiet instrumental (it really seemed to be a bit off), # 2) The song that was played when the badges went out to the friend's house and # 3) were good songs too quiet, especially when playing a heavy metal song in the background, while Danny Trejo hung a man (sounded like a pretty cool song, but it should have hanged the whole scene) as Danny Trejo got froggy). Now it's a bad thing: the script was cruel. I mean, HORRIBLE. I saw a smoother dialogue in Star Wars. Advice for a part-time writer and full-time film buff: When writing a dialogue, ask yourself, "Is this something people would actually say?" Honestly, the script was ridiculous. I want to act as a slut, but with this type of writing it is hard to know if they have talent or not. The dirty dialogue was severely hampered by a mildly interesting plot. I know it was a low budget, but the words don't cost money - if you have a good script, even half-parties can pull it out. This movie didn't seem to be, but hopefully the director will get a better picture for making the film.
