Sorry, but it really looks like the fall of Apollo 13 today. Absolutely unreliable (at least Armageddon FELT as a comic book! It seemed like a bad high school movie project), acted like a cliché, when one gets, and ... the space shuttle lands on the LA highway? Come on. Seriously. Jerry, what did you mean? And all the clichés: The wife of the pregnant astronaut, the nervous reporter who gets into the path of everyone, so-called. And this is one thing to do a fun story about physics or politics or any law, but at least make it good! Fact and science were completely polished for that. The space shuttle does not have fuel tanks in its wings, and even if it did, it couldn't drive by switching fuel between them (and didn't get the DC-10). <br /> <br /> If you want bad acting, bad storytelling, low reality and cheesy clichés, you can't win!
