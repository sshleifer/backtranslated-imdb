This Asterix is ​​very similar to modern Disney cartoons. Soulless, technically good and adult fun. Perhaps this is because it is the first cartoon I watched after Laputa: Loss in the sky, but it was quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> Plot is animated and forgotten, but it is accompanied by Asterix and Obelix, who go to Viking territory to rescue a corrupted teenager who learns humility and finds love. Oh and at first they can't, but after reluctance they all have a deep friendship ... yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> The best bit is to watch little jokes. Vikings get the best. Like Vikea (Commander of Viking Command), who gives a list of furniture and skulls to restore the next attack. Or the Vikings do not know the meaning of grace (literally). Oh, and Olaf's most foolish Viking is actually fun (as much as the voice that works as a dialogue). <br /> <br /> For example, on a Viking Ship: (after a speech from Captain Abba) Olaf: Who is this new man? Captain: This is my daughter, cod-brain! Olaf: Your ... daughter ... man?
