After the September 11 event in New York, this American firefighter drama was created as a greeting and respect for their professionalism. The story speaks of a number of setbacks where, after a firefighter, Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix) has fallen through the floor of a burning building and communicated only via radio with Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta). Returns basically show how Jack is growing up as a recruitment, seeing Kennedy as his father, being a legend of fire. Of course, Jack's fires are trying to reach him today, but they're too late, and finally he lets them leave, and it goes on to his funeral, where he is praised by one of the best firefighters they know. Jacinda Barrett also plays as Linda Morrison, Terminator 2 Robert Patrick, as Lenny Richter, Morris Chestnut as Tommy Drake, Billy Burke as Dennis Gauquin, Balthazar Getty as Ray Gauquin and Tim Guinee as Tony Corrigan. The movie's cracks are ultimately all I have to pay attention to and enjoy the characters to fight against them. The rest is too pleasant for me. Enough!
