Another different movie from Vicente Aranda. When "Juana la loca" seemed the same, at least its quality was better (mainly thanks to the excellent performance of Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala), but "Carmen" is dull and full of themes (ardent brunette with a net in the shade), a poor man who pulled mad, passion, Sierra Nevada gangs, "toreros", ...) <br /> <br /> Obviously, Paz Vega is a beautiful woman, but there are more doubts about this talent and the role of Sbaraglia is so stupid that it is almost incredible. The script is weak and Aranda's uneven character affects the whole movie. The result could not be good for these ingredients. <br /> <br /> Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I think it's a complete failure.
