Here are some nice landscapes if you can open your eyes long enough to see something like that. I'm a fan of life-critical movies, but these people are just normal. here the whole film can be seen as a political statement because it shows how the individual of communism destroys, making it all the same happy animal that simply spends his life sleeping, eating and occasionally in love.
