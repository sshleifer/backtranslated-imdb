Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist at the Pittsburgh steelworks, working to recruit workers, although it isolates himself from his son, family and neighbors. It makes it even more difficult for Cvetic to actually become a FBI agent as a communist in order to get information on party activities. The party is trying to create a strike in the mill, so the strike movement leads the workers to a propaganda wave. Cvetic must also fight with the beautiful Eve Merrick, the party and the teacher at her son's school, who finds Cvetic a double agent. When Eve learns the ugly truth about the party's real motives, the reds decide she needs to be wound up and Cvetic needs to help her without putting her at risk. The film should have a lot of aisles and double crossings, but there is very little in this movie, but (according to today's standards) there is a lot of fun with propaganda and little action or excitement. Lovejoy is very good in the main role, but even her and the rest are unknown. Here are a few surprises and how did this film get the Oscar for the best documentary? Assessment, 4.
