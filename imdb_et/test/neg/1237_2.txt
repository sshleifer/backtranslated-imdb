I had to fill this part of the movie ... I found myself asking who it was? And when did it happen? It seemed to jump, but I watched the fear I missed, and that would have been explained to me. I loved Lonesome Dove, but that movie didn't make any sense to me. I loved all the actors, but what happened to the rest of the movie? It made me go "what"? at the beginning of each section. As far as the landscape - I thought it was okay. It made me feel like I was leaf through the book and left the pages out. The end was a bit confusing to me, even though I imagine the boy was waiting for his father and had to leave you when his father would eventually come home to his son and be a father, because his mother is now gone .. I would like to read the book to see what I missed the movie ... I don't expect it to win prizes.
