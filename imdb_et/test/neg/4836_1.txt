and it is only in January, I'm still sure! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst Swedish films I've ever seen and honest Swedish films are generally not so good. It has been argued that this is "original" and it may be seen that people who have never seen an English-speaking movie can not feel like Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein in the last ten years sat over the most successful films of recent years during one weekend and tried to push it all into the Swedish package. What can I say is that the result can be just ... poor. First of all, the story is weak first, even worse if it is not just a bad story, but a desire to combine with very bad stories - first of all, failed to try to make Swedish action a la Matrix and then combine this very bad moral story. And if you thought it might not be worse, you will notice all the "cool things" that have just got into it for some reason more than badly, trying to show that Sweden can also make Hollywood movies - which we can't and shouldn't try. For example, trying to make the main plot deeper by letting youngsters play computer games Storm, who has no story at all, or, for example, how the internet side of "Storm" is, while maybe it's just the main figure of consciousness - I really don't think even Stein or Mållind does not see a point where there are three-quarters of the film, but just tries to show bad additional factors. For the actors, I have to admit that Eric Ericson is doing a good job, unless he does the same job through the whole movie, even the harsh Storm is trying to be a movie of DD's personal development, which he does not change in the way of acting. Jonas Karlsson, to be honest, I thought he was a fairly respected actor but decides to Storm ... he must shame this film, his character and scar. Finally, Eva Röse is just her criticism, both her character and the actor. The only reason Storm can't get 1/10 is Eric Ericson and what I want to say at least.
