I was in Hippie age 22 in 1965, I saw the game 5 times, I have two versions of the music and I read the script several times. Maybe it is a separate thing, the movie is OK, but it is terrible when it comes to playing games. <br /> <br /> First, good. The songs are sung well and the production values ​​are pretty good. Homosexual Effects For Black Boys, White Boys are cute. The Claude / Berger switch was interesting. Hair is the production of liquid and its constant changes are inherent in the condition that its basic spirit is preserved. <br /> <br /> But the main spirit was very distorted. It seemed that all the producers wanted to sing certain songs and match them, no matter what the original purpose of playing. <br /> <br /> Claude, Sheila, and Hud were presented as selfish brats who could care less for someone outside their tribe. Claude destroyed Sheila's parental party (it's hard to believe she smiled when her parents got hurt) and stole the cars repeatedly. Sheila stole a soldier's clothes and a car. Then he left him in the center of the desert, where he would definitely be badly sunburned, likely to be ranked and likely to die on this lonely Nevada highway. Good fun. And Hud found that his son's heart breaking is his ex. This is not what the hippies were, not what they described, and is directly against the generation of love. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a hippie start with money. The idea was to be independent outside the capitalist system, not the beginning. <br /> <br /> After Berger was imprisoned for the destruction of Sheila's party, and Claude offers some stools, Berger instead requires bail without beating Sheila's parents with a better plan and then hitting her mother. <br /> <br /> "Be In" has always been a very spiritual point, but here it is silly brides floating around. Even if it is part of his journey, it will destroy a beautiful song. I know they are in conflict with the army "Swimming in space". But again, it destroys a completely beautiful song. <br /> <br /> Although Sheila and Claude are thin, Berger steals her clothes, laughing at "it was a fun man" even after she saw both were very upset. Then a little later, Berger does one thing that no hippie ever does. He hits Claude. Dreadful. <br /> <br /> Then they have a great chance to sing "Starshine" in the beautiful SF spot at night, where the stars flash and maybe work as an inventive duet. Instead, the whole tribe sings in a sunbathing sun that crosses the road in convertible (of course, stolen). <br /> <br /> In 1979 I was very disappointed with the film and I like it even less. I think it would have been possible to show relatively close acceptance, but that is not the case.
