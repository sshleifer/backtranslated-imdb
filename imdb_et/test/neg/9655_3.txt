This movie is definitely weird. The main piece is 3 old business partners who invite 2 strangers to their home to have lost 10 bucks in it. The two who appear will fall in love. Three senior businessmen are dying and coming like ghosts to try to help two younger guests. Well, it may make sense, but then we have 3 old men who probably have the bread that lives together .. lightly weird here ... Harry Carey plays his part base that can't be said to be a nice man or really stab. I really mean, think I can do it. Then there is Richard Carlson who plays Houston from Houston in Texas. Hmmmmm, he sounds more like a southern gentleman than a man from Texas. It's not even close. Then we take 3 spirits who are better placed to help New Orleans to play the game than to actually help ... In fact, they are not at all helpful and why they are even in the film over the scope of knowledge. A stupid movie in which characters work out of character.
