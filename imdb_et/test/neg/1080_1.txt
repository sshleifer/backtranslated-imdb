This is an amazing Hollywood remake of the classic British film. Everything that made the original "Italian work" entertaining was taken out of a "filmed" painkiller by Donna and Wayne Powers "scripted" and "G" by Gray. I'm surprised that Troy Kennedy Martin (the original film screenwriter) promised to use his name on credits from this pig's ear. Martin has been working on some of the latest 40-year-old film and television projects. Even if this stinker is vaguely associated, it is not a good thing. <br /> <br /> Humor is forced, drama has worked, all the characters are cookie-cutter-like tough (except Charlize Theron's incredible, beautiful safe cracker / rally driver) and the plot only matches the original in the following points: <br /> <br /> (1) Three Minis (Modern BMW Versions but Minis Still) <br /> <br /> (2) Use the Croker and Bridger for two main characters <br /> <br /> (3) Disconnecting the city traffic management system to ensure a safe route through it. <br /> <br /> (4) Er, that's it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, what you get is an American and incredible American number movie, in which a fun pirate gang will eventually become your evil companion. Believe me, it looks awful for a long time before they do. The cast does their best, but it seems that they all took it after reading the script to polish it. The original character of the original film in the Hollywood hamburger machine, and clearly the British taste has not survived. <br /> <br /> Take your preference and watch the original 1969 movie instead of sucking the chest. It's a miracle that Noel Coward has not made Aunt Nelly, jumped out of her grave and threw all the teeth involved in this cold remake halfway down her throat. <br /> <br /> Italian Work? More like Italian Jobbie.
