Wow, I was told that it would be a B-film to watch. I think I was misled after this preview event. The plot is a complex brand of several films. Even the title is to take another movie if you can give the movie so much credit. I'm sorry to say I was taken to the cleaners. I'm not wasting your time for that. This movie seems to be a number of wannabets who got together and made a bad idea with a borrowed camera for a weekend movie. While in an entertainment company, I can evaluate a decent film and it deserves to be shelved or discarded. My advice is to stay in the classics like the Dawn of the Dead 1979. On a scale of 1 to 10 there are even 1 manufacturers pleasing because of this movie BLOWS. (Below what sucks) Manufacturers must stay in their daily jobs. When you watch the movie, be honest with your posting, it looks like it's a couple resurrected. There are some who have seen it when it has been and is posted correctly. Sorry, but I have to say that this is one skip.
