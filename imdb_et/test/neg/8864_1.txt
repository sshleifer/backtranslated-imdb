This is the turning out of Pulp Fiction. I thought a good laugh would be good. Well, it turns out that this movie was really terrible. The entire plot does not follow the Pulp Fiction plot. Turns to other movies like Forrest Gump and more. There were some laughs from this movie, but all this and everything took my life away from me in 90 minutes. If you are thinking of renting this movie, don't forget to waste 90 minutes of your life. Check it out again and continue and find a movie that really makes sense. Please, if there is a Plump Fiction 2, I definitely will not continue and rent a sequel. Just give it to those who are there.
