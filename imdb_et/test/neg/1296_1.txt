I was struck by the terrible action and script of this movie. All characters seem unchanged due to personal issues - rather than deer headlamps. If they decide they are decisive, they will have their emotional wounds and complain. I found myself screaming on the TV screen, trying to wake them up and do something! The plot line is unlikely. Whenever the main decision is of a leading character, one of the other characters must manifest all the problems with an obvious decision, as making the decision even more complicated - it is a tried-and-tested melodramatic order and just wants you to get angry. It is clear that the import of the decision is obvious - you do not have to treat the audience as idiots. In general - the whole movie is just too much emotional melodrama.
