I just saw this movie on TNT and let me tell you that this movie was ugly and funny. But after a while I started to laugh at my socks and tell the truth that they would like this film to be a comedy rather than an action / adventure. An absolutely fun scene comes when Delon and Kennedy make the loop 360 to avoid the French missiles that Wagner ordered to destroy Concorde. Our fearless leader, Kennedy, decides to shoot the incense cells out of the window to stop the rockets looking for heat ????? Unknown, but funny --- The kicker still comes, though --- after one picture the malfunction of the gun is working and Kennedy is catching it in the cockpit and well ... if you want to know what will happen to this movie. The stupid parts of this film include the absence of the whole plot ---- yes allows you to take some action in 25 minutes as land in Paris and go for one hour with love scenes with prostitutes and flight crews. Now you can switch to a saboteur for ten minutes, then to the destruction of another film and a visibly broken plane and passengers who do not see if they are right in front of their eyes! --- Final evaluation of this movement --- (1/10) of the four stars if there were 2 to 4 stars if it was a comedy
