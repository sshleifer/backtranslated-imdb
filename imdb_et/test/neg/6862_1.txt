I remember this movie when I was about 10 years old, one of my friends it was. At a time when it was about 10 years old, I just thought of it as another movie. <br /> <br /> When I look back at a full movie, it's a pretty amazing movie. For anyone with this movie, I definitely had a short Hollywood career. Though the actor seems to have made a few movies according to IMDb, although I haven't seen it and don't remember him too much. <br /> <br /> Anyway, just saying this movie is really bad, it could be in every sense. I would like to see it again: oD
