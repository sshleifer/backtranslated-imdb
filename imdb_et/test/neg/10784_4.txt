Western-style feminism camps in India's various subcultures have so far remained largely non-existent, with two foreign-owned entities and threatening (for tradition) never falling apart. Art imitates life (or the requirement goes) and the popular Hindi cinema is not an exception that reflects the main thing that unfortunately forms a large part of the collective Indian culture. But why? What is it about the gender of women, which has made this culture so annoying that women are routinely subjected to the most unthinkable horrors, including rape, murder, grandchildren, established illiteracy, infidelity, and subjugation of the spirit under the name "dowry"? The latest offer by Rajkumar Santoshi, "Lajja", asks for the same promising question that links the atrocities committed against women between three separate chapters / episodes that are a disgrace, suffered by its protagonist Vaidehi (Manisha Koirala). <br /> <br /> The direction of Santoshi is not equal to the level of song demand. He cannot achieve the necessary sensitivity by depicting the saga of sadness, and vice versa, rather than being outraged. Santoshi has recently said that he has not made a film for an international film festival, but rather for the masses of his country. Unfortunately, stickiness and film often show up in Santoshi's specialized action genre. The film suffers from its nervous, episodic pace, and its end is far too natural. <br /> <br /> There are many more friendly and rounded testimonials given by a female than their male counterparts. The main player is sensitively luminescently beautiful Manisha Koirala, who proves in Lajja that he is one of the most competent leading women of our time, and when he has been given the right role and structure, it is truly commendable. One wonders how brilliantly she was shining when the film was made by the director with an appropriate creative intent and the issue to be addressed. Mahima Choudhary is commendable and continues to show that he is an untapped talent. Madhuri Dixi, with Janki, has ever seen the affection and honesty that really deserves to "act." The role of a smart street performer who finds solace in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child is the greatest threat to his singing channels, which has retained his subscriber status over the last ten years. What leaves the final and most disturbing result in this constant feminist saga that is incessantly talented at Rekha. Lajja is a Manisha Koirala film, no doubt about it, but Rekha dominates the procedures that dig into your bones and send fear through her heart's vestibules. Rekha dazzles like Ramdular, preceded by vanity and dissatisfaction, to provide performance that is so full of authenticity and ingenuity that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of this part of the film. The comparisons are indeed harsh, especially if they have been changed against one of the world's leading leaders, but in the gracious presence of this dominant screen, other shades disappear. <br /> <br /> "The variety" has no complexity with proto-feminist dramas such as "Zubeidaa", "Pinjar" or even the hell-queen celebration "Laadla": it fills its feminist goals in two early moments: a loud tirade Mahima's abuse of her laws is abused by her father, who has not committed any crime other than giving birth to a girl. He breaks, leaving the wedding bull in low light. Seeing that his father was devastated, he began to cry, accusing himself of chaotic destruction in front of him. He cried, "Why did I say something? I've destroyed everything! It's all my fault!" Her grandmother, who showed silent intentional abuse, comforted her, saying, "Why are you crying? There's no reason you wake up. Who came before you because if we had the courage to say what you said today, there would have been no In this scenario, the importance of feminist heritage is clearly visible. his parents home shelter in india. The viewers of Western societies may seem quite reasonable (indeed natural) that every abused woman is seeking protection for her parents; but it is a social taboo in many eastern cultures, India among them. If she has been married, her presumed identity is her husband and her personal assets (family, business, children, etc.). equivalent to a Western woman. He is then considered to be a "spoiled" and "damaged goods" whose value has been completely abolished by his own actions and his refusal to assume his role. He is not as individual as the emblem of family honor. His father is attacking him for his deeds, worried that his family glory hides the daughter he had already passed over to another man. His main concern is the question of the upcoming marriage of the younger sister of Vaidehi, while the divorced parent's daughter is much less likely to be in the same household. He tells him that he must return to the man to whom he legally belongs, although he may be violent and sadistic. He pays his old-age speech that "Every home's glory lies in his daughter's hands." He responds quietly and tensively: "Yes, the glory of every home is in the hands of his daughter. But it is no honor for her daughter."
