Sorry, people, but everyone who says it's a great documentary ... and the award he won at Sundance ... well, you're all deceived. I've heard a couple of years how I saw this documentary and watched it finally. Perhaps in 1999, when it came out and reality TV didn't have such a dominant presence in industry, this movie would have seemed fun. But Mike and Mark are probably playing themselves, Mike and Mark. Sometimes they are funny and some lines look out of the cuff, but mostly they don't really speak. They are the reality version of Jay and Silent Bob. Yes, people are real, they are not actors, but it is set, it is exaggeration itself, and it is so obvious that it is hard to believe that many people think this is the real thing. I was not deceived, so it was actually boring. Somewhat amusing, but not much if you forget it.
