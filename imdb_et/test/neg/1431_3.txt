What starts pretty well (and quite disturbing) quickly penetrates the annoying confusion. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider (Twisted Sister infamy) apparently showed his idea scenario, and while the cybercrime lurking freak is potential, they really hit it with uneven tempos, bad dialogue, and one of the greatest infinites you will ever see. In spite of the inanimate performances, the director directs the really horrible first reel. It really seems to be a good little budget effort. <br /> <br /> There is no such happiness. The plot goes across the map, and Snider's character is spawned by endlessly tiring psychotic fortune cookie lines that should undergo meaningful dialogue. The worse is that supportive lies record barely and the only semi-believable dialogue comes from young girls who help navigate the detective on the internet. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of a good idea. Oh, and there's a new twisted sister song when you care.
