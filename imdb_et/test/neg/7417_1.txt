It looks like an "amateur" lesson. How ever this trash can be released is next to me: actor, story, characters, supposed special effects, and so on. It's all wrong. Why Lance Henriksen accepts it remains one of the great secrets of cinema. Perhaps he was in dire need of money or maybe it was under the influence of some illicit drug. <br /> <br /> It's pointless to try to explain what this movie is about. It deals with the legend of a big leg, but it is done in the worst possible way. In fact, this stinker smells like a direct video output. <br /> <br /> Avoid all costs! 0 * 10 *
