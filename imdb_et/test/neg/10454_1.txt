I knew five minutes after the monster made his appearance when he went. But when I saw the original credits, I said, "My God, Bruce Boxlightner, Walter Koenig (Star Trek) Gil Gerard (from Buck Rogers and he is almost recognizable), I saw John Callahan, who had previously labeled his favorite soap, all my child, put a few pounds, but he can still act, then was Veronica Hamill, too bad that I didn't get sick to see him in the movie. It never saw William Katt (Perry Mason and The Greates American Hero) <br /> <br /> All these stars and one tough movie. I hope they got their wages. <br /> <br /> Bad Bad Bad
