The real problem with this story is that there is not much story. You can hardly talk. Widower buys an electric grandmother for her kids. One child suffers from an electric grandmother. Then he finally adopts it. Then the children and grandmother's leaves grow. Truly, very little happens. This is much more a prerequisite than a story. <br /> <br /> Besides, this is the skmaltz, and you have a story that was already made and better: Lonely. The same basic idea: a person cannot initially accept a robot's love, because it is just a machine, the robot finally arrives and loves it. The biggest difference is that Lonely is much more powerful, because both the protagonist and the audience are shocked back in reality and forced to remember that in the end the robot is actually only a mechanism. <br /> <br /> I also find that the story is very flawed by the fact that an electric grandmother is just * perfect. He is not only a "human" but a super-human *. She is * smarter * than a real person, she has no traces of mechanics at all, and she makes marbles out of thin air. To be honest, he really believes that he thinks he is a machine.
