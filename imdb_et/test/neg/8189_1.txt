This person is a so-called entertainer who has to use embarrassment, vulgarity and slander to try to believe others have a talent. I have often seen comic books somewhat effective, but if everything can be said, it is a sign that the drug affects the twisted mind. Makes me wonder where his twisted and fried brains are within a few years of abuse. Poor man !!! I admit that I couldn't look at it all - too stupid for words. Its amazing part is that someone believes he is a philosopher !!! No wonder self-esteem and dignity are diminishing and perversity is increasing. Could it be that the UFC can be his dead brain factor?
