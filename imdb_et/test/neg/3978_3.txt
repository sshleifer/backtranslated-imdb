I've now suffered from Parts, The Clonus Horror. <br /> <br /> The horror of the title in this movie is an insult to a real horror. <br /> <br /> The story was about a Cloning Center owned by "Man". They grow clones to harvest organs from clones later on to get the original people who need transplantation. One clone escapes, the government is angry and kills all involved, but the story leaks out. <br /> <br /> It is really shameful to see how a potential movie is destroyed by amateurs like Fiveson. The only thing he really managed to do was talk about the concept of human rights and the very philosophical aspect that makes people human, and would it be OK to grow clones for organic harvesting? Unfortunately, mediocre actors have been chosen and the plot has left the city until the end where the pathetic attempt to sum it up has been made. <br /> <br /> But !! I was most disturbed by the lack of new characters who have no real significance for the plot. Nevertheless, Fiveson feels the need to kill them in a bad explosion that only Sir Coleman Francis would be proud of. <br /> <br /> The device was interesting. How did Fiveson think that pulling out of plastic and running water would lead an incredible river beyond me, but I think if you compared the device with the paste-oatmeal of Coleman Francis, then this movie would win. br /> <br /> Coleman may have changed what bad movies are for me. 3/10
