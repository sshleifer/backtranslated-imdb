I LOVE Sandra Bullock-She's one of my favorite actors of all time, but it's a movie she'd had to pay a long time to conserve. I understand that it is almost 20 years old, but my dead grandmother can do better than these people. Caution - it's not even worth $ 5.50. WalMart rack ... You know that if it smells bad that it's not even a few bucks - the sound quality is terrible - there are no closed captions to hear even terrible dialogue, and it looks like it was filmed $ 1.98 budget. I thought I'd like to see Sandra early to see how he developed as an actor, but YIKES is too kind of a word to use ...
