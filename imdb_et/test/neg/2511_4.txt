Alien body-snatchers in the desert. Small blue stones that look like they are made of cheap plastic. The general story is not bad if you like this thing, but the actor is so far away from the poor that it amazes me that some of them really did entertain! And special effects? Hi ?! Where Did They Get Their FX Team, High School? I mean, come on; there was so much they could have done! It was amateur and extremely simple. I didn't enjoy it (and my dad was sleeping at it!) And of course our hero falls in love with a leading lady! It's so typical and very predictable. Bleugh !!!!!
