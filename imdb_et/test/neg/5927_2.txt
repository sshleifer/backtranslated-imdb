Yes, Lifetime has the habit of making male species stupid. And this soap opera doesn't joke when they make Perry King, a supposedly well-known doctor who can't see the evil around him. Do you trust the doctors? How can no one see what's going on? Is he stupid? And an evil woman with a face like a horse is going to kill her family again. How does he get all the drugs? This is not explained. How does he leave the hospital without a secretariat? I think the director Don FauntLeRoy asks us to just believe it. I didn't. I screamed at the screen in the king's foolishness all over my face. If the woman was so attractive, maybe maybe I can accept it. But he's not even that. Shannon Sturges is the perfect woman and I tell you she has a horse face. I wouldn't cross her on the street, but our perfect husband does and does it quickly. After all the cast persons had failed, I was not satisfied with our misery. He deserves more than he received. William Moses plays a doctor's brother who unfortunately knows his result from day one. Joy at least to see one beautiful face in this clinker. This is Lesley Anne Down. He gives 2 counts to the film just for the relief that he sees someone who pulls in that confusion. King Perry earned his destiny. What a bump.
