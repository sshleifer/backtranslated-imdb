The third film, based on Charles Belden's "The Secret of the Wax Museum" (1933), is directed at the X-tasy generation. Dual scriptwriters, Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, spend more time developing basic characters than other films - a promising start. Their condition ensures authenticity. The role of Paige (Paris Hilton) was not the greatest stretch for the world's favorite hosts. She basically "In Style", sticks boys, chats on the cell and frets over a poorly designed pregnancy. His regular routines have changed remarkably. Hilton made his performance - not so hot - in the parody of "1 Night in Paris" (2004). While pimp-my-ride is moving, he eagerly looks for his boyfriend (Robert Ri'chard) in a round lip balm. Finally, the "actor" is suitable for using the word "N" for sex. Director Jaume Collet-Serra shapes his twin style in contradiction to the past. Everyone at this time showed the opposite qualities, while today a couple can bring out a couple of good or bad. However, the latter does not preclude the first. Childbirth is the luck of the bow. Observers do not consider Vincent (Brian Van Holt) a modern Quasimod. They are allowed to share some similarities like artistry, dysfunction, submissiveness and murder. But one small variable between the two changes the whole difference. Vincent is even slower in the interior than he is out. Collet-Serra "House of Wax" honors the actor Vincent Price from the first reconstruction of 1953. The film leaves an obvious van Gogh punch to the audience. However, the choice of antagonist sharing is in two, which eliminates the viable twist at the end. The unveiling of Professor Henry (Vincent Price) Jarrod is in second place, but Lon Chaneyle's "Opera Opera" (1925) is the most terrifying film in the history of the scenes. As for the new candidate, the consequences of the segregation operation will reduce the impact. The surgeon should know that the Siamese twins work physically and psychologically. Their father must be called by a few colleagues - dr. Phil Consulting and Dr McNamara Pinching. Despite what the trailers said, wax is not forever. In fact, you can get rid of it by burning it.
