Unlike most of the appraisers here, I hated this movie simply because the writer / director's exaggerated ego was a different, potentially interesting topic. Too many film fans equate EXTREME with "GENIUS!", But I do not buy it into the cult of personality. The film should be on his subject and not on the director (if not, of course, Woody Allen's film). * SPOILER * (which is just as good, save time ...) Nothing is brilliant to show you the length of the footsteps of the porn stars you knew in the last frame - what is actually called the sticky maneuver by the hacking of the SCREAMS Film School. <br /> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> It's a writer / director. But the rest of the audience should also look at the unpleasant and brutal nature of pornography. Flick was at an angle to the porn industry, looking at every player who could do it. No matter, just love my writer / director. Love these four-minute segments of the stabilizer that should show the current energy, but somehow everything was off the switch. Love the story - no matter how boring it is - the rise of the gee-whiz porn star and the fall of the variety. But look at it, of course. Although the subject has the potential to be exciting? innocence, money, degradation, beauty - your worshiping writer / director was able to make it all over again, DULL. Partly because of this working time. Here's something that your author's hero didn't try: giving characters. Or the soul. Anything that everyone would fear, except Genius, that Paul is, of course. But I don't buy. I don't know how to jump into creepy cages. <br /> <br /> Another long-lasting auteur is hacking, which is fifty times higher in quality. I know some of you agree. The rest will probably see this caring flick again. Not my problem.
