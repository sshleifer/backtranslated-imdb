This film was a great prerequisite and it could have been an exciting look at racism, an attitude towards women at work, and a male-female relationship in England at the beginning of the last century. But it just changed the soppy love story. But what was worse was that the love story was absolutely incredible. The operation was largely poor, the direction was confusing, but mostly the manuscript and story were non-existent. The only thing she liked was how dark it was before the electric light. I really feel how little light a candle puts out.
