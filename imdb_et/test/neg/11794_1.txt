I watched this movie with some of the friends they said I had to see, but from the beginning I knew it would get worse. So I can only give this movie 1 because the effects I used were so badly used and I thought everyone could see that there were no "real" ghosts. I feel that the worst part was the so-called "old haunted house" that contained a whole host of new items and some "convieniently placed objects". I could have thought of the effects that would have seemed much better than the ghost that I didn't see (or I should say wire). Later, when they look at the chair over the tape, it slips differently. Uh Oh, there is a big consistency error. If it were a really good movie, they would have collected this and all the other "old house" objects. This movie is like hanging on a haunted hill house and the Blair witch project all rolled into one poorly thought out and concise movie. I would be ashamed to have something bad about girls' behavior, effects and cheap videos and when the camera falls when something "paranormal" happens. This film is offensive to people who are actually looking for ghosts and get real ghost material on the tape.
