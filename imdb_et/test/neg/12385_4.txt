I love old "monster movies" for the value of a clean camp. This is not disappointing if you find that such a thing is fun. <br /> <br /> The actor is a pure 1950s paired crap. You get used to it when you've seen enough of them ... dialogue is very silly and ultimately forgotten. You're right there for a giant bird. <br /> <br /> The science of this movie is fun. A monstrous fortress that can manipulate things ... with the intention of breaking and eating people ... an alien who has come to nest on Earth. Some of the best scenes in the movie (not including birds) include "scientists" explaining what's going on. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of ridiculous birding on the floor. It looks like this is a new baby bird ... bald and silly, closed feathers. It's even hungry, angry young. But the fortress frightened my three-year-old crap, who was a big scary bird in the evening. It's a bit crappy. <br /> <br /> I was very sad about the scene where they shot the eggs. (In some way, the egg's antimatter is not protected by film.) But I'm a bird lover, what am I saying?
