The activity was episodic and there was no narrative yarn to link episodes and move the story forward. Moves along the plot. With a few exceptions (eg Graham Greene), the actor was undone and at best a pedestrian. The actors seemed to have something in their minds except the scene where they were. It's boring to see a man driving a car through this film setting in a semi-desert country, be it when he is driving badly or well. Such scenes are typical of video tension levels. So this video was not something that would turn on or distract an observer to take care of the characters and come out. I'm twice disappointed because I rented this movie based on the reputation of CEO (Redford) and its novel writer (Hillerman). I note that it has been reported in the jewelery box that the funds are provided by the PBS and the public broadcasting corporation, as well as by Carlton International. I hope this video was both a disappointment for them and me and my wife so that they no longer finance the same catastrophe.
