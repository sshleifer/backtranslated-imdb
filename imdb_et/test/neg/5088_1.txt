The Queen Queen's record label should have been shot, that day and age have no excuse for poor recording. The end result was mumbling's voice, and cinematography was fair at best. The story was potential and I am sorry for the overseas representatives who need to know that they are in turkey during filming. It is obvious that the film suffers from the e-cheapo budget syndrome and the scene where Temuera starts inside the house, while the battlefield is out of words is just too stupid. <br /> <br /> I noticed some of Maori's protocol affairs have taken some shortcuts, but this was probably due to movie length restrictions, and so on. All this film was not impressed, there are many beautiful places on the Whanganui River, but this film gives us a cold, drab and claustrophobic image that has no beauty. The film needs more sunshine and better camera angles, less confusion on the screen, better sound recording, and more thought of what the film's visitors would see on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Hats for all involved to complete what must be very difficult. I am very pleased to everyone who can make a feature film, unfortunately I did not enjoy it.
