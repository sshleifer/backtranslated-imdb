The pace of this movie is quite slow. It takes about 70 minutes for Katie to go to China (what we know she does) and leave things for 30 minutes. The story is so predictable that you know everything in about 5 minutes. Nothing surprises you. I think the film is a movie of the era, but the film is full of stereotypes that are pretty upside down: <br /> <br /> Katie - beauty that realizes that boys and shopping aren't everything. He understands that he can "feel" and "see the real world". Touching. <br /> <br /> Mother - a high-voltage, nervous, screaming mother (wow very innovative) that needs a strong man's care. <br /> <br /> Father - patient and always understanding and caring for the powerless woman. <br /> <br /> A boy who only wants to get into his pants. <br /> <br /> Comic book Chinese boy who can't speak English properly and made a laugh. I thought Hollywood fell in the mid-fifties. <br /> <br /> A sister who from time to time knows everything about how to move around in China, that next time she has a mother, a woman who can't go through the situation or knows something. <br /> <br /> A deformed Chinese girl with whom our Westerners get help and become a beautiful girl. Because there is nothing in China (according to the film of a third world country) and therefore needs our charity. Gah, wake up and smell what you shovel. <br /> <br /> Certainly, China is in poverty, but helping Western countries (read from the US) is so low and happy that it is sad and disgusting. Shanghai (where the film is set) is currently the most expanding and developing city in the world. <br /> <br /> A Chinese father who is so nice and kind-hearted that in the end there is a desire ... to be a cowboy with a white hat ... <br /> <br /> A teacher (Sean Astin) who has this really a heart-hanging story (not) that he doesn't know. Why Sean? WHY? 15. If you want to learn something about the world, such as Hotel Rwanda. To get a better life or age movie, I suggest you watch the Italian "Cinema Paradiso", which won the Academy of Best Foreign Film a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The only nice thing about the movie was the small urban landscapes that really capture some (not all) beautiful Chinese lands. I've been there and seen it.
