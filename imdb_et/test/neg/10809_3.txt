OK, I read the director's comment on this film (highlighted as "front-side comment") and I have to admit that I can identify with my post. <br /> <br /> Micheal, I hope your career will return to a particular setback and you went on to other better things. I've seen this movie in MST3K format. Even if robots throw out all the chopped continuity and brilliant remarks, I saw a potentially decent film, with ambitious ideas struggling with a limited budget and limited players available to it. And this is one of those movies ("Mitchell" is another), where the MST3K team took a lot of leading pictures even when it got better. You know that they had some kind of unfair fun at the expense of the actor because it was made a more lively episode. <br /> <br /> IMO, the fact that the film was actually trying to get something and was at some decent and effective time here and there it would have to hold onto the "100s" ("Tangents / Times" is another movie that is a plot and a heart that doesn't deserve to be there). <br /> <br /> This is still not a very good movie. I don't blame the writer / leader for who he is. It is just that his acting and writing skills needed some years of maturity before he could pull out such a nonsense project or make a feature film. Writing and characterization are amateur and slapdash, and dialogue is often barely on the ABC Afterschool Special standards. It sincerely gives her the best, and in general she definitely acts in front of abortions such as "Future War" or "Space Mutiny", but here is not really a professional performance except "Big Joe" Estevez, who is hammy but suitably intense. I never saw a complete original paragraph, but taking MST from "Soultaker" was sufficiently representative to make these facts simple. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the film has Robert Z'Dar. This means that the IMO is a real "Kiss Kiss" for every movie that hopes to take seriously. Yes, he's big and scary in his role, but I just hate that actor. (In real life I wish him good and I hope he is financially comfortable). <br /> <br /> I liked many things about the movie. For example, there was some warmth and humor between the male wire and the divorce between her dead friend and it made her much more watchful. The idea of ​​the Haapsalu elevator, which opened its doors to Afterlife, was an inspired way to rely on some horrors, without any special effects, and I respected who worked on this script to keep the budget manageable. It didn't really work, but it might have been a little bit more complicated. <br /> <br /> So, Mr Rissi, better luck with your other projects - your involvement with this failure will keep me from watching something other than "buzz" was good. And Mrs Miller has nothing to be ashamed of - she was young and ambitious, and the film was not so bad.
