I understand the drawing and turn to such a different film type and I am a great admirer of films with very little dialogue, but all this is absolutely terrible. I've been to the Scottish Highlands and found there are no Scottish accents in the characters. This plot was theoretically strong enough, but cheap kits and the lack of one realistic character kept this movie off the ground. I feel that using silence to create the atmosphere only works if you have participants who can speak of some kind of presence and these participants definitely cannot. If you want a silent movie that records its presence, try (Le Dernier Combat). There have been very few films I could not even finish and it was one of them. Absolute drift!
