All this movie is bad. everything. Ridiculous 80-year-old discounts. The ridiculous mustache. Ridiculous action and fighting scenes where you can actually see that your opponents don't hit each other. Bad, bad, bad 80s music. People passing through recurring forests. A bad guy with a silver plastic hand and stupid hair. Stupid dialogue. Operation is non-existent. Everything seems very cheap. This film even goes beyond "Plan 9 from space" in its total inferiority. <br /> <br /> It's not "funny bad" it's just bad.
