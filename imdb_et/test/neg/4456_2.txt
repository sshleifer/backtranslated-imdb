From all Alistair MacLean's book adjustments, I feel it qualifies as the worst, but doesn't blame MacLean! What this movie shares with the novel seems to have the same title. We have no tension, unpredictability of the mystery, no chance to deal with the main characters. We spent the whole duration (or at least I did) to wait for Charlotte Rampling's clothing (for Charlotte it seems that it will take a considerable time!). However, a glimpse of Charlotte Rampling's tits cannot save this catastrophic film. MacLean has once again been attacked by the gutter to withstand those bitter cages and nervous bangs who seem to blame him for all the wounds he has undergone in his book-shooting attempt. The poor old Alistair must have climbed into the corner and hit it when it came out. At least "Bear Island" - which also uses the name of Maclean, but probably none of his novels - was LITTLE exciting. The excitement here awaits the final credit.
