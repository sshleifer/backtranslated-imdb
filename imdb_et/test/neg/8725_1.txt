This is a weird, strange film and doesn't deserve a better character than David Lynch's one! Special effects are badly done, actors are basically bad actors, and this film is not a race that is a minority of the planet, and is trying to fight domineering, but it seems like a crazy film that gives tribute to the section. This is definitely not the author of Frank Herbert, the six-part epic! Check out one of David Lynch's one, which is the perfect respect for the novels!
