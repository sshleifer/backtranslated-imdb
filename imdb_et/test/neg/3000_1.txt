It's the most boring, terrible and stupid movie I've seen for a long time. I saw it in the Beverly Hills Academy and there were quite a few people in the lobby who had left the screening and sought refuge there. Everyone was solemnly shaking their head and looking like a funeral. What a waste of time and money. Even worse are the critics who gave this pretentious good comments. What about them? Are they afraid that they are not considered "hips"? Did they get bribes? This movie is amazingly bad. Don't take a date to wait for a thorough conversation at the cheesecake factory after that. When you see this movie as your idea, it captures you and keeps it for the rest of your life.
