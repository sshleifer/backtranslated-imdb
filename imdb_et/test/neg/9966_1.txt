I heard some legends about this movie (quotes that aren't used to offend the movies), so when I finally got this DVD, I started to look at it impatiently. Finally, I * had the opportunity to move forward with only some of the most meaningless, pointless and pointless scenes of this meaningless childish confusion that it would end faster. <br /> <br /> It may be the worst movie I've even "touched" - and I was involved with Trom for some time. "Manson's Family" makes the bottom part of Troma's records a bold and ground-breaking film of artwork. I could talk and talk about a "plot" of a siphletic skeleton that is disappointingly "acting", painful, "wrong" routing, kits and props with its "dollar ninety-nine" look (I especially "loved") "Tate's murder site plastic toy guns! " or the nasty look of all the bags in this garbage (I think it should represent hallucinations caused by the drug; I have no idea how the hallucinations caused by the drug look or feel, and I don't want to know - but I think that the burned "brains" will love this "movie" (they seem to be the ones who did it). I've seen many different "worst" movies 50 "lists traditionally opened by Eddie Wood's names and Eddie Wood would have terrified van Webber (or whatever his name is; he doesn't I would never forget it), which I have never seen in Superbabies or its sequel, but I really want "Manson" to join them with IMDb rating. Fortunately, this hidden garbage p has enough viewers not to see enough "1" votes - And so much better!
