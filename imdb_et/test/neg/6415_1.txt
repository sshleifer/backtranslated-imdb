This film does not respect the viewer's time. It takes a 15-minute story and reaches 95 minutes. To do this, they need to use a very slow narration and do anything with unlikely anger. By the time this movie showed something interesting, I didn't care. The problem is not in action, but in momentum. The story is just weak. Jim Carrey is a capable actor, but his attempt to bring light humor to a serious role is simply inappropriate. His humor style is not common, so he comes to himself as a dehydrated version. Number 23 causes great grief and frustration for people, but its rationale is never logical. Most of all, it's just a little interesting. Jim Carrey has a lot more ability in a serious role than this movie shows. Don't waste your money in the theater watching it. Rent this movie if you have difficulty sleeping. If you're still awake after 10 minutes, I liked it more than I did. I also didn't like film lighting and artistic aspects. A lot of passive visual eye eyelets were thrown into the viewer with lighting or effects, and it did little to improve the story.
