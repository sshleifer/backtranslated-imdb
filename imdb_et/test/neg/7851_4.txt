Paul Muni, an actor of German emigre and uber-hambone, who never saw a scene he did not want to chew, plays in a lively Mexican immigrant living in Los Angeles and works in the world. If this crazy vehicle resembles that of Al Pacino minerals as a cultured Cuba, it must not be too surprised. The characters are quite similar, and both get wildly pop-eyed at the request of the script. The Spaniards should be heavily offended by Muni's top performances everywhere, because it is a lively Mexican Mexican in Mexico, the consequences are cursed. I think Benicio DelToro's grandfather was not available. Young, bleached blonde Bette Davis plays Muni's love interests; finally he goes crazy for the love of Mr Meh-hee-can Muni. The absolute momentum, Davis, is the only reason to look at this racially attacking attack. After all, it is absolutely disgraceful when Muni asks to marry his dream galt - a white breed where one of these harsh, up-and-coming 30s accents of Hollywood loved so much - and he calls him a wild and brutal "different tribe." Muni will change immediately to Mr.. Hydeks and he refers to premature death. In the last scene, the mind-enhancing Muni tells his priestly face to go back to his own people, his being. End of the movie. Finis. That's all he wrote. Muni had said he had hired a Mexican-oo-in Mexican driver to explore this exotic creature with a speech image and physical habits. Yowza!
