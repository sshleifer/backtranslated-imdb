Unfortunately, there is a boring flick and probably the only way to see it is a polished bootleg Public Domain version that is so blurry and blind that sometimes you have a hard time making a screen. Leading participants are unpleasant. The man spends most of his time trying to appear unnatural, charming and sexy, completely forgetting what the film is and that he is suspicious of murder because he played with him to start a goose. The Lord simply walks out of the flick, being dignified if he is not busy. This is a rather badly written stuff that is never interesting or witty. There are no good camera works, a memorable soundtrack, glamorous actors or an atmosphere. It only scratches the surface of the genre and nothing happens if you miss this completely unforgettable flick.
