Simply put, the only rescue arm that is on this film is the settings, the costumes and the OK punk concert. How H.R.Giger needs to know his cyborg image on the cover of this movie, I wouldn't want to know. As soon as I was able to do sardonic comments on the main characters of the films, I hoped that the "friezes" of this film would fill them in good fashion. I know SPOILERS coming! I was wondering if this movie was in the first 20 minutes. was going to be as humorous as the rest? Exploring all the obvious political challenges (the police are trying to rape the "freak", "freaks" and frat-boys, and the talk of the punk concert w / female singer) and the use of slowing down in the fighting sequences (screaming "martial arts coordinator") I just don't know. A person called "Steve" shook me because he was trying to fight the fighting people on the street (he should be robbed and raped) and it seems bad when he broke towards the end of the boy's neck (I want me to show you how to do it) ?) But I have to say that if they had developed other symbols better than "Splatter", it could have gone somewhere. If this movie was 0, it would have been, but unfortunately it is 1.
