I had to write a review of this movie after I saw it, and I read some comments that people trying to categorize this film's dissatisfaction with wfmitchell's post)) I don't fit in any of these classifications. The second classification to be on the list is 5) people didn't like this movie because it wasn't good. I found the film to be sewn and forced. My wife chose us to see her as a big Kidman fan and also likes Jude Law. <br /> <br /> Speaking of the law, it took me a lot of time and a lot of beliefs. believe in his southern accent. I can't help but don't know if they didn't make their character more targeted, so we shouldn't hear so much about this tortured accent. <br /> <br /> It took a long time for the film to become interesting (about 1 or 1.5 hours) and then it ended. It was interesting that I didn't know that Mingha was the director of this movie. About 40 minutes of the movie, I asked my wife "is this not another English patient?" It was absolutely. <br /> <br /> Fighting scenes. I'm trying to think of a word that describes the scene of the battle, but I think the most descriptive word that accurately describes it is just "stupid." It was forced, it was incredible, it was stupid and it was stupid. (After the battle, I looked at my wife and asked, "Was it just stupid?", To which she nodded vigorously.) <br /> <br /> The only bright point in the film was Zellweger's performance. The role was somewhat overworked as every decent comedy, but it worked. His speech, his walk, his motives and esp. his little laughs (my favorite: "If you want the bull's ass to get up to 3 feet, you have to listen to each other"), he was able to create an almost comic character who did his job very well. <br /> <br /> I just didn't like this movie and I have to think about what people say they like it (or an English patient on this issue). I suspect you could classify them into categories: 1) soap opera fans
