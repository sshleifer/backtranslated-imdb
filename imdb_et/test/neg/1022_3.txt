Formula is a film about a rich Chilean illegitimate son who inherits the fortune and mixes with the bad boys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas). It looks very similar to a television film, not really exciting. The only reason I looked was that Valentina Vargas was there. There are no real surprises here, though Vargas is nice to see. There are very beautiful landscapes in Chile, but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie. Michael Ironside plays like a bad man, but it's not one of his most memorable parts. Chase scenes are standard prices.
