This film has a fairly good premise - once again, it has once again appeared in a science film, most notably "Alien" - and some decent "he-man" performances by a male. Astronaut's husband, for me, is the weak link in the band - he doesn't seem to know what to face with him in many of his most outstanding scenes, for which I blame the director Corman. <br /> <br /> With a decent budget for props and special effects, and a more targeted and cohesive screen game, Blood Beast could have been pretty decent. However, the inherent cheapness and continuity errors and gaffs of the production project undermine the procedure. For example, every time I saw a dog astronaut placed on the "exam table", the width of the ironing board, I broke into poisoning, probably not the emotion the team wanted to use. And the monster costume needs serious work; Paprika coated parrots are not just frightening or convincing. <br /> <br /> However, the prerequisite was strong enough to just hang up to see how the plot would be solved and the alien's motives were unclear at the beginning I can think of it as a mystery. And the scene shot by the murdered scientist had some shocks with the plot development, where the alien claimed to have taken over some of the dead man's personalities. <br /> <br /> It's Corman. It's cheap, fast, and easy to track if you don't think too much or too much. What else to say?
