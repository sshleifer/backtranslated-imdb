I saw this movie for the first time on Saturday when I was very young. I thought it was cool and often thought. Well I finally restarted it on a DVD. It was still very fun, but different. It must be one of the most sparse, toughest sci-fi movies of the 1950s. It seems that it was full of stock military material. Dialogue is stylish and has an impact on crude oil. There is one line of dialogue that I had in the seams. Line Jeff Morrow talks with the babe on the beach. Rent it if you need a lot of drunk friends to watch a movie. It's classic.
