This film was thin, slow, embarrassing. I may not be the best judge because he is not a fan of fans, preferring a classic horror. Slasher fans can enjoy it early in the Slasher genre. I really would like it for 90 minutes, which I look back at. The only reason to look at it is 1) Young Vanna White (Fortune for Wheel), which has about 3 minutes of total screen time. 2) Early morning Queen Linnea Quigley (with nudity) and legendary beauty as secretary to EJ Peaker School. Otherwise, the appearance of the 80's band Felony will appear, which is interesting but moves too long on WAY. Just like the movie ..... I had to check how much time was left and could not wait for "Graduate" to be a better movie.
