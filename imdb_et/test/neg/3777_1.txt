Parallel to this film and "Captain Walrus" (an independent film shown at the 1994 Team Projects Festival), it is so blindingly obvious that "Sally Marshall is not a stranger" is to be seen with the knowledge that it is riding on the success of the Second Work. <br /> <br /> Captain Walrus examines two young boys (Geoff and Roger, played by Dean Turner and Brett Allen, respectively) to explore the wonderful behavior of their new neighbor, Britney (played by Louise Farley). When two boys look through their telescope, they watch a single man calling Captain Walrus (Peter Sargent). But the emphasis of Captain Walrus is on the futile and somewhat more powerful activities of the neighbor Britney, and less on friendship between two friends. <br /> <br /> Critical success at the film festival, the creation of Captain Walrus on the plot has been clearly acquired and restructured to give the Australian film community another notch on the safety belt for children's products. Although Sally Marshall is not an alien, it is a good film and credit for producers, but its unreliability leaves nothing to be desired.
