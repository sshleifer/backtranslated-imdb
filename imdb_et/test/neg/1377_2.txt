Carlos is probably not the most original comic, but the first series was fun, his direct comments and observations were fresh. I stayed for a couple of seasons, but after all the accusations of stealing the material, at the end of July 7, I got a couple of episodes of Mencia's senses. Carlos has a lot more toilet humor and sex jokes than race observations. In one episode he was the same as he was in the same league as Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle. I don't think so. Maybe Comedy Central will give him another season, but the episodes I saw sounded tired and the same as Osbournes has more words. Carlos, go a few years ago, get fresh material and try again.
