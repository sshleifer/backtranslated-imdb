This is perhaps the worst film I've ever seen. What is the obvious talent of Michael Imperiol. From start to finish is a nasty movie. I can say that this director is not "auteur". You never get inside the game, the head of the character, the amazing talent with the numbers that the real Stuey was. The coke scene is bad enough to throw his shoe out, it could have been a great scene if it was made for movies and not for the stage, with the camera half way through the house where it slides over the drug mirror. The drama is far behind. The scene in which he wins a big championship is simply ridiculous. This should be seen in filmmaking 101 - which does not take pictures.
