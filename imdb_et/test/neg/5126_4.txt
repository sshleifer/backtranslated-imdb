When I first watched this movie in the 80s, I loved it. I liked music, dancing ... all. Recently, I watched the whole DVD watch again and I was struck by how stupid it was - how it contained holes, contradictions, and - frankly - a whole lot of nonsense - and how terrible the dance was. I mean, in a realistic world, he would never have received this ballet report ... The whole thing was quite pathetic. There was also no thorough development of character. I think it was very much a product of the 80s: the movie is not today!
