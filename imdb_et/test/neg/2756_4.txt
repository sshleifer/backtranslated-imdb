I saw the MST3K version of this movie and it's a bad movie - but it's not nearly as bad as its low IMDB rating (currently 1.8 out of ten). At least the film has little production value and apparently he was a competent editor (unlike movies that are really terrible). The main problem with this movie is that it didn't have any attractive characters. The main character, Marv, is so pathetic that he asks almost all the bad things that happen to him. And he is not very smart, or he would have wanted to stay away from the girl Betty. And even more pathetic than Marv is his father who is nothing but a drunk loser. The highlighting of the film is the end result, but even what is so weakly done is completely absent from the film. At least this movie was made for a very funny MST3K episode because Mike and Bots are doing a good job.
