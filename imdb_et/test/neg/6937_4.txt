In some ways, I liked this film because it was a "frenzied", positive atmosphere that it has. I had a problem with the plot aspect, but more about it later. First, the characters were small and one dimensional. "Good People" had similar physical and characteristic characteristics and "bad people" had similar physical and characteristic features ... hmmm. The main story was OK (quite simple and standard) - nothing is too exciting or annoying. The main attraction was, of course, miniature dinosaurs - a kind of nice fantasy element. But they had a very small presence in the film. <br /> <br /> Outside this movie, there was a lively pace and he didn't get too little at any place. I liked the movie. <br /> <br /> The problem I had with the plot was related to the idea of ​​stealing. I think this movie is not well thought out - something is wrong, especially if it's a child's film. I keep the following sentence abstract so as not to be a spoiler (skip if you're worried). "Good guys" are stealing and do not have the same information that the public has - so it's just stealing and it's a bad thing for a movie for a child. <br /> <br /> Generally, if you have kids because of the questionable plot aspect I will consider further. But this whole movie is still a pretty low key, so it may not be important. Submit it if you have other interesting choices.
