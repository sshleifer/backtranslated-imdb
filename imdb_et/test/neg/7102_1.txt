Why Lori Petty was thrown into a tank girl, I never know. Her performance is shiny. His voice is grateful. It is almost impossible for me to say how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> The film has a number of "modern pop" references, which I found very strange because the film was expected to be in the future. This assumption would also have been interesting. Some of the better writings would have helped with the burden. <br /> <br /> Naomi Watts appears in this lightweight techno-geek. I think they should have changed roles. <br /> <br /> I never know why anyone wants this movie unless they were Petty fans. <br /> <br /> Try not to see this movie. Waste of time.
