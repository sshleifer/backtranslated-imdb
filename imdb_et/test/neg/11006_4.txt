The famous Shakespeare director John Madden gives us another pretty bad movie at Ethan Frome. In the middle of the plot, there is a new admirer arriving in Starkfield, where he learns a story of a local struck man with Ethan Frome's diseased wife and a one-time romantic servant. Adapted from the novel by Richard Nelson's award-winning author Edith Wharton, this film is not the least interesting due to the insecure weak script and the bad direction that changes the scenes that should be ridiculous schmaltz. However, there are other aspects besides the film - filmmaking is well done, Rachel Portman gives a great score and although no one is their best, Liam Neeson, Joan Allen, Patricia Arquette and Tate Donovan are working well on their roles. In general, Ethan Frome is only marginal and simply forgotten.
