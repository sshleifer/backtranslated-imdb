I was once a great Olsen fan. I got this movie when I was six and looked at it almost endlessly until I was nine. Then he put dust on my shelf to collect yesterday. I was left blank. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley play Allie and Mel, two twelve-year-olds who are sent to Paris with their grandfather's grandfather. On the way they meet, as expected, two lovely French boys who show them a more fun side of Paris. I think two boys were okay, fake French accents aside. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable and humor is low. Mary-Kate and Ashley play two low girls with too many faces. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie if you're not in Olsen's twin or family movie.
