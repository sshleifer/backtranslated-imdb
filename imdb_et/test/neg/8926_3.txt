Harlan Banks is a thief at the top of his game, but after a successful career he has decided to live with his wife and retire. But he decides to take one of his last routine jobs in Las Vegas. All he has to do is drive a car and it seems easy. Unfortunately, someone hints at the police, and after a passionate car rush, he only rises into slalom to escape and vengeance on those who betrayed him and got him first. A typical competition will appear. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal plays himself (surprise!), Kande ditch, and sporting his beloved Colt 1911 with his usual fracture Aikido. Colt and Aikido have always been with him, but the first thing he remembers about trench-hair is "The Foreigner." It is not particularly impressive, but it adds a little notch to Seagall's deadly arsenal. Or it covers the additional shields it wraps. However, look at it as you choose. His main friend throughout the film is playing Treach (another new thing, a rapper in the action film), and they both reveal a little conspiracy on both sides of the law, and give each offender an obligation. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this movie is that it is painful, and I really mean painless, unigiginal. Seagal follows the plot of the film for a fraction of the time and even succeeds in getting the film fading. Then it becomes boring completely ridiculous in the last scene as people who seemed dead, killing each other suddenly, without reason, to start talking. The rigid that generates the word in every sense. The only real positive thing is a decent opening - driving in Las Vegas with police cars and generally entertaining chaos, but after this brief highlight you have seen it before. Rated: continuous violence and embarrassment
