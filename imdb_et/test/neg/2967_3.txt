There were very few moments in this movie. Only a few characters were specified and not so well. There were enough big land holes to drive the truck. This tempo seemed like an old man. There were many moments that the film never came back like Coco removal. What happened to him? How about Garci's sister? Is he better now? What about Leroy? We didn't learn anything about him. What about electronic piano? How about a rich girl with abortion? What happened to him? It was an interesting sub-block. <br /> <br /> In general, this is not a good movie and I recommend the music that was in this movie. LET'S TIME WARP AGAIN !!!!!!!
