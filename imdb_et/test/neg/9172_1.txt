This film is undoubtedly one of the worst. It was so boring that I just couldn't wait until it ended. I told my girlfriend to watch it after the site had good reviews and even after 30 minutes she looked at me like saying "my nuts". The terrain was as boring as the film, which had nothing more than driving around in the car, which looked at the wind blowing in the bushes. The action was un-inspiring and the film was just a waste of a good idea of ​​wasting a DVD. <br /> <br /> Guy Pierce should have kept his neighbors busy, because at least he was washing his hair. All he did was talk on his phone, but he didn't sell anything as a seller. He would have been before weeks. His girlfriend (once on Coyote's fool) should have danced in the bar because she was at least hot. <br /> <br /> The man who played Vincent (those who watched it was so annoying with his phone calls) that every ordinary person would have traveled to his house and hit him a bit 4. <br /> <br /> I don't know the country someone liked. I want people to look at it to suffer the torture I went through.
