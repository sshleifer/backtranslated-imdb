Game .... Huh ... game. I'm not even sure that the bloody hosts of this particular reality game know what the term "game" means, not to mention the bloody players of the game! <br /> <br /> The aspiring PUA would look at it and think ... Hmmmmm ... What was FORK fearing that it was a useless excuse to introduce attractive women? I've seen my neighbors DOG attracting women more than barely! And this is one UGLY bloody dog! And its main approach to tactics is frenetically hump your feet! <br /> <br /> I'm challenging the show's disappointed chump hosts to SHOW-down; demonstrating their ability to extend the SO ... Can they offer? If we want to see this piece of un-reality-drivel, then you realize, no, those supreme, mentally masturbating, breastfeeding-boyfriends, want to be Queer Eye hosts or something similar (not that there's something there wrong ...), will not be able to retract his penis in a sufficiently short time to provide a REAL extension demo. <br /> <br /> If you dear North Americans say, "..." Nuff Said! ... "<br /> <br /> Message Down Under ... with love.
