There are really no redemption factors for this show. Simply put, it's just terrible. Absolutely terrible. It's just a terrible "reality" show. Not only that, it's a terrible fiction. So they grab the camera, harass the local people and filth the random landscapes painfully "trying to be a dramatic-yet-failed" monologue. This exhibition is basically a number of teenagers running around with a home video camera that is trying to make a really bad horror movie. The only difference is that this exhibition has a budget and writers. Streamed budget and terrible writers. <br /> <br /> Problems, how do I read you? First, let's talk about it on a personal level. I am not a skeptic of the paranormal situation. I'm ready to believe whats paranormal and whats not, and I'm sure there are many people who feel the same. So, if you are going to show a paranormal, you have to do a good job to convince the viewer that what they see is either paranormal or not, because the viewer can just believe differently. I hate to compare it, but I don't see why not now. Take, for example, "Ghost Hunters". In "Ghost Hunters" you can say that the cast is equal to the audience. They are not completely skeptical, but they are still ready to handle possible paranormal abnormalities. They have to look at something and be prepared to say that "it's possible that it's just something". With that in mind, they tried to try and prove themselves wrong. They use technology and a number of other gadgets with constant moderation to determine what is paranormal, with the fact that what they can follow may not have something in mind. Not only do they try to convince themselves of what is real and what is not, in the process they are trying to convince you. This element of doubt does not occur in "Paranormal State". Strike one. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal" says cast simply that there is this spooky place and its HAUNTED, so we find some SPIRITS! And right now you know and say to yourself, "Okay, convince me otherwise". It is not professional in interviews. In fact, sometimes it seems that they just harass local people in their so-called. They have no real evidence to support their claims other than assumptions and theories, and the best they have to do is someone who "claims" that they can contact dead people who don't have someone to support that person and how right they are . They could just have just picked up a few random people on the street and said, "pretend you can contact your show. In the "Mothman" episode it happens simply. Without any convincing evidence at the end of the show, they will bring out individuals where he makes a random, painfully written "reading" of the suspected area of ​​how something "haunts" to convince his audience. Very, very poor efforts. I feel that one of the main problems with the exhibition is that he knows the script. During one episode, one of these "paranormal abnormalities" attacks at times to be dramatic. Such dramatic sequences would make a skeptical laugh and even those on the fence understand what they are looking at, there are just a few tabloid-esquire trash bins. If the purpose of the exhibition was to try to convince their audience that these "paranormal" events are real, they do so terribly. Strike two. <br /> <br /> However, there is always a counter. Just one last point to see if the show is worth it. What if the show does not try to convince you that these paranormal events are real and are simply trying to attract you with good fiction? Also, this level fails. When the creators of the exhibition try to make their audience entertaining handicraft, writing is too poor and even at a fictional level cannot persuade the audience that its cast members are experiencing a truly unknown in all their terrible glory. Writing is not just convincing and even, dare say, boring. So triple. <br /> <br /> So what this exhibition is about is just a lot of teenagers who are too ready or too easy to believe in paranormal just because it is just more amazing than the reality, with the camera, the bad scenario and the bad actors, who just make a really bad horror movie. This is the whole stage. There is no reason to see it, not even an entertainment factor, and there is no reason to take care of it. To be blunt, its flat. There are no redeeming factors for this exhibition.
