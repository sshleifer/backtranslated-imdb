I thought if someone tried to make the whole Matamoros confusion into a goreporn. Anyway, here are some things I learned from Mexico about watching this movie. <br /> <br /> ~ All Mexican women are very hot - Do you remember this little wilderness in Unearthed? Yes, this must be the city of the Mexican sister. Don't worry about whores, just put a couple of smooth moves on the hot bartender. He's just as hot as prostitutes and probably they don't have children! <br /> <br /> Half of Mexico is controlled by the crazy Satan-worshiping Palo Mayombe cult. Â¡Ay, karamba! On the other hand, as everyone here in the US knows, drug dealers are run by. Fortunately, this sex-tourisim does not interfere with trade and our extremely low wage factories. <br /> <br /> ~ Mexican police officers are useless. Don't go to them. Go to the nearest occult shop and ask for a hot chick behind the counter that happened to your lost friend. He gets much more help than police officers. <br /> <br /> If you are extremely tortured by the above-mentioned bodybuilders, don't go into any part of the Psalms or Bible. You just mess with the mojo.
