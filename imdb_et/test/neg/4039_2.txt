Other comments suggest that this movie is almost ever made in the WORST movie. Let me see how many different words I can describe it: boring, tempted, ridiculous, nervous, stupid, terrible ..... <br /> <br /> I could go on with these descriptions, but obviously you can <br /> <br /> I would have given 0, bad behavior, poor control, poor production, poor plot, if possible. <br /> <br /> It was made in 2001 and looks more like 1965. Very low budget, boring plot, terrible action, really bad special effects, and so on. <br /> <br /> I rarely see a Sci-Fi movie that I think is bad. I mean, it's garbage. It also has nothing. As for the "B-Movie", this is the bottom of the lot. <br /> <br /> I think I'd have more than 90 minutes of blank paper to watch. This kind of junk gives the bad low budget "B" movies a bad name. This makes Ed Wood's movies good. <br /> <br /> Watching live movies is just when you think you've seen the worst, see something worse! <br /> <br /> DJ Perry is a terrible actor and has no individual qualities that make him stand out. <br /> <br /> Avoid this waste at all costs! Oh humanity!
