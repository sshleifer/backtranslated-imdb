I am writing this note as a chess player and as a movie viewer. I watched the 1997 Kasparovi-Deep Blue games online. I know something about the issues raised. Other chess players come and want to know if this movie is worth seeing / buying and I'm talking about them to a large extent. However, I try not to ignore those who are not "chess". <br /> <br /> This film is about Garry Kasparov and the specially built computer "Deep Blue" 1997 game. But the first movie you see in the movie is neither Kasparov nor the computer, but "THE TURK". It is an "automatic" built at the beginning of the 18th - 19th century in Europe, and played winners against all entrants. I put the word "automatic" in quotation marks because it was, as everyone knows, fake. There was a man inside. <br /> <br /> If you don't like "TURK", you can't stand the movie because "TURK" is as much of a screen as Kasparov, maybe more, in a modern frame or in an old movie. The repeated appearance of "TURK" every few seconds highlights Kasparov's accusation that "Deep Blue" was human aid - that it was (to some extent) a counterfeit computer that IBM cheated there was a "man inside". scenes to help you win. Not only does Kasparov not believe it, but filmmakers believe it. And so it is not really a huge number of chess games or programming chess accessories. This is a propaganda piece of a big company that allegedly abuses the helpless grandmaster. Indeed, it is much like "negative campaign advertising" because it is full of intimidating music and camera work, and spooky sound effects and innuendo ("we've never discovered what was behind this locked door") and constantly present Now, most people in the chess community is pretty much convinced that IBM is not deceiving and that it was at work in Garry Paranoia. First of all, in order for a person to help "Deep Blue" hit Kasparov, it seems that you need a person who was better than "Deep Blue" AND better than Kasparov. Since there was no such person, the whole idea is a bit suspicious from the beginning. What's more, by the time this movie was made, there were programs on the computer that could work on your computer, which could have won the grand grandmasters. Today, much more than in 1997, we take for granted that a computer can do things that you might not expect. And we are less likely to take this monumental human tragedy that the computer won in chess. (And in fact, the bottom line is that Kasparov beat himself with two bad mistakes, including leaving the game 2 in the drawn position.) <br /> <br /> As for chess games, you will see very little. There are some comments from masters and commentators to tell you briefly how they went, but really you can hardly see any strategy or tactics at all. Of course, I took this as the main drawback of a chess player, but I also think that non-players will be deceived. Imagine, for example, a baseball movie, where you can hardly see the game - just a commentator who tells you that "Game Fouris won the white Sox Astrose with such and such a score." For example, here we are told that Kasparov made a bad mistake in opening the decisive game 6, but we do not show the position on the screen or say why it was confusing or what it should have done instead or something. We'll see a few seconds from Kasparov, who is holding his head, and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera work. <br /> <br /> (Since I saw this on a DVD, let me warn chess players about DVDs as Jacket lets you add apps to games with "analysis". ! This is an automatic analysis of computer voice synthesizer from some version of Chessmaster that tells you when a piece is being attacked and the pawn is isolated and you are "Caro-Kann Defense, Main Line." Blahhhh.) <br /> <br /> Someone can come and say, "Well, clearly this movie is meant to dramatize non-player games and so it is unfair to be impatient against it." But it doesn't really do a good job to reach a non-player - it cuts off some points that the real beginner really would like to explain. For example, it is said that Kasparov could have received "constant control" in another game, but it does not explain what it is (or show what he would have seen on a table that would have been interesting). It flashes back to the Kasparov-Karpov matches, but does not explain why they are two or who organized them, etc. I didn't need this information myself, but I know it. If you have no chess experience yet, there are places where you are confused, and that is just a movie error. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I cannot recommend a movie that, like "TURK" itself, is not what it is going to be (documentary), but rather an illusion of the stage.
