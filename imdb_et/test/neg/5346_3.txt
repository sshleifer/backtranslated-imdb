I've been wasting my Saturday night to see this mess! I saw Chris Noth's name (Mr. Big, from "Sex & the City"), Robert Patrick ("X-Files"), decadent Elliot Gould, Colm Meaney, and Mercedes Ruehl credit; very reasonable IMDb rating (5.6); and many good reviews in IMDbis. To my surprise, the film is terrible: the characters are poorly constructed; the story is trying to be funny, but it's totally silly; The character of Mercedes Ruehl is amazingly stupid for Princeton professor. So, I decided to investigate the reliability of good estimates and found that most of them were made by IMDb users only with a review, so cast and team relatives or friends or people who are hired to promote this garbage are cast. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sem Retorno" ("Not Returning")
