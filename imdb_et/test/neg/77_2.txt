OK, so my summary line is a cheap trick. But the movie is full of them and it is absurdly praised, so ... <br /> <br /> I got it on one TV (uncut because TV here shows all the movies, it's for you Americans who could say that i'm not like it because i saw a cut version of television - luckily it's just a US thing - and had no idea what it was. I switched on, hit the last minutes of the show and the movie started. After a few minutes I was begging that it was comedy, given the particularly ridiculous beginning of the clich√© (yes, it's a bad movie-in-film, I know, but what's the way to keep the viewer interesting!) doesn't even know why I didn't switch channels. And yes, in fact, the comedy of the film appeared, albeit involuntarily. <br /> <br /> Marina Zudina is pretty pretty, but gosh, what a terrible performance! If the alien's role is smart enough (he doesn't talk about the language barrier), but sorry, Marina baby, playing mute doesn't mean Harpo Marx's embodiment. His actions are inadvertently funny at many moments, see him when he pulls X when he kills. He wants to kill you, no time to play Zorro. We get a lot of "running upstairs" things running under tension, like the worst slashers, and things that pull the carpet and the bad guy. Ugh! Will Hollywood ever learn? But the best / worst pearl is men with aging and ... Well, I've never seen anyone in the bath with an electric shock, but I'm sure your comic strips in real life don't see if? And how do you immediately trust a middle-aged man because he says he's a cop, and doesn't ask him to show his credentials? OK, so he's a real cop. However, it doesn't make sense to ask for a badge (plot-wise, we could always guess that credentials might be false or they might be crooked by a policeman. Writing a screen 101). And how big twists? Don't tell me you didn't see it come 200 miles away ... <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the bad old Alec Guinness and his useless stock footage. Now, I mean, what's the point of giving him a "Mystery Guest Star" credit in ... END titles? The film is over, it's no longer a secret, and everyone and their brother has identified Guinness (even non-movie makers recognize Star Wars). Better this way, so we can pretend it's not a late actor. <br /> <br /> People compare it to all people, Hitchcock. I think it must be a milkman, John Hitchcock, because Mr Sir Alfred felt it, not to mention it. And it gets 6.8 / 10 ???? It's the bottom 100 material! But then let's talk about a rating system that allows the "Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" to appear as the third best film ever made (see Top 100), so ... <br /> <br /> 2/10.
