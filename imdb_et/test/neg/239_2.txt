Oh, man, they knew how to do them. Hollywood has forgotten the key components of making a bad movie: cardboard and god who is afraid of the hero of the scientist's action! <br /> <br /> This movie was so close to the masterpiece, unfortunately it wasn't because it couldn't deliver the Moon's radio guns and invaders. The MST3K version tried to fix it by adding a pilot to Captain Cody, where a man with a rocket jacket struggles with Moon's bad make-up, but it hasn't grown up. <br /> <br /> Comments from boys in the theater were also not as funny as I expected them to be. All in all, there is great disappointment.
