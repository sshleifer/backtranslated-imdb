I watch the movie TON and enjoy the B movie, but this movie was terrible. Apart from the quality of the "homemade" movie, it was very slow and seemed pointless. I only comment on the second comment I saw here that it was great! WOW! Maybe OK to look on the rainy day if nothing is available. <br /> <br /> The characters were separated and did not match any noticeable reality patterns. The inter-character dialogue was forced and sometimes very confusing. <br /> <br /> I think if you had 51 and some other nuances in the whole area, it might be good - but for me - the average Joe - I can't get it!?
