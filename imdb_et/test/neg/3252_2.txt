This movie should never be done! It stinks, it's terrible, it's not good, it's bad, it's terrible. Starting with a pattern here? Jackie Mason is definitely not Rodney Dangerfield. Ted Knight and Bill Murray walked along with Dangerfield for the first film. It seems that all three (letters) knew they saw one script. The one who didn't have a good idea for that was Chevy Chase, who was around, but I think it was next to both movies. This movie is just NOT FUTURE. Nor does it have any other damaging qualities. This thing depends to a great extent on anti-Semitism, and it works unfortunately. I hated this thing. A waste of all time.
