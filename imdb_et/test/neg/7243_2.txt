No budget directly for the video story of aliens in Arizona involving the military and escaped convicted. <br /> <br /> It is not bad in itself, it suffers cast and the team sort of pass through the pace rather than trying to sell it. It would be as if they knew they were grade z in the movie and want to know they know. Then maybe they just couldn't get it together. <br /> <br /> An error in a z-class movie that could have been something someone cares about - and he had the skill. Why filmmakers with a low budget must insist that they do not really try to do something good, rather than simply making a product. <br /> <br /> 2 out of ten because nothing comes together
