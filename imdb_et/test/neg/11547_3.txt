This movie actually starts quite interesting, but my taste degenerated too quickly into a boring and predictable melodrama. No show is particularly interesting and the camera's work is just plain TV movie stuff, so there's really no reason to see this movie if they're not as big as Jeff Bridges fans, as I think. The bridges are played by Mike Olson, a young man who announces the family's picnic to give up college to go. His parents believe he is "just acting" and tells him "he has no plan". He assures them that he has a plan and that he must discover his true self and his place in the world. So much so, in fact, that he calls them to go the way with him and buys the antique bus to travel by what he and his father repair the real TV movie father-son bonding fashion. Until that movie point, I was somewhat interested in the plot and the characters, and I wanted to see how his captured mother (Vera Miles) reacts on the road to life. Early, there is a funny scene where father and son have to convince him. They show him the inside of the bus, and he is gradually becoming more and more interesting, eventually leaving somewhat talking about curtains between the curtains and the windows. Bridges admires his father (Carl Betz, equipped with a radio transmitter) that he has changed his mind. The father assures him that "the electric oven ... works every time!" <br /> <br /> But the film goes down almost as soon as they arrive. It turns out that Mike's only "plan" is to introduce them to some of his friends who turn out to be the casual people they meet at the hippie rock festival. As soon as I saw the rock festival, I was a little disappointed ... especially when it became clear that the rest of the movie was going on at the festival, not actually on the road. But at least I thought I could have a good band, well, if they can't afford Hendrix or Stones, maybe they would have at least Canned Heat or Little Feat or something like that. No dice - probably the only music in this festival are some terrible chorus group with orchestra that sounded like a weak fifth-dimensional imitation, with a tedious listener who should be humorous. <br /> <br /> We are also introduced to hippie festivals and their various medical melodrames. Kathy (Renne Jarrett) is a beautiful blonde girl who has her existentialism and nature who falls in love with Mickey before revealing that she needs kidney dialysis to live and die at the festival. And two more campers have decided to camp the baby rawly, bringing the struggle between modern medicine and hip-hop ignorance (or something like that). All in all, the longer it will be more painful if anyone who hopes for any element of surprise or true drama gets the film. <br /> <br /> In principle, this is a waste of time, though probably everyone who really is in the late 1960s, early 70s, and movies from that time will be entertained. I'd be as happy as I never see it.
