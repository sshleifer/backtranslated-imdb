This film marks Ben Kingsleys as Frank, a Russian-speaking cellphone who is out of Buffalo. He is also a scary alcoholic and has led to a reduction in his work performance. After he starts to fall asleep during his car, his mob boss sends his uncle to San Francisco, where he has to attend AA meetings and work as a jumper assistant. If you think that doesn't make any sense, you're not alone. <br /> <br /> It gets worse. Well, it actually improves, but not before it gets much worse. Frank is suddenly a master artist, despite the lack of training, but his reactions to funeral and AA meetings are interesting. The viewer begins to root her when they mark positive changes in her life. Luke Wilson is a welcome addition to Frank's sponsor, although he is not given much to do (his character tells us he is gay, but it doesn't matter). Film by introducing the character of Leung descends to idiots. He's totally unrealistic and his role in love for Frank flounders because they don't have chemistry together. At the time he arrives at the picture, Frank becomes less characteristic. His characterization is seemingly random; his behavior is not consistent. Comedy is a low key, and only alternately funny, especially disappointing, considering the cast comedy genealogy. <br /> <br /> Problems are great. Kingsley's accent is terrible and inconsistent. It alternates between Italy, Russia and the Spaniards. During the film, Frank tells many people that he is a human being (including the whole AA group), but no one seems to be caring or willing to do anything about it. The film is based on clich√© scenes to bring it through its final act, especially when Leon's intolerant character is led by Frank at the airport, just as he plans to fly back to Buffalo. <br /> <br /> Although it has a strong prerequisite and an interesting first half hour, the movie will quickly become a complete disaster and will go into complete crap. At the end of the film, Frank celebrates one year of beauty. I hope I will celebrate for many years when I have not seen "you kill me". <br /> <br /> My class: D +
