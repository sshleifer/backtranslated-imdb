my friend and I rented it for a couple of nights. and i have to say it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I mean, woah! "dude, we are better off before the joint closes" and "the guy, the bird is not yet" bra "." what poetry! woah! and it's such a wonderful wonderful movie. I mean, you usually can't find a slasher movie where every single murder is exactly the same. I mean exactly! it is originality now. and almost all transitions between scenes are these great psycho close-ups in purifying ER. how cool! the actress is so wonderful. Dad was just great. must have learned REAL DADS before filming. and how many movies do you find that just doesn't make sense? not much. but it is one of those gems. I mean, how cool is that one boy waited like six hours to pull the prank while his friends were both inside? it's really cool. In general, I would like to say that this is one of the greatest films in the genre, nail, in the world! *****
