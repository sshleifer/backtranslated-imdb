It's just terrible. I regret every second after 80 minutes I spent watching. I think it should be a comedy, but I don't remember a lot of laughs, except for some rough contradictions and even striking mistakes. <br /> <br /> The inconvenient middle-aged man, Lester, meets the inconvenience of medieval women advertising their hearts alone and then murdering them for the money they need to feed their gambling addiction. That's the whole plot, and it's really all that happens. Along the way, there is an attempt to intrigue when Lester begins to call a mysterious stranger who denounces him for secret knowledge, but has been so poorly implemented, you may not understand what should really happen. Sequences where the rich widows of Lester's murders are all quite cruel, but also seemingly dressed in comedy. In one queue, there is a woman who has broken a wooden pole and then an oven. It is very brutally portrayed, but it is played against a big band's roll music, Lester pulls his face and takes over comedy. Another scene has been murdered when he is constantly singing opera operas ... you have to believe it! Actually - you don't have to see it at all, I really recommend you avoid this flop. Fulci does not seem to know what hat he is wearing and where there is no evidence of his previous career. One of the queues was especially sad for me: a revelation when Lester suddenly realizes he has no shadow. Fulci seems to be able to think of the visual representation of this phenomenon on the screen, so that from that moment on he will film the actor to normal, shade and everything! And thus, he captures the whole angle completely. Whether he had a zero budget effect, or he just didn't care enough to think about how to show it. Whatever it is, it should give you a taste of how this whole project is crazy. I couldn't even understand most of the movie and there wasn't really anything worth seeing on the screen. Even the end was the same pancake. The real fuck.
