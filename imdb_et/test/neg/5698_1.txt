It amazes me that someone would consider spending money on such a movie. Really. We should forget that the plot does not even give any original clues ... Most movies are nowadays based on other movie stories, so "simple" lack of originality is not such a big deal. <br /> <br /> But I can't believe that none of the guys in the movie had ever reached it before they were shot on the plane. Because, let's be honest, it would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous. Being sincere, in my opinion, a 6-year-old child with a fake camera would have got something more technically credible. Here are some examples. <br /> <br /> The scene that really made me crazy is when the engines return when they recycle the aircraft. If they need to turn them on again, the radio will say "Ok, push 1 and 2 on the dashboard". These are not the buttons now. They should not be pushed, they should really be pulled up and piloted. This is something that only a plane is addicted to, you know? Wrong. Next scene you see with these fingers pressing "buttons" ... And of course the so-called buttons don't move at all! Not even one millimeter! (And note that I have not even mentioned the fact that aircraft engines are not like a car engine, that you just take the keys and magic happens ... You have to do a complicated procedure to turn them on ...) Come on guys! You could have fake at least the motions! Not to mention the fun final impact of a plane falling through each runway (light poles along the track? What's where they think ?!) ... And the wings won't even disappear! It happened to me once ... Except that the plane was made of Legost! But with the flight crew? He's actually so experienced that he knows exactly where "aux 1" and "aux 2" fuses are in the middle of the cab wires. Should we then mention that a boy who is able to travel by ambulance _and_ is driving his or her computer behind an ambulance? And how did he turn on other aircraft engines? <br /> <br /> Really, I could go with this stuff. This is the eternal movie I've ever met, and I'm also a garbage like Alone In The Dark and other things on the list. Want to earn yourself? Don't look at it.
