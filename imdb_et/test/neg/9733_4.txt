Key Summary: Ipswitch had previously been a vicious circle and fled from Salem's witchcraft to form a secrecy agreement. The first-born men from these families have supernatural abilities and must arrive at the seductive, addictive nature of their use. <br /> <br /> Well, I usually give my doubts about the movies and start with 5, from there: <br /> <br /> Production: -1 very obvious, +1 nicely done special effects, darkness gave me chills, +0.5 for nice dyeing (I like dull blue), -0.5 for a stylish sound track, +0.5 in the opening order - I'm strange for a stylish composition and flashy title design. <br /> <br /> Story / script: +1 decent main idea, -0.5 DBZ / Matrix / Street Fighter ripoff / pastiche, -1 that some plot threads aren't very well explained (spiders, dark), -1 Dull, Predictable End, -1 Free Exposure, Both Words Monologue of the Screen and Bland <br /> <br /> Action / Characteristics: -0.5 For Bad Bad Action, although it gets a little better when the movie progresses, -1 lacile k character development, especially among all women <br /> <br /> Other: +1 free nudity for men and women that are fun to watch, and +0.5 for sex elements that are usually done very badly for this genre and eventually is boring, not hot, +1 to hit this target audience, teen sci-fi / horror / thriller fans, though this movie is not just one of these genres. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: It's not a movie, it's MOVIE. There is nothing to analyze, it's just good (relatively) pure fun. Lots of really attractive actors and actors. Many guys fight in DBZ and Street Fighter style. If you like cute actors and actors, supernatural special effects and / or unnecessarily fun plots, this movie is for you. If you prefer Oscar value, finely-produced movie masterpieces with tons of multilayer, allegorical plot threads and revolutionary visualization techniques, this movie probably doesn't like it. <br /> <br /> The movie gets 4/10.
