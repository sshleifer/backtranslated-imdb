It's been a long time since I've been so flat and boring in the movie like this one. One thing is slow if the symbols are gradually developed or some aspects of the film are obviously improved by such a pace (for example, Lost in Translation), but there is a difference between slow progress. and as stopping as it happened. I think Helen Mirren's face must be disappointed when her husband disappears! Surprise, surprise! What a wonderful creative moment when the mistress and the woman met (sarcasm) And what a great way the whole story ended.
