While it is a comic for Tom and Jerry, it is not a cat and mouse team, but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off that shows that they are going to Africa and hiding themselves in a stereotypically burned cork break to try and mix. Although dialect humor is mostly flat, there is a short musical sequence that includes "black skeletons" that were fun. However, I have to ask, how could Tom and Jerry still have their makeup after a few times in the water? One of the many scraps that Van Beuren Corporation produced for RKO Radio Images before being distributed to Disney. It only deserves to be an animation buffer or you are interested in how certain nations are considered stereotyped for entertainment.
