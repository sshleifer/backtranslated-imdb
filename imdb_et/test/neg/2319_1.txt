First I start blasting the film. Remove Abbott and Costello from the pain, and you have a poorly colored film, a stiff cardboard in the aching section, a poorly dubbed sound (especially during singing) and a tedious dialogue (eg listening to the line of "Mr. Dinklepuss" ad infinite). Probably some studio hack thought they could cash in Disney's CLASSIC presentation "Mickey and Beanstalk", but perhaps the audience was more light (unlikely) or double (more likely). Even children should feel offended by playing this movie. Total Cellulose Waste. Now, Abbott and Costello's behavior. Bud Abbott always played a straight man, and all the accounts had a nicer person. In the case of the radio, his character was usually a smooth quick speaker and was especially funny when his speed caused his lines to slip and make mistakes. In films he still plays a straight man but is more of an artist. Not that he is bad, but Groucho Marx has played this character perfectly. Duo's real traverse on film is Lou Costello. Again, he was funny on the radio. He played a character that was a bit slower than Abbott, but not too slow! He also had lines and started to laugh when he was ad-lib about Abbot's mistakes. I don't know if the film was his decision or not, but in the movies his character becomes Stan Stan's fraudulent incarnation, which in turn was made even more by Jerry Lewis. Why change? he was funny on the radio when he was smarter - but here he gets a child-like character that looks like he is a robbery of cameras for every frame. this characterization is shown in all the films they make and only brings the image to the radius. The film career is a poor (very, very bad) copy of Laurel and Hardy. Movies would have been much more fun if they had played their radio characters instead of stockpile recovery.
