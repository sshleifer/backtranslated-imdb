I have to give Billy Dee a credit for trying to pull it out. Knowing that it was a blaxploitation film, I started my DVD with some expectations. I knew it would be a low budget ... acting under-par ... but hoping that a couple of gems would be sprinkled all over. If this film had diamonds or gems, they were successfully buried under tons of tons of coal ... or maybe too much. As an actor and a filmmaker, I often climbed up when potential bright moments were destroyed by cruel performances. But I have to admit I couldn't look. I don't know if it was like a car wreck that you can't keep from your eyes or mysterious power in your movie. This movie is good for a case that has been misunderstood. If Walter Kronkite had to say "aristocratic" jokes, it would be a complete flop, though the joke itself is fun. Let Dave Chappelle say, and we all roll on the floor laughing. This movie needed "Chapelle". Now, if you have the opportunity to buy this movie for the dollar I did, do it. It's worth the money. Maybe I'll take another dollar, buy the rights and get it again. Who knows ... it may not be better, but it certainly can't be worse.
