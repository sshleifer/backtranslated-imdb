This film tried to make Stu's Hungarian life creative. What they forgot was that his life was enough fun enough in itself, without having to do things. <br /> <br /> A short list of inaccuracies: <br /> <br /> 1) Stuey was not sent directly to Las Vegas for the Gin tournament to pay off old debts, spent a lot of time in Florida and went to Las Vegan, when he ran Gin games on the east coast. <br /> <br /> 2) Stuey never associated (or played Gini) with a casino transfer (like what he played in Pat Morita). <br /> <br /> 3) There was no 1997 WSOP build magic turn. In fact, Stuey barely missed the tournament. He even chewed cocaine a week before. <br /> <br /> Tell the story correctly or not at all. 4 out of 10 stars by Michael Imperoll for reliable performance (the only redeeming quality of this movie).
