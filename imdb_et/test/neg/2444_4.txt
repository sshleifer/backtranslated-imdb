Silly Disney movie of college students who accidentally discover a drink that makes things invisible. It's not a bad idea and some special effects are pretty good. However, the script is very bad ... all the fun flop and the actors are bad. Everyone is trying to be funny and they are not. A real boring, stupid Disney movie. But it was fun to see Kurt Russell so young.
