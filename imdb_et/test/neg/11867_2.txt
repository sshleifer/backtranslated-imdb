Meh, summing it up for me really. Bored story, uncomfortable dialogue, boring action scenes (HOW do you do something like fighting or shootout boring? Do you really need to do it?), Real signs, etc. Just bored. Snipes is a talented actor and physical performer, but none of this has come to the surface of his DTV work as an opportunity to offer the audience a much higher product than he used to. Imagine a decent script with some solid characters and what are the damn explosive activities, fighting, shootouts, and so on. How is it so hard? My personal opinion is that the main players of the producers simply don't care. There is no evidence of the enthusiasm they are doing. See the Snipes First Two Steel, Passenger 57, Rising Sun, New Jack City, Demolition Worker, etc.? Awesome, intense performances, complemented by decent (if not always) scripts, good-backed lies and evil actions. None of them is evident in any of these publications, which are still a huge shame. Distributors collide with Wesley's face, knowing that the audience is hitting them because they have not yet realized that they haven't seen him in theater for almost 2 years. <br /> <br /> I love to see Snipe work with someone like Isaac Florentine, who really knows how to make the most of DTV production, and work with Alpha Stunts who are just some of the best action masters. Together, they would make a great crew and a Snipes passenger car that we all would be proud of. <br /> <br /> Detonator sucks. It's not as bad as Marksman who looks, but it still sucks.
