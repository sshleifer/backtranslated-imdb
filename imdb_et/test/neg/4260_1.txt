it is by far the most pathetic film that Indian cinema or cinema has brought out. it is a shame that such a respectful actor is so low in making such a shameful film. the little respect he had has been lost forever. he should have retired long ago, instead of making himself stupid and losing all self-respect. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. I would also recommend that Amitabh should retire already. I don't know how IMDb has made some suggestions for this movie. there are no such terrible films to make recommendations. seeing such films as Devdas in the same line as this film makes a serious injustice for a decent film. its general could be shameless.
