OK, when I was little (and I mean 2 or 3, not 6 and 7) Barney was one of my favorite events. Then I grew out of it and threw all my old Barney tapes away. So I see that one day, when I move through the channels, now Barney Kaboos is going on, and I thought "is this the right show?" When I realized it was, I chewed. Why did they change the exhibition settings from CABOOSE? Since then, the show has been terribly terrible and the only reason I gave it to it is a) because I'm nice, b) because of Riff and c) because in the old days the show was allowed. Now I just hate it. HATE IT. <br /> <br /> 2/10
