Not good. -Not at all. <br /> <br /> This installment revolves around the descent of Amityville's original murderer, who has to face his past to get rid of Amityville's horrible fear. <br /> <br /> It's basically nothing. My contribution is that this movie was made for a couple of extra money to buy a boat or something ... because it's just ridiculous ... Fortunately, it doesn't kill or destroy the series, but it just doesn't affect the series at all. <br /> <br /> I have to say that the mere fact that it is constantly connected to an old, notorious house is probably the only thing that makes it one more tolerable than the "The Amityville Knitting".
