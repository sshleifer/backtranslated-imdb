I saw it in a cheap DVD edition called "Entity Force". Since I enjoy the 80's horror films, I thought I was a real treat. Unfortunately, the movie is mostly boring and you are always waiting for something. It will eventually become somewhat interesting, but it's in the last quarter of the movie. It's too late. If that doesn't happen, it's not that big we get dead bodies "floating" along the ground and pursuing mausoleum girls. It's not the absolute worst I've seen, but you can do a lot better. I would only recommend it to the collectors of the brilliant 80's horrors.
