This popular children's story on the film is a spectacular look. I know this is one of the first efforts in cinema, but this 15-minute picture is unimaginable and poorly captured. The "Big Train Robbery" (1903), which I commented on, is much more creative and exciting to look at. <br /> <br /> We see a little long-haired Jack Cow (2 men with a cow) in a bunch of merchant beans and later a beanstalk, where his mother throws them out in the yard (I think poor Jack was wrong). Jack dreams of a goose (in fact, it seems like a chicken) and a golden egg, and the next day the stem climbs into the sky. <br /> <br /> No effort has been made in this movie. The stalk looks like a rope with leaves, the giant is just a long bearded man at home, where there is nothing unusually large compared to Jack and the climax of the movie, where Jack makes his escape with a goose-chicken and his golden egg is unhappy when the stuffed mannequin stays out of the screen instead of stuffed mannequin. and then the actor takes his place - the exorbitant death dancing up on his feet, like most early films. Beanstalk (rope-covered rope) comes down from top to bottom and rolls well on giant ends. <br /> <br /> Look at something else.
