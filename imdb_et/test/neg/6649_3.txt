In order to fit DNA sera into a secret database file, Federal Agent Frank Poo (Andy Garcia) has discovered the only person able to save his son's life, a psychopath that Michael Keaton plays. However, if the serum transfer in a local hospital goes awfully wrong, some Mr.Poo must do everything in his power to ensure crazy survival to make an inevitable transfer possible. By the way, his name is not really poo, I just feel it calling him. Despite its original concept, it is an incredible and complex endless activity monitor. I've never been a big fan of Andy Garcia and I told my career that it wasn't fixable, this film was all worse. sequences are considered rather disappointing and ending suck. Having made a major accident to the Pacific heights, Keaton's psychopathic bad boy is too crazy and charismatic to condemn. Brian Cox disappears as Garcia's firm and sincere boss.
