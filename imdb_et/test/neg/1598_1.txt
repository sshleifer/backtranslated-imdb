Usually I tolerate twisted movies, but it's really a sick obsessive self-absorbing film! <br /> <br /> First of all, the writer / director is a completely absorbent man full of sick jokes that aren't funny at all. Second, he is also a sick pervert that manipulates and poisons the minds of children! I can't believe my ears when I heard the sick and perverted monons spoken to children. <br /> <br /> I'm very sorry for Zane Adlum and Devon Matthews. They are both very talented but fell victim to Eric Schaeffer's little-known movie! <br /> <br /> And what the hell happened to Eric Mabius? I thought he met the girl he was supposed to marry, but he wasn't a wedding! In fact, he's got this bald guy! Did this time really fly fast? <br /> <br /> Anyway, don't waste your time to see this movie if you don't want one sick Eric Schaeffer to be poisoned and manipulated!
