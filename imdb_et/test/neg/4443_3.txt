Watching QUINTET does not mean differently when you look at a Portuguese-speaking person or another language you don't understand. You get the idea that they play the game, and if you look closely enough, you can just start to understand the rules. But why bother because it is clear that you can't join and you wouldn't want you to have the chance. <br /> <br /> Director Robert Altman is not the one who would like the audience to like their films, not to mention their understanding. Sometimes it allows you to join the picture to be part of a crowd, such as M * A * S * H, NASHVILLE and A WEDDING, movies full of hubbub and orchestrated chaos, one or two body body scenes wouldn't make big differences. And at other times, he seems to be upset by the fact that someone can even watch his movie, like pictures or three women, where stories are almost personal monologues made for one audience, with Altman QUINTET, Altman seems to deliberately encourage me to participate in the story . <br /> <br /> You can't depend on Altman to make a logical or anticipated thing that sometimes makes his films so iconic, but sometimes the unexpected act is bold, just stupid. a young woman who is probably the last person to be able to conceive, and she is really a child. This last hope in a disintegrating society is almost instantly gone; Altman does not have to wait until the end to play show your last depressing map in this complicated nihilistic and pessimistic story. He lets us know how empty and meaningless life is outside the bat. Brave? Maybe. Stupid? Certainly. There is no intention that he will try to create a story of a fast-melting iceberg, while reminding us of the pointless effort. <br /> <br /> For a record, QUINTET, can at least claim to be prophetic. The story is focused on a deceptive game played by different eternal characters. This is the form of the TAG (murder game): a handful of people are directed to each other for elimination, each of which is a future assassin and everyone as a future victim. Two or more may form a third to kill. When they die, new goals are set. Whoever lives, wins. All of this happens in an exotic and unpleasant desert. This is to a large extent the "Survivor" extreme, sci-fi version - minus commercial connectors and fake "reality". <br /> <br /> It's not a bad concept epic for sci-fi. Apocalyptic position, world microcosm (cast is sharply multinational), a game where there can be no trust or at least not for a long time and no one wins. The word is literally a cold war. A blind eye director with dark humor and violent invention may have a field day. The secret of QUINTET is not in the game or how it is played, but why is it all there. If "Quintet" is a metaphor of life, it seems that Altman does not see anything in this material, but an opportunity to show life an empty, pointless game - a conclusion that is obvious when it is wrong. Given the lively, though cynical, nature of the rest of his diverse films, I do not believe that Altman also believes in QUINTET. And if Altman has no faith in his material, why should we do that?
