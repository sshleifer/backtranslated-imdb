Some people thought it was funny because they loved the political issues discussed in this article. However, I am so tired of the state of the two-party system that I cannot get propaganda on either side of the stomach. I was hoping for a horror show, but I got "cute" zombies and partisan crowds. I'm watching my fears be scared. It didn't even try to be scary. Also, in his films, in his political / cultural satire, Romero does not understand ... it was a blatant, non-imaginative story that was difficult for me (for wrong reasons). On the bright side, when you hate Bush, you love it (I disagree with anger and Bush with this statement)
