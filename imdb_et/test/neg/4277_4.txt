This version of Mansfield Park, which was extremely accurate for the novel, lacked the compassion I felt for Fanny, which is important and central to this Jane Austen story. The reason for this was the complete lack of acting ability of actress Sylvestra Le Touzel. He had no complaints and sometimes seemed to have lost space or depth. The scene he has an uncle where he breaks down in hysterics was hysterical. He badly surpassed this decisive scene and I was really sorry that Henry Crawford would ever care for him. <br /> <br /> The polar opposite is Mary Crawford's portrait by Jackie Smith-Wood. What a wonderful actor, in a very difficult part, that this character is witty and selfish, selfish, but sensitive to love. <br /> <br /> I've always loved Fanny. He is a light visa, but with an incomprehensible idea of ​​what is right and what he thinks is worthy of respect and admiration. Fanny in this adaptation is too weak and submissive, barely under his own thought until the end of the series. As far as I wanted such Fanny ... I just couldn't. <br /> <br /> I recommend leaving Mansfield Park in the version that is the real thing ... novel. Fanny doesn't disappoint ... you love her!
