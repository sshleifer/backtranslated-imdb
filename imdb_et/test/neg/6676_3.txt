Unlike what one reviewer said, it's not a Magnum Force ripoff. With this, Lieutenant Hal Holbrook gathered his small team at the Academy's Rookie to send repeated offenders. In extreme justice, this operation is punished by higher cases of LAPD. The exact way they are punished is a questionable method. <br /> <br /> This special investigation track seems to be a shelter for LAPD malformations, those who have forgotten their first commitment are defense and service. That's why Scott Glenn thinks that Lou Diamond Phillips, a detective who has more to do with the internal market than his part of beef, is perfect for the team. <br /> <br /> What should have been sent to him about Phillips is that he has a nice live-in relationship with a reporter, Chelsea Field. It definitely threw me into this movie, you think Lou would be the last man he'd try to recruit. <br /> <br /> And what his team is is a death penalty. They direct the criminals who follow them and expect them to remain in action. Then it's the open season. <br /> <br /> Extreme justice went a long way in trying to make some points. Certainly, there would have been no harm in waiting for the robber's gang to stop the robbery and take them out. No civilian was hurt when the citizens of Coffeyville did it with the Daltons. Or wait until three rapists stop working before moving. It was asked to believe here. <br /> <br /> And to be honest, I couldn't buy it. Many good players are really wasted.
