Anyone who takes care of something real Diane Arbus or who appreciates psychological truthfulness is a bad film. Arbus was a brilliant, talented, restless, and restless person, but this film depicts him as completely self-evident and truly bizarre in his taste and judgment. Kidman depicts him nervous and vague, while he was someone who knocked people with his charisma. The totally imagined relationship at the heart of the film is incredible, and Robert Downey is really annoying in his ridiculous imagination, which seems to think he is better off the rest of the world than simply because of his misery. The film depicts this meeting as an arbus interest as a "freaks" source, a truly banal explanation for the inspiration of the 20th century's greatest photographs. My mystery is why some people with talent and intelligence chose to participate in this film in some way.
