Closius says Baltic Storm is banned in Sweden. That's not right! Instead, you can buy a movie almost anywhere, such as petrol stations, shopping centers, the internet (of course) and so on. Often at a very low price, because this film is both BAD and nobody wants to see it, despite all the tricks that keep interest. Only the conspiracy of theorists, psychologists and other persons living in la-la-land and those who "know the truth" is approached. <br /> <br /> Working in a museum with an Estonian catastrophe as a subject I meet with. I've heard of all the theories that exist like cocaine smuggling, arms smuggling, biological warfare, nuclear smuggling, red mercury, foreigners, Russian-American-Estonian-Swedish and Finnish intelligence, often in different combinations. <br /> <br /> Some ordinary people have asked why we don't show the movie? The question was only for those who haven't seen this terrible crap. <br /> <br /> "Baltic Storm" is not forbidden again in Sweden. It has some entertaining features, but what the hell is Donald Sutherland doing in this movie?
