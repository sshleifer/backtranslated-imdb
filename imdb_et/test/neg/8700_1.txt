If you are a fan of the Ten Commandments, this film will make you cry. given, I am currently about 1/2 hour, but it is so painful, I felt it was my duty to warn the Ten Commanders before they were under this bastard. I didn't think the special effects would actually be able to get worse than they were in the 1950s when the original was taken, but this 2006 remake proves to me wrong. I can forgive some flat special effects, but the craptical dialogue, the melodramatic lifestyle-movie-style and the dirty-wax-figure-life-life-giving activities give me the hope that they will write around the plot and sink the red sea into the moses.
