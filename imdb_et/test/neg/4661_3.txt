Dear Readers! <br /> <br /> In my film research, I've found that when Michael Bay makes a movie, people put it and hate it, but they're still looking at it, and it's about $ 100 million somewhere. Why? As Michael Bay is one of the top five leaders. Next to Ridley Scott, Spielberg, Kubrick, and Miyazaki, Michael Bay is Hollywood's best action and adventure leader. This point has proved to be the most rocked Armageddon. <br /> <br /> The asteroid, which is Texas's size, hits the planet and the only way NASA can do this is to ground the men's team with an asteroid, drill their cores and shoot down the nuclear explosive, then air the asteroid. Only one person is qualified enough for this: Bruce Willis. Willis depicts Harry Stamper, a grizzled tempered oil purifier, trying to keep his family away. This does not help her daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) with her best drill AJ (Ben Affleck). Trains trained by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), NASA leader, Stamper, and his roughneck cage team will become an astronaut and save the world. <br /> <br /> Armageddon is a two-part film. First of all, there are funny parts where we meet gang and cunning. Then they get into space and all the comedy gets out of the window and replaces despair with special effects, cool music and very serious behavior. Murphy's law goes crazy in the second part, which means that everything that goes wrong can really go wrong by increasing the film's tension to prominent levels. <br /> <br /> Cold pain and teamwork (as Michael Bay leader Jerry Bruckheimer and Gale Anne Hurd, and JJ Abrams as one of the screenwriters), tons of special effects, great humor, fantastic music and intro by Ben-Hur himself , Charlton Heston, Armageddon rocks of great time. <br /> <br /> Signed, continuous DVD collector, Matt Macleod <br /> <br /> Parental warnings: This is not a children's movie. The F-bomb is used a couple of times and many other bathing words are used, plus there is a Strip bar and an extremely intense second part can be too heavy for the child.
