Like another reviewer, I wanted to like this movie. I went with my father, who was the greatest lover and multiplier of classical music, but neither of us was able to stand this movie. I wouldn't even call it a movie. A better description may be a record of some chamber concerts. I remember the camera never moved. Rather, I sat the entire tripod for each stand. The dramatic effects of the experiments alone were at the end of each work when the film was cut into windy poor trees or a small wavelength on the beach. I'm sure the director would have preferred to use some really big crashes, but the best he found was a few inches in a nearby lake and again with a stationary camera. Really pathetic. I can't imagine how anyone could justify the rating of this movie over five. When we went out, we were my father and mysterious how it was possible to make such a bad movie. I don't know any good movie about Bach. The world really needs one, but just because it is not, there is no reason to see it. Someone does one. So far, just re-write _Amadeus_.
