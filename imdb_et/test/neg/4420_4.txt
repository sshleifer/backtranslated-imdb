The breadth and height of this film's ruin me. A week ago, I wrote a comment on the silent epic of MACISTE IN HELL in 1926, which referred to it as "incredible". Then I met Pollonia Bros. BLOOD RED PLANET. Wow ... <br /> <br /> This is all the scope behind the thinking behind it. Pollonia Bros and colleague John McBride thought so great that Arthur C. Clark and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: SPACE ODESSEY was happily thirty-two years before that slope. In fact, Kubrickel was a simple modeler, a budget, a real actor, and a big studio that supported his little "Star Trek" ripoff, and all that Arthur C. Clarke had to do was write a damn thing. What is so difficult to typewriter around muscle? On the other hand, Pollonia's brothers had to think radically, outside the box and quickly. They recruited half a dozen of their friends and colleagues - including hot chicks - bought a number of colored light bulbs, attacked an old office supplies dump for every keyboard, monitor, and handsfree headset they found, all of the identical black landmarks made in every county cupcake tin, learned enough 3D modeling and skinning of the texture to revive a couple of spacecraft airfares, spent a few hours typing a script, doing what is the most frightening monster of the monster because this terrible little monster Jabba, who was with him, was fried by R2D2, literally spent days VHS camera and Amiga to shoot and edit their movie, and winners came. This is the best D.I.Y. even the LOGANS RUN or BATTLESTAR: GALACTICA (the original series), which is a cool look at our future, directly to a news publisher who misplaces the wrong and poorly, directly into the epic of the movie fan room I have ever seen, and in proportion to the talents and resources available to filmmakers. matching 2nd handbag. As a species we are doomed. <br /> <br /> In a matter of minutes, it is a tremendous progression to later epics such as DINOSAURI KRONICALS or PREYALIEN: ALIEN PREDATORS, which is funny because it was made before one of these masterpieces. Somewhere along the way, Pollonia began to take on itself: this film is filled with a firm conviction that gives you the chance to believe that you can really breathe dust mask and two bicycle spray bottles. And the scene where the alien beast consumes a miniature crew member immediately made me think where I saw it before: GODZILLA VS. SEA MONSTER, where a huge robbing monster crabs two cans and eats them on the camera. It made me cry when I was a child. <br /> <br /> It made me cry as an adult, because here I waste my time trying to be a critic, writer or writer / critic and these men get all the fun by making a real long sci-fi epic where there are many cool colored luminaires, hot chick and talking slide projector KAL. One flight crew will even wear their black space baseball cap upside down and glowing, as does Metallica's clown. Should this be a joke? No. It is an epic statement of mankind, of mankind and of humanity that deserves to be seen by anyone who has the ability not to take it too seriously. Check out this 2-disc box called GALAXY OF TERROR at your favorite retail store cutout DVD holder, which is probably where it belongs, but how many of us can say "Yes, they have a couple of boxes to sell our movies on the best buy." < br /> <br /> 4/10: Anyone with no sense of humor can try SILENT RUNNING or TRON. But one day, the stranger civilization on the other side of the galaxy will stop broadcasting this movie and decide that we won't really interfere. Good work, guys!
