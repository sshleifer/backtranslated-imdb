I really enjoyed Tycus, if not much more than mocking production prices. Dennis Hopper was just fine, though I don't know if he would have signed up for the project if he had seen the special effects they used. And what else was with the ninja with the scene? It was just at full speed. Maybe someone came in the middle of the fire. Oh, this movie is great when you're drunk and you need a good laugh. Greeting.
