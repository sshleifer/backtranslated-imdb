Flesh Feast starts at Miami Airport, ace reporter Dan Carter (Harry Kerwin, he is also a manufacturing designer) calls his companion Ed Casey (Phil Philbin) to know he has just returned from South America where he has studied Carl Schuman (Doug Foster) and he was a great story, but while still talking on the phone, he's been skinned and killed. Schuman meets Dr. Elaine Frederick (Lake Veronica, he is also a senior executive) who has recently been released from a mental hospital, discussing his harsh plans together. The news of Cateran's death has come to Casey and decides to take the story and do some research. In fact, he gets his secretary, Viginia Day (Marth Mischon), to do most of the investigations and just report to him, lazy bugger. Virginia informs Casey that they have someone in their internal name Kristine (Heather Hughes) because Dr. Frederick rents their vacant spaces to their sisters, Kristine reports to Casey Schuman and Dr. Frederick's Grotesque Rehabilitation Rehabilitation Experiments involving Human Meat and Specially grown Breeds ... <br /> <br /> Collaboration, compilation and staging by Brad F. Grinter's Flesh Feast is a bad film on all accounts. First of all, you can start with the Grinin and Thomas Casey manuscript, who was also responsible for cinematography (you feel most cast and team members had more than one job), basically, it's terrible. The characters are one-dimensional idiots and have no personality, I didn't like the film. Because what is worth, I like some ideas here, meat-eating breeds, basement laboratory, stealing bodies from the hospital and this unforgettable "twist" that is almost worthy to sit through the rest of the movie. Unfortunately, the dialogue is so badly written, rigid and unnatural that it is wrong, I mean, there is one scene where the sister says they "don't let us out of the house", which is good except that she speaks out someone in the garden. There is no point in the story, because it has never been explained why the edible breeds of meat can rebuild young people, in fact, at one point near the end when questioned what Dr. Frederick says there is no time to explain at the moment that sounds like people who do it wrote, had no idea. Even a very short 68-minute-long Flesh Feast is very slow and boring, bad editing doesn't help for long-lasting scenes and shots, for example, there is a scene where the ambulance pulls out of the hospital, drives up to the door, the boy leaves, he drives the back door and opens them etc etc. Did we really need to see all the details? There is also another queue where Dr. Frederick enters the room and puts on some gloves, then he takes them down to the opposite room and puts another pair! Personally, I think Grinter could not guess enough of the material so that it stretches out every scene as much as it can to start the time. I like this strange ending, though really. Technically, the Flesh party is a complete mess, I'm not sure what the budget was, but it must be small, very small. Almost all the film is in one house, Dr. Frederick's laboratory consists of a table, some plastic beakers and a tube, some ancient electronic medical device and a strange screen with funny colors (don't ask). Cinematic art is poor, music sucks and the whole film is dubbed, also poorly dubbed. Usage elements are also disappointing, there are few pictures, but they do nothing but a bit of beating, there is a short scene where the dead body is sawed and OK looking for the broken body and the limbs hanging on the hooks. Action is terrible for all involved, and I really mean bad things that make the robbery dialogue even worse. Do it yourself and avoid Flesh Feast, yes one or two inadvertently funny moments and this ending is unique, at least say, but mostly it is a real amateur film that quickly becomes painful. I doubt most people do it in one session, I can tolerate almost everything, but even I had to turn it off. Certainly one that needs to be avoided is glad you did and if you really don't see that you didn't warn!
