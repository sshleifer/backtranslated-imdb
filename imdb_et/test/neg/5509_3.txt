OK, nobody shuffles it with Citizen Kane, but you have to love a movie where women are always topless. There are also a couple of roofing and some kinky sex. On the other hand, I hope they did not pay for the man who wrote the dialogue. Here is an excellent example. If one of the girls in captivity dies: <br /> <br /> "It's awful. It reminds me of the day when Zenobia died" a relative? " "No, my favorite cow." I think they saved the script money and blew it into big special effects like a plastic crocodile. I say that for this fine work of art I had three sessions, never a good sign. I think it will happen after a while if everything seems the same. I hope that people who are waiting to rent it will not be too impatient. Don't worry about people, it's there.
