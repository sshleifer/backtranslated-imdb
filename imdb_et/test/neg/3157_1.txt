I can't get it. I just can't get it. "Barney and Friends" Over the years, millions of lambs and I testify that I was one of those lambasters. Any child watching this exhibition does not realize that what they are looking at is just one trash. Barney is very annoying and very selfish. Add a Baby Bop and it gets even worse. Add B.J., you have a very horrible television nightmare. Then you get the kids. They're old enough to find out what Barney is teaching them! What are they doing first? It would be funny if Barney and his friends appeared on the Jerry Springer show. This would certainly be one of the most wild moments in television history! More importantly, this exhibition marked the end of public television when we knew it, because we have seen less informative and interesting public television programs that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. What a big difference is the selfish son of weapons. When this exhibition leaves the PBS, it seems that there is a great deal of relief among millions of people, but there is a huge dent in the history of television. The message to Barney himself: You may not understand it, but your days are NUMBERED. <br /> <br /> In short, there are other options. Better choices.
