It's really terrible, the weakest attempt to make a comic book ever dedicated to the movie. Any possible thing about this movie that may be bad is. Music, acting, lighting, kits, "special" effects ... the only positive results I find is that Sue looks cute in her blue tights and that Thing make-up is almost satisfactory (only face). That's it. Zip. Don't bother to keep this copy; it is not really worth your time. Even the abandoned Captain America film, dating back to the early 90s, is much less embarrassing than your seat when you try to endure this confusion.
