You would probably be something like that. I translated movies to live and this is the first film in my five-year work experience that found me insulting to my intelligence. Of course, stupid Hollywood movies about drunk teenagers are pausing in the spring, but these films don't even claim serious artwork. But when somebody strives for size and poetry, but offers a confusing (and often ridiculous) story, a variety of scenes, a pretentious dialogue ... Then you get the worst movie that another reviewer defines very precisely as "pretentious mess". For those who find this movie wisely or even crafted, I can only say - this is your intelligence and your imagination that you probably used to try this merciful event (it is to try and understand things in our human nature). One more thing: I can withstand political injustice very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of beliefs, but the Slavic female character was just too much. I wish someone told the director that it was kind of ridiculous (even in an unrealistic film) to portray a Slavic woman as a semi-literally confused creature associated with natural forces, probably because she had spent all her childhood watching stars and dairy cows in a three-legged stool.
