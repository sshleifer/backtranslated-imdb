"Atoll K" or "Utopia" is one of Hollywood's most sad swan songs. Filmed in France, "Lewis Loving Land" (Jerry) in 1950 and released next year after five years of dismissal, boys are physically very terrible. However, they are almost as bad as the script. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the fun "comedies" ever filmed. <br /> <br /> It's a painful look at this legendary team, the funniest duels in the history of movies, the two that made "Devil's Brother" (1933), "The Music Box" (1932), "Pack Up Your Troubles" (also 1932) "Babes In Toyland" (1934), "Bonnie Scotland" (1935), "Flying Deuces" (1939), and so many more intestinal, ridiculous-class comedies in such a movie. <Br Aga> winners and ball players do it all the time. They're too much for one season or one for the game. In this case, Laurel & Hardy has seen some interesting examples of patients at this late stage of his legendary career.
