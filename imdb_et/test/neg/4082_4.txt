The creative team behind Evan Almighty should have been able to shoot better. Tom Shadyac, one of America's favorite players, and Tom Shadyac, a pet detective director at Ace Ventura, is expecting a bigger number of laughs than a picture. Hell, even Steve Oedekerk, who wrote and directed the Barnyard brutally for the last few years, and has a loan here, has done a better job. The thing is that Evan Almighty is not the worst picture of the summer season, but it can be the most disappointing. The title of the picture and the creative team show that these are the events of 2003: Bruce Almighty. In this picture, Jim Carrey was in the lead, and although both Steve Carell and Carrey are both funny boys, this is the last one to fit into such material. I've heard that Carrey was offered this sequel by someone else, but the actor couldn't see that he saw no other place where his character would be. So Shadyac moved to Carellis, who has been a starter since the fun part of the 2003 original. After going to sleep, 40-year-old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine have become a big business, and so he is more like Jim than a rubber who takes it to production theaters. Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who has been elected as a member of Congress, and therefore his and his troops' movement and state, is Evan Baxter for Evan to succeed in his work. His wife (Lauren Graham) and three children have doubts, but in general they show a supportive side to Evan, who looks to the future with optimistic eyes. But things are going to get quite fast, God (Morgan Freeman) seems to Evan that the flood is coming and that the politician must build Arki. Originally ignored, Evan is quickly given some clothes to the beard who refuses to shave and the animals will appear twice. Then Evan starts to build a boat, but the neighborhood is not happy and neither is a politician (John Goodman). Anyone waiting for the nervous laugh of some of Tom Shadyac's other films is likely to be completely cold for this movie. Ace Ventura, Liar Liar and hell even Bruce Almighty, where much of the very funny pictures, but all of these projects are interrelated and this is Jim Carrey's presence. Shadyac hasn't made a strong movie without the River Carrey, he has worked with Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy, and now with Steve Carell, but it still seems that only Carrey has been successful with Shadyac. Carell can not desperately work again after a disappointing Box-Office and a critical gullet, and Carrey is now making serious projects for Shadyac to find a new comic museum. Carell himself is quite bored here, who felt that his first part of the first film (despite being quite amusing) deserves a full-length feature to be taken back and taken off. I hope that after drawing the Bruce Almighty Box-Office, they were themselves Universal Studios, but you know if a high-quality comedian can't do anything of a character, it's a scenes personality and that's exactly Evan's Almighty. Lauren Graham has no great trembling, like Evan's wife, nor does any child make the right mark. Freeman lets everyone hang up like God with another fun and chilled performance, but he seems to have accidentally carried the piece. Indeed, Evan's secretary (Wanda Sykes) and sliding co-worker (Jonah Hill) are the most consistent smile, both of which made me laugh twice more than any other project. Oedekkki's writing has been worse (Barnyard), but also better (Ace Ventura than natural calls) than her work on this production. His script has really funny moments, but it's full of family moments and humor is never strange or really offensive. The film takes the religions easily and easily, if it should cut down on the concept of cutting up, indeed the church symbol in The Simpsons Movie makes religion more difficult than Evan Almighty's entire 95-minute ride. With a little boldness and a heart, it could have been a much better picture. I have no doubt that the main family audience of this movie is a little entertaining, but if they are happy, this is a completely different question. Evan Almighty is always on the wrong side to be traceable and useful. Maybe if you feel boredom and cables that can be wired, but I can think of much better ways to spend my time and, more importantly, my money than setting up this mediocre comedy.
