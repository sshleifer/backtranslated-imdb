In general, political messages are made on television, so if you are a big fan of the environment, watch your heart's content. Most people go to entertainment movies, not to sell some of the popcorn's political mess. Hook here is a big name cast. Unfortunately, the amount of performances is equal to the total movie that went absolutely anywhere. The two best performances, Chris Cooper and Richard Dreyfus, have a minimum screen time. In short, "Silver City" must be avoided as entertainment. It is nothing more than a documentary, robbing political revelation of illegal immigration, pollution and any other causes that are not part of a small screen anywhere else. - MERK
