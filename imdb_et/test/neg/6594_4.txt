When the devil VH1 found the screenwriter for this movie? Out of high school? This film is trying to be sympathetic to Michael Jackson, but makes it a terrible, sticky caricature. All the lines are full of clich√©s, but surprisingly, the operation was not bad. As usual, this is a bad film with pretty good actors. Actor who plays Michael Jackson, jeez, I know him! I think he did the best with the weak script he could. I don't mind Flex not looking like Michael Jackson, I thought he did the best, but later, if he had all this white makeup, oh man, did he look happy! Other players who played Debbie Row, Priscilla Presley and Elizabeth Taylor were pretty good. Except that Liz Taylor's acting actor seemed too young and healthy to play Liz. An actor who plays Diana Ross didn't see her at all and I couldn't figure out who this woman was in the movie much later. <br /> <br /> This movie is for everyone who is on Michael Jackson's or Michael Jackson's side. It does nothing to change someone's opinion. In fact, the only opinion that anyone after this movie is watching is, God, this movie really sucks! And where the hell is Michael Jackson's wonderful music and songs? There are no pages in this movie. I love the soundtrack of this movie anyway and I probably buy it when I get it. <br /> <br /> However, it's a lighter side, it's very funny, campy movie! This is a great time if you want to look at something that does not brain too much of your brain. I look at it again because it's just so badly bad!
