Time Machine starts in New York in 1899, when Professor Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) makes his beloved girlfriend Emma (Sienna Guillory) who accepts, unfortunately, just after they attacked the attacker and Emma died and died in Alexander. Jump on "Four Years Later" and Alexander has built a time machine that he uses to travel back to the night when Emma was killed to save him, but he's still killed, but otherwise. Alexander understands what he is doing, but several times before, Emma is always or otherwise dead and she wants to know why she is traveling so far into the future to discover the truth. But after the destruction of the month, two new races have evolved on Earth, such as the Eloi and Eloit-eating monsters Morlock. Alexander decides to stay and save Eloi. <br /> <br /> Director Simon Wells, who is actually the great grandson of HG Wells, who wrote the original The Time Machine book, which was based on the original The Time Machine (1960) film and is actually a 1960 film produced by John The Logan manuscript is based here, not in Wells' original form. Though all three have the same basic story and idea, this remake adds a sub-plate about the killing of Emma's fiancée Emma, ​​and that's why she reveals a time machine, not just because she's smart and she gets. Script is a mixture of sci-fi, action adventure and drama, none of which really captured me or involved me so much, sure there are some pretty special effects, some nice action scenes and the moment when the Alexander question is answered, why can't he save Emma is actually quite intelligent and sensible that she never hit her imagination and never wanted it. Time Machine Time Trips are very similar to Terminator 2: Court Day (1992) in the sense that you cannot change the past, but at the same time the future is not set. a good movie like Terminator 2: Court Day. The characters are fine, though I thought Guy Pearce just seemed too young to be a diligent scientist capable of inventing the time machine, and there is never any real explanation behind this mechanics, as it is just like the next machine is not next . one and it works great. I think trilogy back to the future offers much more excitement, laughs, excitement and overall entertaining value than Time Machine ever does and when I stop calling this bad movie, because it moves at a decent pace, says a reasonable story and it has moments that I have wouldn't call it bright or even very good. There's also a little bit of reference to the book and the original film that has been checked here by both names. <br /> <br /> The advantage of this modern version is the development of special effects, and especially the CGI, which leads to the time that Alexander is rapidly building his time machine with large buildings, new brushes, canyons and mountains, and a complex pan back comes into space when we see the missiles around the passengers. The effects of the work are good, there are one or two moments that look a little better, but overall the effects are good. I saw Time Machine on the TV and the station that played it badly and scanned it so that the left and right edges of the frame were cut out of the screen, cutting off part of the year to choose Alexander's time machine so I didn't really know in what year he went. Apparently, director Gore Verbinski took over the last eighteen days of filming, because Wells suffers from extreme exhaustion, while IMDb says the time machine was the largest and most expensive proportion ever built at the time for the film, which I find hard to believe that & Guy Pearce broke the rib during the race, but he was like a soldier. <br /> <br /> The estimated budget is about $ 80,000,000. Amazingly Time Machine was named the best make-up for the Oscar, but was lost to Fridale (2002). Jermey Irons puts good results in a terrible makeup, where he looks like a ring of Lord Lord's films, while the singer Samantha Mumba debuts here on the big screen and is just terrible, though Guy Pearce is pretty good and quite pleasant. Time Machine is not a particularly bad film or a particularly good one, but somewhat noticeable, which is observable and passes through one and a half hours, but not much more. Instead, follow the future (1985).
