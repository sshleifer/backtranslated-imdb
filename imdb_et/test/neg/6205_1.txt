Soon after the release of this film, Salman Khan was sentenced to 6 years of imprisonment. (Read on to find out why I mention it.) <br /> <br /> And I pulled out the relief. that he was imprisoned for something he was because he was celeb, but I was happy that it meant that there were no longer Salman Khan's films anymore, his histrionics and no more mortgaged (read Overacting). <br /> <br /> This movie makes no sense. <br /> <br /> A scene where one child belongs to a child makes a rocket that was activated by voice. According to the script, he traces someone. But he finds only Salman Khan Bare Chested. Well, it happened. <br /> <br /> Rocked gets activated in another stupid way and you have to believe it .001. Then it is Salman Khan, who was on his water trawler, and the pursuit will continue if he does not do all the tricks he can show to the stupid audience. (In my opinion, all those people who have given this movie 5 and above, unless they are paid for it.) <br /> <br /> Another breath, incredible scene was at the end when all the agreements on marriage were made and Salman Khan hides Govinda and hides the marriage with another very unwanted song. Later, though, everything has been done and ready for govinda and Katrina Kaifi's confession to Katrina's father and Bingo. Everything is fine and Govinda is getting married to Kartin .... <br /> <br /> It made me wonder if it was so easy why they didn't do it and tortured us for so many hours and wasted my money. <br /> <br /> This movie must avoid and even think it would be worth watching a scene. The plot is too loose with an alphabet that won't go out, and finally disappear .. ex Choota don ... What a waste of characters. <br /> <br /> After this movie, I made a promise that I wouldn't look at Salman khan Movies for the rest of my life if it didn't win the Oscars ...
