Ed Ge's story is interesting, very interesting. However, this film only interests that it is actually done. Kane Hodder's imagination of Ed Gein is so far away, not even the least funny. Ed Gein did not behave psychically publicly, he was very calm and collected, and always extremely polite to everyone and told someone who listened, this is one of the main things that this film did not show to the audience. But the biggest mistake of this movie, even with one shot, was that Ed did not kill anyone without being told by a dead mother whom he thought he was talking to him beyond the grave. He only killed the people who told his dead mother that he had to, because it was God's will, and he was very unfortunate about it, although it did not prevent him from experimenting with cannibalism and carrying human flesh. I officially gave this movie a rating of "1" just because "0" wasn't given to me as a choice. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to be free of this movie. If you want to see a movie that accurately depicts Ed Gein and does not try to put the story of a sub-plot of love between a police and a fictional woman who never existed, I highly recommend seeing the original movie, which unfortunately doesn't seem to be on IMDb.com, although I might be wrong, but I don't have to find it yet. The original does not disappear from the actual events and does not try to twist the story. I understand that the story is being spoken from another perspective, but this film was just trying to make a real story itself, which I find terrible when someone made a movie on 9/11, but gave it a twist that Canada was behind it. Or World War II film that says Hitler was a good man and helped fight the Nazis.
