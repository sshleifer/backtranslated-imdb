The first time I heard of Guest House Paridiso was after he had just seen Fight Club. A small round black ring was placed on each urinal. When you get in contact with moisture (to put it delicately), it created a colored image with two star photographs and a label line "You P *** yourself laugh". When you started washing your hands, it had dried up and faded, waiting for spring to be a surprise to the next "victim." <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe the punchline wasn't terribly complicated, but you have to admit that it was innovative. In fact, I think I can honestly say that I've never seen anything like that before in my life and in more than a century of cinema and marketing, it's a real game. It is a pity that the film that accompanied it did not meet the promise. <br /> <br /> I hate to bet Guest House Paridis and I owe Rik Mayall (Richard Twat) and Adrian Edmondson (Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba) for many years, laughing through their tempting TV series, be it the Young (1982-1984) invention , Bottom's living room plays (1991-1995) or even solo, such as Rik New Stateman (1988-1993). In fact, it would have been a special 45-minute TV. Unfortunately, it's a 89-minute movie. <br /> <br /> You definitely need to earn, and I laughed all the way through the long-running finals that violated the exorcist and the lost ship's raiders and ... well, you have to see it a bit. At the same time, the pace is often the leading and sterile atmosphere at all times. Two stars (Edmondson, who takes his usual backrest, this time thanks to the fact that he controls it properly) never reaches the first move, Mayall shows only a random mania that makes us love him with a small screen. Indeed, the authors' assumption that we are familiar with the traits leads them to underestimate the audience. There are small depths in the series (such as Richie's feminine, unsuccessful social climbing) and here we leave parody parodies instead. <br /> <br /> Fawlty Towers' accusation goes into the water with the drunken chef and invisible, called the Pasquele waiter, which highlights Manuel. Some ideas, such as a hotel next to a nuclear reactor, with a child's swing that is over a rock face, are very, very funny, but ultimately the spiritual tempo is stolen, two are constantly looking for a studio audience who is not there, and all the "dead laughs" areas were placed with casual "comedy" music that would have been recorded two years ago on Carry On. <br /> <br /> The paridiso puer, sadistic, perverted humorous brand IS funny and I feel it makes you laugh ... just not as often as it should.
