I watched it on television today. That was ABC's Sunday afternoon movie. <br /> <br /> It was not a very good movie, but it was fine for a low-budget independent movie. There are some tensions in it, but there are so many bad features that really bring the movie along. The script is pretty flat, and the plot elements are not very realistic, such as how the 911 operator laughs and hangs when someone has reported the murder. I don't know what the writer thought when they came up with this idea, but it's not very realistic. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was a good temporary thriller because there were some scenes that seemed like they would do something good, but unfortunately they never did. In some other similar films, some elements of the plot were used, and ultimately it was not very creative. <br /> <br /> If there's something good about this movie, it's cast. Every actor of this movie did a good job of what they had to do. The terribly undervalued actor Elizabeth Pena was great in this film. She is very sexy and has an incredibly sexy voice. However, if you want to see a movie that is really good, check out the great animated movies The Incredibles. In this film he made good use of his sexy voice. <br /> <br /> What can I say, this movie is not really worth your while, but the actors were good. Unfortunately, they all wasted a movie that is a real shame. This movie tried to be a good temporary thriller, but eventually it fell off. If you want to see a good movie like that, but much better, see The Hitcher. If you want to see something with the majority of this movie, check out another movie. You can really pass on this movie if you have the opportunity to see it.
