This fake documentary is wrong on many points, it is badly done, has interesting signs, but the biggest problem with which I am involved is the prerequisite. <br /> <br /> This movie uses H.P. Lovecraft has traveled to Italy and some of her work is based on the real supernatural events she showed. I am ready to go with the idea that he traveled to Italy (only to stop religion), but that some of his work is based on reality and that Insmouth exists, there is no sense at all. <br /> <br /> First of all, Lovecraft did not believe in the supernatural, he writes clearly in his letters that he considered himself a mechanical materialist, his monsters, where they show that people are not so special. Another myth used in the film is that Lovecraft was a hidden expert, he was not, all his knowledge of the subject came from the most basic sources. <br /> <br /> So we end up with people with a movie who dare to one another and when we finally see a monster, it's so bad that you can't even laugh, just feel the pain in your love of fear. <br /> <br /> The film Frankenstein Lovecraft said he was sorry for Mary Shelley because she felt her work was polished. I'm sorry for Lovecraft.
