I tried to love this movie. I really did. Kevin Bacon plays a victim of brain damage who is friendly with a ten-year-old girl, whose fantasies dig into China, fly a balloon, and so on, is her way to cope. I admit that I made one scene where two of them share friendship and simple enjoyment, while in the background there is spiritual piano music. Okay, three or four such scenes. Maybe nine or ten. Okay, okay, it was fourteen. But I sat and watched most of them.
