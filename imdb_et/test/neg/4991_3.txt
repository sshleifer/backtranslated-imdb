When I first became a father about 5.5 years ago, I was ready for the many victims I have to do. I knew I had to change diapers and take them to swimming lessons and participate in many freezing Santa Claus parades, but I wasn't ready for the sacrifice I made last night. This is my humble opinion of cruel and unusual punishment. <br /> <br /> Underdog is bad. It's not a pretty karate dog bad, but it does Shaggy Dog like Pulp Fiction. If Underdog was a TV show, I would recommend doing it. Even Puddy's presence and the voice of Banky Edwards can't save it. Vibu. Wow. <br /> <br /> It was almost the best 80 minutes I ever enjoyed. James sat on my left and Michelle on the right side, and I spent more time looking at their reaction to talking when I was looking at the screen. They were 5 and 3 years old as the target group, and this film created a target. There's a scene where Underdog sounds like a second dog, and Michelle thought it was a movie that had ever been on the film. When Underdog flew into space, James was literally at his place. The kids loved Underdog, and that is why I was there. That's what it was last night. <br /> <br /> If you are under 10 years old, you will not waste any business for another life by watching this brutal movie. But if you want to kill 80 minutes with your four-year-old child, I don't understand. I had a blast.
