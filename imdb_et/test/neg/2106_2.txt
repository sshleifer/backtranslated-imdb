Really, really terrible. I don't even know where to start. This is a great example of a movie that doesn't know what to do. I'm not sure I'd be able to set myself a category except that I'm pretty sure it's a hit everywhere, wherever. Even unborn. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought I was looking at a parody or a farce. Sometimes it's just a bad B movie. But I was holding porn that I fear is almost (but not completely) non-existent. <br /> <br /> Some suggested skipping. I would definitely like to bring this emotion. The last five minutes are intense and will definitely contain some of the best film making you can ever see. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood would be proud.
