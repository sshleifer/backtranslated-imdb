With the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film, I don't think Shakespeare is in some great danger. This is the story of an ancient Aztec mummy who has been left out. His stuff has been taken and it really pulls him away. He seems to know who does it, though he is a gyrating, raving unit. I loved two numb men talking about how the mummy was found and the doctor who had decided to destroy the creature. In this ridiculous cemetery there are all those scenes that are full of cheap crosses and other spam. There's a mausoleum where the mummy is kept. I cannot begin to reproduce this idiot, including the snake's well, where a good doctor has been thrown (beside it there is a door to crawl), the metal cans of the mass inside the man. The dialogue is terrible. There are long pauses between calls, as if someone attacking them on their line. I love a scene where two little children blame their mother for a night out (she goes to that zombie country or something). However, if you are looking for a movie that you can laugh at and never take it seriously, look at it. First a couple of beers. As a direct line from the mummy's grave, "Look at this and your eyes bleed and your soul smells." What else to say?
