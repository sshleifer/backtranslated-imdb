I liked some things in this game. I loved the first person and would like us to have this choice in the first three games. Nothing sees monsters near their face. The graphics were not really bad, but I would have liked to do more things, even though it was just a shooter. The music was good. The things I hated were: the motion is sucked and the target was complete pain. The story was about words and too old for the same thing that had no originality. Failure to save was terrible !!! Some people have a life and I would like to finish the game later. I thought the weapons were sucked. This game is fun for a while, but it is not the first three and only good if you just want to take pictures. I recommend this to a new game for the first person, but that's it. Play it at your own risk.
