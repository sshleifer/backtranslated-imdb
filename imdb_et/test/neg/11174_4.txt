Well, I hoped I heard this movie wrong because I'm a big fan of Ruggero Deodato and didn't really want to see him; but unfortunately, this Giallo-style supernatural nonsense load is just as bad as I would have thought it was - and it's pretty terrible! The plot does not work at all, because the film tries to mix the murders and the supernatural theme through the phone and it all seems very forced and silly. In addition, there is no point in the plot and you have to ask yourself what the idea is in the film many times. At the center of the plot is a young woman living in an apartment building who is being terrorized by telephone. The best thing about the film is undoubtedly the existence of a beautiful English actor Charlotte Lewis, and unfortunately there are many good points there. There are a handful of deaths, some of which are tough; but all of these are incredibly stupid, the one who sees the coins being killed by coins is put up especially in this regard. In general, I cannot recommend it to anyone; non-Deodato fans are likely to be impressed and Deodato fans will probably find the film frustrating. Avoid!
