This is a worrying film that enhances, as it does, an intense close-knit naked man and his young son, but in his confused structure, it contains a poetic imaginative visual ideized socialized amnesia innocence. <br /> The plot has two yarns, the weaker of which is the gradual revelation of Graham / Pablo. Through this, the beautiful description of his condition and his curving path towards the partial awakening, which his attitude to Irene was, is also wounded. <br /> <br /> The thing is a strong thread, while its peculiarity is the plot bears a collection of seemingly intact characters: Graham's best friend who can reveal the cause of his condition in a mess, his manipulative boss and his comic book scholar psychologist: everyone is interested in him losing and dependent. <br /> <br /> The film's failure lies in the conflict between the two threads. One of them is visual, curvy and sublime, while the other is structured like an uneven thriller, all exposition dialogue, and symbolic unresolved patterns. <br /> <br /> However, I enjoyed Novo. It keeps taboo deep flirting and slips into something beautiful, like a quarry, double bassist and two women, when the cheap porn scene setting turns into a segment of peace and rejuvenation. I still can't get a tooth. <br /> <br /> A strange, silly and narrative failure, but with almost redeeming beauty.
