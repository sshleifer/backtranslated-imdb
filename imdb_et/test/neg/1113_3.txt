If you described a scene; Nightmare of the children who are murdering you in your dream, your infant's daughter speaks to ghosts, looking for her missing child in an abandoned mine at night, so it's frightened that you can't move even if the murder victim's blood drips over you from the floor? then I'd say you had a horror movie. But some of the "Wicked Little Things" just weren't scary. I am a horrorist and I loved the location, the main plot, and I liked the three leading ladies. I didn't want to harm them, I wanted a "bad boy" to get his desserts just, the rest of the molds are just the cannon's bait, so I was so indifferent with them and I played every book of the clich√© - even under a flashlight in the dark dark dark here you start whispering the voices that will be closed to you. <br /> <br /> However, I would recommend looking at it, but if you are not new to horror or have seen it before you can see movies under 12 years old.
