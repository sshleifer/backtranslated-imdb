<br /> <br /> I tune in this movie not because I am a US high school basketball fan (I only rarely look at NBA games), but because I'm a fan of Gene Hackman who can usually bring impressive depth to his performances. In that case, I was very disappointed. It was not one of the bright shining stars of Hackman's career. <br /> <br /> He did not have much work for him fairly. Norman Dale, the new coach of the Indiana Small Town High School Basketball Team, was not invited to do much. In principle, his performance consisted of pulling out basketball at the judges. I didn't find him particularly credible to be honest. I also had an impressive romance between Dale and Myra Fleener (Barbara Hershey). Frankly, there was no chemistry between Hackman and Hershey. Romance didn't pay attention to me, nor did it take a basketball action that was far too predictable. <br /> <br /> There were too many problems with this movie to value it. I never realized how many people in the city were angry with Dale, just before he arrived. The evolution of character was bad and the story itself was badly developed. In my opinion, too much basketball and communication is not enough. How much do children need to take their baskets to get the point that it's a basketball movie? There is no relationship: is it even possible to doubt that Hickory will win a lot? I understand that it is based on a real story, but I think it proves that not every true story should be a film. Frankly, it was not just a very interesting movie. Surely Gene Hackman would like to forget about it. <br /> <br /> Better than 2/10 in my opinion.
