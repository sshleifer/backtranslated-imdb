If directors / producers / publishers want to promote a movie based on "real events" and make a movie that is meant to inspire and have meaning, then first of all maintain the integrity and integrity that you want to keep your movie as honestly as possible. <br /> <br /> A team of "all black" jumpers and a haka in America is just stupid. All sides of intelligent people would know that "all black" is the New Zealand National Rugby Union team and their jumpers are all black and Haka will present them as part of a traditional Maori dance. <br /> <br /> Having such a stupidity in a movie without explanation reduces the film's credibility to zero and denies the message and inspiration the film tries to achieve. <br /> <br /> The question is "Why"? Why would you do such a stupid thing and potential benefit? <br /> <br /> I can only conclude that writers or directors or producers have seen it on television before the international Rugby Union game and think that it would be good in our movie, nobody knows it has never happened, they are too stupid to find out about NZ and all the black ones, it's great. "<br /> <br /> How would an American audience respond to a movie about NZ's Americain grid, with a crew wearing American Indian costumes and wars, making it a native American Indian war, running around, shouting" oh woo woo, oh woo woo woo? They laugh their heads! <br /> <br /> The people who made this movie and the industry that created it should read their head. For some reason, the industry thinks they can "get people all the time to fool". <br /> <br /> It's just stupid!
