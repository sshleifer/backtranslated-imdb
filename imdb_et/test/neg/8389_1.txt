This movie was so bad that it seemed like a home video. In one scene, the camera is slowly and gradually lowered, then moves again. The sound is cracked and disappears from time to time. In the second scene, the camera man is simply visible in the mirror. <br /> <br /> Then the scene came with instructions on how to put down the tent ... which, believe me, ran out of age and was completely irrelevant to the plot. Most scenes were dragged into conversations that were not entirely relevant. In my opinion, they were just for making and making longer films. Even with the addition of these scenes, it was very short. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this was the interrupted head, which seemed quite realistic.
