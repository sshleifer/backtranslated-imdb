This movie was strongly suggested by a friend and Brando was a big fan of the film I ordered from Harrods and was looking forward to its arrival. I'm rarely so disappointed with the film. Brando was good as a German officer, but the rest of the film was simply unbearable. You will never remember or take care of any sign (except perhaps Brando). Operation was OK. Story, what story? Maybe this is the thing. After all, it is war, but I've seen much better war movies. (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, Even Star Wars) It was so boring that I watched my watch ... <br /> <br /> In general, this is one of the worst films I've seen. Please don't waste your time and money. Can I add that this is the first user comment I have written, I just had to give my feelings about this movie. By the way, my all-time favorites are: Casablanca, godfather 1 & 2, one flew over the cuckoo nest, pulpfiction and Amadeus. If you haven't seen them yet, please do so. And Amadeus must have a wide screen of 2.35: 1
