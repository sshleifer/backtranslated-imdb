I am usually a generous voter at IMDb and don't bother commenting on movies I didn't like, but it was just flat. In fact, I turned it on for 15 minutes before finishing it to see "It's this" (because my gf wanted ... I just picked two smaller ones). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie: Imagine this movie as a worse-than-average "horror", such as "scary short-sighted", found in your dentist's lounge "Reader digest". <br /> <br /> I didn't expect anything terrible or funny, I'm not "I want to see blood!" - The type of person, but this "film" is neither "horror" nor "comedy" nor amusing in any other way. <br /> <br /> Probably more horrible / funny and entertaining to watch the "You've Got An Email" movie poster in 90 minutes when you make a chamomile tea. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: "horror comedy" for people between 4 and 7 years.
