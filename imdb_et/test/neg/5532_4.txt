This is a very interesting acquaintance! The "double stories" contains three foolish and childish episodes - the genre is not really a horror, nor is it more than anything. Where's the suspension? Where's the fun? Where's common sense? Certainly not here, but if you don't expect it, it may not stay. <br /> <br /> The first segment is called "Showdown". It's a violent, absurd west. I couldn't figure it out. "King of Roads" is a stupid story with Brad Pitt. During the "double talk" she was just a pretty face who really couldn't work. Fortunately, he learned this skill later, and now he is a fantastic, talented actor - one of the younger generation's biggest ones. The story is almost all that stupidity. The final episode "Yellow" is the only segment that is almost entirely successful. It's silly, but funny. We have to thank Kirk Douglas for that. <br /> <br /> This movie is something to watch when you sit in a chair and eat a popcorn. (I should know that what I did) If you loved "Talte Crypt", you also love "Dual Stories" because basically it's all the same. I understand that these three episodes are actually very rare "works of art" and are very difficult to find. I have the whole VHS package, but I don't think it's a big privilege. You have to be a fan of Brad Pitt to look for it. Otherwise, don't worry, it's not worth it. Stupid shit.
