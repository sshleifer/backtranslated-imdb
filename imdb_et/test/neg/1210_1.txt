when retired USAF MSG (Aircraft Technical Specification), it must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. The fact that a teenager could ever get on a route is much less involved in f-16, is ridiculous. The military spends millions on pilots to make them the best in the world, and this film makes it into the Air Force and all its members seem to be the fools. Yes, I know it's just a movie, but it gives the younger people a message that we are all idiots and we believe we are not. any mission-related logistics is very involved, even in the eighties, military computers were too secure for these teenagers to hack, and other shortcomings in this movie make Peter Pan more credible. Sorry, I have no entertaining value on this film.
