Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance are legendary actors and director Kostas Karagiannis was a successful Greek Giallo-esquire thriller Death Kiss in 1974. And yet, when you connect three talents, all this is the full load! God knows only what drove the letters like Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance in this cheap worship, but I really hope they were well paid because neither deserves anything like it is in their revival. The story focuses on a group of devil's prayers who kidnap some children, directing another group after them. The pace of the plot is very slow and it ensures that the film is very boring. The plot is also far from the original, and anyone who has even a thoughtful interest in the Horror genre has seen something like this and no doubt much better. The obvious lack of budget is to feel the whole movie and the film can't overcome it at some point. This is indeed a frustrating and unhappy view, and even a slightly decent ending cannot lift this ante enough to pull this film out. Extremely bad things and definitely not recommended!
