This train wreck begins with Brujo and Alma crossing the Mexican border. Alma suffers from some terrible curses that cause her vomiting in the garden of snakes and Nickelodeon Gac every few minutes, and her teeth and moles grab meaningless. So, apparently, Alma in Los Angeles is the uncle who knows her. They jump on the train to get there and luckily their friend pays their way. Alma and Brujo remain in the trolley of the film as they cannot afford top-class seats. At the same time, in the higher class, we see any reason in LA for some reason. A witty guy on a business trip, two girls, one wearing 5 dollars and cocaine, three stoners and some Mexicans. The Mexicans are screaming with Brujo and trying to take their "weeds", which are probably soothing Alma snakes inside him. They realize that the snakes are not attacked, they enter your body through your veins! Very twisted and B-film. Brujo rescues the guy with his heart (Temple Of Doom) and snake. For some reason, he can't get the snakes damaged or hurt by Alma. While it goes to a drug expert, trying to bust one of the girls and getting a little action (topless) in return doesn't talk about sending your drugs. A mystical man appears and has the armed forces. Alma becomes a vampire as a finish, bites her and then becomes a huge excuse for train size CG snake, eats the train and breaks the nuclear bomb hurricane mill and disappears. Everyone then goes to LA on foot. <br /> <br /> Credits actually say at the end "Any resemblance to real people, living or dead or actual events is purely casual and very weird. We recommend moving and / or flying". Oddly enough, the film's bald guy is "Yes, I hate planes!" Credits continue to say: "No snakes could be injured during the production of this scenario. The movie really used a lot of real snake and they were all very cramped. There is really no scene in the CG snakes attacking anyone if you count a big one but then just eats the train and the other fake snake is just a head and it looks like a sneaker. Snakes don't attack anything, they're just ... there. One climbs out of toilet paper actually! <br /> <br /> The movie is not funny, not scary ( because there is no real snake attack) and it's just "fast", which is when a small budget movie company hears a big budget from a Hollywood edition, they rush out to release a similar movie or even a password that appears just before or with a big name. the result is that many people confuse each other and look rather fast than "biggie" or they want to see both, for whatever reason ... like me.
