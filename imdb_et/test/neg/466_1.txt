I had great hopes to see it because I always enjoy Paul Bettany's performances. I thought he was very good for Darwin and did his best with the terrible material he had to work with. <br /> <br /> Darwin's book on the origin of species was one of the most breakthrough, controversial and innovative editions ever, but you don't think it's based on this annoying film. It's like a 2-hour episode of a soap opera in a Victorian environment. In Darwin's five-year trip to Beagle, the Galapagos Islands have almost anything that is definitely of paramount importance to this story because, based on his wildlife research, he began to shape his evolutionary theory. br /> <br /> This is just one long, harsh, homey drama, where Darwin was a somewhat prominent eccentric, seeing his dead daughter's vision everywhere and giving him an emotionally constipated woman's cold shoulder. Jennifer Connelly depicts Emma Darwin, has nothing terrible and has little to do with the historical descriptions of Emma. Here could have been the opportunity to introduce the creative interpretation of the earth by a mother or local priest, such as Jeremy Northam (the blink-and-miss-part that is complete waste). talented actors) to counteract Darwin's views but was not taken. <br /> <br /> The story focused too much on endless mawkish sentiment about Darwin's grief on her daughter Annie, and too much time was wasted on Darwin not knowing whether to write her book. Finally, I was so bored that it was difficult to maintain. All in all, it was a bit like making a Picasso movie and spending two hours focusing on her fellow girlfriend and not bothering to mention she was an artist.
