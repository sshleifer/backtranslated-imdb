Director Brad Sykes, who is also responsible for similar 3-D efforts, such as ZOMBIE CHRONICLES (2001) and BLOODY TEASE (2002), refers to George A. Romero's and Sam Raimi's original works as the main drivers of his career, while those filmmakers disputed Sykes uses video technology only to imitate your cinematic heroes, which results in a home movie with greatness. There is nothing here after the 3-D format to pay attention to someone. CAMP BLOOD 2 (2000) follows.
