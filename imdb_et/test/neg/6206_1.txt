It's not a good movie. This is a remake of the tried-and-tested English movie "The Hitch". But it offends the original. It's hardly a movie you expect from a veteran leader like "David Dhawan" who has been awarded good films like "Raja Babu", "Coolie No.1", "Hero No 1" ... <br /> The main theme of the film is taken from "The Hitch" with some changes to appeal to the Indian audience, but this story and scenario is not convincing enough. In addition, acting as a leader, i.e., Salman Khan and Govinda, is pathetic. They seem to need the slightest provocation to remove their shirts to expose their bare chest. I do not consider this to be an exciting and least comic book. What was the Director? In addition, viewers must bear the case of Govinda's domination. It was just unbearable. RECOMMENDS OBSERVERS TO KNOW YOUR RISK. The rating for my movie 2 can be considered very generous. <br /> <br /> Instead, I would recommend viewers to watch an English movie "Hitch" which is much better.
