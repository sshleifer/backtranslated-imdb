This review includes a spoiler. I already knew that it would be ridiculously ridiculous and probably on Snakes On A Plane, but it sold a brand new 69p, so I thought I didn't really have much to lose. /> <br /> The music played on open credits didn't fit at all, even though I made the song myself, the pop-rock song is not really suitable for appearing on the zombie horror movie soundtrack. It started surprisingly well, opening scenes were not too bad, some actors were small, but not as bad as I thought it would be. <br /> <br /> Everything goes well with Laura Cayouette (Rocket from Kill Bill: Vol. 2). He should play a scientist. If he is, he is not very bright. Fortunately, he is quite polished quickly. There was a nun. Have you ever been in a plane with a nun ?? I was surprised that he was not limited to crucifix. <br /> <br /> Finally, after 35 minutes, we will get some zombie action and use the word action "loosely". Special effects are just below the standard, but this is expected to be a movie with this budget. Using blood-coated and yellow contact lenses does not mean you look like a zombie, but it will make you more beautiful. Using slow motion does not work very well. I think this movie is probably guilty of adding too much story. The problem of trying the "malaria virus" option was not a very good move because malaria is not a virus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is played pretty much like every other zombie movie. Most signs are killed and finally a handful of people are fighting to survive. It is possible that the worst part of a flight of living deaths is a completely unthinkable ending. I know it's a movie about people who live and live, but the end was just ridiculous. Rating: ★★
