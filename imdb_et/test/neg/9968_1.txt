The only thing interested in this movie is his theme. Looking at Manson's "family" from the point of view of family members is a great idea. But catching an incomprehensible understanding is something that can only really be achieved in crafting - and that is not the case. <br /> <br /> Probably because there was so much information to get the scenario, this movie was made in an artificial documentary style, reenactments were thrown in. The problem is that writing and directing do not allow you to create things that make the movie traceable, such as a character, story, subject, and so on. <br /> <Even worse, it has an incredibly weak sub-block that is thrown into what follows a small last-day Mansonite band when they go after a reporter working on the anniversary of the murders. It is stupid and pointless and a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is a great wasted opportunity. One of the sun's rays is Marc Pitman's actor who plays Tex, who in real life made most of the actual killing. When female characters are repelled by airbreaks in the 60s, Pitman is able to convey a true feeling. <br /> <br /> In short, don't worry about this movie.
