Hi everyone, I wanted to give you some crazy facts about this movie. I was actually one of the Make-up FX artists who helped create this "beast" of this movie and I have to tell you that the original creature seemed absolutely amazing. I remember when we got the first photos of the set we all talked about, how much shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty bad. <br /> <br /> What really happened was that Jason Palmer made the original make-up for Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and shoot a lot of creatures. The sad part was that Jason died a few weeks before that, and so that the recycled creature wasn't as fantastic as the original. <br /> <br /> For me, it was very sad because it was the Jasons final movie, and he was deceived by his ultimate fame because of bad replays. Anyway, I thought you might find it interesting, and if you want you to go over mmmyeah.com and watch some "behind the scenes" photos. <br /> <br /> Later, Jeff
