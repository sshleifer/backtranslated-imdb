Jean Claude Van Damme's film career seems to have gone into hell, so it is ironic to see that he plays a character that fits the same fate literally at the beginning of the movie! It is also interesting to note how very, very similar the plot of his films, regardless of who is the producer, director or screenwriter. Typically, Van Damme is a playful character in France, due to the fact that he takes place in another part of the world where he has a brother who dies and is Van Damme to get the revenge he just met. Watch AWOL or LEGOINAIRRE or many other movies with the title "Starring Jean Claude Van Damme" and all of them have almost the same type of story. This does not mean that they are of course identical, but very similar, and if you have seen one of Van Damme's films, you have seen them all. It's the same with MAXIMUM RISK
