Sorry to disagree with you, but I found the DKC series quite interesting. So much I invested in the SNES system and my own copies. That's, remember, almost ten years after the first release of DKC. Graphics was a breakthrough for its era, the first vector graphics for home systems. Music and characters are all memorable and the games brought tens of hours of entertainment for myself and my girlfriend. True, the second game was better than the first, and the third was probably the second part of the "edge". But all three offered different games and I enjoy them to date. By the way, I'm old enough to remember when there were no video games (and TVs were black and white!).
