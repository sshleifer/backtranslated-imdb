Porn Legend Gregory Dark leads this hairy glow with Glen Jacobs (Kane WWF / WWE / whatever he calls) his debut in cinematography. He plays Jacob Goodknight, a blind serum killer who has brought people's eyes. On the plot, no matter how it is, there are a group of worrying young people who clean up a historic hotel where GoodKnight lives and is later attacked. Hemmingway it's not. Starts with the same fun B-movie, but soon it will be too annoying to be enjoyable. Glad to go with rather low expectations, but even those who were not satisfied. How can you guide pornography and suffer nudity? disgrace. <br /> <br /> My Class: D- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Samantha Noble Bares for a short time
