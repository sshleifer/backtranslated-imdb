"The Next Karate Kid" is a thoroughly predictable film, just like its predecessors. The predictability of this often leads to a sense of impatience for the viewer who often wants the story to move a little faster. This fourth entry in the series, despite its zeros and extreme sensitivity, is painless, almost exclusively due to Morita's occurrence. He doesn't seem to be tired of his role, and he puts life and humor into the film, making it the best reason to see it. Not terrible, but nothing much.
