Flipping through the TV and seeing The Secret Life of was; gave George Duran a blow to the host. I know Jim O'Connor was very energetic and no one could be as much as he was, but George was bored. It looks like he doesn't want to be hosting; his voice transmissions were monotonous, not related to guests. He seemed to interview the guests at Unwrapped and he just happened. I do not know if George will receive a "better" accommodation for this exhibition, I doubt he has now organized his exhibition. The exhibition seemed to offer more information, but only because we saw less of a host. The formula for this exhibition was very delicate and I'm afraid it is good now.
