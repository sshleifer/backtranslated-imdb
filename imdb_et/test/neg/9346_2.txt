Oh man, this movie was bad. Bad look, terrible story ... The list of good things is shorter than the list of bad things in this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it should be comedy and everything, but something tells me that this movie was supposed to be the real thing. The film certainly does not start as a comedy, but rather as an adventurous film with fun elements. In particular, the actor, who was serious and non-comic, is serious about it, except for obviously a couple of top-downs. It seemed to me that they first tried to make a real and serious adventure science fiction movie, maybe even a franchise, but soon they began to notice how bad it was and just decided to add some more and more knowingly comical sequences to see the movie as comedy and prevents it from becoming a complete disaster. <br /> <br /> Film is a strange attempt to confuse adventurous pirated pirates with serious scientific literature. The film is obviously inspired by "Star Wars" and its success. The film is not even too embarrassed to copy the entire sequence and even how the story progresses, with sets, characters, and robots showing similarities. They tried to hide it by putting some obvious spam, but I won't let it. Thus, despite the original ideas, the film is not in itself original. You can say that this movie is a poor man's "Spaceballs" without really being totally junk. <br /> <br /> The film is bad, some of the special effects of video games (in some order, even literally), terrible costumes (mail and swords in space?). Sound is sometimes even ridiculous. They seem to have shot some sequences without sound and then forgot to add all the necessary sounds later in production. mixing is also very bad. They tried to hide it by occasionally minimizing sound and tuning Bruce Broughton's musical score. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the film is so busy that watching a movie in a humorous way will forget the story. This makes the film's story extremely dirty and with a poorly written, almost completely undeveloped main matrix. It also does not really help the film to flow. Much cannot be explained and some have even fallen after some time. The film begins as a "pirate" movie that constantly watches and steals water, because it is barely and there is only one planet in the galaxy that remains on that water (yes right!). But this plot line will be left off soon, especially in the middle of the film, where the film seems to be completely different, with different motivations. It's like a weird and bad, silly sequence after another, without actually clicking. It also keeps the characters too small and uninteresting to take care of. <br /> <br /> Sad to see that such a dramatic movie was accompanied by actors such as John Carradine, Anjelica Huston and still young and unknown Ron Perlman. /> <br /> OK I admit that I liked a few moments, especially when the ending was through a time-thread, it was original and fun, but really, not all of that was enough to record the movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't even like the movie in a comb-like way. <br /> <br /> 2/10
