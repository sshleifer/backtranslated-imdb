Another try, second lack. France may be condemned for not being able to produce a good horror film. I mean ... the least they could shoot in the Broc√©liande forest, but even the forest is fake! It was shot near Paris! The subject is useless, the actors are really irrelevant and the text wants you to be deaf. Nothing can save it. <br /> <br /> Bad ... poetry. I was not warned. I want my money back.
