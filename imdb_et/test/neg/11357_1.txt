If you want to waste a small part of your life, sit in front of this predictable zombie film. It fails in the first post because it is not scary or funny. This is a boring gray film that I think went straight to the video. Hammy and tongue cheeks leave a sour taste in the mouth. If you want to see the poor, but still observable, recent zombie films, see Dead of the Dead. Poor special effects, school-level script. Zombie movies work when they have a moral or even political point. There is nothing in this film, it is not worth it that zombie emphasizes. It's as exciting and convincing as the Republican Convention, it's not a pity that the Republican Convention is a better example of a Zombie movie.
