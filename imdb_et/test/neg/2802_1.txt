I was in Blockbuster and saw the movie "Dark Harvest". The cover design seemed good, the plot was not so bad and the tag (you get what you sow) made the film beautiful. But I was stupid that day because I did something I shouldn't have done. Today I rented "Straight to Video Independent Horror Film". As I walked for a much better rental, I went home, in the dark Harvest DVD player and it started. I thought I was watching a movie after making a movie (BAD IDEA), but I went on and looked at it anyway. UPDATE * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * First of all, the "children" and the scene are breastfeeding when 2 (main characters) speak, lighting sucks and the buildings even look fake! Now they go to this house where Sean Connel (I think she's the main character, I don't care) relatives lived there. All of a sudden, they all kill ... (fucking) KILLER SCARECROW !!!! AHHH !!!!! The scarecrow is obviously a low budget concept and scenes where the scarecrow is computer-based looks as fake as fun. It makes dinosaur noise and everything! And then at the end ... they shoot with a scarecrow weapon (it is red for God and looks like it was bought with a local family dollar) and it stops for a while and then ...... LOST !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Save yourself for a while, I'll tell you that this movie sucks. If you need to go for an hour and a half, look at the wall, because looking at the wall is A + fun compared to this disaster. However, it's pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: F If something was lower ** F - ** If I gave it.
