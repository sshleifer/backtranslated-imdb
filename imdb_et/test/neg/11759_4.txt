This movie really begins to be strong. We know that Roberts is an Atlanta hotshot that will be sent to Australia to solve Coke's marketing problems. We also know that he is an eccentric genius. Robert's fine-tuner convinces us quite quickly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the plot is so weak that regardless of the character of the fine, it has been canceled with gaps, inconsistencies and even boring movie sequences. <br /> <br /> Normally, I'm bold and far off the plot. The examples I love are "Dark Star", "O.C. & Stiggs" and "Popeye". Along with the fact that I have to admit that this film worked well, I even surprise that I can't recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The complete failure of this movie is around the middle of the movie. All comedies are instantly lost and the film becomes dark. Later, the film ticks. Trying to get a comedy again is not a success. The viewer is still waiting for more surprises and they are darker. <br /> <br /> To be sure, mixing drama with comedy can be a success. The result for this movie, however, is as successful as the "new tree".
