Oh, how I laughed ... it's all ... Asian / White family, disabled Asian boy ... all that a person has to see in the BBC's eyes. <br /> <br /> What a boring tribe: it was a complete insult to my eyes that saw this garbage in one episode and ONLY EPISODEI. <br /> <br /> When you think of some quality, the BBC has put out over the years (for example, Fawlty Towers) and then it rolls ... It's disgusting. <br /> <br /> It's all about political correctness and no humor. <br /> <br /> right from the gut of hell, but what would you expect from the ultra-left BPC ... I mean the BBC.
