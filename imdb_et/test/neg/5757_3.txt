Director and FX Man John Carl Buechler doesn't have to do much to scare me; seeing her name on the only credit is enough to get my heart afraid. <br /> <br /> His unfortunate direct-video output in the 80s sat on the bottom shelf of a part of my local rental horror; Twenty years later and his DVDs occupy the same space. The more things change, the more they stay the same. You can rely on the old JCB to serve up the drecke, regardless of the format and the evolution of the movie making technology. <br /> <br /> In this despicable offer, a number of friends travel to a distant city where they discover Jeremiah Stone, a forty-ninety-ninety-ninety-nine-year-old secret treasure that caused havoc in the mid-1800s. Before his death, Jeremiah went to someone who should find his gold, and it is not long before the killer-ax killing the killer is back, falling behind the unfortunate treasure hunt. <br /> <br /> With its terrible script, unimpressive make-up effects and Scooby-Doo-style villain, "Forty Ninin Curse" is for par. Only the genre stalwarts Keren Black, Richard Lynch and John Phillip Law give this film no credibility. The remaining cast performances range from bad and terrible (though I forgive Alexandra Ford, who is a full hottie). /> <br /> Even the fans of bad horrors are frustrated because most women keep their clothes and many deaths occur during the screen (which is obviously not as bad as the deaths on the screen are over) are pathetic). <br /> <br /> Forty Nin Curse is one of John Carl's fine lists.
