A completely pathetic attempt to shoot the victims of Australian soldiers during the New Guinea campaign. Spending money even when you only see it on a DVD. Fortunately, the video store offered a free weekly rental with a DVD that would have been a complete waste of money. It is probably an artistic type and full of the symbolism that today's Chardonay socialists seem to have. Frankly, this movie is an insult that remembers bold gazes that never came back. Someone gives financial support to make a decent movie at least as much as Saving Private Ryan. Hopefully, RSL will put it as far as possible between itself and this movie. The story must be told by all parties to Australia, local and Japanese - although the latter must tell the truth about everything that happened during World War II, it is very unlikely. Basically don't see this garbage, don't buy it. Within walking distance
