You now know the story of "Sweeney Todd", probably due to Tim Burton's recent film. You probably don't know this, the old story of Andy Milligan - the infamous merchant who gave Al Adamson and Ted V. Mikels their money. <br /> <br /> Eventually. During my years of horror and exploitation in the 1960s and 1980s, I finally look at Andy Milligan's film. You see, in 1964 - 1990, Andy gave us a lot of exploitation and horror films, none of which was good or barely observable. "Bovine meat butchers" is no exception. <br /> <br /> There is a dialogue here, well, talking, and this is one of the things you can find here and much to talk about. From time to time, the film almost reaches the "fate of Manos' hand", if you wait tirelessly for something to happen. Although I love cheap looking gorefections, violence is too little and far from being, and despite being a reputation, the "breast" scene is not so shocking. <br /> <br /> I love cheap and weak exploits as much as the next garbage bin, but "bloodthirsty butchers" is so bad that MST3K is relentlessly leaving. Unfortunately, Milligan dies of AIDS after 1991 and, if there is a movie, I would say it is like the terrible "The Ghastly Ones". It's not "ghostly", though it's just bad.
