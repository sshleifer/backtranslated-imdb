Frankly, I never read a comic and never remember parts 2 and 3 at all. I can compare the first part (Werner - Beinhart) and this is really a disappointment here compared to Part 1, as well as most of the other films I've seen in the last few weeks. The first few minutes are just the intro clone of the first movie intro and then it gets worse. There are some good (funny) scenes, but together this is another boring German film industry second-level sample that fails (almost as usual). One good thing: the movie is pretty short (75 min.) Bad thing: it only contains story and jokes for 45 minutes;) -> Don't look at it
