a really terrible movie about a 30 meter long shark. Bad Story Bad Debate Bad Characters Bad plot even messy ends complete. From my point of view, the waist thought it was a TV movie, but then I saw that I couldn't imagine paying for this load, please avoid this movie at all costs. even if u liked the jaws I did on average, I don't see it even if you have the interests of palaeontology, don't even see it if you like corny movies with funny actors, korny-plots on TV, or humanity favors and don't repeat, DON'T pollute your mind with this ridiculous apologies to sci-fi animals thriller, some people gave it ten ranting ... don't know if they were serious or not (but sincerely expect they weren't)
