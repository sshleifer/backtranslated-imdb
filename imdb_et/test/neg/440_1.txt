This DVD lacks her calling under Heineken. This is a great example of why no one should ever see a sequel with another director / writer as the original. Two hours of this turkey left me begging Exorcist 2 reruns. <br /> <br /> Not just laughing. Not one dignified intimidation. The script was just a mess and I felt that the makers who had to do it were bad (they had to be sick relatives at home or in a monster coke or something). <br /> <br /> The original was a landmark of makeup effects. So, of course, the descendants thought that the dismantling of FX and CG werewolves would be great. These CG werewolves had a lot more trouble for me to laugh than any comedy. It was just a complete break. If you want night entertainment, rent the original again. Or go to the film class and do your horror movie. You have to do better than these fools.
