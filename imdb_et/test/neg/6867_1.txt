The idea is great, the judges have violated the great time. <br /> <br /> Why are people happy? if what the inventors say is true and because most of them say that they spent their life saving their invention, then the minimal idea is to reject it without people being happy. <br /> <br /> shows when they want a career idea added to the judges. <br /> <br /> The only one who respects the judges is the one who always sits on the right side of the table. a sensible person <br /> <br /> naturally an English emperor who claims to be a businessman wearing suits doesn't make you one palm. who sits between English and herd. wake up man, not called to work and inventor. The inventor is a feature that is not a work man. <br /> <br /> I think they wanted to add someone like Simon, an American idol, they thought it worked there, it could work here. the context is different and the idea is completely different. <br /> <br /> It is a good idea and they could have shown it if they just changed the judges and removed their actions and attitudes. /> <br /> just stop having fun.
