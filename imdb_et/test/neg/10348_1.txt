Can I say more? The reason why Kathi and Kim's good Australian version was, as mentioned, good because it was a funny funny originality. The reason why this new American version is so terrible is because a lot of it is done directly from the original. Not to mention the reality of the characters. Kath is meant for dag. Kim is for fat. Who (or Phil, as they called him) is meant to be pathetic. Brett (or Craig) is meant to be a loser, not a person who acts like a heroin and finishes every sentence "guy". Thank God, for Subanski does not sell his rights to Sharon, he would probably be a tall and thin blonde, whom Kim likes. <br /> <br /> Kath and Kim are mom and laughter. They are not meant for two years. And they are not meant as school girls. This show is disgraceful to even share the same title as the Australian version. America: Get your TV shows.
