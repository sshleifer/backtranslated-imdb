This is definitely a direct video, but this story is not as bad as most other reviewers think. I really like the fact that the hero does the wrong thing most of the time. <br /> <br /> Hero reactions and rebel reactions are just human. The nature of Hopper is actually played by God. This may be the right thing, but it may not be like that. <br /> <br /> Finally, God is destined to the death of a player and a hero who would have spent his life can live. Quite moral. :-) <br /> <br /> The most unrealistic thing I saw is that the land does well when no month can stabilize its rotation.
