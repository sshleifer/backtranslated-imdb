OK, we got JP grandmother boy and Chuck, well Chuck. I thought this film would be pretty good, and it started on my film's scale quite high, but it was just about half way through as long as I lost interest. I'm really so boring, probably because you see right now what's going to happen; the story is actually quite a thread, I left over 15 minutes and nothing left! This film should have been a short work, maybe about 45 minutes to an hour max. It starts with good and ends with good, too bad, filling is happier, boring, boring and missing all after a while. Some people say they like music; I don't care about jazz and I don't see films for my score, I'm going to the story and when it is pulled out ... well, the ratings fall into my book. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Good open, very dense and boring filler. The story was cool, but if you don't know what's going on a quarter of a way, you haven't seen too many thrillers.
