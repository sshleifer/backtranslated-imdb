You've seen this movie for the first time since you bought it from a DVD. <br /> <br /> It's like an inexpensive attempt to cash in two Conani movies. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie does not seem to have the same budget as Conan's movies and so some sets and effects are not flashes, and some scenes seem to be in a hurry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nielsen is good at watching, but unfortunately he couldn't act when the gun was put on him. <br /> <br /> Arnie's supporting role seemed to have been directed by the director Fleischer, who also led Conan Destroyer. Maybe Arnie wasn't sure he would continue with headlines like Predator, Total Recall, T2, etc. <br /> <br /> Some talisman female teachers saw the movie early on to lift out their swords and their faces showed they were making this movie very fun. I didn't get as viable as I fought for my life. <br /> <br /> All this was left out that this movie needed very little concentration to watch and was a little fun. I've seen much worse. Two stars.
