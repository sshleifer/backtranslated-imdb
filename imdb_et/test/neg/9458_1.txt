Ah, yes, this is another classic retelling, "a sociopathic murderous doctor creates a woman in Frankenstein and falls in love." not a group), and "Blood Feast", this "unfinished" film cries practically for MST3K treatment. The doctors' assistant even has the shades of the classic "Torgo" from the classic "Manos: The Fate of Fate". I don't know if graphics, if counterfeit violence or frequent dialogue-free tedium could scare the team, <br /> <br /> The main reasons why this movie is to sit is a hysterical hypnosis scene, a ridiculously serious end and rock-based production values. In fact, after this movie, I watched all the credits, because for the same reasons, you're in a serious traffic accident to slow down the car. This and the final theme genius that sounds like "My Favorite Things" plays the game on the piano. It's not Goblin.
