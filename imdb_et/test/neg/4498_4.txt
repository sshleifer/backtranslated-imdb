It should be remembered that Gammera's films, like many of Gozilla's first series of films, were actually targeted children. Little Kenny and his cohorts live in public for children's days: they can run around and play with secret things, while adults stand and promise; they get together with monsters and even when bad guys enter, they are never in any real danger. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the first Gammera movie is aberration because the child can be punished and IS is threatened, but the rest of the series is a pure desire. <br /> <br /> As one critic says, these adult films are not successful but successful children's films.
