This movie is called "Solomon Kane". What it is not. The main character is wearing a hat, but that's all he has in common with Robert Howard's Solomon Kane, known for his earlier pulp magazines and many publications. This is a fantasy movie that is not really so bad and it can easily go through a pretty good overview - if it hadn't been called Solomon Kane. The hero is a newly invented character who is definitely not SK. This story is not Robert Howard. <br /> <br /> As a fantasy movie, this is another film that follows the genre's traditions: simple story, bad CGI, poor actors, bad leadership. But it can be fun, you know, "the cheaper it is, the better they are." But because it's called Solomon Kane, I can't accept it. Imagine the Lord-of-the-Rings movie Hero Bilbo, fighting with black witch Saugalf, his dwarf friend Aragorn and the beautiful heroine Shadowfax. And with the final struggle where the three are using the magic circle to kill the evil witch who has become the Dragon Gondor. Imagine. This is exactly what this film has done with Robert Howard's character Solomon Kane. <br /> <br /> I would give it a 4-star review if it was just another movie, but because it's called Solomon Kane, I can only estimate 3 stars.
