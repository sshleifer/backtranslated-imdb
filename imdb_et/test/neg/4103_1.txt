My friend suggested this movie to me. Could I not have seen it because my friend is a nerd of a video game. But the name and cover make it look good for some reason. I was so wrong. I mean first, what are these suits? And actress! It seems they got people out of Barney. Except for Ben Kingsley. And why was he even in that movie? Did he think it was a comedy! But I have to say that the special effects were pretty good. But it was like the only good thing about it. I mean seriously that the film is worse than Pearl Harbor. And that is actually an underestimation. Everyone must think, "Oh, I can pay, so it doesn't matter if it's the world's worst movie." I understand why someone could make such a movie by directing, acting, producing, writing, and filming and editing the best friend of their hopeless life. Probably one of the worst sci-fi movies. One truly elevated film
