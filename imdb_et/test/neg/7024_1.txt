I love Lucy, but this movie is so harshly bad that I was embarrassed for all involved in the first ten minutes. . . and it got worse. Lucille Ball's "singing" is completely painful and attempts to make her younger thanks to the use of soft focus had reached my reading glasses. Such bombs give the bombs a bad name.
