When the government explores the impact of rocket cosmic radiation on animals, this little Texas city will collapse, people will die. The county sheriff is trying to investigate, but the efforts of other government officials are obstructing it. It turns out that in the woods, teenagers are killing gorilla with mutant space. <br /> <br /> I like low budget science fiction and horror movies. I like monster movies. So I thought it would be a good chance I'd like this movie. Unfortunately, I didn't. <br /> <br /> I don't mind badly acting, dirty dialogue, the scary musical score or the huge plot hole that this movie has. There are a lot of movies that have the same problems I've seen and enjoyed so badly that it's a good way. is at a terrible pace. And it will shrink because of it. There are scenes that continue and continue without something happening - the search for forests is just people who walk the forest for a long time; The party in the forest has several seemingly endless dancing teenagers ... but nothing interesting is happening. If these scenes were shorter, the film may not be so boring (although I don't think cutting those scenes would have saved it). <br /> <br /> I have now given three views for this movie that I gave him the opportunity to review. Unfortunately, it is worse than any clock. There is no fourth.
