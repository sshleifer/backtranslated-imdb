Most of you didn't really like that movie ... you were right. A small minority really loved the movie ... can't say you're wrong. For me, this movie was too stupid. I've seen many foolish comedies, but it goes beyond each of them. When I looked, I could not rub my eyes, not believe what I saw and try to decide if I should laugh or cry because the screen is in real stop * and people left the theater. <br /> <br /> According to leading figures, the time has passed, just enter the museum and you are actually going to the past. And if you are looking for an experience after death, go to the nearest planetarium where you meet the Lord - excuse me, Loydd and give them important commands ... All of the above does not really make sense, right? Well, go ahead, watch the movie (I almost never lose the movies I watch), probably not like it, but you are interested in the ability of the writer to produce the final STUPID script ... <br /> <br /> I'll give him a 3- ie 10, not good, not far worse ...
