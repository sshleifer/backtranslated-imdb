Being too young to experience Hammer movies when they were fresh and new, I discover their sanctified horror films when I find them on DVD. I know it was almost a decade and a half between them, but it's hard to see much of the original Hammer Dracula magic in this late Christopher Lee series. The original Hammer Vampire story was a lot of atmospheric and terrible story to get in. Lee was a great Dracula, a living vampire, if possible at an early departure, but here he is nothing more than a carton character, which mostly stands around and seems dangerous. Fashionable young people talk like cartoons (although my aunt lived in the 1970s in England and says people talk about their terrible clich√©s). I had no interest in living or dying among the younger crowd. They were all rather awful signs. I liked the young and charismatic Caroline Munro; but he leaves the story too early. Lee and his historical nemesis Peter Cushing add air to the film, but they can't draw blood from this empty film. This is D.O.A.
