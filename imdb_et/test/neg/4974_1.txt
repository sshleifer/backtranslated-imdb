I started watching it because I was looking for a nice "background" comedy on my Sunday morning. Then I noticed that it was on the road and I decided to actually watch it. <br /> <br /> The first 15 minutes were terrible, but I wanted to give this opportunity because I never understand a movie without it. Then things started to get a little better. It seemed like a nice tea-film friendship. But then the film started to get terrible predictable clich√©s, and when the movie was over, you felt like you had wasted your time. Does it have anything to say? Why did they even make such a movie? And I did not expect a modern citizen Kane, but I still have several ideas for improving this film. <br /> <br /> So take my advice; leave it alone and go see the real film. There are lots of them. I don't make the directors of these films bad when their names are put into this review. <br /> <br /> 1/10
