I'm a big comedy fan. Racial humor is always a bit risky, but fears like George Lopez, Dave Chapelle, Lisa Lampanelli, and so on. Pull it out perfectly. <br /> <br /> They don't go overboard, make the audience uncomfortable, or * Cough cough * STEAL EVER! But I don't skip it. <br /> <br /> Carlos makes racial humor completely fun. His jokes are constantly screaming of racial humor, that is not funny or wise, but it is offensive. I'm not going to turn to a cold racial humor. But filling these jokes is sloppy, causing people to kick back their comedy. <br /> <br /> His humor is overcome only by the annoyance on his stage. I feel like he's always with me! And he runs on a stage like a maniac. It only comes as annoying!
