OK, I just turned the channels and tried DW3. I looked knowing that it would be a trash ... BUT ... if a person who has seen tons of movies, this one of the purely bad films I've ever seen ... I'm not kidding. It's so bad that you have to look at it, like a bad accident you can't. Sometimes such movies, IE, Troma movies ... but watching the slip of Martin Balsam and Charles Bronson, it hurts .... What's even funny, I'm pulling up IMDb to see what other people said and it really is on 4.1 / 10 ??? I can't believe it did it from 1.5! Like funny, it's not even at the top of this series ... but this garbage justifies parts 4 and 5? And when all this is turned off, some of the guys' comments here point to the best in this series and his all-time favorite movie? Such statements frighten me for this world!
