What the hell was that dumb movie? it seemed quite interesting at first, but quickly fell on his face. should it be based on a real story, but are there no more script writers in Hollywood for crying out loud? man iv'e seen these men some of the best movies ever made, defoe can play almost anything and when i see that he is in the movie i have no problem renting it but i'm starting ime.redford also big actress slips; maybe their harsh or just the loss of their senses. the dialogue was long and terribly difficult, especially at home with the family.i don't know if the actors thought they were here? maybe ... Oscar?
