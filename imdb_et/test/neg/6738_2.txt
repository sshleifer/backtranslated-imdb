It must be the worst Steven Segal movie I've ever watched (even worse than eco-piffle like On Deadly Ground & Fire Down below). I'll start with the good points ..., This is a stylish direction for the DTV movie and it has a wonderful landscape ... That's it! The story doesn't really go anywhere, it's just a lot of well-staged pieces, so the sea moves with bad guys (the body number is easily matched with Tarantino's bloody blood!). The plot is unnecessarily complicated and confusing, you forget who are good and bad guys. Functioning (I use the term loosely) is at best a mediocre, sea-bed normal ONE constipation and wood-working self that I can take, but the other British especially were terrible. <br /> <br /> What's in the package? Why are the bad guys after that? Is the seabed set? <br /> <br /> HAVE BEING ***! <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie in my local Blockbuster (if I paid for it), the assistant laughed at me and said it was the worst movie I could have chosen in the shop! (I felt like hitting him until my hand was numb) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I haven't seen one and a half dead or dead, and I don't want to downgrade my shop, but they can't be any worry if it turkey. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack should be young and hip - it just gave me the mouthpiece of half a dozen asprin. <br /> <br /> All this is Seagal's WORK! A boy who has earned about 100 pounds and looks good is a man who just doesn't have to stop when he is supposed to retire. and go behind the camera or become a martial arts teacher or something. <br /> <br /> My Rating 2/10 (1 point off road)
