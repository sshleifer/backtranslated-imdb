The first thing I notice is music. It's not as amazing as the ghostly theme of the Ruggero Deodato Cannibal Holocaust or the masterpiece of A Tale of Two Sisters, but I won't let this kind of movie stop so early. <br /> <br /> It should be assumed that a woman who investigates her hypothesis for her doctoral thesis that cannibalism as an organized practice has never existed might think they have to take into account that they are wrong and are preparing for the right journey? Or why not go at all if you already believe the hypothesis is true before it is even tested? It is quite incredibly unknown and makes the movie a much more unrealistic and worse script. <br /> <br /> This is actually similar to the Ruggero Deodato film, which is just quite badly prepared. No weapons, decent hiking clothes, just pointless out and out. <br /> <br /> People do not go to college for such trips without monthly planning and preparation. <br /> <br /> But I Digress ... <br /> <br /> Things don't get to our good but stupid adventures for a very good start, because they don't let the unywalking iguanas and their grooming pet ashes go out of the truck almost It's death, then get into the mud hole, well I think it's time to walk. <br /> <br /> Okay, so they fold the coin to see if they will continue or forget the whole thing. How does this scene even make sense? All their convictions are based on the coin flap? After they have spent time and money and are ready to get out of there. It just gets worse. Not talking about how he and his friend were captured by cannibals and put sludge in the mines of 3 inches in length. breastfeeding their blood. I found it interesting because if you remember the first cannibal that they get into the jungle, a man who is a nasty mother tongue sits on the spot, eating such leeches ... don't you know if they're the same? Really, though, this movie is just terrible, because the script is terrible and the operation is emotional with respect to content. They accept themselves rather than edible cannibals as it is not a big decision. <br /> <br /> Mike is probably crazy, but as with the first movie, they treat natives with such dreadful behavior, it's just unrealistic. <br /> <br /> The Ruggero Deodato movie easily recognizes that Americans got what they deserve, while in this movie, indigenous people cannot blame for what the Americans do again. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be pointless. We already got the first movie point, so why did it follow? Lieutenant's name is Rizzo?! Can it get worse? Often with movies like those when you see the selected pictures, they don't find they have actually made many other movies, and their biocides are all but not there, so you can imagine that I was surprised when I found Giovanni Lombardo Radice in the movie, who was in Scorsese's New York gangs. At the moment, it seemed familiar to Mrs Rizzo and found that she was a very small role as a tug captain in the 2002 film Spiderman. Reminds me of how William Shatner went to the police of the USS Enterprise Admiral. Irony, sometimes irony works. Shatner could never get the music right until his last album "Has Been", which is really good, like the Bono of U2, never got the right hair, and Dan Marino could never win the Superbowle. <br /> <br /> Sometimes irony is just as sad as Christopher Reeve, Superman can't go irony. But the man is always a legend because he was such a big man, but I repeat it. <br /> <br /> Here you can say that I'm quite bored to even talk to Cannibal Ferox. > <br /> The Kannibal Holocaust message was about who is the real savage and what is really evil? What do savages do in their natural life, what do our moral data do not know, or what do we do with others with malicious intent? The message of Cannibal Ferox seems to be "Be careful what you are looking for because you would just find it." I say this to Cannibal Ferox. When Gloria returns and writes her thesis claiming that cannibalism is NOT there, she saves others who are curious and go where angels are afraid of gold, but in general this film was very bad. <br /> <br /> *** / 10
