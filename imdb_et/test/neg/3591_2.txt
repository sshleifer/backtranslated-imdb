According to the good words of my friends, I hired this movie, hoping it would be at least equal to the laughs of a similar "House Party" movie, but I was very disappointed and very boring. <br /> <br /> While watching a movie, sleeping is never a good sign. I don't know if I didn't like it because I don't live "da in hood" or if I'm not black, but it's probably one of two. <br /> <br /> Try to drag a couple of movies, but a couple of laughs will come, but in the long run it will fail. I miss it.
