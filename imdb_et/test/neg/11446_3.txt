This movie left me thinking ... but not about plot, direction, characters, main message or smart script. Far from it. I was wondering what Sam Hill went wrong behind the scenes. It is clear that there was something wrong from the start. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised at the movie and the results of Jodie Foster. It was clear that Foster had called it. One of the earlier remarks was even favorable for his facial expressions. I had to watch another movie because Mrs Foster (usually a personal favorite) seemed to be completely interested. <br /> <br /> In one of his first scenes with Foster, Fred Ward says he is also disturbed by his lack of energy and is trying to deliver his line with enthusiasm. By the time he is invited to participate in the allegedly desperate quest for Foster, Ward also seems to have become embarrassed to the project. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Dennis Hopper has always been a one-dimensional performer so I didn't expect much from him ... and he gave it. <br /> <br /> Yes, it left me thinking long after its end. The fact that Joe Pesc and Charlie Sheen refused to associate the project with their names suggests that it was really smelly for all participants. But then you know that the director preferred to hide everything behind the pseudonym. <br /> <br /> But why listen to me? I always think that Foster looks ridiculous in clothing, but he is a sensational lace underwear.
