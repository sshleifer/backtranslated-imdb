This movie was released in all major Australian cinemas. I watched the movie on the 7th AUG Weekend and I thought it was an absolute mess (and I use that word very wrong). How did it become free for every major cinema? The plot seemed simple enough for the world to be subdivided, and people needed identity cards, and actor Tim Robbins played a shanghai investigator investigating an employee who stole ID cards, which turns out to be actress Samantha Morton. > <br /> You think of this summary that the rest of the story should be interesting, but it is not just a confusion in the audience of even more different storyline that is unrelated. <br /> <br /> If you mean seeing this movie, I can save you the trouble of NOT THIS MOVIE.
