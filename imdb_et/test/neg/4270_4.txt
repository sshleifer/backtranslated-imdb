Already enough. this is a terrible TV. The work of the camera is terrible (do I have to remind you of the crisp gravel so loud that the actors can't hear it), Latin Bertram is the most disturbing voice in the world. Anna Massey is "incredibly active". and the lack of chemistry between fanny and edmund is farther away. Also bertram girls are not quite enough, and the boy playing henry crawford is terrible. to say the camera's work is tiring is an understatement. I looked at this adaptation at Christmas, and I think that in other circumstances I would not have been able to withstand it and I would certainly not have been able to justify the wasted time. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of loyal adaptations. so I wasn't able to wear the movie's adaptation or recent pride and prejudice. but see other adjustments, even emma is better than this.
