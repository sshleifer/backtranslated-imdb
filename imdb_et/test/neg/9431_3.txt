"Shadows and Mist" is definitely one of Woody Allen's weakest films, "September" and "Hollywood's End" (though nothing is equal to "Anything else"). <br /> <br /> "Shadows and Fog" is Allen's respect for German expressionist filmmaking style, all the harsh and stylized lights and shadows, and ... you thought it ..... a lot of fog. But you can say that Allen has captured the technique and parody and forgot to make a movie that anyone would care about. <br /> <br /> Luckily, he did "spouses and women" in the same year, so things didn't go down to him. <br /> <br /> Rating: D
