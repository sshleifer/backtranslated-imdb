When you came here, it is because you've already seen this movie and curious what others had to say about it. <br /> <br /> I know you, I really * do. And I apologize as a Canadian (because that's what we're doing) that this movie was ever going to have to go over the eyes, if only for a while. I hear that retinal haemorrhage has not been treated for every ten cases. <br /> <br /> I, like everyone else, rented this movie, believing it to be a stupid hanging of a B movie. I thought "to use a ridiculous movie." I give one positive comment to the creators of this movie about their creation: Thank you for removing REC XX / XX / XX in the lower right corner of the screen. I can see how this would have distracted you from seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> And for the record, I saw a * movie but didn't watch it. The dialogue was inconsistent and most scenes took place in my grandmother's trailer, I swear before God. <br /> <br /> You know what? I no longer write about it. It's just too painful.
