Recension: Angels & Demons <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Ron Howard. He has also made famous films such as The Da Vinci Code & Cinderella Men. He also led the famous TV series 24. The most famous actors are Tom Hanks (Da Vinci Code, Green Mile, Forrest Gump, ??) & Ewan McGregor (Cassandra's Dream, Moulin Rouge, Star Wars: Phantom Threat, ??). <br /> <br /> At first I was shocked because they made the start of the movie so big. Because they changed the father of Vittoria Vettra (Ayelet Zurer) to someone else, Silvano Bentivoglio (Camren Argenziano). Another change is that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) never goes to CERN. It was nice that they could shoot at CERN. <br /> <br /> Then the movie continues, they are spectacular races in Rome. I also like this part of Chirstian Archives when they destroy Galileo's work, it was funny. It was also funny that they entered the archives for the second time, Robert Langdon destroyed half of the archives and if they burst, electricity would be used ?? <br /> <br /> I found it very stupid that Robert Langdon didn't go into a helicopter, but Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) alone, another detail is that Camerlengo is a child adopted by the Pope. In the book He is the real Son of the Pope. <br /> <br /> If I had to give the best show, I would have to say Pierfrancesco Favino, who plays Olivetti. Halvim was active as an assassin, played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas, I think he was undervalued because he played Faboulous on Adams Apples. <br /> <br /> I think the whole movie has been downgraded because the director Ron Howard made some stupid changes. I'd appreciate movie 4/10.
