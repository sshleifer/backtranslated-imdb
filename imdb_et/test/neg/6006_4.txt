This movie was really bad. I went to the theater, waiting for something exciting, and instead gave me the opportunity to "guess the twist of the next plot before it happens". Seriously, the plot was written with an extra thick pen to see everyone. Nothing was really shocking. In fact, even gore was filled with such a complete suspension of belief that it really didn't add much. <br /> <br /> Too clever cracking and cops talking shop crime scenes made it seem all the more counterfeiting. And the scene where Lambert's character struggles and reaches his "exploratory epiphany" goes a long way to showing the audience the level of intelligence expected - little. Cinematography was the treatment of "X-Files": the building of every film, whether it is a building or a house at midday or hospital, suffers from a lack of illumination (not to mention the lack of patients). "hospital". I can't remember any scene when someone switched on the light switch. It would certainly have been nice. <br /> <br /> Mr. Lambert is not really an Oscar actress, so I think you have to pay for this movie. Finally, I have come to the conclusion that the only thing that would make this film more sensitive is to watch it after watching "Warriors". Otherwise, you have been struggling with what is boring and unoriginal, and nowhere is the genre of similar movies like "Silence of Lambs".
