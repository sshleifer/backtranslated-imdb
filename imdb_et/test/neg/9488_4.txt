One of the most prominent / popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. The red-shirt female falls to Khan (for dropping instead of death) and then Friday and Enterprise go Friday as loyalty to the ship's non-existent trait. Considering what psychological tests this allegedly brilliant Starfleet uses to test people for recruitment. We have the same absurd lack of loyalty in "Wink Of An Eye" when a red shirt man takes an enemy just because he falls in love! Same as SS. (This episode has a small role in betrayal in a general plot.) It is very stupid because it once again makes the Kirki team a bunch of soft-headed, easily impressive morals who - if they fall in love with the enemy - are able to do almost anything. The fact that McGivers returns to Kirki does not improve the logic in any way. Lord McGiveth and Lord McTaketh ... <br /> <br /> Why is Khan behind the ordinary door when they know he has good strength? This is one of many ST plot equipment that undermines Kirki's intelligence. Why does Khan McCoy keep his throat against a knife? If Khan is of such higher intelligence, he would assume that he is more self-conscious than he carries. And what about the Latino accent played with Sikh? Montalban should have been given a vocal coach. I was half-waiting to hear the "plan!" in the background at any time. Why does Hell Kirk (or any captain of a ship) provide the ship's library with inexhaustible use of the company's internal technical details? Is Starfleet an institution composed exclusively of idiots? The SS is a very comic, silly episode, so it's no wonder Trekkies love it. There are not too many sci-fi elements that Trekkies hates the most. It has also been calculated that the ST franchise decided to revive the second stubborn nature of this film, a pleasant trekkies that were so disappointed with the first movie - which you thought - was too much of a sci-fi average small Trekkie brain.
