Altioklar: Captain of the Thieves. <br /> <br /> Watch some movies, steal some of them, write a script ... It must be very easy to be a Turkish director. I think Altioklar looked at "Identity (2003)", "Saw (2004)", a couple of series on crimes, murders, etc. He then said "Eureka, eureka" (I've found it!) After he wrote a script about the movie. <br /> <br /> You can guess the murderer at the beginning of the movie. It took me just 10 minutes. He yelled, "I'm a murderer, I'm a murderer." There is no secret. <br /> <br /> The Tamer Karadagli is the same (sux). Exaggerated impression, funny macho man. <br /> <br /> There is only one good thing in the movie. Demet Evgar's performance is very good. You only see the movie for that.
