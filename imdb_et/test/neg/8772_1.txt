One of the reviewers wrote here: "Good functioning, good special effects, great <br /> <br /> even better end." All I can say is "Ugh." This movie was a painful look. Let me start by saying this: I am a Christian who many people I know are considered extremely conservative. So, what I'm saying is that the "Christian content" is not biased. I'm not talking about it because it's a Christian. I'll give it 2/10 because it's a terrible movie. Writing is bad - on top, WAY too preachy and lots of "preachy" things are just just an insignificant story. This just makes writing a bad scenario. I agree with <br /> <br /> the beliefs of the scriptwriters, is irrelevant - make a good script that flows well, stays on track and is plausible. Action was the best. But hey, if you poured amateurs, you get amateur performances. Dirk Been may have been "Survivor", but it shows that <br /> <br /> needs ZERO. Selling your name and reputation to sell units is a bad taste. Create unknowns who can act and you have a much better movie. The effects were HORRIBLE. The filthy scene and the ensuing fall of the stars was an embarrassing look. And what was so big up to the end? It didn't make any sense. Yes, I know what <br /> <br /> Tim Chey did, but it was unnoticed for a long time. I bought this movie and waited so much more for reviews and <br /> <br /> based on incorrect information on your website. And while I was hoping for more, I got what I always get when I look at "Christian" movies - the budget, the poorly written, the miserable, the badly produced piece too. Maybe one day somebody finally ends up with a disc that has a final-time film written as well as Gibson's "Passion ...". 2/10 stars.
