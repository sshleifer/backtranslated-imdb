I was very disappointed in this movie. The director has given some talent in his other endeavors, but it seemed like a filler. There may be a deep meaning behind it, but it seems to me that it is nothing more than a director who has access to some toys. <br /> <br /> I would recommend his other work to people, but certainly not one. When I looked at it, I thought it would start growing after the first slow period, but it wasn't done. At the end of the film I was neither entertained nor moved and thought about things in a new way. I can only say, "What was that?" <br /> <br /> The movie had a couple of really striking parts, but not enough to sit back.
