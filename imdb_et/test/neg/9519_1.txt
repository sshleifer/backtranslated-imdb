What I can say about this movie is really one of the worst gay themes ever coming out of the UK. I can only imagine that Diana Quick and Georgina Hale like money. What a story there is, such a terrible mess that you lose interest quite quickly. This should be based on actual events. Well, all I can say is that it is an insult to real life characters. The DVD is currently in the UK. It is available in a split screen format, which has to make it worse when looking at the full screen version. Gay cinema can be so much better, and we deserve more.
