I hope the makers of these "movies" read these comments so they know people just don't want their movies. They are just a trash and embarrassment to the killer clown's fear genre. Whether it was better than the first, it doesn't matter if they're both just terrible. I'm surprised that they didn't learn their lesson from the first movie. Stop now !! Warning for horror movie viewers, DONT WATCH, RENT, or LOOK AT "URBAN" HORROR FILMS BECOME AND ALL, DON'T YOUR OWN !!!!
