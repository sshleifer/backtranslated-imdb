Parts: Clonus Horror is not a bad movie. I have a version of MST3K on tape and it's fun, but it's still not the worst movie ever made. I'd like to go so far as to say it was better than 80% of the movies they're having fun. The concept could have worked if they had a better script, more money and decent actors. It could have been classic if it wasn't so boring and a little more excitement. Unfortunately, it was attacked in production and ended with MST3K.
