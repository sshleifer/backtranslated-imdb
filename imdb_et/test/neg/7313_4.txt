Finally, the credit was "ALL director Shigeru Izumiya". This is the right way to express it, because it seems that the material filmed from several projects was somehow thrown away, barely even trying to make it all work together. More seemed to be one of those music clip items that are marketed as feature films in cash for these video ads, here we have marketable music and live performances, with the exception of one scene that may be marketed by weird music videos in Japan. What ever. <br /> <br /> It doesn't make sense. Visually, this is not too special, although it has its own moments (for example, a female creature with a "powder of death" attached to a bed base and some morphing sh! T) and this is definitely an industrial feeling for it. I would usually call these effects dilettant, but what this film offers in this respect is more than anything else. Remember these inexpensive video effects with 70's and 80's music videos that make them so dated as the picture on the screen that travels through the screen? Such and obvious reason for this effect is quite a lot. The most semi-apparent apparent effort comes from the picture collage. Pictures are similar to the album cover. What ever. <br /> <br /> I don't know what this version is with the subtitles I saw. The Chinese (or any of these hieroglyphs) sometimes appear to appear when nothing is said and English is often spoken without Chinese. English speaking speaks a lot about life without killing (is it possible?) And a mind about the body that gives what is closest to the understandable conflict in this film. One man (scientist guy) says that life without flesh is death, while another man (metamorphous guy) who claims to have his body in his mind is now blown up by his death flow and now he knows the secrets of meat and not ; metamorphosing dude is visibly p! ssed off the researcher's dude requirement. Whatever. <br /> <br /> Erm, The End - All Written By Perception de Ambiguity
