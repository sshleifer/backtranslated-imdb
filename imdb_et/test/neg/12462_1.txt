As a rule, I try to find as many movies as I can. I didn't make any exceptions to "Tart", doing my best to evaluate it for what it was. But no matter how big it is, it shouldn't be a creepy excuse for the movie. <br /> <br /> This has failed for several reasons. First, cinematography was ineffective and ineffective. Secondly, the script came to "bad" depths that took it well and truly beyond the "so good" category. Third, left-handedness exercises - it was terrible, it really was. Anyone who saw Mischa Barton (seen here as a very horrible Gracet, so badly invented the character and realized that And And Binks didn't seem so bad) as Devon John Duigan's "Lawn Dogs", doesn't know what then and now. Perhaps, if he had been given some value that deserves to be disturbed, and some direction, he would at least have given the ONE a redeeming function. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Finally, it seemed that the film had no point in expressing something that did not achieve anything. Really, I don't know why Christina Wayne worked hard. <br /> <br /> "Tart" made a weak attempt to be something and failed. The result - the film is so bad that it's just very, very bad. Don't bother - it's not really worth it.
