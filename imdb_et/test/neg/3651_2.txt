The sound of this movie is a nightmare. That's the best thing I can say about this movie. When the movies start, every good story disappears. The premise of the movie sounds good. Playboy, who meets with people around him. The plot is predictable and very dull. A wet t-shirt contest can be the worst scene I've ever watched and is almost worth the Mystery Science deal. Sound is sometimes hard to hear and the main actor doesn't know how to speak clearly. His accent makes him very difficult to understand. The only bright sport is Penelope's Ann Miller action. His role is underdeveloped, but he plays it well. In short, don't waste your time.
