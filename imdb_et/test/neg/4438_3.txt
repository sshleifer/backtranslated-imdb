Things I am irritating about, things I'm talking about and irritating people trying to watch movies with me are the moments when a writer, director, designer, on-screen caterer, or who doesn't think about it in the end and with one inactivity - or the Commission - cancels all other work done by everyone else who has worked with the film. This moment "Wait a bloody minute ... What happened?" which stops narrative dead in your stories. (Not that much of the narrative in this film needed a lot of stopping because everyone who has ever seen knows that Quintet's narrative ride is quite frozen before the end of the game.) There are several moments in this movie. And you can think of them for so long. The movie is two hours long and the scripted dialog probably lasted five pages. There is a lot of time to think about these shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The film is set on frozen ground. The second ice age has taken place and the whole world is dying. It's cold. Very cold. It's very cold on the screen. The film was filmed in Canada in winter and there are ice shrubs and real snow and people breathing from every scene in the mouth. Once and again, it is reminded of how cold it is. People wear big hats and layers of clothing and rush around like dressed Weeble people. Must be terrible to shoot. My nitpick comes sequentially when our hero checks the hotel room. In the middle of the night, we woke up by the voices of the room coming from the side that he listened to an important conversation for a very small plot through a large space in the two-room wall. I have no doubt why there is a comfortable grill in the wall between the two rooms. What annoyed me was the fact that the long-term tenant hadn't been grilling the noise with the visitor. When you try to keep warm, the last thing you need is a large wall that leads to empty unheated space. Trust me. I live like that, I watched this movie sitting on the sofa in my living room, which was under the hot water bottle. My breath was just like the actors. When that big rupture was in my wall, I blocked it. Maybe not the best choice for a movie to watch in a heating chamber in the Middle Ages, but the boy made me insane with this film.
