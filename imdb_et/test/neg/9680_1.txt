I think Hollywood should seriously consider NEVER the second "Bible" movie when Noah's Ark is the norm. In addition to the terrible, wholeheartedly wholehearted whole cast (Voight and Steenburgen undoubtedly rue the day when they agreed to make this movie), the timeline has been completely redesigned. I also left a part of Genesis about the pirate battle on the ship deck or the merchant who came with his paddle boat. Hi? All others were dead except by the scriptures of Noah and his family. God arranged the lumber and added plans to build the ship when Noah asked how? I also don't remember reading something about Noah's woman's constant nervousness for 40 days, or Noah, who wanders through the glass and looked all the time. The script obviously had very little knowledge of the Genesis book, or simply did not care that his horror story was completely ridiculed by it.
