Combine good casting, poor writing, good orchestra evaluation, bad dialogue and a good idea that has a lot of potential but you never understand if you have Slipstream. <br /> <br /> Just bought a movie for the box, it's worth it, but not much else. <br /> <br /> Good to see Mark Hamill re-act. <br /> <br /> There should be a proper sequel to eliminate the damage to the original. Or at least give him enough attention he should have. <br /> <br /> The Berstein score demanded your attention from the credits, but the long slipstream aircraft shots and the even longer interesting plot points expose his attention. <br /> <br /> It's really easy for a dog to do this after it is made by the STARWARS manufacturer and TRON manager and a huge number, but that's what it is. And that's not much. <br /> <br /> Favorite line - "We'll do it if-ha! ... (BOOM!)"
