In all episodes I have never seen any real action or drama or comedy. <br /> <br /> The plot is so repetitive. <br /> <br /> **** Somebody gets something old and someone else tells them a little about it and how much it is worth and who made it and where it comes from and how much it can sell and if it has it no work has been done. <br /> <br /> For Sowh, whom I looked at from them 30, I realized that ... there was no drama .... no one would lose limbs or life, and wouldn't split, hit a car or air level. <br /> <br /> Or explosions - not even horse racing with old carts. <br /> <br /> All these weapons and swords, and no one goes with the violent death that you give? Pshycos, no axes, old angels who aren't bad suits ... you just have ... You have an old tea machine and it came back from Germany in 1602 - blah blah blah. .. <br /> <br /> I am still waiting for someone who has a time machine to go to the screen and ask, but not ... it will never come and the only thing that happens is that some tired Englishman or woman it is a bit of a mess that something old is being sold in Boston or China during the Ming Dynasty - a big deal for EFFIN. <br /> <br /> Can't ever rob and hold one of the leaders for ransom? Isn't there any alien spacecraft that destroys the entire floor? Who the hell is writing these things in series and waiting for us to be awake? It's just as entertaining as dehydrating - with comments only. <br /> <br /> There is no sex, no comedy or romance, no action, no relationship, no action, no drama, no mystery, no martial arts. <br /> <br /> This show sucks! What ever happened to supermodels that carry straps and fascinating lasers with a futuristic weapon? Antique Roadshow - More like to grab a blanket and pillow and go to bed to show ...
