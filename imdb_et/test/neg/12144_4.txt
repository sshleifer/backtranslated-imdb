It's a serious movie of black revolutionary movies, not really a movie. Billy Dee plays a young man who is against racism who decides to take things. It is quite sharp and realistic without exploiting the characters, but it is not so interesting, and Billy Dee's character, although white powers are badly treated, is not really sensible. It also hurt this very small budget. However, it is interesting to see if this is a good image of the social problems of the 1970s.
