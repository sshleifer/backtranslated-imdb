This movie was different from most of Jimmy Cangey's 1930s films because it wasn't made by Warner Brothers / First National, but it was a loan for a smaller studio. Since it was a "poverty line" studio, the output values ​​are lower than those for Cagney films. Plus is definitely one of the most strange I've ever seen. Instead of being a gangster, he was a good man in that fight for the law. It is not so unusual because Cagney often played lawyers - like the OSS leader (CIA ancestor) - as an FBI agent. HOW to make him an investigator for the Weights and Measurements Bureau was really strange - especially because he sometimes acted the same way he did in G-MEN! <br /> <br /> All in all, it's overtaking and it's about. <br /> <br /> Finally, the video tape I saw on Memory Lane Video was perhaps one of the poorest I've ever met. . The sound was terrible and scratched and the print was very white and there was a lot of torn film and gaps.
