I can't believe the positive reaction of this movie. I had great expectations and disappointed. First they used every cheese competition in the book. It was so predictable. For example, from another second, a young Latino boy showed that you knew he would be a nice guy because he looked like a gangbanger. Matt Dillon's character has been played a million times, a policeman who has been tempered over the years and would see some light at the end of the film. Predictability with these characters hardly ended. A weak script wasted phenomenal casting. The story of morality was PC max. There were a couple of clever twists, but not nearly enough. Dialogue was sometimes embarrassing. It wasn't all bad. I just can't believe these movies are very scores so far. It was somewhat fun, just a little offensive to their intelligence. I admire what this film was trying to achieve, but it fell well.
