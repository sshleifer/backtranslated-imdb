In the dusty town of Furlough, Texas, the animal kills cattle and locals. When a teenager Tommy (Michael Carreo) is killed, their friends Anna Furlough (Erika Fay), his Mexican-American boyfriend Miguel Gonzalez (Gabriel Gutierrez), Jill Gillespie (Sara Erikson) and Rosie (Martine Hughes) find that the Mexican werewolf Chupacabra is a killer and they are drawing a plan to kill the beast. <br /> <br /> "Mexican werewolf in Texas" is an amateur crap and worse films I've ever seen, if not the worst. Nothing happens in this film: the scenario is ridiculous, some of the most terrible features I've ever heard. There is no direction and the camera follows the "style" of the "Blair Witch Project". Amateur activity seems to be a dog in high school and high school games. "Special Effects" are harsh and extremely poor, and "werewolf" is the cheapest I've ever seen. Ed Wood's films are cultic, but this "Mexican werewolf in Texas" is pure rubbish. Finally, Jill says that no person can resist their chicks (in fact, this is the most beautiful thing about flick). But I believe that the right quote should be "no man (or woman) can look at this movie until the end." I was motivated by my curiosity to see how bad a movie is and I lost my life for 88 minutes, but I believe most viewers don't see less than 20 minutes of work. My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Lobisomen Mexicano no Texas" ("Mexican Werewolf Texas")
