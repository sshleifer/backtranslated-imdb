I bought this movie without seeing the sci-fi convention and I got what I do to do something so stupid. Simply put, this film is unlikely, boring and unobtrusive. <br /> <br /> I was so bored and nasty when there was no plot development so I turned it off to see the repetition of the tops. I understand that it was a very small budget, or at least it seemed to be a very small budget, but it does not relieve terrible action, terrible plot and even worse camera work. It seems that a group of college students made classes and drunk. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the villain was not so ridiculous and the plot was something that could actually happen in real life, law enforcement can be so bad that it is funny. This movie is not funny, it's just bad.
