The 1980s was definitely a year of bad films. "Friday the 13th" and "Burning" might have been the best, but there were as always a couple of stinkers that aren't far behind, like "Don't go alone in the forest" and that. But in all justice, "Prey" is not nearly as bad as "Don't go into the woods", but it's not great either. One thing is that it is just boring and action is not very good, but much better than "DGITW" and this movie actually has some attractive looking women to watch, all three female executives were stunning. One thing that is all about this nonsense wildlife image that just seemed pointless and it seemed that the director used it just to fill some time. <br /> <br /> So what was that movie there? Well, there were some laughing loud cheeses - I couldn't contain a strangle when the last girl made a strange upside-down walk away from the kid and there were some good kill scenes - my favorites who are a sleeping girl with a sleeping bag; First of all, Prey is stupid, boring, and the killer I wasn't scary at all could have been much better.
