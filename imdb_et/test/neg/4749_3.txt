I was only fourteen when I first saw Alien movies and I immediately liked it. Original, terrible and classic. Sigourney Weaver was the perfect choice for the character of a female hero and would have earned her statue for her act. In 1979, something eternal was born as the immortal series continued to produce something less legendary than the first. Alien3 was different, but I think this part was the most stressful and unique, it was my favorite. Unfortunately, the last failure was in many ways. It was tense, illogical, full of meaningless massacres. I didn't like it at all, but I never thought it would be a worse part in the future. As it turned out in 2004, I was wrong. Alien vs Predator was a bad break and should have been led by a more talented director or not at all. But when I saw Alien vs Predator Requiem, I was totally shocked and destroyed. When I sat down and decided to look at it undoubtedly, even though I never thought that such a bad movie could be done. Without a scenario, without a director and without actors, I don't understand how to make a movie. Because this movie ignores these three terms. What you get is a beautiful massacre that is not a story, but with a lot of tedious and boring dialogue. Waste of money and waste of time. This film is quite uncertain as to the glory of fans on both sides (Alien / Predator). Shame!
