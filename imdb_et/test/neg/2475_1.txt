What's wrong with American movies these days? Hollyweird makes films that men like women and men like men. The idiotic man leader and writer of this film must look at his head. The main problems of this film are his apparent extreme feminist images of sex. <br /> <br /> Eva Mendez and her friend from beer bottles go to the bar scenes, as you can find at the sailor's oil tanker at the Icelandic bar. Mendez is always able to see every girl she sees. She also provokes provocatively in every scene, but she cries like a man. She becomes very emotional when she fights with Will Smith for a while, trying to "protect" all women from bad guys everywhere. What we see is a number of idiots that try to make a date to win. The men of this film are engaged in sexual advancement or lack of talk when a woman is face to face. Men in real life do not behave like this. <br /> <br /> What we see in this movie is a cultural product that is frightened. Everything is folded. Boys act like girls, girls act like boys. All this is done by keeping the sexes' extreme predispositions very important to the story. Men are shown to be soft and stupid, but mostly they are interested in sex, while women are shown as mass and overflow, but only as plywood for emotional uncertainty. <br /> <br /> This movie would be good if it wasn't horribly presented to the audience. Content is not the culprit. This is the way content is presented.
