The forbidden film by Nico Mastorakis was, in my opinion, quite disappointing. The film has a couple going to the Greek island to kill all the perverted people (probably). You know you have something quite sick when one of the first scenes contains a man who has a goat and then kills it. <br /> <br /> But things are getting worse from that point on, as all scenes are pretty similar. They meet some people to kill or have sex with them (preferably both). <br /> <br /> The end is OK, when a couple turns out to be a brother and a sister, and he just lets him get rotten somewhere, but generally he would have waited more. There is no substance I am afraid of. <br /> <br /> 3/10
