I saw this movie in LA as premiere. I think I laughed 2 or 3 times. The rest of the time I was in shock when ridiculous / badly shot and badly written. Kirby is actually the only rescue arm in the movie. I was disappointed with the performance of Larry Bagby, who I usually entertained. If you like to watch your friend's funny homemade short films they took with their mother's 8mm camcorder, this movie is a very small chance. Then again, part of what makes these movies enjoyable is that your friends play all the parts. You don't know these people, so you probably find it as numb and stupid as I did. Dear Mr Nelson, go back to film study, practice some time PA or grip or some low level work so you can see how things are done properly in the movie. Then look for as long as you need to find a photographer's director who knows what f. stop, make sure he has an ND filter in his hand. Then try again. Repeat as many times as necessary.
