This is the only unusual thing I've ever seen. It's sad how he's trying to make such a hard joke and everything he does is a curse and thinks his nasty vulgarity is funny. He's the bitterest person I've ever seen. His whole act of trying to show how much he does not care, and that it only shows how much he is angry with the critics and the people who have any taste and sense of humor who tend to go through tremendous torture when they look at him. ". There are good comedies, bad and terrible. But this guy is in his own league. I know him and even more people who are funny to him.
