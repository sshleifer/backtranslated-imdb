In addition to being a liar, he is also a complete idiot and thief in comedy community. Once, when I tried to show this apology on television, I believe I did little in my mouth. I can't help but feel a little clumsy every time I see one of his terrible ads, while I enjoy great comedy programs like Reno 911 and the American body shop. It shows what makes me worried about the constant existence of humanity. It is hard to believe that even Joe Rogan can seem like a moor. Please start praying now when the center of comedy understands your mistake and finishes this exhibition as soon as possible. Have we not suffered enough?
