This film reminds me of Harry Potter - not a style but a marketing strategy. There may be a second part, a third part ... up to one day when the product's life cycle ends, of course, provided that this part is a commercial success. so many things seem to be hidden and so the story is quite incomplete. action is boring. the set design is ok but not good. or Edison Chen would be one big star. In fact, she even feels charming on a big screen. The most impressive is Anthony Wong. 4/10 <br /> <br />
