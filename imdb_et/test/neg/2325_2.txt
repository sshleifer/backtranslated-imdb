Most of the comments on this movie are positive, so I thought I'd try to improve the balance. I came out of this movie, wondering what's going on. I know now and I think it's a bad film. I started with a queue of dreams that seemed too obvious. I was glad that I had a free ticket for the film or I would have asked for my money back. Film directors and critics love this movie, which only assures me that most of them are more intelligent than watching the audience can enjoy the movie. The rating of this movie 8+ is so misleading. Twenty years after this film, no real prizes like the godfather are compared. The film has fine performances from both shades, but it is not enough to record a movie. (also no lesbian scenes!)
