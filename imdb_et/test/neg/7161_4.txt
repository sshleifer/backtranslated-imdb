After the book I was very sad while watching the movie. I agree that sometimes the film should be different from the original novel, but in that case it was more than acceptable. Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Why the ranks are different (eg Sergeant Diester instead of Sergeant, etc.) <br /> <br /> 2) The last screen is very bad and the Diester soldier who sets himself up and wants to die. But this does not apply to 100%. Just read the book. He was also a bull dog in the last few seconds. He didn't want to die to crush his gun and just walked toward Michael & Noah. So it's a happy ending that doesn't fit at all for this movie.
