Mickey Rourke is currently a Renaissance ... and a fair game. I always liked his picture and his ability at a price like Angel Heart and Johnny Handsome. You know what you get with Rourke - average, mood, dirty. But this movie gives you a lot more - and you don't want it anymore. <br /> <br /> First of all - this is not just a point. Rourke is a hardened IRA killer who, after killing schoolchildren, flees from Ireland to London. He's been running from the police and his military comrades. He has also promised never to kill. It seems like he was busy with the kids, he finally made him. <br /> <br /> But when he arrives in London, he is monitored by a local mobster (Bates - like his eyebrows and hair straight down) - burtones his main competitor for £ 50,000 and a boat trip to the US. Rourke agrees reluctantly to do so, but the priest (Hoskins) sees it and confesses to him in a confession to keep the priest's mouth closed. He thinks it's better than killing him. <br /> <br /> There are many things that just don't add: 1. Why choose Rourke for your competition? As illustrated by a scene where an employee pair a wall with a couple of weights that looks like awls - these London boys are anyway strong enough to make their own killing. 2. Not only that, but Mobster gets the guy to follow Rourke and witness the killing with his own eyes. Why didn't this man just kill a competitor and save all the troubles in handling Rourke? 3. Hoskins sees the murder taking place and the police let him go without protection, can I add - to admit? Not possible. 4. Rourke hangs around the church (shortly after he murdered) to get a certificate right after the crime. Why haven't the police checked the place? 5. Rourke hangs around the church and especially the dark brothers of Hoskin, a few days later, without disturbing anyone. What? He's been running and he's staying where he made another murder? Stupid. The 6th police officers meet with Rourke in the church to "confirm the organ" and do not know who he is. Don't they know he's in a school bus bombing? They don't even control him? 7. Why would Rourke kill you and then tell him to wait a few days for the boat to go? You think you want to get rid of him right away. Or kill him. One or the other? 8. Why does Bates's brother suddenly decide to rape the blind man in the midst of all expectations? Couldn't he limit himself for a few days? At least until Rourke has attacked the country safely? It's ridiculous. 9. Rourke suddenly has internal instability after all his years of killing, and wins the blind person immediately - even after he knows he is a killer, he still loves him? Again - totally ridiculous. And in addition - he falls in record time with him "in love" - ​​a few days !!!! 10. The whole bomb is simply silly from the point of view of Bates. 11. Things happen in parts of the movie that are simply not reasonable or are just there to help the story (and I say that passage). Bates' houses Rourke whore until the boat is ready to go, and Rourke suddenly shows the moral height in the house to honor the whore - but still loses a dark girl. 12. Rourke asks the ship where Bates is - a henchman, and the handler practically practices his entire boss's movement in less than 10 seconds. It was embarrassing - the man told Rourke much more than he even asked. 13. The Hoskin Priest is a former army boy and we see that he beat three competitors behind the pub. Fully forced and another worthy scene. <br /> <br /> I stop there at the unlucky 13, not mentioning Rourke's hair (so red that it is ridiculous), his accent (which is fair) is sometimes not too bad, but worsens somehow the mumbo mummy at other times), his clothes, a walk, a look at the sky, etc. I also don't mention music and dirty editing style. <br /> <br /> Oooppps - I just mentioned them. <br /> <br /> In summary, a movie disaster that has some obvious religious images (on the Rourke Cross, preaching from the pulpit) that would disgrace a first-year film student who is never a star and director. <br /> <br /> 4/10
