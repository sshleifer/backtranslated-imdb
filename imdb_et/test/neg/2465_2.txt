too predictable for spoilers, but I'm not under control, so don't read it when you care. . So let's start with all the crimes requested by France ... it doesn't matter what he's done, we think about it later (they're not). a few seconds, but not too much, and something unexpected because it requires Art. half an hour needed to finish the movie; I get it: let them rob the jeweler and take a lot of time, avoiding interference, etc .; all the robbers jewelers in such films, it is related to work (it is not). no humor, no character (ok, yves montand starts to fire it nice) and let everyone talk in a quiet cavity that should think of the dude, but just put the actors down. if they are quiet, they will become unknown - but also save us by writing their own line. we'd better add something to stay home with women who are going to watch this stuff, so let's do something that makes them mommy (we forgot to put women in the movie). I got this: son of marijuana - oh, and try to commit suicide for some particular reason (shame? his father is the mafia leader who cried out loud, but the audience knows his father's care, and if not, sticks to them). Oh, the curvy cop was the boy's classmate who finally ended up with him; maybe? Let them all die at the end or we will never end this stuff. is it possible? right, it's over, thanks to god. who are we leading?
