Rita Hayworth plays a Brooklyn nightclub dancer named Rusty, who specializes in cheesecake crust; he succeeds on the cover of a national fashion magazine, but his upcoming solo (with romantic offers) has been beaten by the boss Gene Kelly. A terribly tired piece of Technicolor cotton candy with unmodified musical sketches (the two worst of which are the setbacks of the 1890s where Hayworth portrayed his grandmother). Kelly, as always, dances well, but works with wrong sincerity; if he is serious, he is intolerable and the rest of the time he is driving adrenaline. Script is a leading weight, not even for supporters of Phil Silvers and Eve Arden. * 1/2 from ****
