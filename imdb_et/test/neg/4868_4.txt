My taking: a routine political thriller with mediocre activities and predictable twists. The rarely seen political thriller, which did a very bad post office response, I was able to catch up with SHADOW CONSPIRACY and I was happy that I was pleased to see this rarely seen film, I didn't really know that movie. Given that SHADOW CONSPIRACY does not respond to how the critics and the public responded to it, SHADOW CONSPIRACY is still not that bad, but it is still not very good to start and everything, from script to routing, is quite predictable. Charlie Sheen plays a presidential assistant who finds herself in the assassins and pursuits (many of them) when she discovers a deadly conspiracy from the White White House employees. After the assassination of the professor, Sheen helps Amanda Givens (former Linda Hamilton), a former flame reporter, to uncover the betrayal and open the title conspiracy. <br /> <br /> But this script, written by Adi Hasak and Ric Gibbs, is a pedestrian as they come, not very different from other White House conspiracy thrillers such as ABSOLUTE POWER and MURDER AT 1600. Some remarkable talents (Donald Sutherland Ben Gazzara and Stephen Lang) try their best routine script, but rarely save it from the predictability of the script. Not to mention the ridiculous scene that includes a game helicopter that seems too thin and inappropriate in this "serious" political thriller. SHADOW CONSPIRACY has its own moments I'm sure some of them are much underestimated (director George Pan Cosmatos earns some decent chasing scenes), but none of them raises this routine thriller that doesn't have much profit or surprises. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** 5 out of 5
