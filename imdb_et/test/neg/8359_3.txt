There is a lot of background information left in the movie. In fact, the film, Lizzy, didn't even show depression. She just seemed like a girl who went under control when she finally came to college, mostly by taking drugs and alcohol. It seemed to be his problem, not a mental illness. Of course, he had emotional problems because his father left and barely saw him as a baby, and his mother seemed to be out there. But how he treated Noah and Ruby was just a thought and I don't think it is caused by depression. He was very necessary to run Rafe, but he was like his father. <br /> <br /> But I think the main reason why this movie has never come to the theater is that it is not enough. and the story is not well written. <br /> <br /> END VERDIKT: Really, I would recommend it only if you are interested in seeing Ricci's first naked scene. Otherwise it is not very interesting.
