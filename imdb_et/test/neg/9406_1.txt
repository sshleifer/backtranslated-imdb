Second entry from Pacino-As-Mentor sub music. You know that a cage: a young hotshot hysterical mistake (in this case Matthew McConaughey, trying to jump start a career, pulling that Pacino coillail - hey, it worked for Keanu and Colin, isn't it?) \ T natch). Young Hotshot learns from his father's drawing on the inputs of all profitable but degrading careers (this time with football). Father draws Young Hotshot with money and whores and power, but we all know that this decadent situation is in a collision course with scattered and desperate. . . that is, until Young Hotshot finds his moral center, leaving the Father's drawing and everything or almost everything that he stands for. (It is clear that Stone's * Wall Street * pretty much set Pacino-As-Mentor's basic music rules.) <br /> <br /> We also plan to take these last-day Pacino films in parallel with reality. Again, you know the exercise: Living-Legend Actor shows its undisputed superiority over Inferior Young Actor. The latter can carry it out and hurt it, but it has to admit that it does not intend to get any good line, much less the chance to chew a larger landscape before it is suppressed. Now it has to be said that the Pacino-As-Mentor canon actually has two good films: * Woman * and * Donnie Brasco *. In the first case it was still one man; in the latter case, Pacino Johnny Depp met his scene-stealer. But these two films were seriously meaningful, not just training for showboating. Pacino is confident that his younger co-stars are in the film because * Brasco * is not as charismatic as Depp. By the way, none of this speaks very well of Living-Legend Actor. Like his modern De Niro, Pacino has spent the last 10 or 15 years on his laurels. * Two for the Money * is even the worst example, which is even worse than * Devil's Advocate *, which had at least the virtues of Connie Nielsen and chronologically before that movie. Well, this happens when you've crowned the king too early - just ask Marlon Brando. Frankly, I have seen one of Al Pacino's films that have the same plot - and the same letter - to be more charitable. Did I say "none of this is good"? In fact, it is humiliating for all involved, including the paying audience. No one is going to blame Matthew McConaughey for Shakespeare's actor, but even he doesn't deserve the role of another violin for this intolerable old show, plus he, McConaughey, never understands the size of This is Al. <br /> <br /> I haven't wasted space in the plot details. If you want a summary, IMDb will give you a summary that doesn't make sense, even though I think I presented a rather comprehensive summary in my opening section. Basically you've seen this movie before. Many times. * Two "For Money" is a special world of sports disorders (indeed the underworld). Pacino manages the "bet advisers" office, ie the intermediaries between you and your bookie, and even the cable handicapping show hosted by several of his tops. One thing that succeeded in the film was the exaggeration of these exhibitions. . . but one detail they died wrong was the constant use of the words "gambling" and "gambling". If you have ever seen ProLine or other examples of similar illusions, NEVER hear Jim Feist and his cohort "luck". They ask you to call your 1-900 numbers to get your picks. . . but if you were from, you would say, from Mars, you have no idea what you should do with their saints. "Gamble" is an F-word for sports-disabled TV shows - strictly verboten. <br /> <br /> Gambling is against the law. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10.
