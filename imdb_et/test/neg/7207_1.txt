Previously, video distributors such as Sub Rosa and Brain Damage Films would release low-budget video-video-horror films to the selected gorehound market that ate them high. This is acceptable to me because you saw these movies miles away with their dirty boxes and cheesy titles. <br /> <br /> Now, we have a Lions gate in the mix, but they have decided to be better at poor hats by placing it in a "professional" look and loading the same price as one of their higher budgeted professionally made features. Don't suckered it in! This is where you have seen Dark Harvest 1 or 2 if you already know what to expect with 3, but there is a place for such movies and it's not on the professionally designed features on the video shelf. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of independent cinema and I've been watching several low budget videos that are still worth renting, but it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. "Functioning" (if you call it) was exhausting. It was a terrible line of fun to read a minute or two, but eventually it took too much and was unbearable. The story is bad, dialogue is worse, somehow worse. The only possible sustainable scar, if it were, would be one devastating scene that still manages to be terrible, but it is an award winning effect compared to a blood cleavage after a girl has hit or a dummy. <br /> <br /> It took me three attempts to make it through this movie and I did it just because I paid good money for it and I felt that I should finish it at least to the end. Stay away - stay far, far from it.
