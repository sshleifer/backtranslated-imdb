Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive, I am reminded that it was a trailer, not a cartel. <br /> <br /> A movie theme that focuses on the video I play, what was counted as a crowd kill nation, and eternal living is acceptable. <br /> <br /> First of all, a pretty bad horror movie, blood looks more or less induced (common rumors), these scenes are bleed, they're worse. <br But really (really) that bad is this movie, very, very, bad, but bad in all aspects. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie to anyone, trailer well, movie bad. <br /> <br /> I'm not doing (as they do) spending (consuming) money and time on making these useless movies and too bad.
