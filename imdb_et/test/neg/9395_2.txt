This film was totally unhealthy, disturbing and dissatisfied. In addition to some pleasant Italian pictures, there is nothing to suggest. As usual, Hollywood draws the wrong conclusion from a broken existence - the meeting with which the courts with which you sleep after a few hours of knowledge must be Mr. As far as humor is concerned, there are some in the movie, but I don't see how anyone could mark this romantic _commy_ because about three-quarters of the movie is totally depressing! My recommendation? Leave it in the theater, wait for it to appear on the DVD, and skip it from there. I want someone to give me two hours, which I wasted, watching this drecki, drivel, throttle.
