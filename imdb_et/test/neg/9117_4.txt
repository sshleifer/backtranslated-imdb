Critics were like "a movie that breaks your heart" and so on. So my friend and I had great expectations when we decided to watch this movie. to write about its content with others. This movie is trying to get you to the heart. But it won't work. At least for me. And for my friend. <br /> <br /> All that happened was just on the screen. It was always there, not HERE where I am. I thought most of the time "hmm, something is happening on the screen, but it's just on the screen. It's not real." (1983), Jerry Maguire (1996), Babe (1995), Man without a Past (2002)
