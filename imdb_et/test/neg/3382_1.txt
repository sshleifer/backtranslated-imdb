Okay, so when my friend told me he should direct MM2 and MM3, I thought I had to check Monster Man and see what it was, maybe I'll get some of it, but if I get it its part, but when i jumped it on my dvd player and tried to empty the first 45 minutes, but not bad, bad i mean terribly annoying bad comedy who thinks he's funny to talk about how the director spent meaningless desert ride, I can conclude that these men had no idea what they did and missed the boat with a long shot. The story might have been somewhat different from the usual BS you see on the Blockbuster / Hollywood videotape, which the Lions gates put out these days, but they certainly confused it. Why put so much time and effort into shooting annoying bad and bad jokes, why not shorten your journey and put more plot in the movie. Writing Myabe was so bad that they had to cut out a lot of the movie or maybe the director didn't have enough fear and whore to shoot, so they had to find a filler to do the usual 84 minutes? All in all, and here I am easy, maybe because my friend is a naked reddish bar scene that can break the skull when they lead to three streets, I give it at least one star while trying and gore / kill scenes were not so bad again they tried. Too bad could have been the Lions Gate to create a cool franchise for this idea but failed. I don't recommend paying this rent. Maybe you will find a truncated version where the movie starts from the rocker scene. CRAP!
