This is one of those religious horror films that never explains why "evil" forces are 10,000 times stronger than "good". We have a satanic cult here that can: 1) kill people (like "Star Trek"), 2) through small children's toys, 3) transfer the soul from one body to another, 4) telepathically hypnotize at a greater distance, and 5) cause drastic car accidents individuals become spaghetti, while others (in this case children) remain impatient. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "good" can: 1) sit helplessly, 2) be married, 3) panic, 4) laugh hysterically, 5) waste time, doing something, 6) read comics while dozens of people kill, and 7) arrive too late for Satanic rituals. <br /> <br /> In every religious horror movie, I have to assume that the world of this movie is home to God and Satan. I also have to assume that Satan cannot be 1,000,000 times more powerful if the film does not have a world mark that resembles hell. In other words, where were the priests of that film who knew something? The best thing this film priest could do is to think that there are some witches - nothing else - from reading these books in their study. At first glance, the priest becomes catatonic, then laughs hysterically, but ends up with a big panic attack. So should it be God's contribution to fighting Satan? It's ridiculous. Every good religious horror film has "good" powers that have some (more or less) supernatural power or at least some specific knowledge to fight "evil". In this sense, this film is quite idiotic. Like casting a prison at Martin for the High Priest of the cult (!). There is very little danger or fear of how exclusive Martin is a satanic ritual. I wasn't supposed to be Christopher Lee or Langhella, but wouldn't they have found someone less funny? Also, why do a couple go back to town after they leave their car races? After a "friendly" meeting with the city people, no reasonable person would have gone back; they should have just moved on. The man's explanation for his girlfriend (and viewer) is that "who knows what is in that direction".
