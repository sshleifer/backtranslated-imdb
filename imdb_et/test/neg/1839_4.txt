This relatively embedded Hong Kong "minority" is the perfect island movie movie age peeping toms (at least its first half). Every structure, every scene, every sequence is an excuse to look for a girl's skirt, stare at her chest, look at her bottom and write her tight foot. What it is, of course, is the perverse tendencies of the leader figure! (!) <br /> <br /> Genre stalwart Anthony Wong is a marginally perverted married man suffering from erotic dreams and outrageous fantasies. All involved are little clad, sexy Chinese women who have not only sexual servitude. <br /> <br /> The plot is thickened with a murder sub-block, voodoo doll-racking, and little rape and defeat. <br /> <br Some sex scenes are quite hot and gore is liberal, but the supernatural elements on the other side feel half-baked and plot developments are ridiculous. Wong Jing went terribly fast to get in and out of the theater.
