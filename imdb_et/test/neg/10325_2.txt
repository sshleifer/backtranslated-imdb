I'll give him 2 - I'll reserve 1 rating for Guy Ritchie and Woody Allen. We don't even remember what that movie was. The only thing we remember is one point where the actors fall to the ground, roll to the other side of the corridor, or something and then back up. It was like watching 80-year-olds with 2 broken legs trying to "stunte". Even when characters in the truck were driving, the noise of the engine (or the radio? Do not remember) would disappear when the actors speak. <br /> <br /> And like others, we bought it for Sandra Bullock's front cover. very sad, very bad.
