As a writing teacher, there are two endings that I do not allow my students to use: "Then I woke up" and "Then I went over the truck." I add now: "Then I got on the head." I think it's totally unfair to use these tricks to cover the lack of imagination. The whole issue of migration could have been behaved with some intelligence and craft, but in this film they couldn't do it or not. I am not saying that it is completely worthless, but it is so predictable in its progress, except for the stupid end. There are even gangsters who go to the police to get help from this man. They should have done it right now. It's just a forgotten, restrictive horror / sci fi movie that has nothing new to offer.
