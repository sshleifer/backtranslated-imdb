I was expecting it to be fun and the best was mediocre, the only funny character, believe it or not. Andy Dick. The timing was just terrible in most jokes and gags, and writing was bad, I mean, I know it should be like a blaxploitation, but it just worked. Apart from this whole genre has already been killed by death, all the worship powers of films and secret brother, it just seems old, it also just seems to rip off the bottom of the secret (which also was not hysterical but much more fun than that). The comedy / action film was also a direction that was blissful. I don't know if it is in theaters, but it's for television.
