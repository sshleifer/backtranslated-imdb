This is another of Hollywood's anti-Communist policies of the 1950s. Stalwart American Gene Barry, lovely English woman Valerie French, and three more are kidnapped by an alien and are given fantastic - and fantastically vague - power. What do the crops do with such power? Toss it into the sea or use it to destroy all humanity? Anyone who knows American cinema in 1957 knows the answer the communities are doing, but the story becomes mature when the Americans actually test things in the middle. Then one scientist who has the ultimate power in the universe will appear with his theory and use it! His fragrant attitude later is nausea and the cheerful behavior of all others is terrible. <br /> <br /> Here's the spoiler of this dog: the capsules inside the capsules have a mathematical code that tells the profile that they will only kill. Entrusted Freedom Enemies! That's right - don't worry about the ethical compromise that everyone kills that alien's pill decides the enemy of freedom; just do it! Cheers! No candy! Stupid wife - and you threw in the sea! Ha ha! Kiss me dear!
