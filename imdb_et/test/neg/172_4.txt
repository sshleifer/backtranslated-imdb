As noted in other comments here, the camera's work is ridiculously bad. I am tempted to say that the photographer's director is 7 years old, but it would be average - up to 7 years old. <br /> <br /> All right, but what about it? I was looking for some overview of the state of the wine industry around the world, Mondovino. The film is a very narrow view of one intrigue in this world: the fight between Mondavi and the French and Italian wine producers they would like to buy. There is no enlightening narrative that would put the whole context of the transaction, so we leave the director's selective process and interviews with different little psychodrama characters. There are no despicable characters or even despicable dogs. However, there is a lack of uniformity. <br /> <br /> Is the director a marquee? I thought when I tried to maintain some focus similarity when the camera approached, narrowing, chaoticly flourishing. Little breeder in France: good. Huge breeder in the US: very, very bad. Forget hundreds of small wine producers across North America, Australia and South America. There's a dead horse that beats here for over two hours. <br /> <br /> To learn more about the intrigue, it's better to read it elsewhere. And you can try your favorite wine samples if you don't know it. <br /> <br /> In Cannes, I recommend the best American bashing Diatribe award.
