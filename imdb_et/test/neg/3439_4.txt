You'll get an hour and a half of the Braindead that I have to save the world, one liner and a woman somewhere in the equation. This time he plays a man who helps people in the witness protection program. quote a movie cover. He will erase his past to save his future. Woppi, it's gotta be cool :) I bet the younger people like it, but it's a bit like my taste. And one liner really is something else and I don't want it in a good way. After killing the crocodile, he can say. "You're Baggage" If you have the right mood, you can enjoy the movie. And when the braindead's action goes, it's not very bad. But just before the movie starts, you know exactly what is going to happen. But if you like such movies, you probably enjoy it. I appreciate this movie 4
