I'm a fan of Boorman, but it is undoubtedly his least successful film. Comedy has never been his strong costume, and here his attempts to screw a farce are cumbersome. However, it is almost worth the talent in Boorman's eyes: it is one of Uma Thurman's first major role groups and, as always, he is fascinating to watch. (On the Kurbil side, Boorman marked the script with his daughter Telsche, who died a few years ago.)
