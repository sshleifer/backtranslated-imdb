Jason Lee is making a short promise of this dog film, but it is not enough to distinguish it from any other unpleasant family comedy. This live-action, CG-enhanced adventure sees a shamed police dog (Jason Lee) turned into a super-dog accident through a schematic scholar Dr. Simon Barsinister (Peter Dinklage) in the laboratory. Underdog creates a city to save while trying to keep its identity secret - a challenge given that it can both speak and fly. The odd gag raises the smile, but Underdog's human tie (James Belushi and Alex Neuberger like father and son) is as dull as the predictable story. One of the kids too young to see Superman. Or Spider-Man. Or even Shaggy Dog?
