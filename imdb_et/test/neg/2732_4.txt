"The Core" refers to "Crack in the World" (1965 TV). Action is a stock that is predictable. If you subtract all of the plot "The Core" - basically a manned drilling machine - then you will get the plot "Crack in the World". "Crack" was a really great film starring Dana Andrews. His team of scientists, who worked in South Africa, drilled underground and "knocks out" a nuclear facility to ensure a sustainable source of geothermal energy. One of his subordinates, as well as a great scientist, disagrees. He believes that a blast will not drill a simple hole, but will form crust cracks. (Possible spoiler) He's right. In order to put an end to the resulting crack in the destruction of land, they have to put another nuclear device on the burst. <br /> <br /> Although I've placed a spoiler warning, I don't know if I've really broken any movie. And since "Crack in the World" is only rarely available in VHS format, if at all, my decision not to show whether backlinks are probably academic. <br /> <br /> Overall, I appreciate all the humiliation is just below average.
