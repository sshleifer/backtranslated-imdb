Perhaps it is unfair not to like the film, what it is not, but what it is, but I approached the hope that the filmmaker will finally make a film about gays and women in small towns. Instead, it focuses primarily on the calls of the local population (and the big news from the outermost regions!) For major disasters and the real torture / murder of a young gay man. <br /> <br /> So much time is devoted to fools attacking AIDS, sin, hell and pervert. So much time was devoted to the spiritual preacher who talks about the Bible and the gays they deserve. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see more people coming to the "small town gay bar", not the ones who were against. In addition, the murdered young man is not even from this city. <br /> <br /> The whole movie works as a warning rather than a flag, and it's very suspicious.
