Razor Blade Smile has an interesting title and a leading role. Now most may not like this movie plot and the action was a bit cheap but it is a complaint about the movie like Razor Blade Smile. In a sense, it was a bad film. <br /> <br /> But when you look through this movie to the end, you'll see that it's like I said that a cheap vampire tends to have a little humor. (It is also very interesting how these colors manipulated some scenes.) <br /> <br /> So this movie is ultimately the type you rent and laugh with your friends and enjoy what it is. Because no movie is too bad. <br /> <br /> Like Lilith Silver says, "People just don't smile enough ..."
