This is a fairy tale too far away. Enchanted Cottage offers Dorothy McGuire a "terribly ugly" spinster and Robert Young as a sham pilot. A short story: Scarface marries Spinster, after which their love of beautiful (lighting, cosmetics and the removal of counterfeit scars) makes the beautiful people a magical change that they attribute to the snow living in a seaside house. has been a honeymooners of generations residence. <br /> <br /> When the story stops there, fine; it would be a proverb message: beauty is in the eyes of the viewer. But it strikes, reaching reality. When Mr. and Mrs. Scarface greet their public, they have a painful shock that they are still home. You see, they look beautiful to each other? The situation that the audience is well prepared for is because all the secondary characters have sermonized that disadvantaged people really need to lower their expectations and find other ways to stay happy. You know. Take your hobbies. Spinster, for example, makes a tree cut. Scarface weighs the collection of driftwood. <br /> <br /> The original playwright (Arthur Wing Pinero) and filmmakers believe in human nature. Their message is: you are either ugly or beautiful and no real person loves ugly. Worse still, ugly people probably need to imagine their lovers beautiful. Reality just doesn't. <br /> <br /> One wonders what Elaine Mason saw every day she looked at her husband, Stephen Hawking.
