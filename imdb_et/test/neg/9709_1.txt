This movie is one of the worst adaptations of pride and prejudice that has ever been filmed and when Jane Austen was alive she demanded that her name be removed from the movie. Austen's novel is only superficially about the evolution of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. This is also a comment on the class structure of Regency Britain. This film focuses only on the love story, which is a disappointment for the viewers who hoped to get the novel right. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with the historical accuracy of the movie. The film has a dance where Darcy slips into Elizabeth, not the gentleman's dance, which includes Bennet, Lucas, Bingley and Darcy families, but rather dancing lower classes. The gentleman would not have danced as if they were dancing peasants. There are also costume and hair problems. The practice of the period demanded that married women wear white hats and women on the outside of the hoods to cover their hair. Women in the Regency period were not so free that they abandoned publicly the hood requirements. The worst historical inaccuracy is Elizabeth's early morning meeting (her night and coat) and Mr Darcy (sans cravat and vest), where they admit their love for each other. It is an unforgettable freedom with the novel. No venerable young woman or gentleman would be out of the door in such a dressing position, nor did she try to meet someone with the opposite sex this morning. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is the link between Austen's dialogue and the frightening modern dialogue. Austen's dialogue doesn't need help from a writer who thinks he can write like Austen. The author of the non-Austen dialogue has not only Austen's talents, but also does not know Austen's style. The juxtaposition of the two styles is dirty. <br /> <br /> For the actors, Judi Dench is the best who clearly understands the necessity of aristocracy. Brenda Blethyn takes some liberties to frighten Mrs Bennet when portraying Austen. His portrayal is interesting and seems to work. Donald Sutherland has failed. His influenced British accent is terrible and he depicts Bennet too much than his 20th century father and not his late 18th century father. Matthew MacFadey's imagination Darcyst is flat. I can't imagine anyone falling in love with his Mr Darcy. Keira Knightly is pretty Elizabeth, but her idea of ​​Elizabeth Bennet is too modern. The knight focuses on Elizabeth's honesty, but his depiction has no full understanding of the social aspects and conventions of time. He would have actually wanted to read the novel before depicting Elizabeth and studying women's behavior during this period. <br /> <br /> If you make a period movie, it must be the right time. This movie needed a historical advisor who really knows something about the Regency period. It also needed a writer who understands and understands Austen's text. I only hope that Emma Thompson will decide to make a film of pride and prejudice in the near future in order to erase this nonsense from our minds. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is that it contains many beautiful scenes in English. Chatsworth is well used by Pemberlyna (as it was during the 1995 BBC adaptation). But beautiful scenery and beautiful actors cannot record this movie. Austen's real fans are rushing to watch their DVDs, which are much higher than the 1995 BBC production with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, or read Austen's text to wipe this version out of their thoughts.
