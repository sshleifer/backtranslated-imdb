The film tells you that you are conscious and conscientious. It also destroys everything and everything the Bible claims to be true. For my similar people, the first episode was interesting and the other was catastrophic. It's called "blasphemy," and that's when you're a believer. It is sad to hear that many people think this is a good continuation of the Bible. However, the film shows a lot of things and topics that can be interpreted as a film version of "revelation". Some of us think that such things should not be abused. One good movie in the film is that it strongly encourages ethical awareness and makes you double-count your activities. The director just seems to forget that some people are already acting so that they rely only on believing and loving the Bible ... Why try to change it if you are not the devil?
