It's a disgrace that they didn't trust the original enough. <br /> <br /> RoboCop 2, however, takes the originals with great ideas, imagination and character and replaces them with all the stereotypes that follow-up offers. <br /> <br /> The original ad was cute, and so was the next scene (resembling the "Boys and Dolls"!), but aside from this and the letter of thought there is one movie that is slow, dirty slipping somewhere in the middle . br /> <br /> Ideas are introduced, then dropped, interesting original characters don't get any screen time here, most of the new characters (Cain, Juliette Faxx) are so boring that they don't hold off the movie and then there's a tone. <br /> <br /> From a happy start, Paul Verhoeven knew how to direct an attitude where, when you pull a good pulse comic attitude and sensitivity, even the most repugnant violence would be fun. Kershner (although he led the "Star Wars" sequel) is not. And the scene after the scene makes you brighter, look or just tune. <br /> <br /> And what about RoboCop? He should be the main thing here, right? But there are all the scenes in which she doesn't even see, and what scenes she's so half-minded and trembling that you don't know or care if she's a partial human or partial cyber - because she's bored <br /> <br /> I've never seen such a rapid fall of grace. Why does Hollywood make such a bad queue? On purpose? Why; did the filmmakers make a bet? <br /> <br /> Only one star for "RoboCop 2"; FX is good, but the story doesn't even try to match them.
