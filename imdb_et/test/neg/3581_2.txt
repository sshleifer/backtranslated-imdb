I don't know what happened to driver Abel Ferrara. From the "Body Snatchers" remake, he seems to have lost it. "The King of New York" and "The Lieutenant Lieutenant" remain the best films of the eighties: exploiting ten years of wrong accusations. With films such as "R Xmas" (whatever it means) and "New Rose Hotel", he seems to have chosen to attract and support former supporters. This film has no life. Although he achieves great performances in his projects in all his projects, the impact of his ideas is not just a result. Whatever the idea is, the drug dealer's new breed is more or less the same as any other middle class new Yawkuh - it will be lost in the stunning script and the boring direction. <br /> <br /> I saw this opening night at the 4-Plex in downtown LA. In the lobby, I was surprised when I bought tickets, and I saw it filled with a large, racially mixed group of men and women. their twenties and thirties. Then they started in the theater, but it was a theater with "8 miles", not "R Xmas"! At the theater with "R Xmas" (remember it was an open night!), There were 4 people, myself, my wife and two others! <br /> <br /> How to go, Abel! <br /> <br /> 2/10
