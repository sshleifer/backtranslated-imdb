Acknowledging the picture of the canteen on the DVD cover, I realized that it was a local film. The word in the title of Detroit complemented my doubts and made some things up and yes, the local film that was. <br /> <br /> So I took it up. Someone I knew actually knew some producers / directors (don't remember what) and said that the producers / managers could pay for this movie. <br /> <br /> Brilliant! What a great idea. The filmmakers can get their movie thanks to their capital and team. Then the investors (majority, team, others) get the profit, I imagine. <br /> <br /> Profit! <br /> <br /> Anyway. This movie was completely down to me. The special effects were special, like the special kids who go to school on small buses. Operation was very fun, not deliberate. There's a big line where the man says, "That mouth can't smoke!" as a takeover line. Unfortunately, this is the only fun part of the whole movie. Story? Well, I followed it on about 3/5, then everyone stopped thinking and when we sat there it suddenly ended. I mean, like, .. there is no resolution as they fell out of time. "Excuse, time-consuming people, good night!" <br /> <br /> We sat there confused and worshiped and threw another movie. Then about 20 minutes later my neighbor showed a movie to a boy! We threw it back and he (the actor) gave us a running comment that was fantastic because he hung up for the movie! <br /> <br /> What else did you ask for? <br /> <br /> For me, the most absurd scene was the chase of a motorcycle when it was so dark that it could literally be a flashlight and not a motorcycle. This and the jaw that falls on your face is a sudden end to drag you. Pain! Zombies saw zombies less than my colleagues. And I don't work in the morgue. <br /> <br /> So I suggest you see it when you get a movie to come over and give you a commentary on all the things behind the scenes and make sure this person hates the movie because it just adds fun. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, let it pass one. Hire something like you want the funny funny movie bad jaw ...
