I've seen most of the series because I leave the background noise of my TV in my dormitory. <br /> <br /> I'm a Mencia fan, but this show doesn't do much for me. Sometimes he says or does something to repel, but he has the honesty that completely destroys it. <br /> <br /> I've always thought he was funny because he's an angry man-routine in this TV series is not terribly widespread. Instead, he is simply insidious. I think it just reflects how funny his comedy is: outdated and uninteresting when he is not in the right place. I have seen him sometimes at his show, but he usually sits with a smile and smiles, and it doesn't fit him well. <br /> <br /> Just my opinion.
