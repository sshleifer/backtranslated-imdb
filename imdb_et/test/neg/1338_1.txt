No! no no no! My whole being is in contradiction with the terrible transformation of the classic film. I knew we were struggling after Meg Ryan appeared on his ridiculous hair and clothes - literally looks like a scarecrow in the garden he digs. Meg Ryan plays Meg Ryan - how tiring is it?! And it got worse ... so much worse. Terribly clich√© lines, stock characters, the ever-increasing idea I watched of "The First Wives Club" spin-off and the extremely hackneyed schtick delivery space. How many times have I seen this movie? Only once, but it looks like it's a dozen times - nothing original or fresh. Shame!
