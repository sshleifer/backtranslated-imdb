Oh dear, what we need is another Essex-cockney garbage that crowns the rise of the British football hooligan / rave gangster, who of course followed West 'am (East London / Essex style). Did anyone tell you that they won the world victory! And then naturally the inevitable decomposition of the UK rave culture underworld. Blah blah blah. Why and who would like to finance such a film, I don't know, but I promise to pray that it comes from private investors (we see former drug dealers, merchants-bankers - we all know what to call them and the rest are ridiculed) not publicly funded. Hopefully, we will not see a similar recession again. When we do this, we call the death film of British films and of course we can all blame Britains' first Mockney Country gent wannabee gangster Guy Ritchie.
