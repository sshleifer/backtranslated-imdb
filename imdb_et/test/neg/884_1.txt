Let me do this straight: <br /> <br /> "The Hotshot plastic surgeon loses the patient's surgery table by removing his face cyst and reaching his newly separated bed and breakfast hostess in about 24 hours, thanks to his firm recommendations at night." > <br /> Wow. Move over the laptop, there is a new boy in the city. <br /> <br /> Where to start, but how is this relationship? br /> <br /> 1. Swap polite pleasant salads 2. Drink lots of Jack Daniels, play basketball with old foods 3. Offer each other unwanted advice about your dirty lives 4. Love your hurricane 5. Dedicate your life to each other by airmail . <br /> <br /> I noticed that George C Wolfe has his own "The Hairball" and "United Kanye West Project" file. Would your genre be too harsh? agrees that p the sweetest love stories make us cry or laugh or even hope. But the reason why they can do this is that somewhere during the event we start to take care of the characters on the screen. To take care of us, it is time to develop their characters ... their lives, their history, why we are watching them now. Wolfe didn't want such trivial things to "waste our time", but gave us all about 8 minutes of background information on each character before we were amazed by the intense interaction between two ACTORS. Will everyone come to adore, but two CHARACTERS, which we could take less care of. <br /> <br /> One brief offer for a moment when Richard Gere shouts that he does not expect him to listen to his problems, and he invites him to see something special between these two characters. But instead of allowing to enjoy "what happens next" with the unexpected and playfulness of the wonderful, unpredictable joy that is conscience, we are rather good relationships between the two people we barely know. <br /> <br /> Let's face it. We've all heard about cheeses from rosy movies. But the reason we created Bogart "Casablanca" or "Nicholson" in some "Gotta give" is that our hearts and minds are lifted up into the sky and pulled through the mud and back with these letters and by the time they deliver the line, we are so deeply related to their difficulties, we don't even notice the cheese factor. Since Wolfe does not allow us to love or even like our protagonists, we have all been left with strangers and a few snicker audiences. <br /> <br /> Wolfe's old Hollywood director's phrase "cut chase too much literally. Since every cast one lining is cast, our viewer will wonder if director Wolfe tells the audience subconsciously:" Is this Richard Gere's romance . Buy it simply. "<br /> <br /> As a result of such a stunning character - or the lack of a relationship - the film's climax is unable to make our heartbreaking power. When Gere dies, I felt like I was watching news about someone I didn't know to go Or looking at the eight rowing races for women during the Beijing Olympics, just No. Care. <br /> <br /> Epic failed.
