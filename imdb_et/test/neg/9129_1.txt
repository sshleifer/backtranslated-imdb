Dear reader! This movie is not really a movie, although its creators have a call to name it. If you are not warned about this content, here: The film is just a sequence of successive imagery that flows constantly and tries to convey a sense, concept. They can be called symbols. Pictures are accompanied by a soundtrack that also aims to create an atmosphere. But the pictures that the director has chosen can only convey feelings to the American audience because they are a huge number of American icons. Although the purpose of the film is to express the idea of ​​"civilized warfare", it cannot do so not only because of the general chaos, but also because it is too long and tiring, and I felt that many scenes were not "war" in any concept. All in all, I was very disappointed in the documentary, which is not a documentary, a film that is not a film, "something" whose only strength is the extraordinary use of technology in image processing.
