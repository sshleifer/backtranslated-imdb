This movie is a third level test for a convincing, moody thriller and fails on all three occasions. It had almost managed to keep his attention, because the protagonist was slowly and predictably breaking the rules of life that he had comfortably set at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> But it's within the last 25 minutes or so things really start spiraling. The vaguely believable line (and it is generous) becomes completely nervous, as suddenly new signs do not appear anywhere and occasional and bizzarre events have never been explained. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be as bad as scripting would be. t so cheesy, work both wood (despite the strong British choice) and the direction of both uninspiring. It is not a good example of making a British movie, and it shouldn't really make Tarantino a bat, at least not in comparison to his previous work. <br /> <br /> My advice in this case, when it is hard to get hold of, is not to waste effort. If you're a Brit like me and it's in your local video store, head it well. Maybe you have a video titled "American Beauty" - now it's a great British direction.
