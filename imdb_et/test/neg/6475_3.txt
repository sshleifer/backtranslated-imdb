Chris Ricci is going through a great deal, but then he quickly takes the air of boredom and contempt - as I did. Without him, it would be just a cheap children's film, but at least he adds quality air. The company has few, if any, visually prominent and charismatic young actors. <br /> <br /> There's not much wrong with it as long as you agree with what it is - cheap Disney is aiming for very unwanted children. I can look at Ricci all day, so I have probably missed many of the film's shortcomings, but if you are not a Ricci fan, a cat-lover or a very small child, I doubt you will find it very fun.
