The well-established provision of the 1930s gives the viewer great interest in the early 21st century; Unfortunately, "London Belong Me" has little to suggest in addition to linking the peculiar English charm. All the problems concern a deeply vague story. The main plot concerns the activities of the young boys, Richard Attenborough, the problems he faces and the community in which he lives together to save him from the laws of society. Or something. The main question is that the character of Attenborough brings everything on his own and, frankly, is guilty of almost every accusation against him, so it's amazing why the film (and all the characters) has so much compassion for him. He is treated as a victim of circumstances when he is not; and it is no longer shown that he has a great deal of repentance for his deeds, but that he takes care that he does not get things he did not have to do. Alastair Sim gets a lot of screen time on a subfield that has nothing to do with the main plot line, and you don't know what it does there (though Sim is always great). You know that there is a problem in the structure if the main piece constantly affects the sub-block, but not the other way around. And after a soothing pace and careful structure, the plot breaks down over the last 20 minutes with a deeply unsatisfactory and inexplicable conclusion that doesn't even show us whether Attenborough's character has evolved from the previous procedure. The movie doesn't end, it just stops. <br /> <br /> The film's behavior, direction and general feeling are all commendable, but unfortunately, the story and structure of the pieces is constantly. The final point of the cavity: Alec Guinness based his performance very much on the film "The Ladykillers" on this film by Alastair Sim, with both characters with almost identical first scenes.
