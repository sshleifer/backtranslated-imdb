I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was terrible; it was pointless and just stupid. the presumed plot also touched the future groom who was too complicated with the world's problems to associate his bride and other people in his life. She disappears on her wedding day (tux not less) and fits with strange assortments. <br /> <br /> We saw this on busy people down the road to Atlantic City and everyone agreed that it was a terrible movie. It was trying to be deep, but it wasn't; it was stupid and offensive. If I wasn't on the bus, I'd have come out of the movie. Anyone who is considering watching a movie or video that you have previously warned.
