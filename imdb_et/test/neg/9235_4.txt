IMDb's 7.0 point conviction, which is pretty good, I decided to watch this movie. But I found this movie quietly boring (about 2 hours) and full of clichés. A little girl who got several persons after trauma, and so on. Tamer KAradagli is a quiet joke in this movie, in dialogues, etc., you have to see it, he's a sure cop you see in American movies, maybe you copied too much. I'd describe this movie as a normal American thriller with a bit of Turkish touch. Unfortunately, I am still convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres that are worth the Turkish cinema. Anyway I gave this movie 4, it's too boring and full of clichés
