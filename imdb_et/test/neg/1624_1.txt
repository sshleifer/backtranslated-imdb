I just read an extra long overview on the first page of this movie and explained in detail that this movie is worth watching only on the "Mystery Science Theater 3000 !!!!!" And yes, I find this advice really helpful! I mean, a movie that is trying to be good and this exciting just isn't what this movie wants to be !!!!! So yes, whether you watch this movie at this show and instead of giving this movie ten stars with one star, you can give it ten stars out of ten. So far my only star rating is only the real, clean, intact version of this movie !!!!!! Is it now?
