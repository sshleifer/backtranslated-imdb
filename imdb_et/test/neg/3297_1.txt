I am one of these punishments for punishing these days - I'm still looking at them again. My observation is that most of them are not even funny, even those that are high on the larger networks, I just can't find them who have found it funny to burst into the gut. While some have broken me off, none of them made me laugh loudly, usually changing the channel in a few minutes. In the FOX network, they cast out new items like changing underwear, for some reason they think they can make a good sitcom, wrong dead lie. They have beaten this dead horse so much that it means they just hire someone they find to write a bad pilot with a bad dialogue, and just cast them out. Let's briefly look at the last piece Fox has chosen as "War at Home" <br /> <br /> I looked at it for about 5 minutes and it was generous. In this particular episode, the daughter goes out to her parents who are doing that I am an adult who now rant.The father goes up, tells her "OK, go ahead and do whatever you want if you turn this problem around "to which he replies:" Well, I think your crazy, but at least I couldn't get AIDS "(kicking off, not something that can be a living audience if they haven't paid for such garbage recognition) that AIDS is not not so bad taste. Well, at least I don't have to look at this mess anymore. Take the tip of FOX, stop wasting your time with sitcoms.OK. You also have the Simpsons, but now it's too old and tired.
