The film will be opened by Charlie (Jeff Daniels), a businessman who finished his lunch in the neighborhood. It doesn't seem to have enough money to cover the check. Instead of reaching out to his plastic, he looks carefully around to see if the coast is clear and the ducks aren't paid. Charlie didn't know, "Lulu" (Melanie Griffith) had been watching her on the other hand. <br /> <br /> "Lulu" has been featured on the brunette's cool downtime of the 1980s. - Boy cut. He follows him so he knows he saw what he did. He's trying to deny it, but he can't escape his accusation. Thinking about it, Charlie is surprised when Lulu says she's not working for Deli and then offers her back to work. <br /> <br /> When he goes in the opposite direction, he will start switching to the Middle East Coast. <br /> <br /> We should become perfect because the thoroughly modern "Lulu" puts straight Charlie in degrading situations. This is all right when two accepting adults get into a small kink in the motel room, but they break when they throw out a check in a family-style restaurant. Stealing labor from hard-working people is not my idea of ​​"nature". Charlie is a jerk. <br /> <br /> "Lulu" is a loony jerk. He's going to go to Charlie as his wife. First of all for the mother (who can really withstand the herd) and then for her comfortably timed 10-year high school meeting (an event later used by another too cool-her-own-good movie "Grosse Pointe Blank"). "Marriage" is a surprise to Lulu's real wife (Ray Liotta), who has recently been released from prison for armed robbery. Ray gives two welcome results and shows them how nasty the crime is. <br /> <br /> I can't add any irony in writing that I watched it next to the cinema. No, I don't. I stuck it out of cable TV and assure you that I will look at it strictly in the privacy of your home. that 20 years ago I was a reggae kick and "Something Natural" soundtrack is reggae prominent. The final credits begin with the treatment of sister Carol, where she performs her "Wild Thing" version.
