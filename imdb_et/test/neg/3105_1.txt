I'm really too bothered to write this review - bad movies always do this to me - but I feel obliged to warn everyone who might consider buying or watching this pious confusion as if it were my civic mission. Please, please, just take my word: this is the one you want to stay away from. It is so boring and boring, so weak and intrusive, so bad excuse to experience familiar talent. Burt Reynolds? Destroyed (despite his best efforts). Ice-T is hardly in the movie and when he appears on the screen, his performance is so restrained and silent that it becomes crystal clear that the director with intense enthusiasm on the ice doesn't know what to do with him. Rob Lowe, like the title, has never shown so little screen-based charisma. Mario Van Peebles should be ashamed; his performance is a sad joke in the minds. Certainly, Satan himself signed a review of this film. The plot is just as weak, half-burned and annoying as all the music involved (a totally boring club song seems to be literally the first third of the movie). The look of the film makes one seriously wonder whether the photographer's director, like one of the unforgettable female characters in the film, was forced to smoke the smoke piping. And if you look at at least stylized, shooting-type-type violence, you won't get anything here. I assure you that this movie, I promise you, has absolutely no redeeming qualities! Please, I ask you to avoid this Flick! Don't put it in and let sucker believe that its pace is accelerating, getting better and evolving. This is not. This is not. It can't! It sucks! Now you are warned and I can go to sleep now (this is 3:00 - please forgive all the errors that this warning might contain) - knowing my conscience is clear because I've done my civic duty against my fellow man!
