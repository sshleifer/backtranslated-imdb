The book is great. This is one of my favorite books. The film, on the other hand, is amazingly pointless and bad! When I heard that Damon was playing Ripley, I knew that the production was doomed. But I didn't expect it to be that bad. Participants go around and act very skillfully. Except for the law (and even if he is guilty of some exemplary action), all the actors here are near amateurs. When speaking Italian and moving your hands or hair, no action should be taken. Damon has failed. He's too heroic for a character that should be chameleon. Paltrow is forgotten and Hoffman plays another funny character. Talk about typing. <br /> <br /> What is really unforgivable about the script (overestimated by the director) is that it completely abandons every fine detail book and comes up with many of its own and none of them work! Adding Jazz Music Stuff is VERY BAD! I think Minghella's idea of ​​Italy in the late 50s, the beginning of the 60s, is a cloud with pictures of Chet Baker migrating to rural Italy and spreading amore. Yes, Minghella is a real visionary. The film is obviously bleeding. This silly scene when Ripley rides through mirrors filled with narrow streets. Very ridiculous. Yes, we get a point !!! Every point or detail goes through miles so that the film can give the audience the wrong impression that they have psychic abilities. We know, for example, that Blanchett's character, introduced at the beginning of the film, later returns to complex things. And the soundtrack is at times totally inappropriate. Strange if it shouldn't be. The film goes on for too long and in any meaningless direction. There are too many boring characters in the landscape (many of them were not in the book). This movie is bad! Really bad! <br /> <br /> Obviously, Minghella's son told his father that Ripley's novel was his favorite. Mr. Minghella then led his son to his variety. Well, the director did what he did: Talented Mr. Ripley, with his Hitchcock aspirations, is a film that has been strictly made for 12-year-olds!
