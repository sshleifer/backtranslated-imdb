I've read the positive comments on this movie. I assume that the people on this movie have to come to this site to give him a good press because it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I always look at the whole movie, despite the fact that there is a quality or a flaw that explains why I was watching this movie, but I don't think I even smiled during this movie. The jokes were mostly very bad, but when the jokes had some promise, the delivery was out. If you liked it, maybe you should shoot the buds because you have to keep 5 or 6 brain cells you have left. This film had a bad script, bad behavior, bad leadership, a weak chart ... nothing of virtue and no fun. If you haven't seen this movie, don't.
