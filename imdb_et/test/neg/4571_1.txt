I looked at the Fraudsters a couple of years ago with my friend. He jumped in this great funny movie, one of the best comedies ever. I think he was cracked or something. I just found out that this movie hasn't been shot in theaters, I understand why it's completely. <br /> <br /> The basic piece includes a group of men who deceive a lot of their tasks at school to get good grades. This is the main problem with this movie that morality is all bad. There are other teen comedy films where pupils do bad things, but most often it doesn't happen at school. So I think the whole concept of the movie, basically the kids cheated on everything, is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I also didn't like the characters in this movie. The main character of the man is a completely insidious arrogant idiot who is not a good protagonist. In fact, I'm not sure if one could say that there is a protagonist because they all cheat at school, which is wrong. Other supportive characters were not funny at all and cast shots in principle. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bad message and even worse action and characters. There are other teen movies that are better than this movie. So you don't have to see it and it's good because I don't recommend this movie at all.
