Robert Aldrich's brutal, almost black black comedy "The Grissom Gang", recasting the British film "No Orchids For Miss Blandish" in 1948, is the successor of the 1920s, Kim Darby, who has been abducted from the clumsy thieves; soon this gang will be sent and poor Kim will then go to the bunch of another curve - the third-level gangsters brothers who have a sweaty, sticky face and a mother who looks like Buddy Ebsen. At first Darby (not very cute and not very smart) tries to escape from this descent, but they are on her. Finally, he simply quit trying and lies in the story of the problem. Do we have compassion with the audience? Should his growing concern for the family be warm-hearted? These are a nasty, restless character and I wanted to see them as little as possible. But since the side effects (police progress in the case and the second with the singer Connie Stevens) are quite boring, the director has no choice but to keep those sweaty faces on us. Quite soon, the nervous Darby starts to sweat, although her scene in hayloft is sensitive and Aldrich's weather conditions are thinking when they are wrong. ** from ****
