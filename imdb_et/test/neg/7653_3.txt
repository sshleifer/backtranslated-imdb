I watched this movie with a bunch of friends during the Halloween party last night. I have to say that the sarcastic comments never stop and I have to say they were well-deserved. Although I felt that management was doing well, the madness in their dialogue is a little bit of cheese. I think I got some time out of it before I started to understand what it was like to go home. You're pretty fast trying to make this whole family pretty peculiar and something down for them, it's just too slow. This film would have been easy for about 45 minutes and much better. The only thing that made it bearable was the two wine bottles I grounded during the slip. Bring slasher movies to people because at least I know what to expect from them. It wasn't my thing, too much dark humor, and the material of the cannibalism was a bit explicit and harsh. I have to say that Randy Quaid played this part as well as he could have, and I give him props for this, because I usually see him as a drunk runner or a washed fighter who wants to kill aliens. > <br /> Finally, I give this horror / comedy a very generous 3 out of 10.
