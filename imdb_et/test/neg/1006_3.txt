I'd put Death Wish 3 in the same box as Stallone's Cobra and Commando. The box I would sell for $ 2 in garage sales with all the videos. The story tells us how the main character has come back from the success of previous films. Why did the makers want to destroy the reputation of the last two films because of this cheap spam. The story is so flat that was supposed to be a terrible sequel. I mentioned Cobra earlier because he has the same mood that one person can kill 20 or 30 gang members without scratch. Both this film and the Cobra were bent, showing a hero who put his weapons at the hip level and the enemy in large numbers. Police officers spend hours at the shooting range, so why do they hit the gang members who shot their hips without targeting? This movie was so bad that I was thinking of Death Wish 4 for a few minutes.
