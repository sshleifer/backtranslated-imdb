Let me break this movie for you ... <br /> <br /> The first 15 minutes is a terrible special effect. I'm not about any special effects, but what you need to understand is that if you can't afford the good special effects, you shouldn't reinforce the special effects of your movie. Starship fire stains paint each other, burning stock explosions and taking care of the past six polygons counts low enough to read with your fingers. You have no idea what's going on. That doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> The second action involves a woman walking in the desert. At this point you will be treated with drab landscapes and illogical, boring fight scenes. No one is talking. Something interesting will not happen. The goals of the protagonist are unclear and not very convincing. It takes about 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> Then he slips into an enemy base in five minutes of assembly, straps on a rocket, tries to destroy a doomsday weapon, fails and dies. None of them affect the possible direction of the film. <br /> <br /> Over the last twenty minutes, chicks' memories are basically transferred to his daughter, who goes to the stadium for many years, learning the secrets of humanity. After that, we see the first and final segments of human interaction in the movie, and the new heroine is forced to choose whether or not he wants to become part of the material that causes the big bang or not. You know. Because when the universe collapses, you decide if you want to get that part. <br /> <br /> He chooses yes. IF THE GAMES ARE CONTINUED IN THE CAPSULES. Maybe we won't make the same mistakes again, huh? If you like movies with characters, it's not a good movie. Important roles would have been to perform well with any old toy that can walk through the sand. The whole story is said to be a painful narrative. <br /> <br /> The film tries to feel deeply by bringing together a number of unknown fictional ideas. There are enough concepts here to fuel several films, but as it is, it has swelled with completely irrelevant details. Two-thirds of this movie could have been reduced to 45-second editing. Instead, the narrator performs the short story without giving us any reason to worry about what happens to the cases. People watched the movies. This movie will not relax.
