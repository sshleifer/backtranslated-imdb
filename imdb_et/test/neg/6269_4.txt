It is incredible that in 2005, two films with the same story appeared. It appeared with Tom Cruise the day before. Did they not do this with Truman Capote of the same year and Zodiac killer last year? Interesting. <br /> <br /> Writer / director David Michael Latt had no budget for Steven Spielberg and C. Thomas Howell is not Tom Cruise. This is a pale imitation that is $ 588 million worldwide. <br /> <br /> The action was minimal and most of the time we treated Rhett Giles, who played a pastor who gave up his god. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey was a terrible army of LT.
