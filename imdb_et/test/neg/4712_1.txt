The pesky and talented American documentary filmmaker learns from the legendary <br /> <br /> South African monster, half-box. Tradition says it is a half-human, semi-leopard creature whose closest parallel is a werewolf of European traditions. Instead of focusing on the creature, the film follows the strokes of the film crew. There is little action or intercourse to delay the film. This problem is exacerbated by numerous irritating signs that cause even more irritating talk. The main premise is wasted because it is limited by the unexplained concentration of an undocumented team member. Perhaps the director was influenced by the Blair witch project (1999) or the Last Broadcast (1998) approach. Regardless of the fact that the film does not work on most levels. Avoid at all costs.
