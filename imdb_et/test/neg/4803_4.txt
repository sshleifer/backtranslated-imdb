Although it is one of two films on Voodoo volumes 1, it is not voodoo or supernatural! The box is marked "Hell Hole", but the screen title is Escape from Hell Hole. The title is confusing to Hell Hole (1978) or "Escape from Women's Hell Hole". A group of women swim in the river and the worst thing they have to worry about is the peeping tom whom they just win. This or some other scene has no nudity. <br /> <br /> A woman named Cardena travels in the car and seems to be known and liked by all women. He invites Indri and his uncle M.G to live in the city and live there. When they get there, it turns out that M.G. wants to take Indri's innocence. M.G. manages some kind of prostitution house and he is either a soldier for a corrupt branch, or controls paramilitary clothes or prefers his guards wearing military uniforms. <br /> <br /> Women who refuse her or otherwise hurt her. Indri is sent there. The guards are tortured and sometimes raped. <br /> <br /> Various unsuccessful attempts to escape or rescue have been made, but will inevitably fail despite the obvious advantages women have: they cross the guards considerably and relatively few guards have automatic weapons - most of them have semi-automatic rifles or handguns. <br /> <br /> For WIP genre enthusiasts, this may be pleasing, and the fact that it has been made in the Philippines gives it some novelty, but otherwise. Eh.
