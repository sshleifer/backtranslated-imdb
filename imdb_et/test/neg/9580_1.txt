I bought a big trash bin from $ 4.99 for a DVD, I thought I had some documentary pearls that would really prove the Karakoram Mountains and especially the K2. Fast delivery of the film came to the climatic environment, with climbing gear at first sight ---- Mount Waddington, which rises across the 13,260 foot Canadian coastline. At least one K2, which is aimed at K2 climbing, has no idea what the mountain actually looks like - his friend and climbing partner must make sure he hasn't brought that partner to the ugly side. Mountain. Considering that one of the film spaces is that 27 people have lost their lives in K2, you may think that this jerk might have been a few minutes or a few minutes to create some basic facts, but the clown seems to think the preparations for this scale, though He loves Reinhold Messner, is under him. Frankly, I haven't been watching the whole thing. What I've seen makes me worry. They say you get what you pay for. I've hung up at $ 4.99.
