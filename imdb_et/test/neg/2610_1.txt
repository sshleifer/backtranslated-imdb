This son of the descendant's son was terribly insignificant. You think the production would be better 10 years after the original was released, but the Retro Puppet Master was neither written nor written by the original writers, and it contained a bad story, the absence of any emoticon connection with any characters, and a slow scenes scene. Building a strong plot, a very weak climax, you will find yourself slowly making the whole of your movie anime when you can sit around the roll. I never understood why the horror film continues the offspring after the release of their "final chapter". I can hardly see this flick, but if you don't recommend someone else to sit with you.
