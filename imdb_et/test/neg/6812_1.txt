Ever had one of those nights if you couldn't sleep and just turn on to see what was? So I ran this faithful. I would have served myself for 97 minutes when I was wasting this movie, and I would have made it better. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to be "true", the characters in this movie come as gangsta stereotypes that the story should have been a prerequisite for Wayans' brothers. Dialogue? Please! It sounded like a white man trying to write this movie. <br /> <br /> Editing was terrible. One of my "favorite" scenes was a car that ran down a narrow range of alleys. Cut the cut character, but they run in the background with baseball fields in the park. <br /> <br /> If any of our "homes" hit this movie, he will bleed through the clothes wonderfully. which does not contain holes that are more than I can say about this predicted load .... baking soda. <br /> <br /> Indie movies can be great even when they are small in budget and impact. but they must have some kinematic integrity. If I could have given it, I would. If you look at it, I hope this is a cable, because even the cheapest rental would be too much to pay. In fact, 97 minutes was too much to pay ...
