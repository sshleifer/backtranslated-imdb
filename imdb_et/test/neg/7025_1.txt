Until 1970, Lucille Ball was a great comedy. He was such a perfect clown if I wanted more people to have seen him with Bob Hope in "The Life Fact" because he also died. as well as slapstick. <br /> <br /> Yes, Lucille Ball was great. . . <br /> <br /> Trying to see Lucille's ball in "Mame" is physically impossible, because the already filtered lenses have so much petroleum that you need a scene to watch Lucille Ball in Windex. So even if you see Lucille's ball in "Mame", Lucille can't really see the Ball in "Mame". What is a blessing. <br /> <br /> This is the most pleasant thing I can say about "Mame", which is a feature film of a movie (it can go on, but it started with a totally funny book "Auntie Mame"). Giving this bad rape is like beating with a sponge. So it is not important that the music rather than sing. Most of the songs were not much anyway. The first three have no difference. "It's Today", "Open a New Window" and "We Need Little Christmas" are all the same song. Celene Dion should make an album with them, they are so big and boring. Killer Ballad "When He Walked in My Life Today" needs a confident proud voice (Edyie Gorme won Grammy for doing it in 1967) that poor Lucille Ball wasn't making this movie. (True, Elaine Stritch can't carry a bucket, but at least Stritch can carry the song.) <br /> <br /> If you still feel that your life is incomplete, watch the movie's "Mame" how is dancing there, but when Lucy / Mame starts to do anything other than the scaled shuffle, the camera cuts off, returns to the right when the number has passed and the star denotes dancers. Again, it's just as good. Jane Connell had to predict the miserable role of Agnes Goochi after Lucille Ball had been fired by Madeline Kahn to ensure that comic originality didn't mean a star. Connell is a director who, like Carol Channing and Ethyl Merman, is unable to film his films, so he joins Lucille Ball, though for various reasons. <br /> <br /> Theadora Van Runkle (Van Wrinkle?) and they offer a color that is missing in all but one cast. <br /> <br /> Bea Arthur as actress Vera Charles, Mame's best friend, ignores everyone and makes her fun. If only he had more scenes. He's too old for his role, but at least he didn't.
