Mmmm, previous summary, "If you like aliens and predator enjoy this movie," I could no longer agree, this film does not respect any respect for its compelling genealogy and has reduced the two best loved sci fi strands a little more than the teen horror slasher movie, it is not any tension or foreboding present in previous aliens or predators movies and there is no noticeable lead character, i really don't care about any characters and i positively yearned to see the stereotypical cast of death as soon as possible hopelessly hope that something better would replace it, is really paramount The human incompetence that two of the most frightening creatures have ever been invented can not grasp the exciting movie, but only watch it if you want to see how not to do it.
