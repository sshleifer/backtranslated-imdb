I can't figure out what Jon Voight should have been thinking about when he was in this decade, inconsistent, intentive, moody shore. He helped himself to write the alleged "script" and he should shame it. The film (I can't call it a "movie because it hardly moves at all) is an amazing, embarrassingly pretentious drivel - a sort of really bad Oprah Winfrey show, but worse. that he is a reincarnation of the medieval prince, who must save the kingdom from his evil brother's machinations, and somehow it goes to modern times, where Voight must save the state from the evil of the executive power of the oil company. and Armand Assante) is not enough to kill it, an astonishingly failed direction, a selected photo (it looks like it was a really cheap 16mm camera), almost complete lack of editing (scenes continue and end indefinitely or split in the middle of the sentence) and Voight embarrassing, apparently, the "action" of the flow of consciousness is enough to bury what should have been Experience the jaw dropping. Avoid this dog at all costs.
