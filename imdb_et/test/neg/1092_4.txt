My mother did not allow me to watch this movie in Grade 2 because she said it was too violent. Years later, and the only reason I remember this movie is because of my mother, I stayed up and watched it in PBS. Well, maybe building up these years can lead to a big paralysis of this movie, but I found it flat. It was not well outdated, and it changed the script's dirty, big, stunning holes, but there are some cool scenes, such as car hunting, and a big gun fight. I'm not staying with this movie.
