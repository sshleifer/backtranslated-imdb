There's so much wrong with this movie. Greico, with a girl's wig, an old man's scientist's time machine fastener, a tough guy, Jones, who's behind with a gun with three rounds, people with spiders who have tentacles and bad teeth, etc. visible spiders on the screen at once (could use alien cameron technique), but they chose every spider man to dress the same way ... badly. The nice thing Greico does is that he strikes his eye on every syllable as he reads how many words he speaks in the script. It amazes me that all the information contained in the comments on the DVDs still includes such people who make movies. This film could have been worse than I don't know. And one last thing. I'm going to the SCI-FI movie. People on this channel should not be allowed to continue the nepotism in film and television.
