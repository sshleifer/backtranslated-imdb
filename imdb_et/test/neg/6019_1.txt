Why does the poster and the work of art say: "Clubbed is one of the best British indiefs I've seen for a very long time. SCREEN INTERNATIONAL" when it was quoted by the French distributor REPORTED by Screen International. See www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=39811, which states: <br /> <br /> "Pretty Pictures has acquired all French-language rights to Neil Thompson Clubhouse .... James Velaise, President of Pretty Pictures said: "Clubbed is one of Britain's best indie films I've seen for a long time." "<br /> <br /> Isn't it misleading? The distributor must say that this is good. Are other quotes real?
