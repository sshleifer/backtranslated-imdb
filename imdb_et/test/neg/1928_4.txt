... it separates good, memorable movies from such movies. It's not entertaining, touching, funny, interesting, and sometimes it seems like a small person. Directors-General act as they are in the rest of the world in a worse way than they should communicate with each other and with the public. <br /> <br /> Starts normally enough. The rich child gets to the end of the new car, but the dean says he has no car before the ceremony. However, joy rides and stops on the wrong side of the canteen as a quick argument for local yokels. Wise-asses waitress / girlfriend's head yokel. Hidden, they play a chicken until they accidentally burn a meal that they left three minutes earlier (not all 5 meters away). <br /> <br /> They said they had to go to court to find that the only reason to "get out of the water" to stay in town is to find a scenario that both boys need to help build a canteen. Worse than that, a rich boy staying with a rich child's family. This "room above the attic" has saved a lot of people needing a bed. <br /> <br /> The abundant child, unexplainedly treated by a girl, will ever be understood by someone who almost did not kill her. This, of course, does not mean her boyfriend and has never been fully explained. You don't know why Sam (Leelee Sobieski) belongs to Kelley (Chris Klein) or why Jasper (Josh Hartnett) allows it. <br /> <br /> Chris Klein is tolerated, Leele is totally unbearable and Josh doesn't register much impression. The most life is characterized by a judge who speaks to Kelley and Jasper to help rebuild food. He leaves at least one funny note that is more than anyone else. Everyone is so frightening and humorous that you feel a bit of a window sill when you are even thinking of smiling at the film. <br /> <br /> The end is one way to end the end, not the most original, but at least it was over. I don't like filming that a little girl anywhere in the world could really love it, but since I'm not one, I have to do it. The most pleasant thing I can say about this movie is that it does not mean enthusiasm, and although it did not force it, its innocent and home-scaring, the funny dialogue comes from a beautiful place. 4/10.
