A young doctor and his wife are waiting for a sudden baby. Both are disrupted by about two hours of memory overnight. An interesting story about hackneyed story. Very good F / X and interesting editing. Jillian McWhirter is an outstanding pain with Arnold Vosloo, Wilford Brimley and Brad Dourif. Brimley brings extreme normality. Kudos directed by Brian Yuzna.
