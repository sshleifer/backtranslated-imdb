I like the movies, but I didn't find anything that would be pleasing to the box. I was interested in the "hook" of the plot, but unfortunately it never went anywhere and it was impossible to follow. Anyone who says he understands this movie is probably against them being part of it, well, I have news for them, the emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this film is that women are guilty of the original sin and humanity's violation. I've heard this story before and it makes less and less sense every time. It is true that this film is different from the movie currently being shown in theaters, but it does not make the price of the ticket.
