Director and playwright Richard Day adapted his stage material for the screen inspired by Rock Hudson's actual dilemma of the 1950s: what to do with the homosexual screen idol? Marry her with an unsuspecting woman to cherish (and keep her) gentlemen. A weak, thin idea that gave some energy a good cast and retro production that is happy to resemble Shag's greeting card. Dialogue is not very smart, and at first there are some strokes that do not work (diet, etc.). However, when the ultimate act is overcome by a serious tone, it is treated with great taste - and the viewer is much more welcome than any Klutzy stupid. Matt Letscher does a good job as a film hero / male whore Guy Stone, but is his experience enough to strengthen his character, or would he be right next to the bar? The film does not seem to know or take care. The day wants to get a couple of one-liners and one carefully written pro-gay speech - a statement of tolerance, but it has no other agenda. For those people who invest their time and interest in these people, the sentimental bow of this thing may seem more than a square. * 1/2 from ****
