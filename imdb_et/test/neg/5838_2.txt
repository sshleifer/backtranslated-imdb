This SOFT soft-core / sci-fi movie is what you would have if you took the early Fred Ray Ray movie and took the fun. Or, on the contrary, it is like Uwe Boll's movie, but without that much intuition. A young nubile chain warrior (C.C. Costigan) agrees to depict a space commissioner to stop the nervous Kim Dawson plans ... all of whom are apparently sexually obvious to others (this is a whistle fiend). Anyone who went to this movie looking for serious science fiction would also do what you deserve not to do the film at home. First, if Kim Dawson EVER stands for something other than the soft core of the Skinaix plain. To do this, take a look at the continuation of Costigan and the director before you take the hissy, saying that you've been waiting for something else. Don't be wrong with the space / activity / soft core / titration flick that this movie is STILL Not good, but if you expected something "Contact" then I wouldn't care for you. <br /> <br /> My class: D- <br /> <br /> Where I saw: Starz-on-demand (available until December 8, 2005)
