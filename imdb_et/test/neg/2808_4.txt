I didn't expect too much from this movie, but I was still disappointed. It should be comedy, but there are only four or five scenes where I actually laughed, and I think it's pretty bad. Also, there is no real plot of land, I always felt that most scenes could have been placed somewhere in the movie because there is no connection between them. But the worst thing was Kim Franke's "action". He has one facial expression throughout the film, as if he had to play some slowed man, but I believe that is not the case. All in all, I appreciate it from four to ten, I've seen worse movies than this, but I wouldn't spend that money again.
