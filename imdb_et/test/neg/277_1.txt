I watched this movie and started getting ever more stupid on a plot that didn't go anywhere, suddenly making this story a surreal turn and having an actor. Oh, how did I pick up. Because it's so funny, isn't it? We know that Julia Roberts is playing the character of Tess, and here they are joking in the film that Tess is a bit like Julia Roberts. So Julia plays someone who embodies Julia. How well he does, we never know, because 99.999% of the audience doesn't really know Julia Roberts (and reading from him in the Hello magazine doesn't read). <br /> <br /> And then Bruce Willis is coming up! He's probably Julia Robert's best friend. Well, he's in the movie ... how do I know if Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts even know each other? I have little interest in the personal life of the actors - I just pay my money and hope they do the work they pay. Anyway, they're going to shoot clapping jokes in a movie where Willis (rather convincingly) plays a psychiatrist ... the one who has this little boy ... you know that? I don't know, I've forgotten what it has called. Willis will even comment on how well this movie was in the box - how modest about you, Mr Willis! <br /> <br /> The problem is that not only are these scenes meaningless and terribly awful, it also reminds us, viewers, that we are just looking at a number of participants who are moving around and paying very little for large sums of money. When I see the movie, I want to stop the disbelief and forget that I look at the actors - I want to believe the story I look at. When you start drawing a landscape in the middle of a movie, you just destroy my illusion. <br /> <br /> You know that silver is busy in the TV series, when it starts to introduce celebrities, play Simpsons, Friends, etc.), but this is the first time I saw the movie jump. Usually away from such movies (eg Scary Movie, The Naked Gun, etc.). The problem is that honestly, the Ocean didn't think about 11 movies in that direction. What a shame. <br /> <br /> So stopping the belief from the window and the plot in the movie will break the most notorious joke to the audience - the story actually happened and the last 90 minutes of the movie was pointless. Yes, that's right: Steven Soderwhats and his actor friends rise up, point to the audience and say, "Ha ha ... you have all ... thanks for your money!". Then they give us one fingerprint. Well, right back. I didn't pay for watching this movie ... I downloaded the DVD. How d'ya do they like apples? Now this is the twist of the plot.
