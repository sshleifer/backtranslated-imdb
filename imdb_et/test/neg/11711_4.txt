I was lucky enough to read the book in advance and I know a little about Tudor England. <br /> <br /> The writing and editing of this TV movie was usually terrible. I felt like I was really looking at a bad drama doci about a timer, a movie. <br /> <br /> First, there were too many cuts between important parts. And leaving out the important events that happened at that time, one is against Rome for his desire to separate himself from Katherine's aragon, which led England to Rome and established his own church. they barely stuck with the book at all. I am all for creative freedom, but a limit, especially if you are a novice with a well-written book. In the book, Mary gives birth to young Catherine for the first time, and then she was born a young Henry. Both of their fathers are Henry's eight. in the film, they show Harry for the first time to Catherine. And suppose Catherine's father is William Carey. <br /> <br /> There are too many bad moments in the movie to write all of them. <br /> <br /> However, I say that Jodhi May and Natascha McElhone portray if Boleyn's sisters were probably the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> If you haven't read the book and don't know anything about Hennry 8, I suggest you stay away from this movie. And for those who read this book, it disturbs the film's details and the absence of an important plot.
