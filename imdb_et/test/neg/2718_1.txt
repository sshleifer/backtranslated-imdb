As Joe Bob Briggs would say, this film relies more on the talents of actors than on their talents. The exhibition-babes-in-bikinis-fest at the beginning of the 1990s is a little redeemable except for showing pretty women pretty naked. Joe Estevez, the little brother of Martin Sheen, proves once again that his film career is far from what his brother's career is. <br /> <br /> Avoid letting you look at beautiful women in hostile clothes. This is the only thing that redeems it.
