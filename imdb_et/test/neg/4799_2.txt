The bipolarity of this film is crazy. At one point, it is fun in Latin America, American tourists and banana republics in general, the other one wants to touch, burnt villages and orphans. Even a serious revolutionary hero will at one point become a revolutionary parody. But the comedy parts aren't even funny because it's probably stolen from Star Wars. Yes, Star Wars, the "hero" is basically a scammer with a gold heart. Add to this stereotypical sound effect Latin Americans, who speak English with each other, and a villain that just disappears. And what is this point? It is basically a revolutionary propaganda without resolution and unplanned (as these people cannot be managed in any way). The US government is bad guys, but who makes that money? Not a poor farmer, that's for sure.
