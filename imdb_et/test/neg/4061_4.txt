Like a massive DM fan, it goes without saying that I've seen this movie many times. But I only look at it for the concert material ... the rest of the movie is quite terrible, sad to say. <br /> <br /> The famous rock music director DA Pennebaker followed his regime in his late 80s music education, which promoted the magnificent album of the same name. Heading 101 is mainly due to the fact that the concert material comes from the 101st and the final concert of the Pasadena Bowl, but there is also a reference to the film being a beginner course in the band and how it is made, ie. Depeche Mode \ t101. Quartet video of a vibrant and exploratory America is another story that includes a group of DM fans who have won a race to meet the band and go on their bus. <br /> <br /> Now, as I said above, the concert material is great. The mode is at this stage a rock stadium of the stadium, which was a somewhat unusual achievement at the end of the 80s for the electrorock band. Although the film hits the band before they registered their 1990 masterpiece "Violator", there are still countless stories that can be seen and heard, eg behind the wheel, majestic never let down again, everything reads, just can't understand enough Vince Clarke Years, Shake The Disease and more. <br /> <br /> In mode, they are great. If they are not, they are very boring. There is nothing vaguely interesting for young people because they are looking for the US in the dead days of the Reagan administration. For example, the likely "highlighting" of a material is a visit to a country music store to purchase cartridges. Not just exciting. I know that all bands do not have to be wild and careless idiots, but these men make the Mormon Tabernacle choir similar to Rammstein. <br /> <br /> The only real thrill comes from the different clips that focus on the band's singer Dave Gahan. Gahan gets into a slightly psychotic 101, talking about violent power within himself, which he can't control, recalling a strange rage attack involving a taxi driver and so on. There is one point in the film where he casts the prima donna somewhat on poor men who are quite embarrassed. At that time the man had problems, which fortunately have been solved. The songwriter Martin Gore and the Andy Fletcher keyboard are very expressive, clearly massively talented, but also completely colorless; Although somewhat mysterious, the fourth member, Alan Wilder, is the only quartet who draws the rock star personality with any aplomb. <br /> <br /> As with "fan travel", it is unnoticeable. . Let us not be a child. Perhaps this is just because it is so much * in the late 1980s, but strangling young devotees is little for me, but it gives me a feeling of irritation. They are alone low and coarse people whose antics are banal if they are not hidden. Let me repeat .... * Nothing happens in a frame that is not on stage that is interesting. Something. The endless scene for kids, spraying their hair, claiming unnecessarily, changing their clothes, getting lost in the cities on their way to concerts, and finding their partners in bed with the winner of another race, thought to me just one thing - when Cure fans were with that when Cure fans they were with that mind. '88 / 89. Young people's love for the band is something that I definitely can relate to and sometimes infectiously cheerful, but if what we see was the most interesting thing about what was filmed then I wouldn't want to see what is <br /> <br /> But music is all that matters, and 101 is great in this respect. The Pasadena concert, the best concert of all time, makes the movie worthwhile. The latest DVD edition of the movie is equipped with a bonus disc that contains unrecorded remnants of concert material (good 80% of the performance) and thus makes the DVD an absolute fan. The band's voice comment (minus Wilder who left Mode in the mid-90s) on the first album is also strangely much more interesting than the film itself. <br /> <br /> As a boy's documentary from the Basildon amphitheater, the Depeche Mode 101 is invaluable. But if you are looking for excitement, it is better to get the accompanying double live album (now available in Super Audio CD format).
