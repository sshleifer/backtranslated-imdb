It's just one of the worst films I've ever seen. There is so much in the house that it goes wrong so it doesn't happen, it's not even funny. This movie is given, which means that things that happened in normal life are not happening here, but this film is much further than the theories that no child misses. All these people are in the house and no one has noticed the other, let alone the devil's owl, which seems to be coming everywhere but in its cage. I could say with the owl for the first time in jokes, but after an hour I just can't do it, rather kill myself than see this fucking owl again. Did I smile during this movie? no. Not even once? no. Terrible, terrible, terrible. The fact that this trash is closed with Ashton Kutcher, bending his boss and putting his pants off all over, makes this film even worse. But wait, the day is saved because the devil's owl can fly. WHO IMELY! But I give this film some credit, it's not as bad as Epic Movie .....
