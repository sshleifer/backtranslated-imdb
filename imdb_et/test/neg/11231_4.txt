A few years ago, I remember reading the essay of a feminist film scientist, who briefly mentioned Rosalind Russell. This theorist wrote that the strength of "strong women" played by Rozzie R. was, in part, their ability to stand with their husband (even if it was not). <br /> <br /> I thought of this essay after viewing "Passion" crimes ". <br /> <br /> Kathleen Turner expresses the same strength and style as Russell's prostitute in Chinese blue imaging. He is the object of affection for two men: a ransom priest, played by Anthony Perkins, and a funny white bread boy who has slowly faded into marriage. And he won't let either of them wear him before ... <br /> <br /> I'm not giving up - but I say it's finally Bland's Whitebread Boy fantasy. No matter how hard Ken Russell tries, he cannot hide the fact that this film is basically a 1940s melodrama for the MTV generation. These old black and white films look revolutionary and gender politics in a revolutionary fashion.
