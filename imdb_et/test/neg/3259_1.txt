After watching Caddyshack 1, I heard there was a sequel and decided to look for it. The film seemed pretty bad and I told myself I stayed away, but I gave the stupid thing and actually bought the fucking thing! All reviews and all the bad things you have heard about Caddyshack II are true. The film is just about carrying ideas and flattening the plot and jokes I've ever heard, gopher, the whole movie is really bad (Randy Quaid was funny). <br /> <br /> Just stay away from this movie as much as possible, what can I really say. I'm very sorry to watch and buy a DVD, but I'm not sure what the decision of the prayer was. Just stay away as much as possible.
