I think it says something that Bollywood's "Bride and PRejudice" was more loyal to the source material than this 2005 Hollywood version. I laughed more in the Bollywood version. (Mr. Kholi? Priceless!) If you've read the book or seen the BBC version of 1995 (and liked it), you'll have a surprising surprise for this movie. But my friend, who hadn't seen it, was lightly amused. However, if you are a purse from Ane Austen, or even a filmmaker who does not like historical inaccuracies, it will hurt to sit. <br /> <br /> Ugh, script. The script was the biggest problem. I imagine that the actors would not have gone halfway as if they had a proper script, perhaps won by someone who really loved Austen's work. <br /> <br /> Which travestions were made? Well, you have to endure such unbelievable features as "Do not dare judge me, Lizzy!" and "Leave me once in my life!" Not only such lines are far from being the beautiful pencil of Jane Austen, but can anyone honestly say that such words are poured out of the mouth of a younger woman in the age of Regent? The use of modern collocialists is one of the many irritating ways that a scriptwriter kills a book. The writer also decided to give characters that were completely different characters in the book and all without a visible purpose. Worse still, if they try to get a little closer to writing a book, the scriptwriter has an unpleasant and unnecessary habit of reorganizing Austen's phrases and replacing the awkward synonyms for his already perfect words. It would be like a scriptwriter who wrote a script on the one hand and a thesaurus on the other hand. Stay with Austen's words; he did it better than you! I assume that it all happened in a "revolutionary" spirit and trying to make this film a long way from the 1995 BBC version. But for me it was also the true spirit of the most loved work. <br /> <br /> Casting was potential, although it quickly disappeared when the script was launched. Excessive and barrier your curved teeth is not equal to charm and liveliness! And I think Mr McFayden, although I find he's nice enough, misread my script and had the impression that he was playing Heathcliff and not the terrible Mr Darcy. I really enjoyed Brenda Blethyn, Kelly Reilly and the actress who played Mr. Collins. Their interpretations were really quite refreshing. Oh, but Donald Sutherland! Somebody described his performance seemingly like a hobo who had inadvertently migrated to the film set and had to say that this is the right description. And can anyone tell me why they were in Legolas after Wickham? Although she was in the movie for less than two minutes, I dare say, and without her impressive archery skills, to restore the film. <br /> <br /> The wardrobe notices that I would kill Miss Bingley for dresses because they were rich and fit more with the modern century. (Sleeveless Regency Evening Dress? Please! More Versace than Austen, that's for sure) And poor Keira, the whole budget went to his salary, not his garderoobile! Oh, and I'm sure they finally hit the bastard who stole one hairbrush from the movie. Unfortunately, they didn't hit him early enough to shoot the drama of the actors before the show. <br /> <br /> In short, with this new version of Hollywood, offer adieu Austen to the utterance, fineness, and intelligence, because it is the opposite.
