I think it's publicly available as a DVD. First of all, this feeling is a good propaganda film shown to the Aussie audience of the war, so it is not considered a serious retelling of Tobruk. In the first half of 3/4 there are very dry things in Australia, I think, like many American warfare films, where the recruits come together, the man is so tall. When we arrive in Africa and Tobruk, it's a pretty bad and low budget. The scenes of the DVD copy battle scenes were almost completely black. Take a look at this if you need to, but be prepared to use fast forward because I doubt you can do it in a few minutes. I enjoyed much more of the Italian "El Alamien battles" cheese, too, and Richard Burton made the African theater war flick, which was a good "desert racing", this movie is just a real-time piece and should have stayed at this time, does not hold well today (I doubt it was also highly regarded). I say the same thing about my American wars, so do not take it personally to Aussies (I love Australia, I was there twice!).
