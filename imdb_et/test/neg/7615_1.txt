I've been and have been a serious collector of Christmas-related movies, TV shows, special offers for holidays and more than 24 years. Please note my warning and do not be misled by the pound comments and media hype regarding this movie. It's not Muppett's movie because we've known them and are definitely NOT kids. The fact that it was produced for large TV channels is not surprising given their current level of performance. What I find difficult to believe is that Jim Henson's organization was so small to reach this Christmas birth. I wish I had read that I would have read what warned me before I wasted this hard earned money in that piece of trash.
