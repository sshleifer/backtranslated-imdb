Agustus and Call really did nothing? Why did they heroes do nothing but when they got to the dead sons. What was the purpose of this exhibition? I was very disappointed. I was expecting more action, more story, and seeing the birth of Heros and the Great. Instead, I saw very little, like Agustus and Call, where the Indian story is a great Indian chief. <br /> <br /> I'm not even sure that history is even very close. They did very little to show why Texans and Comanche fought against each other. <br /> <br /> The only good part of this movie was Zhan, who played Gust very well and is a great actor. A lot of good story that could have been destroyed. It was sad and I wish I hadn't watched it.
