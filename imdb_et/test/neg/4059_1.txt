This is definitely the sequel to WORST I've ever seen, and I've seen many of these conclusions. The plot is just ridiculous. I can also catch the ball and drive around in the field. Why can't I play Superbowl? Yes, I know this movie was meant for kids, but there are only a few plots that even kids can understand is completely stupid and unreal. The first Air Bud movie was pretty good, but it was a collapse. Disney loses it. When I checked who won the Razzie Awards, I'd give it one pair. Good day! =)
