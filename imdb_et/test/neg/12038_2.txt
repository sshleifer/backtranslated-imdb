The Chicago couple, Dillon and Dougherty, are mistakenly accused of killing their daughter. People are starting to wonder if they did it. The police are investigating and finding suspicious evidence. The couple is outraged by the public and accused of being pressed. Prisoners speculate that they are Satanists and have ritually murdered their daughter. They are accused and prosecuted. They are represented by lawyers looking for the public, who give them bad advice and give them $ 100,000. The evidence against them is twisted or hidden by the police. Work on sexual abuse is being presented. Their second child is taken from them and placed in a nursing home. Dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to find her child's removal. The decision he did not do, but he did it. He goes to the slams with a 45-year sentence. <br /> <br /> In the last third of the movie, where Dillon Prison and Dougherty thought about what to do next, we see people who are now slowly antagonizing the pair. Witnesses admit that they were lying. Other facts show that they eventually lead to Dillon release. The killer has never been found, although the film gives us a thorough blow as a plausible perp. <br /> <br /> It's smart from start to finish. Nothing seems to be right for the couple. Oh, there are some happy moments, maybe a party where everything is happily together and crushing joy or some evidence is discovered and people hug each other. But it will never be long before someone gets more bad news behind the door and all faces are frozen in tragic unbelief. (Usually, abandonment is blocked as follows.) Moving tragedies are not necessarily wrong, although I can't imagine the joy we see from people. There are also many tragedies in Shakespeare. I think the interesting thing about any tragic stories is how they are spoken. "Oh, but I'm stupid!" Romeo cries after killing Julia's brother. Here we have Dougherty, who runs in the hospital through a corridor, shouting, "Where is my child?" The story is not unambiguous or ironic - as I am sure there must have been actual events on which it is based. People are either good or bad here. Or else they are bad, then they become good. <br /> <br /> The aim of the movie is not to explore the human question or how things work. Its purpose is to reduce tears slightly. Participants offer first-rate role models. I don't remember the last movie I saw so many tears. There are tears. Rain showers. Cascades of them. Their real Niagara. Lake Lacrymos from them. <br /> <br /> Well, I give one example of the effectiveness with which the film is designed. Dillon and Dougherty hire a Chicago police who works as a private detective (Ed Asner). Asner is sympathetic to them, but he has not really achieved much. He seems to be in the film not because of his importance in the case, but because he is able to offer the victim a couple of philosophies - "Learn to live with it", which is okay - and because he has colorectal cancer so we can look at him to take his medicine , doubling pain and finally losing. <br /> <br /> What is depressing about the film is that, by focusing so heavily on couples' suffering, it goes aside from the most important issues it raises - the rumor function of private life. <br /> <br /> Gossip is a strange thing. If we call it "rumor", it is bad, but if we call it "public opinion", it sounds at least acceptable. Of course, we have all the convictions that may be justified or not. (As I write, Michael Jackson is turned to the court where he is accused of being a young boy, and I don't know how many of us have rejoiced and immediately assumed he was a pedophile.) But blemishes are not all bad. It's like water. When properly managed, it is community property. We need rumors to keep each other in line. This will help us maintain public order. But like water during a flood or tsunami, it is destructive in the village if it is out of control. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is okay if you don't look too much for human nature. It is so wise that it is difficult to argue with this goal.
