After watching Steven Spielberg's version of World War II in theaters, I was hooked on this topic. I can think back to my favorite places, people can evaporate, people panic, fire, explosions, all this was so big ... <br /> <br /> So a few weeks later I'll enter my video store and I see David Michael The Latt version of World War II is on the shelf. "Couldn't get into the DVD that it's fast?" I told myself. I read the back of the case and instead saw Thomas Thomas Howell. "Oh, I remember her out of the way!" So I thought it might have been a try. <br /> <br /> I was wrong, wrong. As soon as I looked at the opening credit, I looked at them forever, knew something was wrong. Something started to disappoint me in this movie and it did. The whole film bumped like a cheesecake that remained in the refrigerator for 10 years. Actresses, special effects (the things of a stupid tripod when people evaporate, they become orange skeletons) and most of all it didn't get as interesting as the Spielberg version, the plot was boring and there were only 3 destruction scenes! What the hell? I was so bored that I had to move the movie forward quickly until I found something that was far from interesting. And there was nothing really. Spielberg's version comes out at the end of this month, buy it! Please, please, please! Stay away from this mess before it hits us all!
