When I was young, I was a big fan of Chuck Norris. I first started out all my old movies so I could see them through the eyes of adults. I remember being particularly fond of it, and I thought it was one of his best. Now that I'm a little older, I can say that although it's a medium, I still consider it one of his best films. With an active stretch in Norris, a policeman is haunted by his involvement in arresting and capturing a dangerous serum murder film. Serial Killers are all the rage nowadays, and people would like to think of them as the 90th invention. On the other hand, it is good to see where the current generation has risen from the 70's and 80's millennial films (as well as the stem n 'slashers). Although Norris tries to worship and laugh at humor as well as any form of human compassion, no one can do the same thing with Chuck. Being a big fan of Steve James, I can recommend this movie, a delta for the legend Billy Drago, and see Mitch's role in supporting The Blue Brothers. Not great, but it's better than anything in Norris in the 90s.
