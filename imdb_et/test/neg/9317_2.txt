Help! Again, Paul Schrader has sabotaged his intentions of boring, pedantic storytelling. I organized a vacation, so I saw this "world premiere". What's wrong! Why did Schrader even want to do an exorcism? High intentions are good, but if I wanted to have a 2 hour theological stroke, I would visit my sibling Sunday school. Father Merrini's struggle for faith, as it was presented on his younger days, is a potentially interesting topic. But the exorist film needs more! Consistently dirty presentation with ridiculous special effects makes strange production. Who is this movie? I didn't bother to see the Harlin version, but at least they tried to offer some visceral excitement. <br /> <br /> The exorcist series has been quite strange. The first film was great, but every sequel has been unpopular and meaningless. Why do they continue to do them? I think Schrader did so to get a lot of money. But why should we go?
