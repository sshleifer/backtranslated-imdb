A movie that tries to be suspicious is simply uninteresting. This happens quite often. Not only is Dark Harbor not interesting, but it is very badly done. The scene after the scene touches an otherwise superfluous assumption. A distressed couple picks up a stranger in trouble to find more problems. Dark Harbor adds, but never adds, its story. I was hoping that, like other movies, the blast will finally explode. It's never. Also, the symbols are not continuity from scene to scene. They can act in one way in a single scenario, but then act in a completely different way in another scene. First of all, you think they're just out of character, but in the end you realize they're not characters at all. They are just the final twist props. The last ten minutes are trying to be shocking. Instead, it is quite flat and uninteresting. The only thing that was shocking to me was that the movie ended up. In less than ninety minutes, the movie is still too long. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those low-budget gems. It's a counterfeit watch that breaks as soon as you get home.
