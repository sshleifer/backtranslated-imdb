This film talks about the escaped black slaves who found themselves in the 17th century as a free man in their mountain area in Brazil. The story is interesting and refreshing. But this movie - like a movie - is terrible. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is not music of time or tribal music. It is African-Brazilian pop music dating back to the early 1980s. Battle scenes are fighting cheese pop rhythms sounds that are best suited for disco or bad police. Of course, these words are a slave heroism in folk tea. Special effects are absurd. Instead of relying on the mysticism of African religion and atavistic beliefs, they simply make the film cheap. They are absolutely unbelievable, and I just don't think about blood simulations. <br /> <br /> Life in Palmares could not be as depicted in the film. For this society, as shown in the film, there is a one-piece beanie, a one-piece afro-pop festival. Moreover, it is almost embarrassing to see how the director plays black clichés, such as talented singers and dancers who just want to be happy. He depicts everyday life as a dance party, where the liberated slaves paint bright colors and rotate around the 80s pop music strains. On the other hand, they have plenty of beautiful food, but the viewer hardly sees the job. The king penetrates into private ownership in hackneyed and clichéd ways. When a man complains that people take the vegetables that he has grown for many months, the king says, "What comes from the land belongs to everyone if the land is not owned by anyone. I'm glad I learned about this episode in history, but I'm relieved that such low-production film and the fact that such worn-out stereotypes are trading are unlikely to be made today.
