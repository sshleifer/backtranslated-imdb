Terrible "comedy", where a beautiful, crazy woman (Liv Tyler) "comedy" destroys the lives of three men (Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser and John Goodman). Dillon hires him to kill him (Michael Douglas). What happens to comedy? The year 2001 has brought some of the worst comedies (Silverman, Sugar and Spice, Freddy Got Fingered, Tomcats, etc.). It's one of the worst. There is nothing there, repeat, not one funny moment. Jokes are either stupid, uncomfortable, dirty or real. Also in this garbage, women have a strong hatred - the only main female character (Tyler) is a sex object. Finally, extreme, bloody violence is thrown away. The only acceptable moments come from Reba McEntir as a psychiatrist and Andrew Dice Clay in two roles - both in psychics. Dillon, Goodman and Reiser have been struggling all the time for a low career - the only way to go. And Bad Tyler! Did he finish up with intelligent independent movies for that? If DOUGLAS ???? What was he when he agreed? Perfect piece of piece - to be avoided ALL COSTS !!!!!!!!!!
