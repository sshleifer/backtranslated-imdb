I have to admit that I am not a big fan of Satanic horror movies, and it seems that I feel less and less every time I see a new one, and it's not really surprising to watch movies like Satan's fraternity! Despite the low rating of IMDb, I was surprised to hear good things about this movie and my expectations rising. It turned out to be a big mistake because it is this film that his rating shows it is very bad! The plot is your main Satanist group that causes problems, and we focus on a small town where people are murdered and kidnapped, and it's not clear why. Of course, there are Satanists behind it and this is bad news for a mother, father and daughter on a journey that is trapped in a mysterious city. I had the feeling that this film could be the same as the sad Satan, which is "The Fury of Rain", and although it is not as stupid as Robert Fuest's later film, it is not much better. The plot seems to be quite on the ground, but it is also quite boring and I can't say I enjoyed it at all. Satan's fraternity probably has fans, but I'm not one of them; this is a movie that I see no reason to recommend ...
