May 2: Someone clicked on 11 NO and then made 15 more of the last 15 comments: almost as funny as this turkey! <br /> <br /> May 1: <br /> <br /> As I write it, I am still very impressed with what must be the funniest thriller I've ever seen. I have a big paw, but I try and calm down. (It's hard to write if your nose breaks with your finger and your mouth spills the sporadic dragon on your keyboard.) A couple of young women who just came back from the bus will drive by bus. A couple of young men join them. But the bus is not really a taxi service: it's a robbery. (Don't slip!) Its leader has been part of an organized "white slave" gang who pulls young women from airports, and they've done it for five years. (Don't laugh.) Five years at SAME airport, without the police or even the FBI ever getting this wind. (Pole giggling, please.) Apparently, dozens of women will disappear for years and years in the same exact place - and no one will notice this trend. Is the FBI incompetent? The "Shuttle" world seems to consist of three types of people: easily robbing blondes, fools / comics / invisible FBI agents and all kinds of psychotic gangsters (who hate the sexy blondes with tattooed backside). <br /> <br /> This leader has barely been alive with this single mission, but he has done it - I repeat - for five years without killing or losing one of his limbs. (Stop laughing ...) Did I mention that the driver is immortal? Do I have to mention this? We all know that film psychologists have immortal DNA. You can tow them, bump them against the walls of the buses repeatedly, pamper them with a soft hammer, nail your nails to the nine-inch nails ... hell, you could shut your hand with the grenade in the middle of a Hollywood psycho mouth and just escape with little scratches. No, the driver is not Satan, or even a small demon, but just a normal Hollywood psycho with better survival than the biggest, most important sewer barge. <br /> <br /> Basic plot view: The man loses all his fingers on one side in a silly scene. (Magical bus that counts and follows the thoughts!) Passengers are trying to escape. They can't. They get hurt. They break. They claim. They're trying to escape. They can't. They get injured. They claim. They're trying to escape. They can't. They get injured. They're trying to escape. They can't. They're trying to escape. Robbers can pull a gun from the driver! Unfortunately, they don't kill him because the golden Hollywood rule of Gifty-like pacifism prohibits them from doing so. (No strangulation.) One of the other passengers is a gang! (Stop laughing.) She plays an actor who studied at Rob Zombie / John Travolta school, where there was excessive activity and a stupid career. He threatens rape. Later, one of the gals hits the head, more than ten times ... very hard. Only seconds later, he regains consciousness. Yes, he will survive. (Immortal, remember?) He'll be killed a little later. (No idea how! He shouldn't be able to kill.) Robbers claim. They're trying to escape. One of them escapes! Unfortunately, the psychos are too much like God so they can't catch their catch again. The game starts again: passengers are trying to escape. They can't. They break. They look at the gap. They get hurt. They're trying to escape. They can't. They get hurt ... <br /> <br /> You get the picture. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I believe that stunned, heavily disoriented, inebriated snail would have escaped their nincompoop prisoners easily. There were so many options. At one point, these worshiping psychologists (remember: five years!) Are even at the grocery store of one of the abductors! He leaves a message to the police. But yes ... you guessed it: this fancy fairy tale for a US city is not a police. <br /> <br /> And as you thought the film had no load - even when Luc Besson and Brian De Palma joined forces to give the manuscript a hand - that is. Girls are kidnapped to be sent to some remote island (?) And this is achieved by transporting them as cargo. Apparently, this fancy America has no FBI, no police or any border issue. But it has immortal criminals with more luck than twenty lottery winners. One blonde had her billionth chance to kill the driver, but she failed. How is it that their funny thriller victims never try to end their immortal opponents when they are laid and injured on the floor? I think I answered it myself: they are immortal! Why try it, he had to think ... <br /> <br /> So why was one blonde wiped with death and the other dipped and spent alive (with a kitty nest box and a more fun picture from Demi Moore Basic School pictures )? Could this be a tattoo? I think they killed the more beautiful, but it's just me. Was his tattoo ugly? <br /> <br /> Could it be that I don't care? Why should I look for the logic of imbeciles made by the silhouettes? Besides, how do I even think straight when I laugh so hard on the time?! <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a 21st century horror / thriller, a mobile phone is not working ... Maybe this invincible gang will control not only the FBIs, the police and the customs, but also the satellites in space. <br /> <br /> Do I have to write this out? Robbing people is much easier. And more intelligent people who should make movies. Give the idiot to the camera and he puts the egg every time ... The answer that the eternal mystery came first: the head of the egg or the birds.
