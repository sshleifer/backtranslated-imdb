I'm a big fan of Patricia Hodge and Mariam Margolyes, so I looked at this example A&E a few years ago. The show was strange at least to say, but I gave him the opportunity because I liked these actors. It must be one of the worst examples I've ever seen. I don't look at it again and definitely won't waste money buying a video. The story of this TV version is ridiculous and just stupid! "Kicker" (red) comes when Ruth has surgery on the bones of his legs. This kind of crap belongs to James Bond and Sci-Fi movies. If this version is right for the book, I will not check the book from my local library! The American version came out a few years after I saw this original. To my surprise, the Americans were right this time because their version with Meryl Streep and Roseanne is laughing and quite funny. When playing laughs the story works.
