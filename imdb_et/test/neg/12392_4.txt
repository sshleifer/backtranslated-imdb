Grosse Pointe Blank was really far below the average movie. His hit man theme is very dry and is rather a romantic comedy than a hit man's thriller. Operation is very normal. From time to time, the performances are embarrassing and, in many letters, seem to be "eccentric" and it bothers me very much. The whole reunion and "Wow, I haven't seen you in 10 years!" The element is extremely fun and many scenes are dragging, especially to the closer to the end when they are at the actual reunion party, and characters are passed through all their former classmates individually greeting them. It all seemed very sticky, pointless and poorly filling. <br /> <br /> The role of Dan Akroyd as a rival killer is very small. It seems that he appears only once at the beginning and at the end of the "final show", which is extremely resurrected but does not offer at all. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also very mediocre. Most of the songs on this film have been out in the 1980s and two or three are very bad. Famous songs over a fairly large movie only adds to the negativity surrounding this film. <br /> <br /> I could go on and talk about how tiny things were annoying and very bad, such as the very few actions that came and went very quickly, the lack of character development, and how bad this whole thing in this department was built so half the time you forget that Cusak's character is even a hit person, because the element is so non-existent <br /> <br /> Even though comedy thinks it's funny; but it is not. I never filmed it during this movie. Of course, I can smile now and again, but my only real feeling was good when I realized that the movie was almost over! <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time with Grosse Pointe Blank, despite the relatively high (but badly wrong) IMDb rating. I've seen movies that are better than this movie, which has a lower rating on this site, telling you there are better movies. Just don't worry about it.
