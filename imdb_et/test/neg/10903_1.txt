I won't break it for you. While you might be able to take less care if it were corrupted (you know what I look after), Poor's story. B-rated film quality. Typical horror-stupid situations - rare timing. I should know if they try to put a lot of leap in their ad or even add "quotes". Just tells me that the movie bombed a lot of time. And they're just trying to pull everyone out so they can even break the cost of making that bomb. I wish I could take it back while watching this time. I was stupid and thought there was just something big around the corner. But I fell down. I usually don't waste my time adding comments to one movie. It's actually my second post. I just felt that maybe some of you could get rid of the waste of money that had a bunch of hype.
