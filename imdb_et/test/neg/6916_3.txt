(Some Spoilers) PRC, dr. Igor Markoff, who is not really dr. Karkoff, but a scammer who took his identity back to Europe. Actual Dr. Karkoff had a dr. Markoff's wife, who led him to kill Dr.Markoff, and then his wife, Lenore, was infected with acromegaly, which made her look like an "elephant man" sister. This was done so that no one would ever look at him and he could keep Lenore himself; but the disturbed Lenore later got to his crazy wife by killing himself. <br /> <br /> This nut, fake Dr. Markoff, will meet Patricia Lawrence, Wanda McKay, one night at the theater, where her father Tony Lawernce, world famous pianist, Ralph Morgan will give a concert. Predicted by lovely Patricia, a dead woman's dead ring, Lenore Dr. Markoff has become obsessed with her and goes to extreme lengths to marry, although she doesn't want to do anything to her. <br /> <br /> Tony is trying to fall in love with Patricia by sending her flowers with syrups of love that were added as many as five times a day, and Tony is going to see Mad Dr Mankoff saying she's ending her daughter's annoying. This is when Tony comes out to be a good doctor who has injected him with an acromegaly dose that makes him a somewhat ugly companion. His hands and body are swelling and unable to play his beloved piano. To Tony, Dr. Adams, Sam Flint, says that the only person who can treat her from this terrible illness is another, then Dr. Markoff! the person who gave it to him. The film has the usual sub-lines of Dr. Markoff's assistant with Maxine, Tala Birell, who is also in love with her jealous fake doctor who played for Patricia. There's also Dr. Markoff's glowing butler, Glenn Strange, who, like his pet gorilla, is just a big clumsy caffe who can't even put under Maxine, less than half the size. Strangely, the head hits beating and Patricia's boyfriend Bobby Blake, Terry Frost. As far as Gorilla is concerned, she will only be a big hairy wimp if she tries to do it in Maxine and is a pet dog Ace and locked up. Dr Markoff, in his despair to Patricia to marry him, allows him to cure his father just to break his father's chains and the resulting fight with Markoff's dead gun. <br /> <br /> This confusion has a happy ending for Maxine, who knew so much about treating Markoff's acromegaly as she did, injecting Tony with a secret serum that made her as good as new. The movie ends, as it started, Tony playing the piano in a packed and cheerful house in a local theater.
