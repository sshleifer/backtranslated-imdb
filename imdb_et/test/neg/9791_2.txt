Apparently, SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last film in the role of Julius Harris. I have not seen all of his films, but Julius Harris was in many good films and I remember him best in "Live and Let Die" where he played Tea-Hee and was full of Voodoo references, something that is common here in South Florida ! I always thought LIVE AND LET DIE was a great movie because it had some atmosphere and mystery, unlike most 007 movies. In SHRUNKEN HEADS, Julius Harris has returned to his Voodoo personality! He has a great style of mystery and occultism, and his role in this film is great. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is something comedy. SPOILERS: Three children who look like they were cast by LITTLE RASCALS were killed by a neighborhood hoodlum who looks like FAME was fired. or DICK CLARK AMERICAN BANDSTAND. In other words, these children give another dimension to LOW BUDGET. Julius Harris goes to the tomb - the funeral home, cuts off the three heads of the child (and no one notices) and then takes them to his apartment society, where he has a huge boiling liquid casserole. Three heads are thrown in with some herbs, spices and Voodoo items. At some point, Mr. Harril has a little head on the boards and he flows their blood, and they come to life as talking heads! They can fly, make fun, roll their eyes and revenge the evil doers. Usually they look pretty funny around, but the effect is not bad. For some reason, one child always has a blade that can be turned on and uses it to slice people's neck and cut tires. This movie is weird and funny, but only the first time you see it. Meg Foster is in this movie, and he looks thicker than Rosie O'Donnell and Meg plays a male member of local gangsters. Weird movie.
