This DVD is barely 30 minutes long and has boring interviews showing that Slipknotia's average is about 30, but these aspects are the least problematic here. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that Slipknot is one of the least talented metal bands to sell over 100,000 units. (The only reason I say "one" instead of "" is because System Of A Down is even worse.) Like Ed Ge's girlfriends, this band's music is assembled from old old metal clinics, which must be found in both their picture and ultrasound. in music. In fact, their picture is fun; their videos are like haircut extracts, so they fulfill at least some purpose as entertainment. <br /> <br /> Their music, however, does not consist of any quality - just clustered, heard-those-million-times-played-only-guitar-neck reefs that are in no way interconnected and are randomly grouped to to form "songs" that have no cohesion, not prominence, nothing. But if the riffs are really bad, the vocals are even worse: the Slipknot singer has a stereotypical "bad" exhaustion - 90% of all modern metal bands - but that's nothing compared to this cheat hick trying to sing! But what could be expected? The Nu Metal Handbook, Rule No.3, says quite clearly: "You alternate between songs and songs. Please note that these two styles are not well mixed, because most of your fans are so toned - they love you even if you *** * microphone. "Slipknot is their absolute worst case when their" singer "starts to" melodies ". <br /> <br /> But back to your picture. It has been stolen, copied, ripped, nicked, borrowed without asking anyone other than Mr.Bungle. You never heard of them? Of course not. You only listen to nu-metal and Mr.Bungle are far from it and anyway. They also suffered masks - grotesque, horrors, similar to Slipknot, which I could add - in the late 80s and early 90s. This band, chaired by Mike Patton of Faith No More, never hit a big one because their music was not directed at medium music fans (to put it mildly). <br /> <br /> So, in principle, Slipknot is not even in the original picture department. They have nothing new to offer, which is why many years are forgotten: when masks are boring for the legions of fans of their zit, when Slipknot is forced to compete in the music market only with his general music. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Mike Patton, it is interesting that many of the nu-metal bands often had a significant impact on their song. Predictably - and fortunately - Patton hasn't attracted this and has denied that he is proud to have influenced one of the worst metal sub-musicians ... <br /> <br /> By saying this, enjoy this short DVD and cheap the excitement that it can give to the untrained side and the boring eye ... And then polish these Slipknot posters, because in a few years no one will care for them, the poor. <br /> <br /> Having seen Corey in the documentary "Get Thrashed", I finally understand why she is wearing a mask: she is a blue ginger in front of her baby, looking like Dave Mustaine's younger brother! Not quite scary. <br /> <br /> For more about my music world, please visit: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/1 <br /> <br /> Please punish me, very HARD, by clicking "No" below.
