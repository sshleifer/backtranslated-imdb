MGM-A budget with high diameter treatment is mistaken, inaccurate, dirty and endless lunacy. Kate Hepburn plays a bride who thinks that her rich, beautiful wife (Robert Taylor) is not her married but a psychotic killer. MGM's attempt at the Hitchcock thriller has been doomed from the outset to a scandalous, confusing, ridiculous script and Hepburn's idiotic casting of a threatened woman who is afraid of her life (who could ever imagine Hepburn fearing?) Louis B. Mayer forgot to tell Vincent Minnell that he controls the thriller, not musical. Taylor is embarrassing. Only Robert Mitchum, who is also type-proof as a good boy, retains his dignity in a quiet and low-key performance. Karl Freund's tempting cinematography creates pictures of beautiful beauty - and it was wasted on the wrong film. End result: Metro "Parnell" in the 1940s.
