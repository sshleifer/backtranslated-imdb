I was expecting this film to be shown before the elections. CBS last shot up the bush. This movie was just terrible, but I still look at it. ** Small spoiler ** I think CBS got the same people who "gave" a memo to make a semi-cut. What is a bad guy talking about? Can an actor be more artificial or more dialogue than Ed Wood's film. Who ever came with this script? If you want to see a decent class B catastrophe, look at the earthquake, flood, etc. Tip for CBS Avoid us with this mess. Give us CSI again. Better action and more credible.
