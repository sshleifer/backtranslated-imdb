In the 1940s, Lake Veronica made a meteoric rise to the film's stardom, thanks to its shameful beauty and its highly used "bacon" hairstyle. He played the opposite big names like Alan Ladd and Fredric March, scoring the screen progress in movies like "See Gun for Hire" and "I Married A Witch". She also kept her female stars, and she surprised her bitter navy sister "so proudly man" with her presentation. But the changing times and his own failures grabbed him and by the end of the decade his flowering had ended. Behind two failed marriages (and two more in the future), Veronica headed to New York, where he occasionally appeared on television and summer stockpile before he fell completely off the horizon. It was a brief big news when he found that he worked as a barman of a second level hotel in the early sixties. But now his long-term alcoholism and years of life have kidnapped his appearance. Without them, the public interest was lost publicly. He returned to the stage in various vehicles, but his success was minimal. Finally, he moved to Florida in Miami, where he lived relatively hidden. In 1966, he went to Canada with a covert film "Footsteps In The Snow" that had no US release. The following year, he discovered some industrial filmmakers who had long wanted to create a commercial feature. They approached him to mark his movie "Time Is Terror" and convinced him to invest in the project. As one author has said, "Once there was a queen of the film, it was". Surrounded by amateur performers and pathetic product values, he could not even rise to the minimum level at Miami. In the case of long frames, it is quite common and outdated in the neighborhood, poor Veronica did not work as much as walked through its part. Like a dirty doctor who has hit a successful formula for rejuvenating young people using carnivorous food, he is as bored as confused, his most inadvertently more entertaining moment when he is forced to ad-slip when he fights with rubber gloves. Support pain is not helpful at all, but promotes the plot, telling it to death. Apparently, the director Brad Grinter only called for the actors to move when the camera drew attention to them, there is no need to remember something to entertain (There is indeed one unintentionally entertaining scene involving a private detective / sister and body in a wheelchair preceded by '' Weekend Bernie's '' for nearly 20 years. ) According to Veronica himself, the film was postponed for three years, because no master picture was filmed. But in 1970, the manufacturing company scrapped it, changing the title of "Flesh Feast" and releasing the biography of the lake. And since the former leading women, such as Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and Olivia De Havilland, had unexpectedly revived their career in fears, this version of Veronica was promoted as a "comeback". This seems like a strange way for filmmakers, because it is unlikely that this young (young) audience did not know the quality film and did not care about who was Lake Veronica. As expected, he did nothing for Veronica's career and died in poverty three years later. The previous reviewer mentions a scene where a female detective nurse in a doctor's laboratory (observing a nearby morgue of body theft) helps her to cut body parts with a versatile driver. "Poor Mrs. Lustig," he sighs, "I hope he doesn't mind leaving his body to science." "Try not to think," advises the driver, cutting off. "I think you are right, Hans." stops detective / sister, "What is done is done." What a sad ending for a more memorable career.
