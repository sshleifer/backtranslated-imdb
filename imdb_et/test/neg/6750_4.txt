This was probably a low budget movie. It shows each scene. What's nice to see where it's done. Many movies were shot in Columbia, CA, Sierra Nevada, near Sonora, CA. Some of the movie was also shot near Jamestown, CA, Columbia. There is a railway museum in Jamestown and they used some old trains in the picture. "High Noon" was also taken in Jamestown, as well as "Back to the Future III".
