Sometimes I think somewhere in the "Lifetime" channel's office complex is a room where the writer hangs, on a big wheel wall - like a big six in a casino. The latter have lots of places to win even money, and fewer large sums, until there may be a couple who will pay the bigger bucks. <br /> <br /> But I imagine a channel wheel with about six different genres of this wheel, two of which have appeared most, called "Psychotic Neighbor" or "Hidden Past or Secret Spouse or Both". "Lifetime" movies have a few repetitive stories and these two seem to be the most common. <br /> <br /> The category "Spouse ..." may be a long-term spouse, but some people will appear or an event that indicates that a good husband was once a whore, a couple had been involved in bad behavior for some time or something else Against the background of what is expected, etc., etc., or, as in this flick, one of them has faced the most unfavorable goals of marriage. <br /> <br /> One constant, in all of their genres, is that the husband or other men are usually helpless, empty, and slowly that you have a clue as to what happens in hell up to the peak or, at best, in a very late procedure (except if the man is wrong). That's not the case here. <br /> <br /> Whether a reference to miscreant may be a "neighbor", or as that offer, "a woman," is always exciting, how easily, successfully and effortlessly they continue their dirty acts. They manipulate many others, embrace them as necessary, accept various things and juggle more than you can read - which is only successful just before the end. <br /> <br /> Leading here, as many of this channel's movies are old hands. I noticed that another movie he celebrated was titled "Perfect Neighbor". <br /> <br /> Finally, the terrible "perfect spouse" of this flick sends those who have more knowledge and simplicity on their roads than the most experienced competent person in the Don Corleone family can accumulate. And I couldn't imagine that Jack Nocholson's Melvin Udall's character was "as good as it could be," along with his massive OCD misery, could give antiheroine advice to help deal with that obsession that was the basis for it.
