"The Story of James Dean" is introduced as "A Different Film," explaining: "The existence of the leading character of this film has been made possible by the use of existing film material, voice recordings and new techniques - dynamic photo exploration." The only "recordings of his voice" are remarkable , is one short recording of Mr. Dean who visits his family in Indiana; he wanted to save his grandfather's Cal Dean's family memories because he was playing the same name as "Cal in the East of Eden". Dean asks if Cal Dean was interested in art and learns that the relative was the auctioneer. James Dean was interested in art and probably had a warm relationship with him. This is the only 100% accurate revelation in this documentary. James Dean was interested in art and had a warm relationship with his family. <br /> <br /> The amazing "Screen Test" / "Extract from" East of Eden will appear at the end of the movie. It's a black and white scene between Dean (like Cal Trask) and co-star Richard Davalos (like Aron Trask). Dean is at his best. If this scene only appeared here and the film "East Eden" was not finished, this documentary would be an important, high-ranking film. However, a scene that is perfect for "10" should be considered an extra "Eden from the East". Dean's Traffic Safety Film is also worth it. <br /> <br /> Interviews with family and friends are welcome. My favorites were the boy (Lew Bracker) who passed through the Dean box and the Dean family. Aunt Ortense was not enough and Dean's letter to her little cousin was very nice. Reading Dean messages would have been appreciated. Dean's unknown writer's friend seemed to be a better doctoral thesis for the film; filmmakers could consider developing it as the main focus. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman's Guide to Reading Martin Gabel's Stewart Stern script is terrible. What did they mean? Perhaps, because of the proximity of Dean, filmmakers can be forgiven. Don't wait for "The James Dean Story" at all. This film is more about the impact of Dean on people (both fans and filmmakers) than on man. This is very clearly the beginning of the "legend" of making James Dean's myth. Tommy Sands sings "Let Me Be Loved". The narrative refers to Dean as "God" with godly air. Dean family shots seem to "know" when he dies, is really sad. <br /> <br /> The James Dean Story (8/13/57) Robert Altman ~ James Dean, Martin Gabel, Richard Davalos
