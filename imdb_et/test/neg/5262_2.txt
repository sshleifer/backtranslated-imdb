This movie is a very strange mix of genres - humor in the toilet and action in one. It really doesn't really pull out - it should have kept one genre. The best thing I can say about the film is that this dog is cute. <br /> <br /> The most annoying sequence is in the middle of the movie when Moses (Sandler) and Carter (Wayans) decide to stop at the hunting house / motel. I'm not quite sure what the point of this sequence is - it seems extremely infinite. The hunter owner ("Charlie") is a very funny man. For some reason, Moses starts chatting with Charlie for porn, capturing, homosexual sex, sex ... Charlie's photo of her "wife" seems to be dressed by Charlie. There is no reason for this truly juvenile dialogue and scene. Anyway, it seems that the whole scene is aimed at the moment when naked Moses arrives with Carter's gun on his butt and Charlie sees them through the window. It all tells a schoolboy about humor about homosexuality - scared and quarreled all at the same time - which I don't joke at all. <br /> <br /> I have a friend who is always on Adam Sandler's films. This is the first I've seen - after that I'm not sure if I want to see more. <br /> <br /> BTW, this is my husband's account - he's seen Happy Gilmore and tells me it's pretty good - maybe I should give Sandler another chance. <br /> <br /> Countess Skogg
