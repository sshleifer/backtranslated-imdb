I wish I could have given it to zero. Of course I admit that I picked it up wrong, I thought it was a Spielberg version. A smart marketing project that releases it now and is visible in the video shop. But I was ready to give it anyway - I wish I hadn't. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? I have read some other comments here and I have to say that I disagree with someone who thinks that some actor was good - even Mr Thomas Howell. None of the shows were good. None. <br /> <br /> Even if the actor was decent, the dialogue is terrible! "Ginorm" and "dick skinners" just don't cut it. <br /> <br /> Now that the story is fine, it was terribly customized and kept by a 5-year-old. The main character is constantly running into situations that are so comfortable - or at least that the movie was edited together. For example, he is trying to find a place called New Hope to find his brother. During a short break, someone gives her instructions to New Hope. What the hell is that? When he reaches New Hope, he just happens to be a deadly brother. Then there is the part where he has traveled from his destination day by day, and it just happens that he is driving a car where his wife and son traveled. He went to the other side, then, how was this car finally coming where he was? She has a black backpack that appears randomly and disappears all over the film. There are parts of the film where the characters wake up in the morning and then two seconds later, at night - or worse the next day. I cannot forget the main character and the preacher who for some reason has not failed through the house floor - we will not know later that the alien has landed. It reminds me of the moment they walk and suddenly find themselves under the alien they didn't notice. What the hell, foreigners are like two stories with big bodies and several feet - how could they not? There is one point where an alien kills a random citizen, probably spitting him with some spam, but you never see what it just looks like boys. Special effects are generally terrible. The whole movie is like a bad "train wreck". When we finally get to the end, after that man tries to find his family in DC, they just appear. No questions asked. Just oh there you are so happy - the end. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry if my review worsens a little, but this movie was so bad that it was hard for me to arrange my contempt. Please save yourself some time and don't look at this crazy-looking movie. This is probably the worst film I've ever seen. I'd rather have become a root canal - it would have been less painful.
