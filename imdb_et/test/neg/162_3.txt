I just watched The Edge of Love (by the way, this is one of the worst titles so far) and it seemed like a chore. Looking at Keira Knightly's unlikely, skeletal character, the film became thicker. <br /> <br /> It looked at me four nights to see that it was so boring. The only good thing was Cillian Murphy. She is always good / credible and in many films it has been taken seriously. However, it wasn't good enough for him. <br /> <br /> Aside from unlikely characters, the boring story was also emotionally pleased with the plot. I felt like I spent my time doing something (what I did). I should have done a smart thing to turn it off, but I kept it for Cillian Murphy and for great cinematography.
