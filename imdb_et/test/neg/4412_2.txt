Native Chief's son is mistaken for his father's death. The doctor of the evil witch instructs him to fill. Then he comes back as a slaughter tree (!), Tabanga. Well, what can you say about such a movie? When it was meant to be a horror film, obviously it was a bad assessment. And for comedy, it's still not funny enough. I don't know why people do such movies. I think you have to look at it quietly. Or maybe you want to see an incredible "monster" tree that gives a new dimension to "slow death". Or maybe you want to look at the great acting skills of all involved. (Ms Kilgore!) Or the dialogue and scenario that the Academy's awards were ignored this year. <br /> <br /> "Shouldn't we try psychoanalysis of this tree? Maybe his mother was afraid of oaks."
