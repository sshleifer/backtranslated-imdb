I rented this movie because I love Kristanna Loken and I was watching her on many TV shows and because she is 15 years old with her new T3 movie today, I wanted to see what other films she's been. <Br /> <br /> She's just acting. Not good or bad. He compensates everything, being extremely proud. Rodney Rowland was a surprise for the hero. He gave the only strong good in the film. He is a very good actor and should probably be a star of activities. <br /> <br /> In addition to being OK for Kristan and Rodney being really good at this movie, it's the purest form of garbage. <br /> <br /> The computer hacker grabs the ground plane system and uses the joystick using a nuclear power plant ..... or something. And, of course, there are heroes who stand their way and destroy their game. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst scripts I've ever seen. <br /> What is shocking is that this film was made in 2001 and it is too much like the tragedies of September 11th. <br /> <br /> Why do they make such films first? <br /> <br /> Panic * - one star (waste of too good actors) (also a waste of time) (also known as Air Panic)
