Is this movie as bad as some claim? I think this is the case. I did not intend to comment, noting that some comments have already been made, ranging from "terrible" to "almost not so bad ...". But I can't resist. <br /> <br /> What you do with the movie on the DVD cover. the phrase "I do the actual story of BArker and his boys ..." and the standard "any resemblance to real people ..." disclaimer in credits? I'm not naive, but in this case, it's pretty pretty relevant observations about this movie. <br /> <br /> Many comments say they are performances, they are quite terrible, Roberts, Russell, Milan and Stallone have something like 315 movies and TV shows. works the least. <br /> <br /> But dialogue ... is not my taste and sometimes endlessly funny. The arches of the story did not seem to be anything but the least necessary. violence and melodrama together. <br /> <br /> The direction and screen writing needs to be spoiled: Amyrill tends to see Ma Barker's violent mood and stop taking "The Girl!" Alyssa's ability to act ... some scriptwriter wrote this line or reaction and / or some directors shot it and said, "OK, that's good enough, don't have to try it again, it's plausible ..." One footnote: I did your copy for $ 1.99 or $ 2.99 in a discounted grocery package; driving time is shown as 91 minutes, and I note that runtime is listed in IMDb as 95 minutes. I don't know which 4 minutes I am missing, but I admit that if these 4 minutes were the right type in the right situation, my rating could join 3 or 4 out of ten. that's 1/10 what I have to vote for.
