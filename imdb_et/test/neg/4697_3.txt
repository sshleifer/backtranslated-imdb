I just saw, "Comedian." It was ... well. It kept me looking at the screen. It's just not the thing I like to pay to see $ 7. <br /> <br /> Now, don't make me wrong, it makes an excellent HBO feature. If it were something I would be watching on television, I would have tried. It gives an amazing look at what the comics go through before and after the stage. It cares about someone who likes watching comics. <br /> <br /> But when I go to movies, I like entertainment. I'm not educated there. Now I know what he likes for Jerry Seinfeld before he leaves the stage. But frankly, I just want to laugh at her jokes as something for that. <br /> <br /> Another thing: Onry Adams has a bad attitude; I look forward to seeing him take his order from Burger King before I see his HBO special. He was not funny. He's the kind of person you love to hate.
