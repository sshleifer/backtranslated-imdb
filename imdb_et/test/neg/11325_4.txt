. . . and it is only if you like beautiful women with nice, bumpy jugs that run around the so-called African jungle. So there is no problem for most men. <br /> <br /> I looked at it as one bundled package. Forget the plot that is basically just a weak style to get our heroine flashing on the screen with every opportunity. Just to give you a sense, our heroine swings from vines to viticulture and climbs every opportunity for animals without good reason to let you see your jug ​​in all corners. Again, there are no complaints. <br /> <br /> "Fighting Scenes" are ridiculous and boundaries are pornographic. Our heroine captured the films at least five times. Sometimes, when it comes to fighting, "fighting" means overcoming dirt, unbelievably looting and basically fighting like kittens. I'm surprised if the hair is not pulled. It's so bad that the main player had to remind the "fighters" that "I said the one who pulls the first blood!" to avoid watching fools any more. <br /> <br /> The witch doctor Kuku was a bloody shot. Being a big, soft bear from the start, he got from manic depression when he was caught and then directly into psycho. He spent all the muting lines of the film with no insignificant significance. Lake swim without good reasons. Yeah, that's a movie. <br /> <br /> Look at the beautiful Lian in your glorious glory. Even though the movie is more than 20 years old, you can't get older unless you look at blonde women to flash their beautiful jugs on the screen.
