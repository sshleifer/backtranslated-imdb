The only good part of this movie was the end. You know the part of the movie where the lights come and leave you home. No, no, it may be a bit tough - dancing in the movie was sensational, but unfortunately it is where the plot ended. As long as it was dancing and not to mention, the film went well. As for Chayanne's debut - not too bad, but hopefully his next film is a little deeper. As seen in the movie wait for rent or TV. Don't make the same mistake and pay 8.50
