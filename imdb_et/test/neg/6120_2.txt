For any wrestling fan, it's a wrestler to forget. There was no logic for races, some garbage tricks (clown and giant Gonzalez), it was a forgotten PPV that was rare for WWE (F). Hogan's logic, which won at the end of the world title, did not make sense, and many people feel that it alone helps to put spikes in PPVs. The meaningless tricks of the Roman soldiers, just some of the real bad wrestling (the worst competition), which is just a bad match (Scott Razor Ramon vs Bob Backlund, how do you have one of the greatest wrestlers, returning and working on his first wrestleman is facing a powerful wrestler who was at that time unbeatable), this is a PPV, which even WWE has ever recognized, was below expectations.
