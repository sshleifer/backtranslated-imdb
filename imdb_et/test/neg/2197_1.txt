We can conclude that there are 10 types of people in this world. <br /> <br /> Those who understand binary and those who don't. Those who understand binary will put this movie in their graves with hackers, while those who enjoy this movie will not mess with it. Anyway. <br /> <br /> To make the movie a contemporary movie with fiction. It has failed. Dreadful. Only 11-year-olds and parents can enjoy and only 30-year-olds and parents can be afraid that their identity will be taken. It disappears in the main market for the resale value (I look at it now it is more boring than when it was first released).
