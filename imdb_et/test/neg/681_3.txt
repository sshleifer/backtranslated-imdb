This documentary is a real problem. <br /> <br /> How lofty is it to make a documentary about your family? I understand that you think the topic is interesting. I was bored with it. It's not an exciting story for me, and I don't know why you think it would be. <br /> <br /> I don't want to come out, but I have to say: most of the people in this movie aren't just attractive. And that's OK, not everything is pretty beautiful. However, your camera technique to capture the lens on your face so you can't help but have an unpleasant look because it fills your 47-inch TV is not enjoyable. I had to protect my hand for half a time, I am warts, wrinkles, eyes and yellow teeth, really, I am not trying to inhuman, but pulling the camera back so that it wouldn't like the strangers to breathe my face. <br /> <br /> The camera works in this "movie" level of amateurs, this is a photo work that you see with your family on a picnic with a camera, no framing, no uncertainty, even a static frame is taken carelessly. if you do it for maintenance. <br /> <br /> I don't see honestly what this thing is about.
