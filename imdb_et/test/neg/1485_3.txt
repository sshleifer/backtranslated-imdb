Yes, the film was boring and uncomfortable. After a certain point, I wanted the croc to eat these people so we could get the movie over. <br /> <br /> The plot is that three Aussie take a small boat trip along the river. where the guide straps are with a gun. He says he just does it for insurance purposes, all the crooks have been hunting through this river. Croc eats it right away. Then the trio gets the wood up, the reptile began to flee. They spend most of the movie claiming the best way to escape. <br /> <br /> One of the survivors is expected to find a guide to the pistol and shoot the crocodile. Aww, they killed the only pleasant character of the movie! <br /> <br /> Where are Paul Hogan or Steve Irwin when you really need them?
