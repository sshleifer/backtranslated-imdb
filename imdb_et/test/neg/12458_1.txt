Why do people make bad movies? Did anyone who worked on the picture know that there was no point in making them? There's something in this picture that threw me away, besides finding this "movie" unrealistic, pathetic, and POOLLY ACTED. I admire them to try, but the "actors" in the movie seem to try hard from time to time, and no sign has any substance and says nothing lightly intelligent. This film deserves a null star. But I didn't have this option so it gets 1.
