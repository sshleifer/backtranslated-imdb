The only redemption factor in the film was that it was free on television and that it probably helped the Romanian economy. In addition, Hallmark has to reassess the division of this empire and perhaps keep its films in the strange love relationships between cancer-infected hemophilia in Mississippi. More detailed information on how this film is meaningless would give her a memorable impression. It wasn't. I remember watching it, vampires (some of them teenagers) and very bad copying. Anyone who worked on the film's copying line must be relocated to another sector of society ... maybe for food, deaf. If you have the opportunity to watch, just watch this movie because it makes so many other really bad movies back to the Oscar value. When you actually came to this movie profile, imagine it might be too late ...
