The idea of ​​the film was not too bad: the horror film was filmed in the maze of corn for Halloween. The bad part was dirty camera work, ten million strokes and a corn and a one and a half hour walk that this man took in the maze. Oh, I'm sorry, "corn". I took this film because it reminded me of the maze of corn where I live, and I thought it was cool. But with all this in mind, it seems that your average Joe could do the same idea and move on a lot. Bill Cowell's action was not too bad, in fact, I would say it was pretty good. But the lack of talents in his co-stars does not help his efforts. Here's the hope that her next movie will be swallowed more easily.
