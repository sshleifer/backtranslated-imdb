It's hard to decide what to say about it. It's not completely, a hundred percent bad. Though film-in-a-movie is incredibly bad, it is meant to be campy but a lost mile. I'm pretty sure it's deliberate. Danny Aiello is here perfectly suited and more or less pathetic in nature. Dyan Cannon played a small role. Clotilde Courau was impressive as the last twenty something girls. And Linda Carlson had a brave topless scene that she pulled out very well. <br /> <br /> So it's not all bad, but I don't think it will achieve its goals. All in all, it's definitely worth going on.
