If you liked William Hickey's "Prizzi Honor", he raises his character as Don Anthony's "Mob Boss". This is a very weak "godfather" satire with little laughter. Stuart Whitman looks puzzled at what he's doing in this shock shock? Morgan Fairchild's production is one of the best efforts of the film, and it's not just a sure sign. Eddie Deezen performs "Three Stooges" and a bad Woody Allen imitation. Fatally flawed, "Mob Boss" is so derived that boredom quickly transcends comedy and the film pulls on cars, hidden weapons in the restaurant bathroom and many other pointless. - MERK
