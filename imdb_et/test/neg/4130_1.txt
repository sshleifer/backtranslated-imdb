Fortunately, I watched this movie alone, allowing me to move faster (or most of the movies). OK, some are not all bad, partly with good photography (even some underwater scenes) and sometimes not too bad management. But it still does not save an incredibly bad script and worse. In addition, if I can't find the movies "hottie" to be all that, even the wannabe-sexy love that makes scenes, gets boring. Really boring! And for drama: You know it's always a bad sign if you don't like all those characters who really don't care about who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> If you are still tired of the Survivor reality series, you may like something in this movie. If not, stay well!
