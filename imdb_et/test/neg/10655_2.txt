Characterization of this film is one of the worst I've ever encountered. Dialogue is a subtle and clich√© disregard for extreme attention. None of the characters' faces have been formed at all - they are just surface details that aim to get a point across without really having to believe in a dialogue to support this point. Likewise, Chinese characters are a bit to be desired - I find it hard to believe that a Chinese father learns flawless English (or in one scene) from a book so that he can teach it to his daughter. Jr. <br /> <br /> A smile train is a great organization and it's a great idea to make a heartfelt film about what kind of program such a program can have on a child's life, but generally I found this film to be more frustrating than anything.
