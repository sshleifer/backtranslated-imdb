I do not worry about the wicked hosts, nor do I bother with the cynical, fair attitudes that those messengers take. <br /> <br /> I'm concerned that most episodes are fake. I wouldn't even be surprised if all the episodes were staged. So this is not an example of reality, but a lot worse than Oprah: garbage television with zero scores. Like the daily TV soap opera, but more activities and struggle and less plot. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite would have turned out to be great - if only it had been executed by the viewer. If only this idea were free from all the legal complications / aspirations that would really come from what is happening with real people, and which is finally said. So the only way to create this "" reality show "" was to get quite desperate participants and make them improvisation (and what merciful and convincing improvisation is most of the time!). Shouldn't it be obvious to anyone who has finished school? Most of the comments you read here do not even mean that it is fake, not to mention that it can be all. Desirable thinking or just unlimited naivety? <br /> <br /> Actors hired in this pathetic show are those out-of-the-box unemployed who are suddenly waiting on the table, eagerly waiting for a speech holiday (or a mess of it), that is when they finally get a chance to get several hundred bucks. I even knew one actress ("rogue" role) that I saw for years from "Jerry Springer Show". And I saw only 6-7 episodes of "Cheaters". How many of these losers are there who appeared in Springer and Cheaters, which I don't even know? <br /> <br /> But Cheaters and Springer are not fair to compare. Springer show is not all fake; most episodes are unstable - so often very fun. "Scammers" can't find any value if you're not in trouble with an actor and want to get advice on how not to act in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers use different (very cheap), transparent) loyalties to create the illusion of reality, to give their film material that is hardly documentary. But it's all in the vein. Finally, the more intelligent viewer looking for a train-wreck remains absolutely squat. "Professional wrestling" is more reliable.
