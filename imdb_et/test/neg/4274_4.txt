This film speaks of a young girl who lives with her rich relatives who love one of her cousins, and rejects an immoral defendant who brings problems to the family. After seeing the 1999 version and reading the book, I decided to look at the older version. I found it characteristic of Fanny, but it was also boring. Fanny's character played by Sylvestra Le Touzel was weak; he often seemed bad. I also didn't like Robert Bourbage, who played Henry Crawford. I couldn't imagine being interested in Fanny or her cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood, who played Mary Crawford, was fine, but the wig she wore was so ugly. I lost interest in my actions and I watched my wig. I waited for him to fall off his head. I also saw the slippers of her real hair sliding under the wigs.
