HANA-BI has many quiet moments and quite slow pace. Unfortunately, the viewer is left to think over the surface and annoying of the recently-watched scenes and many questions during many thoughtful interdotes. For example, why didn't a cyclist ride the ocean when he was in the sand and the tide came around him? He was not saved or hated. <br /> <br /> Is it true that the Japanese police are so inaccurate and unqualified in the arrest procedure, so as not to first remove the suspect's ability to reach the gun? These detective-level Japanese police seemed to have no experience in dealing with the suspect. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't the better eye of lead lead? One blink of an eye was annoying and it went unexplained. <br /> <br /> What exactly was the leader to spend all his money to borrow so much of a loan blow? He was not gambling. Being a non-primary government employee, he or she must have full health insurance. <br /> <br /> What was a single man doing nothing in the middle of a nature park? What was his reason why he was there? <br /> <br /> How can gangsters find their character and his wife in a remote nature reserve in the world? It didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> And how can gangsters later control Mt. Fuji Resort? For these gangsters, there were no clues to even know which country the leader and his wife were, not to mention the right specific location at the right time! <br /> <br /> And the third question, how younger detectives would know what foot is on the shoreline to find a shoe and his wife? The coastline of Japan must be great. Were all these characters to be psychic? <br /> <br /> Two Last Questions: A lovely girl trying to drive a dragon on the beach - Where was she from? He seemed to have no transport or companionship with him. And why was he still trying to try to fly what was his dragon after it was cut? It was weird. Inadvertently Python-esque. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I loved background music. It was dramatic and flowing and added a lot to this movie. Photography, images and art were pleasing to the eye. One last point, the woman was too pleasing to the eye. He never ever saw a deadly sick person. He seemed very healthy. If anything, these people seemed depressed and mentally ill and physically ill. Her husband treated her wife because perhaps the newborn gay man treated a respectable woman ... the love of friendship, but not the close tenderness. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a mixed film.
