I can't even describe it. this is the worst movie I've ever seen (nice guy when I call it). This is another big-budgeted one who doesn't like-think-much. It's not even scary. It is reluctant to have big movies that never reach the big screen and then it comes to ... "the thing" for movie fan tricks. I think big manufacturers do whatever they want. <br /> <br /> Just get a big manufacturer, hot chicks (albeit terrible actors) and tons of horror clich√©s and bake this week or so and you'll get "Nun". <br /> <br /> And I thought Bad Boys 2 was terrible !!!!
