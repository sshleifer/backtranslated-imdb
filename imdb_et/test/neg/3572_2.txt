I find it difficult to understand what makes the viewer feel that this is a powerful film. I think that the main purpose of this film would be to study nature and the impact of racism in the British community. That is why it is all the more disappointing that all the characters are two-dimensional and the actors are at the college's performing arts course. I'm always skeptical about "improvisation", another word to be too lazy to write a proper script. I was overwhelmed by the performances and sat at the audience who laughed when the story definitely had to move. Racism is a serious problem, but I think the fine approach in the cinema is much better than stapling.
