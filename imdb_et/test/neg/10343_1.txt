Stealing is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen, look like they're gonna go. I have not even seen this movie, but not only do I know it sucks, but the fact that it steals another movie or the story of a movie about it is such a bullhead (and if IMDb would allow much more mockery) than just bullshit that i'm full of rage and feel like I'm just throwing it out of the window and just stopping it all. O.k, it's a bit much, but stealing is worse. <br /> <br /> Ever seen Pontypool? It was this fantastic little zombie movie that was made in 2008, this wireless network is going to work and then this zombie attack takes place. We only see what is happening inside the radio station, and the only thing we have, what's going on outside, is random calls from our eyes in the sky Ken Loney (just the most entertaining moment in my mind) and the BBC calls for updating the situation. Of all the readings I read, and of the conversation I had with my friend (who has seen this movie and Pontypool), this movie was exactly the same as here with little tweaks. So throw originality and creativity out of the window. As for zombies or infected people, whatever you want to call them. They are exactly the same thing because, because they are infected, it does not change the fact that they walk frantically and they no longer have endless muscles. They are zombies. ZOMBIES !! <br /> <br /> ZOMBIES !!! Okay, one to many, but back to this filthy movie. The zombies I've heard have been much like 28 days later, in a better movie, with their crazy rage and even more mildly dampening the meat. This is where Zombie movies define themselves, the story doesn't matter in a zombie movie (as long as you don't use another movie idea). Of course, this zombie movie story can be supplemented, as is the case with Pontypool, but zombies must be original in some way. 28 days later, the crazy madness began Zombie. Pontypool I can't even explain these young people without destroying the film. Evil Dead, I think I just have to write the name again, because it is The Evil Dead. Romero is the captain and he passed all the different zombies, from colored face zombies to Dawn of the Dead to the fearsome zombies in the dead diary, and made his own unique style. So, after talking about other big zombie movies, I think it's time to explain why I hate this movie without even seeing it. This movie down to the right steals the original story of Pontypool, which I think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country, and many people threw it out of school to do so, but in Hollywood it is allowed and apparently approved. This is not the only film that takes the contour of another movie and just tries to say it differently. 90s, like the worst period of films, is sure he had some gems, but what is not a decade, and that's because all the movies were exactly the same. My favorite, criminal film, the twist is so big that you don't think so before the end. They are forcing you to blame that it would be impossible for this to be someone else, but for him to beat, during this time he was a man, you just had to look at scenes where he was not and when he mysteriously appears out of the blue, say, "Hey, what do I miss?" Oh! NOT THIS YA! Well, I leave the clich√© for my final report. This is one movie you definitely want to miss.
