If I have to turn the idea of ​​this movie to a big Hollywood bigwig, then I'm sure it sounds like this: <br /> <br /> ME: "Four boys in private high school are good friends and they are sorcerers." <br /> <br /> Hollywood: "It sounds like" Craft ". ME:" No, no, I told four boys, not four girls. "Hollywood:" It sounds like "The Craft," instead of boys instead of boys. "<br /> <br /> ME:" OK, but this is the fifth unknown boy who comes to the picture and wants more power. "<br /> <br /> Hollywood:" There is still no big difference because one of the Craft girls also wanted more power. <br /> <br /> ME: "OK, OK ... I'll make these guys" crowd ", they're rich and the school is on the east coast. <br /> <br /> Hollywood:" Now this original sounds like this. It's not like The Craft, it's a billion dollar. "<br /> <br /> This movie was both a cliché and a uninspiring, even the drama produced between Chase and Ipswich brothers was a very blasé. Children whose biggest problem is what color Bentley wants for his 18th birthday (and 18th for ), I don't care at all, even if they have authority.Every boy in this movie saw that they stepped out of the magazine and, of course, had to be free of naked man and 80% nudity just to get home because you are not in shape. I wanted to call this movie "OC Witches", oh, rich children and their problems, let me pretend to care. <br /> <br /> This movie was completely unimaginable and predictable, the last fight was flat and dragged and the end was very anti-climate floor.
