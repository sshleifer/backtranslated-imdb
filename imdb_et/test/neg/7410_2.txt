The Pacific jungle includes planes that transport some scientists and a prototype, powerful and revolutionary invention of the DNA machine. The insurance company sponsors the rescue exports ordered by Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), the owner of a large company with a prototype, and a researcher father. There, the group finds the plane five miles from the expected location and the machine and the remains of the people. What's more, they realize that Sasquatch, one big mouth, is pursuing them. This movie is so ridiculous that I don't know what I'm doing, I spend my time again in that garbage. The direction is terrible, actors and lines are terrible, copying parts of "Predator" and even "Blair Witch". All in all, how bad this film is, its best scene, when Andrea Roth's Marla Lawson is wounded and the expedition's guide says she needs an injection of tetanus vaccine. Andrea spreads her jeans and the guide says "Nice butts, but the shot must be in your hand". Ridiculous! My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sasquatch, The Abominable" ("Sasquatch, The Abominable") <br /> <br />
