Did I waste my time. This is a very terrible movie. At first you think there's something going on, but by the time you get around 30 minutes, nothing happens. I waited another 20 minutes and then I was so disappointed that I started reading IMDb comments and realized that the director had wasted so much valuable time. <br /> <br /> Incredibly boring nonsense film. Stay away. So many good soundtracks. I'm going to give the police inspector a joke because it worked for me. I laughed for a long time, but otherwise it was a very bad film. Stay away from 1 in 10.
