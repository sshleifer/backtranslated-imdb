You're one of the worst films I've ever seen. But on the other hand, it is better than most Slovenian films that are full of amazing characters and stories without bright ideas. You're bright, optimistic and without artistic moments. In many interviews, Director Mitja Okorn tried to tell us that his film was top quality because it didn't cost much. But I thought it was wrong. You're a bad movie for me. The dialogues are really bad (90% of the script is curse), the characters are stereotypical mores, the story and its turns are very predictable, and the sequences of action (this movie should be a comedy) are filmed very bad and without style. Okorn thinks he's even bigger than Quentin Tarantino, so he's copying his style for over 90 minutes. The humor of the movie is very cheap and primitive (Okorn thinks the constant curse is funny). In my opinion, Tu pa tam is a very cheap (not just budget) movie stupid story and very very bad performance.
