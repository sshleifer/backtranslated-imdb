Considering the topics, I thought this film would be at least enjoyable if it stopped somewhat from the masterpiece. I was wrong. I was waiting for something else that happened and it ended - I thought the final was what happened before it was exciting. The only reason I gave 2 instead of this one is that the effects are worthwhile.
