This movie must go in the history of bad movies, which is the worst I've ever seen. It wasn't even a bad b movie ... I would have appreciated it as z. Special effects were ridiculous ... a mistake if you could even call them special effects. I think the reviewer hit the nail on the head ... this was the box that sold the film, while the cover design was big and concise (which is why both were rented) was not only a waste of time but also money. I didn't stay long. I took it back to the store and switched it to another movie. I believe my local video store pulled it out of the shelf because they had a lot of complaints about this terrible movie. My 6 year old could have done a better job of filming / scripting!
