I saw the screening of the movie yesterday. I had great expectations of this, but it was definitely disappointed. Within 5 minutes of opening, Williams is already campaigning for his presidency. And he will be president in the first 40 minutes. So this aspect of the movie goes. The first half hour is fun. Don't do me wrong, the movie has moments. But after the first half hour it will take the worst. It becomes less comedy and more like a thriller / drama / love story ... which is pointless. the film goes somewhere and stands for another 30 minutes. here and there is a laugh, but the consistently funny part is the beginning and only the beginning. at one point, the public has heard the greatest joy when a crowd of people shouted "boooo" during an emotional scene. Williams delivers superb performance, parallel to his comic style. Walken also offers a strong supporting role, just as he can. I think one sign that is underestimated is Lewis Black. Consistently vulgar and political, funny to see her PG-13 rating. Generally, I don't pay for watching a movie. After that I saw it for free and was even disappointed. The first half-hour is firm and downhill. The movie doesn't really fit in the category when it realizes that it shouldn't have been more than one hour of comedy. 4.5 / 10
