My mother said I wasn't going to look at "Kadosh" - but who ever listens to Mom? <br /> <br /> I looked at it the way I looked, so I thought I had to lose my feminist credentials going to the theater, so I checked the feminists carrying the card the next day. No, they thought it was much more than an anti-orthodox leveling as a feminist claim that painted the Orthodox as equal to the Taliban. <br /> <br /> Although this Israeli film is cautious to show that the story is an extremely orthodox Messianic, it is so nasty that it is incredible (plus that non-fanatical Orthodox rock-'-roll)! ) one sister is in love, is incredibly sexy-- even in Israel, which must be fantasy). <br /> <br /> The theater was quite crowded, so there was an astonishing curiosity to see Israeli films; Too bad this witchcraft is a widespread spread. It was almost enough to bring me back to Hollywood's romantic movies. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 29/22/2000)
