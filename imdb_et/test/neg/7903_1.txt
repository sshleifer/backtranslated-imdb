Well, to get started, I'm black and black, and I can tell you that it is very sad when black people think "black film" sucks. I can't say I've ever seen a movie that's a badly directed or worse story. <br /> <br /> Snoop is me and everyone, but he doesn't know this movie at all, I know how much they paid him to be in a pail called a movie, but I hope it's a good smell wash. <br /> <br /> I'm all about supporting a movie, but it was bad, really bad. It blew on all sides, a real plot, a suck, a cast, and the best was a white boy! <br /> <br /> I almost demanded a refund of the exit from the theater, half of the crowd up and left before he was out, I still wanted me to have. Save yourself some pain and see something else, something else ...
