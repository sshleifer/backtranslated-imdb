The writer / director Brian Burns has obviously seen some romantic comedies, and he seems to have discovered a formula of success: abounding in New York (preferably in winter), hints of old Hollywood movies (especially musicals), an enjoyable musical soundtrack. Unfortunately, all this is just compensation for the lack of Burns talent as a writer. (The great secret of many independent writers and directors is not why they can't go to big studios, but how they get support for their movies.) Usually, our interest in romantic comedy is motivated by the leading figures, but in this movie a couple have no complaints. This is not the fault of David Krumholtz or Milla Jovavich; their characters are just badly written. What we react in such classics when Harry Met Sally or Annie Hall or older films, like His Girl Friday, are the defects and mistakes of the leading figures. Absence of the ability to create individuals, Burns gives us after school special inspired men of Mars, the women of Venus. <br /> <br /> How anyone can see Burns as a descendant of Woody Allen is outside of me. I never laughed at this movie and the screen is full of kayak chambers ("I want to paint the city red." "You want to paint the city in red?") What is the most noticeable sign of someone who has no business writing a life. One of the early scenes we see is Krumholz's actor girlfriend, who is filming a frantic TV sitcom. This is the only moment in the film that dialogue seems to be right; Perhaps it shows what Burns' talents really fit.
