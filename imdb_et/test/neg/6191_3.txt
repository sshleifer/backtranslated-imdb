Pepe le Moko, played by Charles Boyer, is an international criminal who wanted in all European countries, and to release him from Casbah, the mysterious part of Algeria, where even the police do not want to go, a senior official is sent from Paris to capture Moko once and for all. For Le Moko, although Casbah allows him to remain in police custody, it also becomes a kind of prisoner - a place he cannot leave because he knows he is being arrested when he does. <br /> <br /> Boyer's performance was good and I understand why he was an Oscar candidate. He captures the nature of such a character - the perfect combination of a very dangerous and at the same time very stylish. The film itself, unfortunately, was lagging behind. Many parts of the story seemed inconsistent, two of which I mention. First, there was the idea that the police would not enter Casbah. This was noted quite clearly at the beginning of the local commander's movie, but repeated references in the film suggest that the police actually entered Casbah quite regularly. Both Commissioner Janvier's suggestion that the police would not enter, nor the Slimane statement by the inspector (including the proper presentation of Joseph Calleia), would make sense to enter, but not to, Casbah. I also found it hard to believe that Gaby (Hedy Lamarr) could sweep off his feet so quickly Moko - a hardened criminal, to entertain local people, sing love songs, and then leave Casbah to find him, giving himself up. I naturally understand the irony of some of the latest scenes because Pepe leaves his prison (Casbah) freedom only to find true freedom in his capture (because the police have shot him and killed him.) I just found it impossible to believe that someone like le Moko would fall into this trap . <br /> <br /> It's worth Boyer, and to a lesser extent Calleia, but this story is disappointing and controversial. 3/10
