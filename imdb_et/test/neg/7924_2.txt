This movie is ... terrible and at the same time wonderful. I saw it for the first time when I was about 13 or 14, so I have a lot of nostalgic value. In this film, Cesar Romero actually plays the character of Octavio, who "discovered" Santana. There are also two more actors, Monte Markham (playing Sami, who is trying to save his daughter) and Peter Mark Richman (playing the priest), who have great filmography and these are the only actions that are fine. The rest of the actors and the film itself have all the features of the B movie that some of us cherish. <br /> <br /> Recently, I spent 2 years getting a copy of this movie and it's almost non-existent. I assume that it was finished very soon after its release. But I finally found a copy and paid a penny to get it. If the trial day happens in a video store (misleading when the green green "satan" is on the cover), read yourself as blessed with those living near a few video shops that still have a copy.
