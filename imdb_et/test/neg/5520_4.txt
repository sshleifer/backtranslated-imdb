Strangely enough, this is Fred MacMurray, who plays a more "screwed" part in this screw-ball comedy. Carole Lombard shows the performance of the fine, combining lighter moments with the drama and the seriousness of seriousness. <br /> <br /> As usual, Fred MacMurray remains a mystery to me. The camera is not his fan, he is not so attractive and has no style or panic to draw a very similar role to Cary Grant. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bellamy is an excellent friendly friend who lives back through his relationship with the character of Lombard. One can only wonder why his character does not want his gentle, soothing love, rather than almost being sure of almost MacMurray's failure. But that's Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The picture almost works, but leaves the mark, mainly because of MacMurray's performance. It would have been nice to see Grant or even Clark Gable in his role. Lombard and Bellamy are highly believable and enjoyable; MacMurray is rigid and wants to keep her hand long.
