This movie was very little for a real drama. After opening the minutes, the film coiled, which did not lead us to hell and the back was clean. Action was more frightening than the film's subject and sometimes I couldn't stop laughing. The continuity between some scenes was terrible - the characters disappeared from the scenes without any explanation that they would only be replaced by others that had been in the past for a few minutes. Certainly it was an exorist punishment. The Church's collection plate must be full of a copper day when Mr. Russo registered for it. Do I speak Latin? That's Brutus.
