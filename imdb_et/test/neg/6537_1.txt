Despite many positive reviews, this is a very slow film with three major actors who improvise the most banal dialogue you will ever hear. This is another road movie that doesn't really go. The camera is often out of focus and constant panic in some of the long scenes is annoying. Three characters are attractive, but enjoyable. It is also painful to be tired of using the word "dude". (Even Howard Stern has abandoned this tired laundry word). <br /> <br /> Three major players and one supportive actor show great promise. They are clearly comfortable and allow themselves to be depicted as low and even silly. Character actors all seem to be because they are happy amateurs who voluntarily spoke a few lines. Indeed, they all fit well with their roles. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is boring for 90 minutes, which seems to be eternal. . This is one of my ten worst films.
