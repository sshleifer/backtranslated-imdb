ASTROESQUE (2 out 5 stars) <br /> <br /> I don't know what the title should be ... even less of the idea of ​​what should happen in this movie for half a time ... yet, it was interesting to me. It's a low, low-budget movie by "El Mariachi", which is filmed 16mm ... and for that value, the shots are very well designed and visually stylish. Director, written and starring writer / artist Michael Allred ... I think it's not surprising that the film looks good. Unfortunately, some actors are worse than ... and the rest are the best. Allred himself goes to the best ... but just because he doesn't really talk much. He just moves to watch the coolest of most of the time ... or runs out of crazy people trying to kill him. Sound is also pretty bad ... almost like it would be in unfinished places ... maybe they couldn't afford the music they were going to use? A strange, vaguely scientifically-fictioned graph ... resembles the tone of "People who land" ... but most of the film falls under the usual bad guys and kill-them-before - those-kill-you plots. Ultimately, it is too sluggish to be successful, but not in the interest of adventurous filmmakers.
