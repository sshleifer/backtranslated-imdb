I don't recommend this movie. Even if it is rated G and is clearly intended for children, there is quite a lot of sweating (including the frightened "F" and "S" words). Such a language does not spoil me particularly, but in children's films? Come on. <br /> <br /> There was also quite a few indirect sexual content that was one early between young male characters and any mature adult woman, including a prostitute! <br /> <br /> The action was as good as the movie genre, but the story was very exciting and even my four-year-old said it was "stupid". <br /> <br /> Despite Elizabeth Shue, this movie is definitely not worth it if you haven't seen it.
