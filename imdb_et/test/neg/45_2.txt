It was a decent film in the first half. Too much cheap BOO! moments, but tensions are built, bad guys are horrible and everything seems to be nicely set up. Children are not very deep, but hey, working for teens. <br /> <br /> Then it just becomes ridiculous and trying too hard - "why in the world does it do?" moments are destroying someone's ability to stop the infidelity, the twisting involves too many ridiculous coincidences, and the title comes from the late attempt of a philosophical meaning to a film that goes somewhere and has fallen rapidly. The theater was laughing at moments that were not funny in any way. Great prerequisite, but just poorly written and not together. Some very nice shots, but they are hard to enjoy when you roll your eyes.
