The Rising Damp movie version appeared two years after the end of the TV series. Like many fans, I went to the cinema when I was open. I got bitterly disappointed. Eric Chappell couldn't write the script very much; most of this is the idea of ​​old episodes. During the release of the film, the Rising Damp series were repeated regularly at I.T.V. so the public was asked to pay to see something they already saw. At least "Bus Films" were original scenarios. Secondly, Richard Beckinsale had died last year, so they removed Alan's character as a sign of respect, replacing an art student. John ', played by Christopher Strauli' Only when I laugh. It just wasn't the same. <br /> <br /> When the other poster was brought out, Rigsby boarding house saw something that was used in the series, being bigger and cleaner. <br /> <br /> Director Joe McGrath was one of the directors who worked on the original Royale Royale, a surreal humor. "Rising Damp" also has a part of "Walter Mitty" style fantasy series, such as "Saturday Night Fever" parody. Personally, I found them awfully away. If the pudding is superfluous. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Leonard Rossiter is as wonderful as ever, as is "Rigsby", as Frances De La Tour as Ruth and Don Warrington are Philip. Its just a shame film is not worth your talents. <br /> <br /> When Rossiter died in 1984, it was shown by I.T.V. as a tribute to the last scene - showing Rigsby, who leans at the foot of the stairs, has been removed for good taste.
