Definitely the worst film I've ever seen in my life. I can't find anything positive about this movie (if that production is worth the word). <br /> <br /> This production is not even a standard for low budget porn movies! <br /> <br /> My question is simply: why does anyone look at the script and thought, "Hey, I'm making a movie out of it"? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie I didn't even hope that "Nicole" would do it? He was really so annoying! <br /> <br /> So don't you watch this movie for your own interest ... if you don't want to waste 85 minutes of your life ...
