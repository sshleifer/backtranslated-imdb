It was a terribly bad movie! Ashley Rose Orr was terrible, she had no charm at Shirley Temple ALL! Those ridiculous smiles that he would do if he arranged his piggy little eyes in such a way that I think it should be cute and go to the audience - "bless!" It just made me hit him. He must be "oh my good!" about a hundred times the whole film. He could also barely say without being fake. Dreadful HORRIBLE movie .. If I could rate it minus 10, I would. Don't waste your money on this trash, go out and buy a real Shirley temple movie!
