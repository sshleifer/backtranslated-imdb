I don't understand why many seem to hate it. <br /> <br /> This movie links several overlapping settings of fifty historical and biblical ethics using similar pieces, props, and costumes. in other films. Here, however, the story goes through the history of all humanity, the story of which comes from the human race in the trial, with a conviction, which means that the h-bombs go all over the world. The prosecutor is the devil that is played by Vincent Price's devilish cucumber. OK, so it's a bit of a hockey, calling the defender "The Spirit of All Men", but I think it's one of those things that gives the film the magic of the era. Human Spririt is played by Ronald Coleman in his latest film quite well. This is also the last movie that all will appear in Groucho, Harpo and Chico Marx, but not together. Groucho plays Peiter Myet, who buys manhattan from Indians, on a scene that was played purely for humor. Chico is not funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat, and Harpo, who has been told, is meant for Isaac Newton, discovering the difficulty. Most other performances are well done. Other hockey things are that the trial is allegedly taking place in the space depicted as a cloud and a bluish area. There is something called "The Great Clock of the Outdoor Space" that can mark the end of the world prominently at night. <br /> <br /> But the film is about the weapons of mass destruction and the eternal problem. the question is whether a person is basically good or basically bad; and that is what I find interesting. Also, anyone who loves the look of fifties costumes looks like the appearance of this film.
