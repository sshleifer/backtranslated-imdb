It really begins to be interesting - the story evolves around the main character who drives the "cleansing action" that specializes in cleaning up scenes of crime. As a former policeman, he gets into some strange situation when one job suddenly disappears. In addition, he discovers a certain connection with the investigation of police corruption. His "Columbo Feeling" is justified, the deeper the story goes into the background. Good actors (Jackson, Ed Harris, Eva Mendes) play a tense story with some twists --- but only up to the last 25 minutes. (up to 7 out of 10 stars here). SPOILER :::: Suddenly the film's touch disappears, and finally there is a totally unnecessary shooting game involving a 14-year-old daughter, betrayal of friendship and not just justice from the development ... why did Cutler's friendship after his investigation not give up? or if the daughter discovers some facts? or ... a lot of possible much better stories to imagine ... a really wasted end!
