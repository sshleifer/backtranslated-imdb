I wanted to say this because I first saw the movie, I still don't allow any of my children or grandchildren to watch it. At least not before I tell them and they understand that it is completely fiction. The only thing I saw was that the animals went to Ark, everything else was wrong. Lot and Noah are fighting on the ocean like a pirate movie. Make sure you tell your children a real story before you allow them to look at it, but really, until they are old enough to realize it's not real, they may have a confusing vision of the Bible. It was the worst Bible film I've ever seen. Bruce and Evan Almighty were much better and more educated. Let your children watch them
