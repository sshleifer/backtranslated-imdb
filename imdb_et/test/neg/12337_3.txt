The real backlog, the novel is such a brilliant hugging journey into insanity, but it is made in a TV movie style of nonsense being marketable and painfully slow. Stay with Mike Hammer. I find it hard to believe that no body has made the brilliant version of this book, Kubrick slips over it, it should have taken over its rings. Stacey Keach is too puzzled when Lou Ford and the whole thing are the same product values ​​as the 1970's on the Apeside planet. I suggest you go out and buy a lot of Jim Thompson's novels, but actually Grifter isn't too bad, it's one of his, starring Jon Cusak.
