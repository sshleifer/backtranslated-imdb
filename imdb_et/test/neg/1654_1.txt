Oh my God! The baby hit a new low political correctness, a mixed race family living in Birmingham with a disabled child who was thrown into good shape. Anyone who ordered this command will hunt down and throw it at the dogs. Usually funny Jasper Carrott is just as funny as piles at this show and won't start with me. They have nuclear bomb timing and fineness. I only hope that comedy will improve, but I like it seriously for the little Britain and Catherine Tate. I think you'd better get a box designed for decent comedy like Fawlty Towers or Bottom if you want to laugh. <br /> <br /> BAN THISAKY CLEAN RUBBISH!
