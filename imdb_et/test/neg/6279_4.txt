H.G. Wells War War Director David Michael Latt is a little less than the average, which is not too bad when considering the budget he had to make - just $ 1 million. For this budget, the value of the output was not too bad - the best part of it is the visual effects (the CGI carefully weighed the budget) and the sound design. The less important characters of this film are the story that is the best for a very long time (but again I think it is due to the budget they had - they had to extend certain scenes to create a feature length of 97 minutes). (again, this is because the actors couldn't work), very few extraordinary camera shots and music. But again, I can only let the negative parts go because the film was prepared for a small budget and still had a good production value. At the same time, you should see this to see how the low-cost version of the world can be done even with errors. 4 out of 10.
