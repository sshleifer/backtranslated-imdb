I was 12 years old when I saw the original film (I lived in Italy and the Italian title was "FBI, OPERATION CAT!") It was a fun movie and not just for kids. This terrible remake is pathetic even for 5 years! What was Disney to destroy his reputation and memory of a cute movie I don't know, and I just can't believe it. Even the title of the original text (both the original version and the duplicated Italian version) was a very nice story. This remake has the title song even worst than the movie itself. It was just nice to see Dean Jones even when he was just a cheeky look, he was regularly on big old Disney movies. I can not honestly see anything other positive in this remade movie.
