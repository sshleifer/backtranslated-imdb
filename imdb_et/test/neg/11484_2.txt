When I first saw this movie trailer, I wanted to see it. I thought some of the director's other works were pretty good, but I have to say I was disappointed. The plot includes a young woman who lives with a widow's father and two of her two sons. They are moving into a well-guarded community, but not everything is as it seems; sort of Twin Peaks. The woman starts to see or see people. During the first lap I had a hypothesis and thought, "It can't be the whole reason?" Well, the end ended or better DOWN and gave us what I felt was a really weak final act. Sound mixing and quality are great. You saw it in a THX-certified theater and amazed ... sound and just sound. No substance in the picture.
