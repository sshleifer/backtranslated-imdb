[As a new resolution of 2005, I decide to write a comment on every movie I saw in theater (10%) or DVD (90%). <br /> <br /> I have to admit that DVD has revolutionized this habit. For example, I hear a cast of true voice that is an important feature of personality. In my country, non-French films are duplicated and we get to aberrations: the French voice is terrible, very far from its original tone! same voice to different people or same people with different voices !!!! <br /> <br /> And when everyone found my comments to be inappropriate, then in 2006 I will finish my reviews ... Ah, AH .... So enjoy them now !! ] <br /> <br /> My summary means that story, locations, cast is not very enjoyable ... <br /> <br /> Only .... <br /> <br /> Sandra's bull is She is a talented actor who is able to watch a movie .... <br /> <br /> It resembles a feminine "refugee" .... So if you are looking for If you live, look at this movie even worse because Sandra life is confusing .... <br /> <br /> She couldn't get anything left, just her poor mother (who is Alzheimer's disease: the lack of depression again) .... <br /> <br /> he has a sad life at the beginning of the movie, he has a life that is saddening all the time to finally recover. .. what a happy ending !!!! <br /> <br /> perhaps the writers wanted to make one point of the fun of life ... <br /> <br /> very far from the best computer screen all the time: * WARGAMES *
