Gang is back for more! Ron Howard and Cindy Williams are now married! His brother proves the bill and Charles Martin Smith does everything in Vietnam to get home. <br /> <br /> The 60's will be highlighted here, but it's everywhere, at the beginning of New Year's Eve 1963, then three minutes later, New Year's Eve 1964, three minutes later, it's New Year's Eve 1965, three minutes later, it is again in 1963. Martin Smith speaks about his friend's death a year ago, and a couple of scenes later, this friend is fighting in his next heat-pulling contest and top down, the drug scene and the flower kids enter the picture (or pictures, in some cases displaying three different camera shots at once). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, you will have to watch WATCH, but I would recommend you stick the original and leave it there. Wolfman Jack is heard at the beginning of the movie before he plays on almost any background, but where did he go? Maybe he couldn't keep up with this movie and give up! 2 out of 10 stars!
