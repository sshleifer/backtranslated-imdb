Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito), "crypt-zoologist" (a fictional term for one of those self-inflicted losers who want to learn extremely rarely - read: non-existent animals), and his hunters can catch Chupacabra, a big, wedge-out, hard-moving beast. To get to the continent, they smuggle them on a Grecia cruise ship, and some idiots open this box, though not specifically mentioned. I think the strange noises coming from the inside were not scary enough. Then the monster makes a monster thang; flying bite pieces from different travelers to the ship's captain (John Rhys-Davies), a square special representative who claims to be an insurance seller (Dylan Neal) for some reason. ), a number of professional guns and other people are trying to stop it. The main victims (whom I think they are comic relief but hard to say) are the old rich bitch (Paula Shaw) with the yippy terrier and the snobby effete gold digger (David Millbern). Obviously, the monster can be crushed with one calming agent, but can live through a dozen bullet hits. The design of Chupacabra is acceptable (albeit unoriginal), but the rest of the film lacks effort, surprise or interest. Boring Sci-Fi Channel "original" film; they have made dozens of movies that have almost interchangeable characters and plots, but the creature has little change. Enough already!
