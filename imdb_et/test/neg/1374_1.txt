It does not make the balls fun for slower people. Listening to Mencia urges him to be brave enough to make fun with jokes. Nor does it take a bite from the showcase. Racial games, the racial Olympic Games, seem to have been scrambled by many sketches for the Chapelle Show skits, which is just less funny. <br /> <br /> But the most unpleasant example is his claim that he is simply driving his drum beating when he is actually marching over many oversized, too-made drums that have been drummed several times. <br /> <br /> I hate this example. I hate being a Latin American voice. <br /> <br /> And not Carlos, I'm not trying to censor you. If people like it, keep it. But I think it's a bad show.
