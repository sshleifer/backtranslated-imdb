What can I expect from a movie directly from a DVD? You know what you're renting it yourself. The quality of cinematography reminds me of reality TV shows. <br /> <br /> Why are they always so close to the actors!? And why do they always focus? There is nothing to look at. (And the actors are so big that they are blowing.) <br /> <br /> Writing and dialogue is just terrible. This intro scene with the British Guy is fun. Just try and listen to these words, they hardly make any sense, just going around. The rest of the film's lines sound like they pulled out romance and sci-fi novels as if the writers had a clue what they were doing. The characters certainly sound like they have no idea what they say. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible movie. I feel bad about the parties involved in this project. Embarrassing!
