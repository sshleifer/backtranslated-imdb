The opening scene keeps me on an absolute zero rating. I want the whole movie to be as bright and real as the introduction. <br /> <br /> To enjoy the movies, there is much to be forgiven, (60 shots handguns, heroes with super human power, all women), the "Assault On My Intelligence 13" tree hatch has been pulled out so far I'm surprised that it showed another day of filming. <br /> <br /> First, how do these guys get to the police? Based on stupidity, I think. How the main female characters justify being in the middle of Detroit's winter, or where they are. In fact, none of the characters in this movie responds to this movie. During the storm of the century there are no windows, electricity (which strangely goes back inexplicably) and they are all comfortable like carpets. What is the technology that prohibits all mobile phones, radios, and brain functions. It must be the same force that forces Maria Bell to walk deep into the snow without her hair and almost no clothing from her generation.
