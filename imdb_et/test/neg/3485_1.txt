I was happy that I grew up surfing in San Diego (not the world's biggest waves, but it was a childhood, I tell you) and I've seen a lot of life in the so-called. After watching NORTH SHORE for the first time right now, I can say that TODAY GOD I never saw it as a child. If I had seen it and mistakenly thought it was a realistic image of the surf target, I sold it on my board and got in full, I don't know accounting or anything. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie has real surfing as much as TOP GUN is a real warfare. Action is terrible, music is worse, cinema is the best and oh my God, what was Laird Hanilton's thinking? WOW! DO NOT MOVIE !!! SUCKS !!! If you want to surf REAL surf, see RIDING GIANTS. Hell, look at SURF'S UP instead. Seriously. Sucks. Sucks bad. Sucks REAL bad. Brah. ;) <br /> <br /> PS: I had to change my summer "WTF?!" en wtf, because we probably should whisper on this site. NO YELLING !!! (shhhhhh!); D
