Where do I start? A plot of land related to love during the war between two high school students, while one is a living weapon and their struggle that love is a very good plot. It is based on Shin Takahashi Manga, which also became an anxiety in 2002, both of which are still read or seen. Unfortunately, it was a terrible film of honesty. It is not as if it is possible to place certain aspects and say, for example, that the budget is to blame or if it is to blame. Unfortunately, there are a number of downward and ineffective elements that bring this movie down. <br /> <br /> Operation is bad. Not to say that Aki Maeda and Shunsuke Kubozuka are bad actors, but they didn't have much work to do and seemed wrong. It also seemed to have no physical scope to draw the reader's story and be too old for the parts to be an annoying degree. <br /> <br /> The script was weak, managers were unrealistic and behaving irrationally. The film also plays for heartbeats, but reaches predictability while not being influential and underdeveloped. There are also pace issues. <br /> <br /> Visually, it's unnoticeable. The film uses a green and unnecessary green screen in too many scenes. Other special effects also have a low-cost look, especially if minimalist practical special effects could be used. There is also no visual flair, as if a cinematographer or an artist's designer was not to make the scenes consistent and stimulating. <br /> <br /> Music and sound effects were good but remarkable. <br /> <br Generally, the film has no enjoyment, and fans of the series should not be disappointed to see it at least once to do so. People who do not know Saikanot are probably not the place to jump because it is not a very good movie or melodrama. It's not a movie or a cast and a team mistake, it's not just inspired and it kills it.
