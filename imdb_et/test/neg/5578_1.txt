Predator Island starts with six friends, Eric (Tom Dahl), Chris (Dan Gordon) with Heather (Iris McQuillan-Grace), Kim (Iana Baker) and Denise (Melissa Roby) are invited to spend some time on Kevin (Michael Wrann )'s father's boat offshore. What could go wrong with this super sound idea? Well for beginners, a big blood meteorite can collapse near your boat to the sea, and it might have come out of alien vitality and try to kill you all, it's just a ridiculously stupid idea, isn't it? > <br /> In collaboration with, written and directed by Steven Castle I thought Predator Island was nonsense and straightforward. The script is the worst, you know what abomination is full of annoying teenagers who do & talk about the most stupid things, are full of clich√©s and are completely predictable, it makes a spill, things just suddenly happen without any reconstruction or explanation, it's boring even just 70 in odd minutes and it is practically no entertaining value, not even unintentional ridicule. The film really doesn't have much of what I would call a plot, no explanation of why or how this alien creature can take over people's thoughts, or why it can be selective in the sense that one moment a person will be. normal - next, if the story requires it and for no apparent reason, they suddenly get green glowing eyes and sudden desire to change the cannibal. There is not enough horror in this, so-called action scenes are pathetic, and I really don't want to waste another thought on the Predator Island, not to mention wasting your precious energy by writing these words ... <br /> <br /> The director's castle does nothing to make this thing would be traceable and "special effects" are absolutely terrible, this guy of alien creature would not even get into the 50's sci-fi movie. Filmmakers even play some of the strokes over credit, but this must be the least funny set of mistakes I think they can't even misunderstand correctly if you know what I mean! Forget every decent gore if not there, there is a bit of cannibalism and some intestines placed on the unfortunate participants of the stomach so another unfortunate actor can choose them and pretend to eat them. <br /> <br /> What is the estimated budget of about $ 150,000, which I have to admit that filmmakers worked hard on a low budget, this is still not an excuse for making such a bad film. The whole thing looks very cheap and the actor is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> The Predator Island is crap, I am sorry, but it is like it is and I just don't see what anyone could get out of it. In my humble opinion, this is probably one.
