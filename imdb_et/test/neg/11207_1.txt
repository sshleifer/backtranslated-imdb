What crack do you smoke? This movie, being extremely fun, is terrible! <br /> <br /> Action scenes are so obviously fake as it is sad. Colonel's daughter is painfully irritating. Ninja's training camp is so much fun that it's hardly worth mentioning. And when Joe puts the bucket on his head and beat the boy of another army, I just myself. I could go on ... <br /> <br /> Entertaining, undoubtedly. Good, no. Well done, certainly not. <br /> <br /> As a commentary on America as an empire, it is actually pretty good. Joe as a typical white conqueror is not surprising, especially in the mid-1980s in the context of American cinema.
