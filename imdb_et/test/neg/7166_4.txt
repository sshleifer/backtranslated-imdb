I saw it once on television and when a friend suggested it, I started looking for it, although it seemed that there were no places nearby. Finally I got it in the antique shop and couldn't wait to see it ... Oh, I had seen it a few years earlier and I really enjoyed it. I was surprised that this film was only 80 minutes long and I think it changed the plot and story so little. The plot really looks good, both on trailer and movie commentary: teenager, Angus (Jesse Bradford) and his updated set of lab Yellow is left on the island in a storm boat ride with his father (Bruce Davison). Together, they manage to live in the desert and wait to find and rescue them. However, it has never been mentioned that everything has been shortened and the plot events have been very rushed. There is a love interest between Angus and Sara, but they are never shown for more than a moment. Yellow is a mischievous dog that parents do not want to keep, but after a few days it seems to be appreciated enough to join a cruise. Mommy (Mimi Rogers), the scene where the death of younger boy (Joel Palmer) was mentioned vaguely, doesn't go anywhere. In no time will you learn that 9 days have been spent on the island, then maybe it is 14, then 19. Of all the animals you can get rid of nature, only 1 species - the wolf - attacks them. Why couldn't anything else be the same type of animal - maybe even the same - strike twice? There is little to look at how Angus prepares food unless he discovers a tree and roots, and if he roasts the rat. If he knows so much about survival skills, why didn't he show more scenes? One thing that made me empty was why the dog didn't have much. If he is rescued and the dog falls on the island, there is no scene that shows how he lives without human help. I wanted to be more open when I looked at it, but I enjoyed it. The show was good and the score was enjoyable. But I found myself wondering why my father seemed so much older than his family, and why he and the main search and rescue manager shared names. This is a good movie for kids, but although the main character is 14, nobody would want to over ten.
