I loved this movie as a teenager. I loved it. It hasn't grown up with me. Perhaps this is because it is a melodramatic load of old rubbish, full of maso-positioning, chewing dialogue, slo-moi harvesting, and signs that speak a lot. Lumpy's narrative captures ruthlessly from one symbol to another, part of one plot to another, without all this, and it does not help William Baldwin's presentation mono to be damp enough to put any fire in the film for a long period of operation. Robert DeNiro and Donald Sutherland deserve a look, but nobody is here at the top of their game. Women are especially short. The only real effect is due to impressive fire extinguishing sequences and Hans Zimmer's majestic score, which remains one of my all-time favorites.
