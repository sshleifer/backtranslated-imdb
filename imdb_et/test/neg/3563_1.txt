Conclusion: Very, but very boring, but I looked to the end, hoping for some backward effect, but the end was worse because it was nothing. The old black and white game didn't help at all, it usually helps psychological movies, but it wasn't. The script, graph, etc. were linear, had no content, nothing going on. When you deal with psychological problems, you are dealing with the analysis, so with the details, with its unity-diversity formula. Just a story, there are many stories to say, but something makes them unique and difficult to forgive with the filmmaker's tools and creativity ... well, that's not the case.
