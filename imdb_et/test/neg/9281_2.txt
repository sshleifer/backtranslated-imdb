It was one of the exhibitions I wanted to continue. But I just couldn't dedicate myself to showing this time. To get an exhibition that focuses on politics, you really need a strong plot with turns to increase the mood of the exhibition, such as "The West Wing" or "Commander". Rob Lowe was fine, but actors like Kyle Chandler just couldn't act (he was a terrible "Early Edition"). This exhibition was painful. Because of the lack of urgency, urgency and reality that can actually work, I just had to give up on this show and I am glad it was canceled so I would never forget. <br /> <br /> Grade D-
