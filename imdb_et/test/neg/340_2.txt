Even if this budget is small, this film would have been remarkable if there was a story here. It started pretty good and relatively interesting and credible. The actors and characters were interesting, though there wasn't much character. My favorite scene was when they all eat. Some seemed hateful, and some seemed to think it wasn't too bad. The story begins very airily. And then ... <br /> <br /> And then it got into a little horror, which is usually the death penalty for most sci-fi. Suddenly, there is no scientific basis for any move. There is no real incredible end-game villain? There is no real explanation of what is happening. In general, if a movie has to use the F word for every other word, it usually also comes from there. I'm still offended to believe or not. I often think that inspires people to do bad sci fi? Isn't there a universe with fantastic good stories? Do people feel that they are wasting their time and everyone else when they put such things out. Why do we get so many mediocre sci fi like this? No female characters / characters? None? It had another "Predator", but unfortunately it went a long way. <br /> <br /> My last comment - poor editing and finally too low a budget to build a real campfire? What gives? <br /> <br /> My advice to any low budget sci fi film production out there. Before you start, make sure you have a good story, and turn the bad special effects off - it's better if we don't see anything other than something that looks fake or ridiculously fuzzy.
