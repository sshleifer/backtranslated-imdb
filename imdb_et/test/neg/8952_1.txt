This TV show is probably the most pathetic screen on television today. Amazingly predictable, hidden use of slow motion photography, cheese lines. Chuck Norris is an abomination that should never be allowed to be filmed. How he decides to publicize every episode is really annoying. His action sucks so bad that it makes people embarrassed. I'll give the series a little credit ... it's sometimes entertaining, but that's not enough. With all the negative points that this series has, I'd still prefer it on the reality TV, it doesn't really value anymore.
