Totally un-funny jokes that fall gradually, amateur actors (with one or two exceptions), boring characters and dialogue that are at best mediocre. After watching this movie, one should be wondering how the manufacturer can meet such a project on earth and I think "I have to do this movie." No wonder he didn't get the theater release.
