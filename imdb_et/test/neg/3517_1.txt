This film is a very bad example of untold storytelling, which tries to hide the "art films" behind the facade, trying to shock the audience with unmotivated violence (against women) to cover their lack of psychological depth and internal conflicts. Everything in this movie is a pretense, from thanks to Bela's label at the beginning, to photography, actor, music, story and editing. If you suddenly, for no reason, are forced to look at your career prospects from the Hungarian people in your boats, while the soundtrack is trying to convince you that it should be a dramatic moment, even though they are just on the way to the funeral of a local alcoholic, that's one thing. Capturing completely unmotivated rape scenes as a shocker is a different thing I absolutely do not understand. This movie is really trying hard to get into certain works of art (Eastern European drama), but there is no shortage of observation skills and "soul" that other leaders have.
