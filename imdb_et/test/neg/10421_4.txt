What is it in French? First, they (probably) like Jerry Lewis much more than the US. Second, they (seem) like Edgar Allan Poe's work more than anyone else. It must be a "Beaudelaire effect". <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong ... I'm a fan of Store. But this trilogy can make three less stories than the Poe average ... well, I'm not sure what they've done. <br /> <br /> "Toby Dammit" is a good Fellini movie, but it has nothing to do with the store's story, at least on the subject. It's enjoyable at first sight. Terence Stamp does a good job with an interesting role. However, it has nothing to do with the store or the spirits of the dead. <br /> <br /> Metzergenstein is a big mess. How Did Vadim Films Bring? It's just terrible ... not even for amateur film school standards. Depending on the DVD menu, try skipping it and saving your time. <br /> <br /> "William Wilson" is actually the segment that is most reliable for Poe's work. But it doesn't have much style, even if it contains a stranger snowball fight, which I think I've ever seen on the film. (It looks like boys are throwing tissues or perhaps handkerchiefs rolled into balls.) <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to skip "Metzergenstein", watch "William Wilson" and when you're a fan of Fellin ( I'm not) keeping "Toby Dammit" when you prepare dinner or snacks.
