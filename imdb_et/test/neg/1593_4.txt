I think I was ready after hearing it. The first heard of Siskel and Ebert. When they said the divine ate the faeces, I had to look for it. Then a friend spoke about it in 1991. He also said that his parents saw it when he first came out and his mother almost wanted his father to do it! So, when I got Pinkance's flamingos today at Sundance, I was ready. In most cases. <br /> <br /> I still couldn't help but I'm surprised by anal close-ups and blowjob scene. That is, the only characters I understood were Edie and the egg man. His crying at the beginning of the film, though something frivolous to ordinary people, makes me sad. Though she wasn't sure, she had a lovely voice. I was fortunate for him and for the egg man and they really touched me. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, working to produce a level of poverty was not good. And as with the script, how does John Waters bring this stuff out? Well, at least it's different.
