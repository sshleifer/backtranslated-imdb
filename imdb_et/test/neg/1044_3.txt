I saw this movie before I rented something else ... and it looked good. I've seen good stuff from Full Moon video and thought it deserved ... Unfortunately, it wasn't a good thing. The couple is moving into a new apartment, discovering the bed and strange things are going to happen. Strange things like a woman discover the crushing sex. And the man discovers the kinky sex. And the woman pulls pictures of kinky sex. And the man takes a kinky shot. And they both start dreaming of dead people with kinky sex. You think so many kicks-off movies would be good, right? <br /> <br /> Well .... No. The problem is that it should be a scary movie or at least a thriller and it just doesn't work. There is no tension, tension or fear. In addition to some worrying dream and vision, there is nothing to worry about for this couple. The whole movie is basically these two visions and playing in bed. Of course, you finally get a fight against the monster ... and some bloodshed ... but something remarkable ... There is only one murder and one good intimidation and that's it. <br /> <br /> And kinky sex? Don't get your hopes (or something else). Their idea of ​​kinky sex is a woman who is fully dressed, trying to strangle her partner with a tie. Not a pretty good idea.
