If you offer all the city clergy clichés for 105 minutes; You have a ladder 49. <br /> <br /> He has a story, but all the clichés are very cloudy. This makes it a movie for every event; it becomes so predictable that it is not worth it. The story is not deep and even the actor seems superficial. <br /> <br /> It seemed that he wanted to be a tribute to firefighters but was finally boring and pretentious. The parallelism with Jack Morrison, who is deadly trapped under the inaccessible parts of the building and firefighters detained in twin-tower rubble, was too obvious. <br /> <br /> It is not comparable to movies like Backdraft and will definitely not see firefighters for future movies.
