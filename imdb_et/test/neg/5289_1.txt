I started watching it because I thought it was really bright porn. As I kept watching the only thrill I got from this movie was finding out what the name was so I could watch it up and rip it. I just finished this and I've been thinking about ending my life knowing that someone actually did it. <br /> <br /> For people who commented on this movie as a good script and great action, the words of my wisdom are for you so you probably don't have friends because you were in the movie. You've probably wanted you to be back in your life all the time, so you wasted this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that it's a serious movie. There was an old boy who grabs it and doesn't even hurt him at all. And when everyone else worships, they fall dead. <br /> <br /> It was probably important that these people killed people and ate them and hung up on an 80-year-old man who wanted to put parts in his body. My favorite thing was when the old man found "hemoglobins" or wrote it because it made the film very intellectual and probably helped the older crowd. <br /> <br /> What really blew my mind was that they decided to throw in a random scene where college girls go to the forest looking for a fake skull. <br /> <br /> If you are trying to see this movie, you should probably fill up your bath and let the hair dryer in and be ready to jump. <br /> <br /> THIS IS NEEDED !!! .... to anyone who believes that life can not get worse because it will help you understand that there are people (the makers of this film) who are even more pathetic and not going anywhere.
