* The ELITE sniper team, who has added 24h or so before, has chosen to be behind a big stone behind one of the first scenes instead of suing and invisible. * When a hero "runs" to rescue his wife, he actually runs. * If inside the building and the target is only about 20-30 meters away, the hero uses his / her use. In addition to the fact that most non-elite soldiers will hit this strike and still hit it, it is also a fact that the scope may not be very close to that. * There is a satellite that can actually view the building horizontally. <br /> <br /> The list is endless ... and the movie is the biggest bunch I've ever put on my DVD player.
