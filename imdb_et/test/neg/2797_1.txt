forgive my spell. This is probably a more funny horror movie that once existed. Think of the evil dead * 1000. Actress is terrible, makeup is seen in the form of a certain woman. is a lesbian scene that doesn't make any sense. And the end, the end of the haha ​​sacrifice, be prepared to hurt your stomach. Now, watching this movie for more than 5 minutes and still waiting for something, look at yourself and ask what the hell is wrong with you. This is a very bad film that aims to laugh and enjoy its purity. <br /> <br /> Don't forget to watch all the movies after the movie, see how little the budget is all about. All in all, this film is a rare pearl in demonstrating talent / care / ability / money in the absence of a clean and udder, and something else you should ever make a successful film. But it's definitely worth it.
