By the mid-1990s, Don Bluth's career as an animator seemed to have fallen to an all-time low. Previously, Bluth had made a number of popular animated films, many of which have been loved today, such as "Earth Before Time" (1988), "NIMH Secret" (1982), and "An American Tail" (1986). But in 1994, with Thumbelina, his films began to become more and more popular with quality and popularity, and one of the many regrettable entries is the 1995 "The Pebble and the Penguin" bomb, a film that did not attract the audience outside the older and under the age of seven . To be honest, the only members of the audience I can understand is to enjoy this rather dull animated feature. <br /> <br /> The story is absurd. The film marks a poorly drawn, amazing and obese penguin called Hubie (expressed by Martin Short) who falls in love with a woman's penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower on her head (voice by Annie Golden). Tightening like in real life, the penguins offer their bride-to-bee with a stone as a substitute for the circle. But when Hubie has wiped out with the current move, the team with a rockhopper alone (James Belushi) who has a dream of flying and they are driving back to return to Antarctica before it's too late. The reasons why they may be too late are one of the many underdeveloped elements of this weak story that would still be weak even when they were there. <br /> <br /> It is very early to see why this animated children's music does not work and does not work for anyone older than six or seven years. It just doesn't have any feature that is needed for a good animated feature. The first is that the film is bad because of the drawing style. The animation of this movie is very comic (even for animated films); it is dark, gloomy, the colors are not viable, and moreover, the design of the film and its elements is universal and ridiculous. Take, for example, the penguins who mark the movie. For just a few back-end programs, every penguin sees absolutely nothing like a bird. For example, Hubie looks absurdly ridiculously with a wide cheek, a hard beak, big eyes, and the surprising hat she wears everywhere. With her hand-like "mirrors" she looks like a Chris Farley penguin suit. The result: he is a ugly, poorly drawn comic book character. But the most absurd and absurdly shaped character is the evil penguin, Drake, who doesn't see anything like a penguin. He is a muscle man with a penguin mask. She has a breast wider than Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the teeth are larger than the teeth of leopard gaskets and killer whales that act as predators of the film. Basically, he is a two-dimensional, recycled villain. He lives in a cranial cave, carries a rope, laughs a lot and gets crazy when people laugh with him. Result: Who cares? And what's bad and perhaps worse is that it is animated music and there is no remarkable or memorable song that would have been found anywhere during this working time. Opening the anthem was harmless? Not memorable, but harmless. But after that the songs became dustier and fader, and there was one that was very tough on me. This is the moment when viewers quickly push back and forth when it comes. <br /> <br /> I felt that "The Pebble and Penguin" was flat all the time except for a few moments when the Hubie and Rockhopper Penguin Rocko was put at risk for the leopard seals and jawbone jaws, which fortunately did not enter into dialogue with the animals. instead of cartoon characters. But for this reason, I can't recommend this film to the kids with all my heart. That's the reason. The film shows a killer whale, a natural predator of the penguins. My worry is that "Free Willy" (1993) recognized children can be offended or humiliated if they see their favorite sailor depicted as a blood predator. Leopard's seal was a better antagonist and was more fun seeing how his jaws opened larger than rattlesnake and how he smiled smiling. But the thing is really that these moments of predators ?? and there are only a few? And they're not very interesting, remember. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, I can't recommend it to anyone under the age of seven. My advice: If you have children near this page, rent it to them. They can enjoy it.
