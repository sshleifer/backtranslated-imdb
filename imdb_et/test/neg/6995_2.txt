The film listed here, made in 1980, is not a movie that is available in "anything other than a strange video" in its "Leader Ed Scare movie, Volume 5". First, the 1980 version is colorful. The SWV has an earlier version (1972) of the film made on the WWW television channel 5 in Cincinnati. In both cases, this film is known. Unlike most of the other director's films, it was meant for broadcasting and viewing to the public. So the carcass level is racked. It is still a rather grim exercise to exploit the bloody death of an alleged educational intention. I live in the Cincinnati region and I remember this thing being shown every year on the 5th promoter. If you are looking for a single movie that shows the uniqueness of this American film phenomenon, "The Last Prom" is quite typical - terrible, hyperbolic, extremely didactic, heavy melodrama. Whether it has really influenced the riding of young people at all, is anybody's guess.
