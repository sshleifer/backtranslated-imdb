Forget what I said about Emeril. Rachael Ray is the most irritating personality of the food network and television. If you have never seen a 30-minute meal, you cannot begin to understand how it is unnecessarily annoying. I really thought she couldn't even start before you looked at the exhibition once or twice, and even then all the words and intelligent thoughts would fail. The problem is mostly his ways, as you thought. Ray has a cow's mouth and often imitates a parrot. If you love something or think it is "fantastic" (the word it uses about 87 times about a TV show), just say it. And he uses constantly awful, unreasonable phrases like "EVOO" (extra virgin olive oil!). SHUT UP! What's worse, Ray has two more examples online! I think this is a complicated conspiracy of terrorists to drive us crazy. Give me another Tyler Florence! Ray is flat.
