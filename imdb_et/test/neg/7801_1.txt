This is a real stinker. <br /> <br /> The story is not the same as most other TZ episodes. It's pretty boring, though seeing Fidel Castro's vision-impaired Peter Falki is some fun. drink and live some quality entertainment. 9 times out of ten, he finished this episode! A weird thing? It often happened to my mother (another TZ fan like me). There were so many times that one of us would say to another: "I was all watch the _Thilight Zone_ and what episode was the Kuban dictator episode!" Obviously some of these episodes like it, because it gets 6.7 rating ... how it happened, I have no idea - but this and in itself would make a great Twilight Zone plot!
