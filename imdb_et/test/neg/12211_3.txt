This movie was so depressing. Everything seemed energetic and I was completely ready for a good time. At least I thought I could stand it. But I was wrong. First, a strange loop? It was like watching America's Funniest Home Videos. Fucking parents. I hated them so much. Stereo-Typical Latino Family? I have to talk to the person in charge. We have to talk. This little girl who was always on someone? I just hated her and I had to mention it. Now, the final scene is over, I have to say. It's so brilliantly bad and bad that it's a movie. With dark dancing. Terrible and beautiful at the same time.
