My only reason for registering on this site was the opportunity to comment on this movie. I felt like I had to get rid of some anger. <br /> <br /> The movie "Babas bilar" must be almost the worst film I've ever seen. I really believe the script might have seen it become a pretty good movie, or at least OK, but somewhere on the line something happened. What is more strange is that it seems to be quite decent on paper. Use both script practice and false not transmitting. There are a lot of actions, it happens a lot of things and you can't help wonder why this happens. And then the actors, the actors are doing so bad that you almost start crying. <br /> <br /> If you have a lot of time at hand, I'd say you see it. If not - don't.
