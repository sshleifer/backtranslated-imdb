I disagree with a 100% reviewer who disagreed with a 100% reviewer who gave this short film "F". Strictly mixing political propaganda hides Joe Dante's limited ability to pull one another out of his trick bag. Horror masters were a phenomenal set of truly terrible stories except for this episode. <br /> <br /> Despite being recognized by those who want to promote their political inclination, Homecoming MOH is the least effective episode. season first. Unlike the rest of the series, Dante's entry is a parade that is neither horrible nor humorous when it is bitten by the delivery of an attacked political point. <br /> <br /> Dante really can only be blamed for pulling it off the shelf because it wasn't his creation. The Zombie sub-genre is very popular during this decade, and there are several works among the predictable George Romero tributes and free fantasies that aim to raise political or (ir) religious messages. Such works are neither written nor intended for true spooky fans. Maybe Dante is not really a Master of horror. When has he been after The Howling? <br /> <br /> If you want a zombie-flick warfare with some pop culture to be referred to as humor, Homecoming can be your business. If you're a spooky fan who is looking for something masterful, pick up ... most other series episodes. My personal favorite was Dario Argento's "Jenifer", which was based on the classic classic comic of Bruce Jones and Berni Wrights.
