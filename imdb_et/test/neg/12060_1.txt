View 1 of 7/19/2003 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): A ridiculously flat 3D movie that follows pretty many 80's teen butterfly cinemas. Foolish children go to a known murder camp, become an unknown masked man, and then try to figure out who lives when someone else lives. We really do not care about who is behind the mask, but even it is not difficult to figure out if you have seen such films. What a waste of 3D viewer, despite a somewhat decent 3D effect.
