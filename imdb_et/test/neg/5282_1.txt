First of all, I'm disturbed that there are no choices from 10 "0". Since nothing else, I decide to look at it, waiting for it to be another terrible movie with a similar plot to Cabin Fever. The man I was wrong ... Dr. Chopper made Cabin Fever as he should have won numerous Academy awards. Let me remind you that Cabin Fever contains a small hick-boy scene that makes a circular house that pulls out the scream of the porch, "pancakes!" The world was wrong with her fingers in her trunk. So it goes without saying that Dr. Chopper was a big, smelly pile. It wasn't even funny. It reminded me of a horror film I had to do with the 8th grade "The Campout". Except for the fact that "Campout" was a better script (we wrote it about an hour before filming), better actors, plots, bloody scenes and camera work. I was hoping to laugh somewhat of a badly made fearful film, but I could only look at it as if I was thinking, "Was this done by grade 8?". <br /> <br /> The actor was terrible, the events and the various small subplots were thrown and there was no point, and gore and violence were very small. I liked how this small wounds died right away and the only weapons the killers had were small pocket knives ... if you were going to make a horror movie, at least killing the killer (s) crazy \ t where did they promise their promises? A good way to bring some scenes to girls who run into their bra, even if they don't matter to the story. And I have to say my favorite line was when blonde says dr. Chopper: "I'd like to introduce you to someone .... my inner slut." His "internal bitch" goes then the garbage can be grabbed by dr. Chopper, shoot and hide the killer fear. <br /> <br /> Wheww .... well, it was long, but I felt I had to express my feelings about the absolute horror of this "movie". I know everyone has their own opinions, but if anyone appreciates this movie 2, they should hell ... <br /> <br /> seriously.
