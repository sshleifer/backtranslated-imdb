I had seen this movie this morning in TCM. Very bad behavior, low budget and poor plot are the impressions I felt when watching the movie. The only highlight of the film was to look at the young Rita Moreno (23 years old) who was playing with a teenager in India with her 50s older men. He reminded me of Sue Lyon's earlier version than Lolita (1962), but more innocent Lolitat. He bounces up and down like a tiny bopper of the 1950s, almost as if he was supposed to be a chewing gum that falls over all that old man who wants to give him something, because he's playing it as he hinders him. Anyone in their 50s who had a beautiful, virgin, teenage girl who wanted to do something for her and be her bride would be crazy to take advantage of her. It is too bad that the censorship board, when this film was released, no longer allowed character like Rita Moreno. The only reason I gave this film 3 was Rita Moreno's movie.
