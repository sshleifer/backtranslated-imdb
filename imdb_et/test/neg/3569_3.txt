Why spend time slipping this uncomfortable and self-conscious movie? Every hour, and after an hour-long mate and amateur show, we start to get bands and pieces of a big band swing that made Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey separate and a great musician. From time to time - at the Art Tatum mixing session, where Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra make "Marie" and standout, Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra headed by Bob Eber and Helen O'Connell, who sing "Green Eyes" - we get a complete song. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie is in the public domain and the DVD is as bad as the actor. There are only four chapters in my copy. This means that you get a quick finger on your arthritis, trying to speed up where it is. The Moon you are moving is a version of Hollywood's two Dorseys lives and battles. Tommy, a great trombone, and Jimmy, a great saxophone, couldn't usually stand each other. Finally, in 1935, they split up when Tommy started his orchestra. Each of them had more success than they did together. They agreed when their father died in the forties where the film ended. Later, he managed to tolerate each other in the Tommy-led orchestra, as the age of big bands disappeared in the fifties. Tommy died at the age of 51 in 1956, vomiting after sleeping, pills and a big meal. Jimmy died in cancer in 53 in 1957. Jimmy was very talented and relatively easy on all accounts. Tommy was very talented and often out of all accounts. But good music makes up a lot of mistakes and the Big Band sounds like two created to help define the swing time. <br /> <br /> They play in the movie and we see that they are evolving from pussy (with child actors) to adult men who fight and fight against each other. Not only the two parents who are playing Hollywood Irish clich√©s, Sara Allgood and Arthur Shields who just want their boys to meet each other, but also a large subgroup that includes Janet Blair's romance when Dorseys' childhood friend who is their singer and who acts as an almost full-time mediator and assistant to William Lundigan as a piano player. Blair isn't bad at all. But if you want to see why he never got stars, he would probably have to change, just look at movies like his studio put him in. No wonder he left Hollywood. Lundigan just takes up space. <br /> <br /> How bad is this movie except when we actually hear Dorseys? Well, here's a song written specifically for the film and given to Blair to hide it. It's called me. <br /> <br /> Me ... you rose rose ... rising sea rising ... star glowing ... <br /> <br /> rose rose? This movie doesn't heal, and it can't get worse. However, if you like Dorseys and if the price is right ... then I wouldn't buy it in retrospect. For me, Eberle and O'Connell who sing "Green Eyes" have been highlighted. You can watch them for free on You Tube. There are also all Dorseys. I would like to know.
