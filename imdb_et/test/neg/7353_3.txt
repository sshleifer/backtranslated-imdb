Why should Burt Lancaster allow himself to play on a poor scanner, which is ultimately harmed by femme fatale Anna Dundee, played by Yvonne DeCarlo 'Criss Cross? The same reason why Robert Mitchum promises himself to be another loser who falls to the femme fatale Faith Domergue in 1950, "Where the threat lives". Maybe they both felt it was a good way to show that they had a "range" because the actors who played against the type are the usual "harsh-man" role they were known to enhance their reputation as participants who could play any role. But the problem was that the role of Steve Thompson, the miserable milquette of love-sick, Criss Cross, did not increase Lancaster's career. Lancaster is not only confused in the one-off role of Thompson, but first of all, the film's main character is unlikely (and maybe even pathetic). <br /> <br /> 'Criss Cross' is a continually slow moving film. Among the many unnecessary scenes in the movie is a setback that crowns Thompson's confrontation with Dan Duryea Dundee at the nightclub. Everything that occurs in this initial recall is later explained in the picture: the illegal thing between Steve and Anna, Steve's tight relationship with Martinez, and his bad blood with Dundee. If Director Siodmark felt compelled to start with a setback, why not keep it for three minutes? I think it would have been more effective. <br /> <br /> Criss Crossis takes time before the main character takes on his commitment to the first world of the "normal" law. It's a scene where she "passes" and "runs" at nightclub Anna and notices how Siodmak spends so much time between cutting Anna's dance and Steve watching her? Spends a lot of time focusing on Esy Morales and his Rhumba Band as the story moves. <br /> <br /> Until the second law crisis, the story comes with Thompson, who has different peaceful meetings Anna and then drowning in his usual soldering tips. In the middle of the second point, he learns that Anna has married Dundee and has been married. During this time, there is no confrontation between Thompson and Dundee and we have rather vague mechanisms between the two lovers, as it turns out (and Anna explains it later to Steve), the reason he left was not just because he lost eight months, but also felt the pressure of Steve's mother, as well as the direct dangers from Martinez, who said she was taking care that she reached the women's detention house. Anna goes back to Steve because she realizes she made a big mistake with Dundee? It turned out he was beaten and he was afraid of him. <br /> <br /> One foolish refusal is that more than one Criss Cross is that you can never take away an armored car. But everyone is so surprised when Steve points out that this can be done if it is "internal work"! You would have thought Dundee would be known as an armored driver for Steve's "profession" and suggested to him in advance. But of course, Steve has to make a proposal so that Dundee won't kill her after she has discovered her relationship with Anna (if they're so afraid to try, why Steve and Anna meet in her apartment where Dundee can find them so easily?). I really got kick out of Finchley (played by Alan Napier), the operation's brain. Dundee is so stupid that she has to hire the type of alcoholic ex-professor who draws a map on the map. Oh, there is the question of how to get the ingredients to build gas bombs used during the robbery, and of course Finchley is good! <br /> <br /> The only really well done scene in the whole film is the robbery of an armored car. The editing was pretty good because it represented a rise in poor occupation. As the gas bombs go out, Dundee has murdered the innocent Armored Car Guard with brutal brutality. <br /> <br /> The movie's climax is like the rest of the movie. Why does it take so long for one of Dundee's ghosts to throw Thompson? There's the sister, then the castle is waiting, then she comes and pretends she's a friend, Steve is sleeping, and finally wakes up after she wakes up. <br /> <br /> When Steve finally meets Anna at the house, we don't know how Anna got his hands in cash. Did he steal him from Dundee after he went to dinner? It has never been explained. Even worse, Anna suddenly becomes a blue evil femme fatale. Previously, his selfishness and attractiveness to Dundee can be explained by his perceived rejection of the dangers of Steve and Martinez. But after returning to Steve because he fears Dundee, he turns inexplicably toward him when he is the most vulnerable. Like "coffee coffee", you have "instant femme fatale". <br /> <br /> "Film Noir? Encyclopedic Reference to American Style" By "Silver and Ward", "Criss by Cross" is "one of the most tragic and appealing movie noir". I ask you to differ. To get a tragedy, you need signs that have a great depth and, in order to be convincing, you need a story that is plausible. There is no Criss Cross. It is an over-priced "B Movie" that has somehow found itself in the pantheon of youth of art buildings. Once again, the herd's mindset has won over previous years' pictures.
