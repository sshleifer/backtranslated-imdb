This movie is terrible. He's completely zero. The Hebrew Hammer (Adam Goldberg) is trying to save Hannukah from Evil Santa (Andy Dick). Perhaps the ball is a promising base, in fact, the film does not go beyond that premise. Although there are some (many and some) nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent, it is work, hackneyed and ultimately pointless boring. Despite the fact that Goldberg, Dick and Greer (Hammer for customer / love interests) all have quite a significant screen presence. Despite the fact that this movie is played for what might be described as overwhelming overloads, this film is in the middle of the middle of class. DO NOT waste 85 minutes of your life. (Note - the music was good ..!)
