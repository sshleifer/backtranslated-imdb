There is so much to say about this movie and so little that it is good! <br /> <br /> The plot has enough holes for the Titanic to sink, characters are absolutely unbelievable, monsters are so unrealistic and I'm sick and tired of seeing films where a former spouse and former spouse are thrown in some odd emergency - this happens too often in the movies and it has become a bad cliche. <br /> <br /> I find it hard to believe that someone would have invested $ 1 to make this garbage, never pay $ 100 or so that it will cost. <br /> <br /> You could make a better movie with more convincing special effects on your home computer! I didn't think the movies could get that bad! Avoid it at all costs - do something that is more fun and enjoyable, such as tooth extraction or enema!
