my friends and i watched this movie last night. it was pretty unbelievable. it was probably the worst film I've ever seen. at first it was acceptable. it bounced on BAD IMPROV, but it was pretty funny, despite the fact that the scenes are too long and drawn out and terrible quality (I read the $ 400 budget over ... sounds right). <br /> <br /> The biggest problem was the lack of a script; With a healing background, I know how difficult it is to keep scenes short and effective. what happened in this movie was that the actors were left to improvise the scenes, and they didn't know when to stop, but they were stupid about time. At first I thought it was because the film was short and they needed to create long, useless scenes. As the movie progressed, I realized that it was just a very bad movie. <br /> <br /> There were many parts where I saw the filmmaker had a really good idea, but not the resources (or talent!?) to pull it out effectively. a lot of scenes were taken from one shot (reason, you know, corrected) about what seemed really for a long time. So boring! if you can stand and one and a half terrible healing, look at it. it is partly very funny but also really stupid and annoying. they all work completely out of alright. it seemed that the only good parts were parts that really were not related to the main plot; ballsy boy who swore a lot, hair salon etc etc. <br /> <br /> but yes. painfully bad. like, i was literally hurt. in an hour or so, my friends and I just missed and left.
