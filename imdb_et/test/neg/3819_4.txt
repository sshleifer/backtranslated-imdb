It's important to check your expectations when you see HATCHET. The * buzz generated on this site exceeds the actual effect of the movie. What can help someone who sees the film is to understand that it is - shouldn't be scary. It is a pure camp and entertainment. It's not - funny ..., just campy. Don't expect something that is HIGH; and nothing on Friday 13th (part II through infinity). <br /> <br /> HATCHET has satisfying actors. The film is directly on Ed Wood. Creature effects and make-up are stupid - apparently for purpose. Gore and blood are something between Romero and DEAD ALIVE. HATCHET is an intermediate film. This is between DEAD SHAUN and LESLIE VERNON. It's between campy and comedy (there's a difference). This is an extremely violent and violent comic book. <br /> <br /> Instead of "capturing the American horror" or any other stupid jargon used to describe a movie, it tries to do something. -American - horror like Friday 13th and new fear like SHAUN. Luckily, it will stay away from the fear of torture. <br /> <br /> HATCHET is finally a bad movie and a decent movie. <br /> <br /> * I think it's getting more and more people participating in movies flocking sites like IMDb to evaluate and comment on the movies they're linked to. At the very least, running campaigns is associated with associates to leave positive feedback and ratings. There is no other reason why this film would have been reviewed by the high 7th by 600 votes and dropped rapidly after its release. This movie is better than HorrorFest releases and should not be expanded.
