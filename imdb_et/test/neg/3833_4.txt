I can't imagine any possible reasons why Madsen and Hopper wanted to be in this movie after reading the script. Maybe they got blackmail? Or are they so bad money? The main problem with the movie is that it is boring. The conversations between Madsen and Hopper's character are meaningless, like an eternal conversation between two friends, drinking beer at dinner. You never know any characters (although Madsen's psychological killer is very pleasant compared to other characters). Hopper was always a good actor and Madsen does a good job as a serial number, otherwise the actor is almost ridiculous. There are about three scenes in the whole movie, where something really happens, each lasting about three minutes. Although "speaking and thinking about murders and murders" would have been interesting if they were scenes of the book. The whole concept would be interesting for the novel, but the movie cannot reveal a story that has so much internal thinking and so little action.
