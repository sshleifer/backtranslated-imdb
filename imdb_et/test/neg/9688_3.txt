I just wanted to say I was very disappointed after watching this movie! I had been waiting for a Bible story visualized with a very special fx, and so on. But during the movie I learned that it was an absolute catastrophe ... it wasn't biblical ... only the boat and the animals were a similar story ... if you wanted Noa's visual "translation", DON'T watch this movie!
