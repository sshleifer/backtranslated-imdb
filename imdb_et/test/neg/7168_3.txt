Oh God! Book II is a more original remake than a sequel to it. It's not all that funny, its plot is playing too much <br /> <br /> as a rejection comedy pilot and using the slogan "Think God" is a different variation to an idea that worked so much better in its original work. came back to the movie and made a big difference.George Burns, like <br /> <br /> wonderful, because he played God, he doesn't have the same chemistry with John Denver with a little girl. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a rating of 3 out of 10, but only <br /> <George Burns, the rest cast is nothing special. <br /> <br /> If you love the first one, don't worry about it.
