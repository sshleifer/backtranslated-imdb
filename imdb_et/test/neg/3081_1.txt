What I remember about this movie wasn't good. I always say that if the film is good and able to follow you in the most difficult moments (such as the Tylenol Cold & Sinus war), this is the film that has done its job. The fact that I slept with most of this film only proves that he couldn't keep his attention and ergo, he didn't finish his job. Why did I fall victim to Tylenol Cold & Sin when I had an arsenal of film? <br /> <br /> For starters, there was no point in making any sense. The action was bad and the general story remained open, which could not be closed. I mean the moment I swear I saw Affleck and Graham (brother and sister in this movie) kissing. It didn't make any sense. Then there was a scene with Affleck and his roommates, showing that he was sleeping with one of them, almost splitting the perfect lesbian pair. I think it was to show that most are not as committed to a relationship as Graham, but for me it was just a filler. I have this suspicious feeling that the director of this movie sleeps with Affleck. His action in this film was cruel. I mean, I've never seen her, she's acting "good", but it was by far the worst. Oh, I had another moment during the battle when I was thinking, and I confirmed it with IMDb.com ... what did John Stewart do in this movie? It was another moment when my eyes were opened for a moment in those battles that seemed to last forever. <br /> <br /> And to be honest, this is Heather Graham - we could care less about it after a while. He's not just interesting - he's just happier, bored and basically stops after a while. Although they desperately start throwing amazing characters to revive the movie, it just doesn't work and instead of just calling for a day, they start mixing so many signs to throw that now it's just weird, annoying, boring and really, really long. Luke Wilson's slow pull factor slows down the already indexed movie to the dead stop - why did the two get married? Dedicated is a truly terrible movie - such a "hip comedy" that leaves you astonishing and boredom. <br /> <br /> Rating: * Off *****
