Being an unreliable non-stop-top-over-the-top explosive melodrama, this film is one of the worst acts that has ever been created, and absolutely incredible. Speed ​​is a constant fever, and all the actions and actors have come across the hysteria. It is almost unstoppable and smudge - stain - in the career of all participants. <br /> <br /> The harsh exaggerated aspirations of excitement undermine yourself, resulting in a movie where you just go "Come on!" all the time. The setting and events cannot even be taken seriously. I appreciate this abomination from only 1 in 10. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good asteroid film, look at Deep Impact, which is intense, sensitive and thoroughly engaging. Not all Armageddon is.
