This is somewhat slow moving for the film, but the quality is better than one would expect in the director's IMDb quest. Camera work and lighting were both surprisingly good and working? though variable ?? it is better than often Indie genre flicks. <br /> <br /> Robert Field is in the lead quite stiff, which is particularly regrettable given that his character Claude is a film narrator and in the middle of his action. But as a turning point in this film, did I consider entering Christopher (Brandon deSpain)? and not well. Twist has been introduced to clumsy fashion, and slow motion pulls out and moves too much. <br /> <br /> Pete Barker is consistently entertaining as Father William. It is easy to stand up to what is quite common. Although I was interested in the first half of the year, I felt I was quite disappointed how things were playing.
