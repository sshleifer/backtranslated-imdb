If you're a boy who loves the real life adventures of a fairy tale, look at it. If you are a child of young movies, why not see it? :) If you are a child with a child, you are a better choice for a squirrel! <br /> <br /> The start of this movie was a little funny and created good venues for events. But after the funny funny symbols, settings and possible conflicts, the story was boring. If more or less the same thing happens for the third and fourth time, the word "predictable" will be remembered repeatedly, just like some LP or the ads you actually hate. And the culmination of the plot ... oh oh ... poor, poor, poor!
