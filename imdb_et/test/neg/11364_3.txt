The obvious down payment * Add Monster here * Plane the trick, Living Of The Dead is about what you should expect. <br /> <br /> The film has little or no plot what you expect from this type of film. Although it is partly fun, I have to say. Zombie action is especially fun. When a movie rises, it never ends; the pace is strong. <br /> <br /> Practical special effects are pretty good, but CGI is terrible and disturbing. <br /> <br /> The end of the film seems to leave the open sequel. We hope it won't. <br /> <br /> If you are a deadly fan of zombie-sub-genre of horror movies, I would recommend it to you; it is worth at least one clock. But if you're just an avid fan of the genre, leave it on the shelf. <br /> <br /> 3/10
