Of course, this Eastern European flap is full of sexy, but it has nothing to do with Nicholas Cage's slip "8mm". The tape is used for extortion and the stakes are higher and higher, as the couple tries to develop it themselves instead of the authorities. <br /> <br /> Sex comes and goes - and that would be the only reason for renting it, I think if you like this sorta thing - and it's pretty free in the middle when we're driving through porn, looking for another woman. I definitely doubt how it got into Blockbuster, even with a youth-restricted sticker, considering how easy it is for a soft core edge. (Oh, that's right, it's a double standard. Actual art buildings like "The Dreamers" and "Y Tu Mama Tambien" get castrated R-versions, but get a straight DVD like this UNRATED banner proudly added. Br /> <br /> Action is terrible, the plot is frantic unoriginal, but the worst fault is the idea that it is 8mm. I would give the flick a rating and be nice, but given that they tried to trick me, it f deserves to be worthy.
