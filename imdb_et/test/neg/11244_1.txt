I watched this movie last night. Within 30 minutes of the start, I hoped it would end. <br /> <br /> It was a promising start; within the first 10 minutes. The prerequisite for this movie (friendship that doesn't go anywhere after they have spent days (and years) with a "private" bed in hotel rooms is not just plausible. She kisses her somewhere along the way, and she feels Ohh, so terrible. <br /> <br /> Very little substance that grabs your interest. Functioning just doesn't hold. He's very passive. Regardless of how much the movie is shown, the viewer never represents any type of service connection on the screen. You know that her next announcement is just as boring as her previous one. ("Do you have a cigarette?" He doesn't smoke, He wants him to quit smoking. He doesn't know it right now.) He calls him to visit him in the middle of the night through the door, they do not even hug or kiss nor express any emotional connection. She doesn't even want to lift her suitcase to help her. This is not how people actually behave. This is not how the best guys behave. <br /> <br /> When he gets a phone call in the middle of the night (he's in town for one day), he's showing little interest in seeing his face, acting more like a night load. At this point they have known each other for two years and have not seen him for a year. Not credible, not real. He probably has written a book on Entropy and Enthalpy, but we never see him in writing or reading his physical interests or discussing it, rather than being able to discuss it. We learn that watermelon in L.A. is costing $ 50 (it wasn't in Silicon Type), it has no problem giving it to the fruit. We also learn that the airport goes out when some really fake snowflakes fall from the sky. Sorry, but was it in L.A? <br /> <br /> We never see how these two characters survive, we never see them at work. We never see them as a fight. They are always on vacation. They have infinite time, they have no concern. <br /> <br /> Nice life. Unreal life. Unreal characters. Bad title. Bad movie.
