After their adult brawler dies after the race, a mysterious disguised murderer who seeks revenge for her daughter's death is tracked and attacked. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of this movie, it was quite obvious that it was not very good (at least real quality). The "dramatic" race track at the end of the introductory scene was one of the least plausible sporting events I've ever seen in the movie. It seemed that the winner of the competition had never been in his life before. Don't just run. . . but run at all. Never. From there we get a terribly unrealistic female naval member who broke his jewelry and make-up with a number of appearance rules, not to mention that his hair hanged evenly over each other. The ridiculously uncomfortable corners of the camera, the pathetic gore effects and the action that varied from the horribly top-bored (all in one actor, mind) make this movie one of the most unintentionally fun horror films ever made. On the other hand, writing was not all that terrible and the story was actually in order. But the direction was terrible, badly affected by bad cinematography. The action varied from acceptable to simple abysmal. Regardless of all the embarrassingly bad elements, there is something here, be it cheese or something that I cannot understand, which makes the movie extremely enjoyable and the value of the clock. Maybe it was just Vanna White. <br /> <br /> Mandatory Slate Cells: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: Deathcards were fun enough, but the gate was just terrible: blood squirting from impossible angles, missing knives' actual eyelashes or wounds, etc. But this film has the first vision of a football scene I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There was a bit of nudity (I mean Linnea Quigley is after all) and some too horrible colleges, but nothing superfluous. <br /> <br /> Cool Killer (s): If you think leather gloves, stopwatches, story costumes and border masks are cool, that's for you. <br /> <br /> Fears / Tensions: Not really at all. There's a moment in the girls' changing room that I'm afraid. . . but it only led to some typical stupidity and was destroyed for me. <br /> <br /> Mystery: Little, but if you can't comprehend the killer's identity for about 20 minutes, then I'm not too sure about your deduction powers. <br /> <br /> - Awkward Dance Scene: There is an excellent "Graduation Day Blues" session with guitar and harmony leading to some fantastic 80s. This is followed by the dancing of the 70's disco and 80's fractures, which was probably the most frightening part of the film. <br /> <br /> Final decision: 4/10. Don't take it too seriously and you can enjoy it (just like most others touch Troma). <br /> <br /> -AP3-
