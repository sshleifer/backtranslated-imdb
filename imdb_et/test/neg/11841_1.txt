So I was sick of one Saturday flu and the silver lining was that the SciF channel had a dinosaur marathon that day - "Carnosaur" trilogy, "Pterodactyl", "Raptor Island". Then I started to look at my cable remote control to see what movie SciFi put in its glamorous Saturday's prime-time slot. Some of the films I never heard before were called "Raptor". I was quite excited. The film starts with some teenagers who ride around Jeep when they can rob and kill Velociraptor. I was like "Hmmm, it is odd that looks almost like the" Carnosaur "scene, except that it was in the middle of this movie." Then I sat through some really bad behavior, and then a boy was sucked into the ground in a research lab where he could eat wild T-Rex. Now I'm like, "Wait for the second, it was a scene," Carnosauris. "Then, after I saw some scenes that ruptured" Carnosaur 2 ", I was wondering what the hell was going on. Roger Corman & Co. hung from the trilogy of" Carnosaur "to use it as a scene" dinosaur running-amok "and trying to release it as an original movie. I don't know who I am more angry, Roger Corman or SciFi Channel, who tried to prevent it as a first-rate slot. The only reason to look at it was to bring out actors / actors who looked like his colleagues in the "Carnosaur" trilogy and think which scenes would be lifted, as much as it hurts me, being a dinosaur lover, I have no choice but to give it the lowest possible rating, because I feel completely.
