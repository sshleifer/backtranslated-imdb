Parrots? PARROTS? I've been around this old country more than most, and I've seen almost all Westerners who have produced it. The history of the Old West is my passion. Comanche Moon is one of the worst-made, directed and acted stories I've ever seen. The historical accuracy was very small, but then it is obvious that you acted in a shoestring budget that <br /> <br /> played such an insult to intelligence. I'm glad I saw this example. It was bad enough to sit down and watch the movie plus erect a man's ads. Again, there was no participant who would be convincing. I hoped it would improve in three days. ERROR! I'm ashamed to say that I wasted 4 1/2 hours since I've left.
