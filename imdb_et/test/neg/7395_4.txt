Imagine the GILLIGAN ISLAND, nowadays in the African desert. Add people not as close as Skipper or Marianne - and enough angst to fill a German psychiatrist. Throw a plot that can be interesting only in episodic and literary parallelism that is never deep enough to truly satisfy. Season with a really terrifying theme that has been used since the first world travelers found themselves very, very lost. <br /> <br /> When KING is ALIVE, it wasn't the product of the ruling czars of Dogme 95. does this film attract so much attention? Dogme 95 is Hollywood's modern Rococo in Denmark. A by-product of digital technology, this Scandinavian movement is trying - quite dogmatically - to remove artistry in making films, using more natural elements and returning to the content of storytelling. PEARL HARBOR is an example of Dogme Antichrist. <br /> <br /> Director / co-author Kristian Levring's saga reflects interpersonal relationships and human nature when placed under a life-threatening situation. Eleven people traveling by bus running through Namibia's sand dunes suddenly find the remains of an abandoned abandoned city. A local African who does not speak their language acts as an observer and narrator (whose perceptions are among the sharpest in the film). As the strongest leaders to the nearest village are within a five-day walk, others will fall behind, survive dead carrots and circumvent their likely future as vulture. Former Henry decided that this rather unpleasant team needs modulation and writes KING LEAR manually. He assigns roles and the group goes through several days on the learning lines and practices, trying to direct their attention seemingly inevitable. <br /> <br /> From time to time, will most of them disappear and their natural shocks? or William Golding can say that human nature is on the surface. If you have ever seen Lord Lord, you know that these things may get ugly, that being in the position of the lifeboats can even make Mother Teresa Calcutta a PMS term. <br /> <br /> The film was filmed using an international ensemble of actors from American, English, French and South African who dictate dogma dogma, develop themselves and their role quite organically. KING was also filmed chronologically, adding a sense of reality to the ever-increasing despair of these characters. After up to three cameras recorded with digital cameras, the results are transferred to a 35 mm film. <br /> <br /> The presentation that makes the most come from Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays boho pop Tart, who tries to support the band in any way. Henry (David Bradley) is another sophisticated character whose passion for his life-work saves the gang from the ultimate despair. It is hard to feel too sorry for other cruel spouses and their oafish husbands, hirsute old women, sumpy French intellectuals, wealthy men who have more important places than the Namibian desert. Beckett can hate this question, but why does this group rush along the bus through Africa? Dangerous morbidity! The whole despair that has been done graphically in detail! Reluctantly annoying pace! Enjoy.
