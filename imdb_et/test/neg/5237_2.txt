Christophe Lambert once said he was still making movies just to make good and easy money. When I see my latest publications, I can believe it. <br /> <br /> Beowulf is summarized in "good" parts of movies. The participants themselves are not too bad. But the plot is stupid, "Mortal Kombat" music has nothing to do here, the end is really s **** y ... <br /> <br /> The only good thing about it is that I and my friends can laugh, how interesting it was. I even want to waste my money on something else. <br /> <br />
