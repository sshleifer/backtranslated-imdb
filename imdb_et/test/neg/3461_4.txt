It's a DVD rental movie. I'm a big fan of cast members, but the story has never really captured me. Don't wait for "Oh brother where you're" in some way shape or form. The more fun part I think is when the war hero explains what's going on in Argon. They seem to have tried to copy some of Clooney's funny facial expressions "Oh brother where you are", but you could say they're trying. John Krasinski was a bright spot and it was all strong. Renee Zellweger plays the part of a passionate reporter ready to make the story. In general, this is a film that you should look at at home.
