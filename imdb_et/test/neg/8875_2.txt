I didn't even watch this movie. Now, I like 50-year-old sci-fi movies, even when they're wildly inaccurate, but it just bothered me. First, one crew member on a spacecraft talks and acts as if he had reached the tenth grade. He sounds like he should be bowling too, not a spaceship. The space ship admires the team on Earth and this boy says, "Do you see Brooklyn?" and another man says, "Of course." And the boy says, "Gee, I don't know who the pitch is?" Excuse me for a moment, I think my parties are divided. <br /> <br /> When they first rise to orbit, the boy says, "The moon is just for viewing! Get me back! 'Also, the better moments of the movie are not looking at how the team stretched the mouth and shouting at the acceleration G forces. (Perhaps the best moment of the movie can be detected on the screen by a large "END".) <br /> <br /> We also find that they can't open the door, because "boob" fixed it before it went away. Of course, the "spacebar" of a spacecraft, which we later learn, has never been carried by a space device and knows nothing about zero gravity. Like Baby Huey, the grown fat comic strip party said, "It sounds logical!" The effect of non-gravity-in-space is so bad that it is painful to look. (Everyone knows that in the absence of gravity everything tends to rise.) \ THow does this movie get from 10.3 to 6.3 stars, if the other tremendously better movies aren't higher, the mystery is for me. I like old sci-fi movies, but it's not realistic, and flat tests with humor of character that throw the fat well at the boob station doesn't work at all - it just destroys the film. I think it is not the whole movie that I hate so much that the "boob" is so obviously not someone who would be on the spacecraft - not even "grease the hatch". OMG. I don't know if he also checked the fan straps. Maybe if they left the trip, it may not be so painful. However, this is only average. What everyone else is saying, I don't know. <br /> <br /> Do you want to watch a clean 1950s space movie? "Rocketship X-M" wins all that heck. Maybe not so much "realism", but a more serious story and less funny signs.
