This is the worst film I've ever seen in my life. If you are not masochism, you will never see it. It was an inadequately long, pointless, eye-catching, depressing film and forever leads my list of bad movies. Who has written this movie is sadist. I finished almost at the end, it was so bad. I'd like to give him zero stars, but because it's not an option, I'll give it one.
