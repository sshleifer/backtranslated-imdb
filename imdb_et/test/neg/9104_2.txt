This movie was so bad on so many levels. Writing was terrible that even the best actors couldn't watch this movie. It's a shame because they have good actors in this movie. I mean, if someone has seen the police academy, you know Steve Guttenberg was good. His character in this film was very serious, which was a big difference compared to the signs I saw him before, so it was a plus. And I thought Steve Guttenberg was very hot in this movie. With or without a shirt, you can't deny having a big body! Sexy face. He loved the shadow at 5 o'clock, making him feel dangerous. One part of the movie where she is in bed without her shirt, and I have to say I would be happy to come in and try to take my thoughts out of my problems! So honestly I'd just look at this movie just to fantasy!
