Does it seem somewhat familiar? Wait, that's right. 90% of the jokes in this movie have already been made in the TV series. What is the point of repeating, can you ask? Is it for the Americans who haven't seen the program? Did the screenwriters get inspired? Or maybe everyone who has suffered suffering suddenly suffered an amnesia attack and forgot that they had already covered this ground? In both cases, the one who sat in the first three series was really bored. I had to turn off this "green green" part during the "tablet" period. Yes, it's very funny, but give us something originality for goodness! In fact, if the best new things you can come up with is taking Leonard Rossiter's Saturday night, you can forget it. <br /> <br /> The man he replaces late Richard Beckin is beautiful, but not half the actor. I personally took this role as a tribute to him. Or better not to bother to make the movie at all and let the TV series have fun. But no, they couldn't do it ... not as long as the money was needed. Sad, really. 4/10
