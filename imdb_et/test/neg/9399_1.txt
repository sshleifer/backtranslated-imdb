Ridiculous, nauseated dogger with a terrible effect; unfairly, superficially and trying to trawl all the most banal clich√©s about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. The main actor is nervously waving his way through the film, trying to portray a suitable level of inequality, self-blissful self-esteem, valuable character and script. I'm sure this book was bad, but it wasn't that bad! The camera is permanently equipped with a vivid "Tuscan" lens filter (maybe Tuscany sun was not enough for Tuscany?), Which they forgot to remove when the scene changes between Rome and (how imaginative!) The Amalfi coast. You have never seen the white marble of the monument of Vittorio Emmanuelle in Rome that is so yellow ... I mean Tuscany. One of the worst movies ever and hence quite worthwhile.
