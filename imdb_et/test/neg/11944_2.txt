I hesitated watching this movie, having really enjoyed the original, mostly Martha. What a disappointment. Catherine Zeta Jones is a good actor but it wasn't her movie. The original had bright moments that created an amazing soundtrack. No reservation felt it was ever connected. Food, Characters - Nothing Feeling Passionate. Mostly Martha had food alive - every scene was filmed so you could taste it with your own eyes - smells, textures. Food "No Reservation" was in the background - rarely did we get the preparation; the characters were not real enough to wear the movie without it. Filming was difficult - many scenes felt uncomfortable. See the original - it's a really enjoyable movie; The sound is incredible.
