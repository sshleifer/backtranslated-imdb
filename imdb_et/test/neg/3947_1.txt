I tried. God knows I caught a Swiss cheese like a movie, but the story was too full of holes, some big to travel through the horse. The general action was uniform and the characters loved enough that you regretted that they died like a recently sprayed roach, scattering death with their death. In general, it wasn't really very scary. After that, we have seen that the background of "The Brood" is a spooky, fast-moving background, so why when / and it was scary, then just briefly. This film never solved the basic plot points and it is the writer's work. Of course, you would expect the director to start dealing with the fact that the story didn't make sense. Like the secret room behind the wardrobe, why didn't the bloody hungry ghost die when he got the nails as he had previously read in the book? Why did the computer say that Frankie was doing a "game over" though he lived? The list continues and continues. I don't feel comfortable if you want to recommend this movie because it makes you feel like you're wasting your time and there wasn't enough money in really frightening moments.
