I have had a good mood to give this shameful, predictable and embarrassing film even 3. What's wrong? We start with free birth, although I admit that the pedigree rotation style was something I have never seen (or experienced) before. And I think they also recorded a few bucks, showing three times the same sex scene. Then there are contradictions. "Oakville Tribune" seems to be in the green part of any city it was supposed to be. (Hamilton Ontario ??) But on the roof, it seems to be in an industrial area with a steel plant that roasts smoke and flames. Also inside the building --- newsroom --- stairs --- look much larger than outside. SPOILERS HERE When our terrible reporter is finally fired, he returns several times to the building once an hour. Hardly likely. The end is also a mercifully predictable ... classic bait and switch whim, where a good boy is a bad man. But my biggest objection is that it is another film funded by the Canada and Ontario tax credit, which is a shame to set up in Canada, but again proves that the Canadian film industry is crazy and opportunistic. State films have to do more than just offering jobs. They should reflect culture. It's bad enough that American studios use Toronto in New York. But it is embarrassing and terrible when Canadian producers (in this case CanWest Global) do it with the help of federal and provincial governments. In a word ... BAH!
