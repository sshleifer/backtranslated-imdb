All this show is the same plot. Kuszko (spelling?) Is in danger of school failure, he has to undergo emperor. He must learn something he thinks is stupid, then he uses it / learns more about it and realizes that it is not so stupid. Eezma, who is the principal, is trying to make Kuszko an animal to stop him. Every episode. <br /> <br /> The movie's jokes are copied (Eezma's incredibly complex plans, Kuszko interrupts the 4th wall constantly, squirrels.) They should try to hire some writers. <br /> <br /> 2/10
