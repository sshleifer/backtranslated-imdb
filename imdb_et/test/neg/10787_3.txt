I think the manuscript of this movie is written on toilet paper. There is no respect for many of the important details that make the film essentially. For example, the names of some Serbian terrorists (I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What are the names? Certainly not Serbia! By the way, Caradan Maldic !!! What a name, I laughed after that day thinking. Probably to Karadzic and Mladic. Secondly, the Serbs have never done terrorism. Such a major character as a journalist should have known this. Thirdly, Serbs do not even play Serbs or Serbs-Croatians. All this set aside, this movie works firmly, but the story is paper-thin and full of holes. Sometimes it makes no sense!
