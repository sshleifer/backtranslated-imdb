Some teenagers go to an old abandoned farm that stayed with their dead grandfather, not knowing there have been several murders for decades because their grandfather made a crap for a good harvest - could a man have thought of something better to sell his soul? His grandson and his friends have been created for the next sacrifice for reasons that have never been explained. Stereotypical teenage son and his girlfriend, a black boy with a white girlfriend, and two lesbians have to fight with three killer scarecrows, but don't be fooled as I was, it's not nearly as fun as it sounds. It is usually just a lot of talk about kicking the ball, smoking and the leading actor, who complain that they never know their parents. The work of the camera is terrifying and shaky, maybe done with some scenes recorded by a hand-held camcorder, which may be good, because pea scarves look like they just came from a child's birthday, and probably they could hire two people to play three peacocks! Some of the best films I've seen have been these low budget independent horror movies, but it's just pathetic. It seems that the cast and the team just formed a number of people who knew each other, had never acted before and did not intend to act again, and had a few thousand dollars (I can't believe this film costs $ 130,000) and in their free weekend their hands Even a lesbian skinny dipping scene is flat. <br /> <br /> I think it is also fun that following this letter, the sequel to this movie has even bothered to add IMDb. <br /> <br /> * out ****, and I only appreciate it because of a lean, bright scene, no matter how flat it is.
