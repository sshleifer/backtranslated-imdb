The man (Gaston Modot) and the Young Girl (Lya Lys) are passionate about the film they are consuming. They have to be together, but their moments are constantly interrupted. The film will gather together with the pictures and will stop in a few hours ......... do lovers find happiness ....? .. <br /> <br /> The film starts with interesting scorpions, but you will soon realize that it is all pretentious nonsense. It's made for a silent movie that has an occasional dialogue and has a non-stop soundtrack that at one point is so irritating that you turn off the sound and want to silently record it. Continuous drum rollers must be crazy for the cinema audience. There are some really funny moments, for example, when a man strikes a dog and he knocks a blind person. Unfortunately, this humor is in the name of art, so it's just a pseudo nonsense. The movie is nonsense.
