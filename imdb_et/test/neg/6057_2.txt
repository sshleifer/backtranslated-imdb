This is the worst adaptation I have ever seen in Greek mythology. It is completely unsuccessful when the original myth was adjusted, the silly plot was invented and the work was reduced by 12 ... 3 or 4, I think. It is completely unnecessary to try to integrate other myths into cumbersome ways that question the writers have ever read myths, such as the exchange of birds in harpies, lions sphinx, Tiresia Delphi Oracle, and bulls pedant. Proteus version, even integrating aspects that have never seen outside of Sam Raim's entertaining series concerning his first marriage, to a woman who had a name chosen from one Fur, so it sounds in the appropriate period. <br /> <br /> I can accept it a lot, but it does not lose its full clean film standards; the most painful is the dialogue, leaden, portentous pseudo-shakespeare trips. This is a bad reinterpretation of myths, making a sad attempt at the postmodern revisionism that Crichton's "13th Warrior" attempted against the legend of Beowulph, but still containing strict mythological elements such as clear interference with the gods and magical superpower. The long and sad failure of the entertainment experience I am sure many of the involved high quality participants will deeply regret.
