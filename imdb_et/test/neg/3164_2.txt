This movie looks good, and it's about where my praise ends. "Love is a Matter of a Split" appeared in the very schizophrenic year of 1955 as a candy-colored mess as it was with an exhibiting art fair like "Kiss Me Deadly". As a trend for smaller, socially conscious films, such as "On the Waterfront" and "Marty", in the mid-50s, it has proved itself that other directors felt the need to remain unchallenged, the tortured melodrama that categorizes so many other films of this decade, and "Love "is one of the last. <br /> <br /> This is the type of 50's movie, where Technicolor is used to its toughest and lighting is always high; even in dark rooms or at night, the scenes are brighter than the average sunny day. I never want to listen to a song song because it is often played during the film to last for someone's life, and I definitely don't want to hear that it is being sung alongside the ear-piercing cream that puts it on the headline. Jennifer Jones and William Holden are satisfying, but anyone could have played these parts. The role of Jones is terribly written - his character is incredibly inconsistent, and it seems that if his character needs to be decided, the scriptwriters turned the coin to decide what that decision would be. <br /> <br /> People will undoubtedly say that I take this movie too seriously, that I am uneven and so on. But I loved "Everything in the sky," released in the same year and just like a cornball in its own way, except that Douglas Sirk can turn the melodrama into an art form, while Henry King ("Love" director) is not. <br /> <br /> I usually enjoy bad melodrama, but in that case I was just bored. <br /> <br /> Rating: D +
