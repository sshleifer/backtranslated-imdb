The filmmaker Bryan Forbes, who was once a light, sardonic touch with light material like "Whistle Down the Wind" and the original "Stepford Wives", is here to the bottom. His direction is not only intuitive but also adapted Sidney Sheldon's early novel; the results are cruel. Roger Moore plays a psychiatrist for the murder of one of his patients; Rod Steiger is a policeman with a neck collar (it's just his most embarrassing force). The only actor to live here is Elliott Gould, who knows something or a couple to enliven the little script. Bland, messy and produced cheaply. NO STARS from ****
