I like vampire movies, I like B-movies, I love B-vampire movies. But it has almost nothing. Some of the actions are terrible, especially for 3 males. The story is not particularly interesting. In a relatively short 88 minute, it still seems too long and you can move forward quickly. There are many Kung-fu vampire attacks. Sound cool? This is not when it is done with a small budget. It repeats very quickly. There are some small blood and gore, nothing to get. There are some good wires where you can see the wires. This is some good landscapes filmed in Puerto Rico. <br /> <br /> No fee to rent
