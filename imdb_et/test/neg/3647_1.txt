Just do a little research on making this movie. Something as simple as Google search. It was funded by the US Army and was promoted in time for elections. This is a great idea, but I would rather see the DOCUMENTARY, not something the Bush administration edited and its reality. The timing of the release of the film, its tone and the fact that MS&L promoted it raised questions about the film's intention. "According to MS & L's Executive Director Joe Gleason, he and his colleagues are giving concrete electoral messages to the Iraqi war," wrote Eartha Melzer. "Is the left-hand prone art house one of these constituencies? Does the government hire documentaries to promote the US population? Anyone who is involved in the film is not ready to say who originally put the money for the film or how they were represented by the military PR company."
