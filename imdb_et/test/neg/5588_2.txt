Wow, what is it on the shelf of a video store in front of me? Nothing but questionable "sequel" to 8MM. It was not a very good sequel to a movie that had a very final ending and a lot of emotional depth that was much larger than this movie. <br /> <br /> In essence, the scriptwriter, American diplomat David Huxley and his groom Tish Harrington perceive in Budapest, Hungary, where he sees who has extorted them to prostitute Risa. The whole story is based on a variety of characters who make up these different sex clubs and bands throughout the city. The mystery is solved when it finally turns out that Tish discovers that the ransom money and (essentially the story later) his fianc√©, who came out of his trust fund, basically goes back to his future spouse when the story ends up in a fragmented end. <br /> <br /> I didn't like how it had anything to do with the original 8MM. The only type of thriller near the original is that it was that David arrives at him with some kind of slave teaching to keep him as a prisoner, like the world of the first film kinky and the fact that the film has sexual sex in almost every key event. Otherwise it is a completely different film. It has prepared a bad story of love, even before the end of it, to know what makes the end more possible because I did not believe that the words from David's mouth come all the time. But we were warned that he was lying about most of the things that might be in trouble for him. <br /> <br /> In most of the "shocking" moments of the movie, ridiculous naked scenes were trying to mix the emotions in the audience so that Tishi could delight in being able to leave this "hellish" generation. I read at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences if there was nothing other than sex. Even the DVD menu screen has nothing more than a movie with naked women to make the DVD completely provocative. <br /> <br /> David wasn't a hero of the whole movie. It may be thought that he was the main problem before the end. Participants who played every role were all new to me, which could explain how they got so much to act "respect". There were holes in the plot (how did David and Richard finally create Tish's father when he wanted to sign a lease when David was so damn investigation to try and find a prostitute?)? like a bondage queen) and a gay brother who did nothing but show how the director tried Joaquin Phoenix to play this character. The tag line on the profile in this video is also a complete BS because it wasn't even the last breath. No one dies really. But they had a good car accident queue that came out somewhere ... but it was a good 10 second hour and 3/4 long movie. <br /> <br /> Go for rent (and maybe buy) the original. This is one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films. It's all about this movie. I don't recommend seeing it if you don't want to compare apples to oranges.
