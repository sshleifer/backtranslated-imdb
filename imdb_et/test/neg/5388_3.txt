This movie can be great, but it is Bill Forsythe's comfort and pleasure. c & j is one of the sweetest movies I've ever seen without diabetes. <br /> <br /> It's okay if you like it, but you realize that all of this movie is direct hanging. <br /> <br /> The original is http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0087072. I can recommend almost everything - forsythe - a local hero, Gregory's daughter, this sinking. I'm better off renting today. The local is young Peter Capaldi and the old Burt Lancaster. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he gave up filming after a somewhat unpleasant Hollywood treatment. Sad.
