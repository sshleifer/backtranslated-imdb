All my friends and other colleagues think this exhibition is so big. First I hate this show !!!!!!! I think I can be the only woman in life !!! I just looked at it because my best friend loves it and feels like Charlotte's character! it is likely that each STD has and has mucus, brown and green genital organs, considering that it is sexual (it tries to do something). there would be no entertainment since Samantha (along with some good NY terrain) is the only reason to look and are not reasoned enough. <br /> <br /> Charlotte (Kristen Davis) is a well-dressed top-class NY idiot who still believes in Pince Charming myth! But sweet and beautiful, she doesn't let it fool, she spreads quite often. <br /> <br /> Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is now a woman with a stereotypical angry butch feminist. I think in one episode he thinks he's a lesbian, but he's probably not ... What a shame he's almost interesting. <br /> </p> I swear I thought I was looking at Twisted Sister's frontal side of Dee Snider's more masculine view, cross dressing, sissy boy, brother! This is a girl who is looking for can't live without you love .... Heard a puppy? <br /> <br /> This exhibition is stupid and I love it for fun because I hear how this is a new awakening for women. It's just sad if you want to look at slutty, pathetic, addictive people too expensive clothes drinking cosmopolitans and sounding like a tedious 15 a. Old cocaine as there is a show for you ... use protection.
