I really wanted to like such a movie, but it barely put out 3. It is surprising that the equal numbers of votes were 10, the other half 1. All the characters were entertaining and even talented, but the whole movie didn't pay. Sebastian Hernandez is tempting; charismatic and pleasant (even physically reminiscent of Marc Anthony in a more easily accessible, but ultimately conscious way), but even he was unable to save the confusion of the film. Scenes that are too long and the points were finally killed. The banana event saw absorption, which apparently showed how much movement was in his boxers. But in his defense, his first film as a director (that I am aware of it) and I appreciate his love. It just left me empty, no matter what I was trying to say. Finally, I think this story would have been more experienced by a more experienced director. What I've seen "adding" is a real story behind it, and maybe when I look at them, I appreciate this test.
