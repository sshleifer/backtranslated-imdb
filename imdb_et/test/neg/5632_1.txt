This movie was a clean trash. Never a worse movie. If it was broken, it worked enough to do the job, but the script was so stupid and so stupid to think, "Where did my life go?" Even Vanessa Redgrave, whom I love (and why I watched it), was wasted. Totally wasted. He didn't even impress. Leadership was so far away that non-characters left me a lot, but leaving Redgrave leaves nothing. His part was nothing. He was good as an average boss, but it was so. Whether depth and depth are given to small roles ~ Venus and reconciliation. I don't waste my time and I was upset that I spent $ 5 on this movie ... I wanted it back. There are no refunds. Leave the movie closed. It only brings you grief ... and boredom.
