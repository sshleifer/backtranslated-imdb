This movie is never one of the worst control marks. I say this because he is a hero when I think everything he does in the whole movie screws people's lives and creates problems. He can't do anything right, but because of the movie he seems like a cool guy to whom everyone should look. He is outraged at the wrong times everywhere, he has all the wrong views on things that end with people being angry with him and killing people, being too nervous, too unwavering, too macho, too assuming, making all the wrong decisions, and having no common sense. It is about a private investigator hired by a successful painter to find the woman and son he walked many years ago. The detective finds a woman and what she sees as her son. But all such things make this story a criminal, a drama and a twist. It's made for the TV, what are you waiting for? <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie is quite fun. Johnny Depp is very young in this and has a terrible 80-year-old hairstyle. He looks at the rubber and throws the football ball for about 5 minutes and that's all we can see him. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the VHS Extract sells this version for $ 40 at online auctions. It must be for Johnny Depp collection only. It cannot be a plot. It can't be. <br /> <br />
