** Maybe spoilers ** ** is hard to spoil this thing, but only if ** Gee's I don't see how anyone could have done it again! It was like a "made T.V" for the show and still pretty flat for it. A lot of fake snow, bad works with top notes, bad action and this crazy pine forest in Detroit. What the hell ?? !! I didn't think it was a great movie, but I was hoping it was entertaining. No, we stayed asleep and had to finish it the next day. I could have missed the rest easy (but I would have lost those big pine forests!) I am so glad I missed it in the theater! It is bad enough that $ 3.50 is wasted in a video store. And I'm a cop, a lover of action and drama. It was a very smelly 10 stars. Give me the original every day !!
