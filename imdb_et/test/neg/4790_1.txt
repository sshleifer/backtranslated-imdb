Other than a policeman and what shows where a child dies to eat a broken hamburger in bed, it has been the worst and dumbest show ever to live the best time. If not Jason Lee's unfair success in the film, this exhibition would never have evolved if it had been relatively unknown. <br /> <br /> TERRIBLE. Moron redneck hick spends his lottery winnings to redeem his past white waste. Is it funny? periodically but not consistently. Is it silly? Every single episode. <br /> <br /> I have seen many great exhibitions that will come before my time, but this mistake has lasted longer than I could have imagined. Dialogue is incredibly strange, as are episode themes. Each IQ over 100 years of episode is an absolute struggle. And Cake Powder? Jason Lee's annoying voice that speaks of every episode. If it were not for the southern culture of the country and for the southern generations, there would be no audience for this exhibition. <br /> <br /> If you are a moral and you need an example that is completely lacking in sense of humor, bad dialogue and dim signs that will not work in life ... then you are probably an actor actor.
