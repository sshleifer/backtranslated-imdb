this is a terrible adaptation of Charles Kingsley's story. Animation is, terribly, terrible. And the songs are disgraceful to record songs, especially the "high cockororim" song they repeat. I'm sorry that Jon Pertwee and David Jason, two of Britain's best talents, offer the voice of a depressing animation. Bernerd Cirbbins is trying his best to fill this terrible production, but he can't. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs, even if it is the last movie on this planet!
