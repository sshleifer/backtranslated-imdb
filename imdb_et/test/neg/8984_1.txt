I'm not leaving IMDb comments on movies, but ... this movie was bad. very bad. I passed it through the majority quickly, stopping where I hoped that the action has improved since the last scene, but to proceed quickly. Formula One - when the obvious murderers were discounted, there was only one. And it was within the first five minutes. According to the scene, it seemed as if I had already read the script, because there were no surprises, no secret. Tori's character ... bad bad actor. A real waste of time on the DVD and a definite "let's go to bed early" when it's the only thing on television. When you watch this movie, you will find yourself never again wasting time.
