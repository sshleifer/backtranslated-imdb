Sometimes when I watch this movie, I start thinking that the people who made this movie were drugs. What this film is wrong, I tell you a bad plot, bad jokes. about Pest Vargas, who is a two-bit scammer who is given the opportunity to $ 50,000 to survive a 24-hour German hunter who kills people for living. Now Pest has to think about how I think this hunter before he is killed. <br /> <br /> I know what your idea "What the hell is this?" Another wannabe Ace Ventura, who is trying to get the money, is sometimes bored and confusing because it changes the plot plot and gets lost in the movie. <br /> <br /> In a funny scene, this film had a straight face oh yes yes I smiled a few times, but laughed out a lot. The jokes are funny and seen before it is like Ace Ventura's meeting with Dumb and Dumber, but bad. dry and lame.You don't know much about the main characters of Pest, all you know is his annoying scam hustler, but that is that he doesn't change his image or be a little smart just for the german hunter all you are is crazy and wants to go back to germany. you really start wondering why this man lives on the island if he has the money to go to Germany. Hunter's son Himmel's prices are better, but not much. finally he is obsessed with standing with his father and his sides with Pest. <br /> <br /> As for action not nly there were all the memorable perforamces, but just above the vertex. who plays the same thing as a hunter, but gives stereotypical performance as well as simply not being used enough or just over the rest for the rest. <br /> <br /> A common bad comedy you can find for $ 2.00 in K-Mart.
