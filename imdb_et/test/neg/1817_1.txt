I felt that the previous night's episode was slow and sometimes boring. I don't honestly believe he has to do anything about writing. Because I know this story was well staged and tried to keep things. I thought it wasn't so bad, but generally I didn't enjoy it. The most guilty of this episode director is Stephen Williams. I always hated the leadership of Stephen Williams. If Jack Bender continues with this episode of the premiere of the season, he would have kept it at a good pace and kept things floating to keep things interesting. I'm glad that Jack Bender is running the next week's episode and it's much better and I'm glad he got the first Syaid episode to lead and I'm curious what he's pulling this time because Stephen Williams was too much Syaid-led episodes before. <br /> <br /> I've always thought Stephen Williams should be thrown out of the show. He doesn't even do anything interesting for the show. <br /> <br /> Why should the opening be a helicopter target? It was so ANSWER! Camera Work Bad Perspective!
