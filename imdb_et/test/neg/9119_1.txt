Wasn't it the fact that it came as a 2-DVD disc connected to America's original Graffiti; Wouldn't it be that I have been in Iraq for several months and now I'm looking at pretty much anything, I would have thrown this garbage after the first ten minutes. This movie was so terribly bad on so many levels, I just don't know where to start. Poorly acted, shot, staged, written, threw, edited. My 9-year-old daughter's first attacks on filmmaking are better - and she's filming the dog's sleep. (Think about it, I'll give it nine stars to this cinema. There is no redeeming feature in this movie except for an Icelandic girl who doesn't even have one line in English. I'm not wasting more of my time describing what this bad movie is about.
