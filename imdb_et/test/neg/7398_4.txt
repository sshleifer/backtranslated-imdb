It is one of the incredibly standard Western, with some bad behavior, dull story and silly action. It has all the usual clich√©s, yes, even in the bar struggle and in the movie there are really no surprises. It makes it dull and weak to the west, as well as to a small extent, because it is so poorly made. Calling and editing can be called bad and all the sequences of action on the film are incredibly stupid. Maybe it becomes almost unusual to look, for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> This story is not so interesting. This is a very friendly western (not even blood), where for strange reasons it seems to be against the younger brothers, who are portrayed as good and very friendly in this film. The story goes quieter and faces when it ends. The younger brothers really existed and were part of the James-Younger gang, including the famous brothers Frank and Jesse James. Of course, they were not as friendly as they were depicted in this film. It was just normal when in the early 40s it was a pleasant man. Indeed, in the Spaghetti-Western era, the main characters did not become rotten criminals. Strangely enough, what has approached has always worked better than those early Western countries where the main character is the good of the law. color. It was something quite unique for the 40's western countries, and it gives the film something extra. However, you may wonder why they shot this western color in full color. The film is still in the black-and-white early western style and I believe that this film would have been a bit more reliable if it was made in black and white. <br /> <br /> This western world is easy to do. <br /> <br /> 4/10
