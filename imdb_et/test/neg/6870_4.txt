There is very little to say about this film. Walter Pidgeon is a truly convincing hero and even a moorish when he tries to go "secretly" when a villain who wants to believe is drinking too much and hitting his wife a bit. Margaret Leighton, as a woman / secret sergeant is a bit more convincing, but still hard to believe that any salt worthy of her salt would not have seen her symbol in less than a minute. The plot, which is a precious metal body, is silly, and it rather drags the grip. David Tomlinson, who plays Algyi in the same way as David Tomlinson, plays all his roles, is the only brightness in the light in a totally dull sense.
