I've been a classic horror fan all my life. Many nights rose to the beginning of the morning, watching "Horror Incorporated" and "Creature Feature Night" feature films. Unfortunately, I watched this movie early in the evening and still almost asleep me. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever seen a "horror" picture where everything was so factual. Dr. Edelmann does not believe in supernatural, but before that he cures Dracul medically and looks at Larry Talbot's transformation into Wolfman, barely blinking eyes. He and Talbot discover the Frankenstein monster as it is a daily event. Edelmann has all fired to bring the monster back to life, but after Talbot, Miliza and Nina protests he is like "Aww, you're right. No big deal." After opening Dracula's betrayal, he opens the count to sunlight and POOF! -Le the coffin, he's gone, just like that. <br /> <br /> The only person who didn't seem to call his phone numbers was Jane Adams as. Nina. At the end of the movie, his prize is backed by hell in the back of Frankenstein Monster. And no one even tries to save her! He, Dr. Edelmann and the monster, all die, while Talbot and Miliza leave the castle at random. <br /> <br /> It is definitely a Universal low point in the classic horror years.
