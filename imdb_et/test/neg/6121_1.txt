This movie was a waste of time. It looks nice, beautiful settings, well-behaved, serious and seems to be leading somewhere so that you will be remembered while waiting for meaningful profitability. It doesn't happen. <br /> <br /> It surprised me that the movie can be put on so much effort, it was clearly done in a very professional way, and the result is nothing for the b-movie. <br /> <br /> Save your precious time and watch a good French movie like Les Visiteurs (funny), Jean de Florette or Spring Manon. I do not remember the Europa Europa language, but this is another great movie - a hard but very worth watching. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to promise a lot but does not give anything.
