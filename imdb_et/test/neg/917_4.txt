I am usually a fan of "art" and "foreign" films, but when I saw it, my reaction was "to be called experimental because it makes no sense." "Action" is static, while bouncing from one place to another. There are not enough headlines to make clear who is who and what their relationship is. Obviously, the main idea was to show that murder, adultery, and generally strange and inseparable behavior is the treatment offered by the authorities, which is the expulsion of a completely innocent black man.
