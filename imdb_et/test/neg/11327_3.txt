It's boring. <br /> <br /> It's slow. <br /> <br /> Where are the nasty and brutal murders? Where is the tension that should frighten us? It's like watching Sesame Street without Ernie and Bert or Grover's funny characters. <br /> <br /> It's really flat. Maybe act, maybe editing, maybe filmmaking, maybe special effects, maybe makeup. /> <br /> I wanted to scare ... not boring. <br /> <br /> It didn't frighten me ... it didn't even interest me ... I had a lot of fun watching the microwave instead of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about buying it ... and if you see it on television for some fun, there's no need to sleep.
