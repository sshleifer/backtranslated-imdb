A totally ridiculous film that makes the college entrance process fun. While it is true that SAT is not all in the assessment of admission to college, what the film is about is completely ridiculous and not worth repeating or viewing. <br /> <br /> College Reception Officers look like foolish people with a very narrow view of the whole process. The film is offensive to work-based high school students who work hard and therefore have to suffer during a long process until they receive the application they have requested. <br /> <br /> This movie definitely deserves rejection at all levels.
