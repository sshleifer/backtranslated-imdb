When that show started, it was quite interesting: we could see what a crab boat fisherman had to go through during the crab fishing season. Shortly thereafter, he lost focus on fishing and almost completely focused on the fisherman's life drama. Episodes did not change anything other than "the captain does not like the new greenery" (it happens too often), "someone is injured or ill", "the fisherman gets a word at home and is disappointed that he is stuck on the boat, repeat. know how people watch the latest seasons, because every episode seems to be essentially the same as before and after. This exhibition should be redirected to another channel and renamed "Crab Boat Drama" or even better if it was the perfect one-off Dirtiest Jobs <br /> <br /> Should Discovery Channel not learn its lesson after American Choppers?
