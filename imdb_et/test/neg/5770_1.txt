And believe me, it's a pretty stunning achievement. Take the "Jolly Roger: Massacre in Cutter's Cove", turn the murderer into a prospector, change his obsession from buried treasure to the old gold and his color bangs from green to deep blue. You now have "Miner's Massacre". The problem is that at least "Jolly Roger" was fun enough - albeit so bad - it's a good way - to keep watching it for two hours. There's no strip-joint-murder scene, no odd killings. I can't tell you how many times I lost interest in "Miner Massacre" and started to taste or clean the apartment. And the end is completely stupid. The 49-year-old guy accidentally gets out somewhere to kill the local sheriff, while the chief actor and actor sit on a sheriff cruise and scream. Truly terrible movie.
