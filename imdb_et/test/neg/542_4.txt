First of all I want to say that I'm a very big Naruto fan. I love Anime and Manga stories. The first film also confirmed that Naruto is a great fun, great action, great story, ... But then another movie came. I was very hyped because the first movie turned out to be great. But it didn't satisfy me a bit ... The story was flat, the action wasn't so big ... especially when compared to the Anime series ... the same goes for the quality of animation. I found it very bad ... Can the story get a camera ... WHAT ??? Where is Naruto Kyuubi? He never turns to a demon ... I mean ... Come on! My advice is ... look at the series (up to episode 140, it's just fillers) and read Manga, because it's still big. Ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future ... <br /> <br /> All I gave it to 4 just because it is Naruto ...
