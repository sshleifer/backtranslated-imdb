Let me tell you about Edward D. Wood's Jr. He had a passion for his work, which I wanted more people to have. If we all had optimism and Ed Wood's leading hope, the world would probably be a much better place. Being familiar with Ed Wood's story and having repeatedly seen the most amazing "Ed Wood" (1994), I admire his courage and his aspirations for the work he loved; I still admire his non-say-death attitude. He loved to say that I want more people in Hollywood today. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't make her movies look more fun. And "Glen or Glenda", his first and most famous film, is probably his worst. <br /> <br /> "Glen or Glenda" is a deadly cult movie about Glen (director / writer Ed Wood himself who, despite his love for his bride Barbara (Dolores Fuller), is unable to conquer her desire for transvestitism she dresses in women's clothes and wig and becomes ... Glenda! The story of Glen / Glenda is told by a doctor and she speaks and follows a mysterious character called "Scientist" played by veteran horror star Bela Lugosi. the story of Alan / Anne's character, who becomes a transsexual based on the story of Christine Jorgenson, to whom this film was originally entitled "I changed my sex!" was the basis for the past. <br /> <br /> Have I fallen behind your jaw? if i want to warn you about this picture, if you have never seen it, i never say a lie about the movie and there is no wrong word in this plot. Everything is true about it. This theme does not sound very attractive and is not very appealing. I'm sure that with a good scenario and a good director (not), "Glen or Glenda", regardless of the subject, could have been a very moving picture. It is a confidential film about Wood's part because he was a transvestite both in life and on screen. But again, it does not make a good movie ... or traceable to it. "Glen or Glenda" is a confusing, inaccurate confusion about a movie that sinks into new ditches in the field of bad cinema. It makes no sense than his notoriously silly scene where Bela Lugos shouts "Pull a string!" unexplained bison material. Most of the film has been told in a monotonous voice, reminding me of the very bad short information I've seen before. It's like one of those very bad short films that was expanded into a seventy-minute-long feature and twice dimmed. We are sitting there, waiting for a plot that never comes. There is no real attempt to even build energy when the camera is locked in one position for many difficult minutes and long periods where nothing happens. The only moments that are worthy of someone's time are Bela Lugos, who can bring them into the dark ditches. I think Lugosi should be like the divinity of the movie, but personally I don't care about who or what he should be. I'll tell you what he was: a talented actor who ended up in the trash. But he and Wood were very good friends and loved to work with each other, so good for him. <br /> <br /> I always admire Edward D. Woodi Jr. as long as I live, admire my films. The film critic once called Ed Wood's films "innocent fun", but I think even this is questionable. Innocent? Yes, yes. Fun? No, sir. And if "Citizen Kane" is Everest in the cinematic world, "Glen or Glenda" is probably Mariana Trench.
