If Andrei Tarkovsky had been a cage, he would have led her mother and son instead of Mirror. This is one of the most terrible films made around the world, I'm convinced. The son, without name, takes care of his mother without a name. They love each other, I think. No, they're not, I'm sure. These are not characters. They are not even characters with players. At least it may be beautiful, but even nature seems ridiculously touched and changed where it was needed on a Macintosh computer. And could Sokurov have developed a technique that is perplexed as a distorted aspect? You should have been born yesterday to buy this garbage. 1/10.
