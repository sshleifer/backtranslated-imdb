Keep away from it. The worst thing is a terrible story. It seems that there are plans to deliver some fine mental / love / friendship messages, but it is so pathetic about any substance you can't help but force. In addition, most of the time on the screen is much more recent about thefts, criminals and our heroes dealing with the artifact of an alien journey. I know you are asking for time when you do, but the story is more than usual. You also have: cheap kits, poor performance and some of the worst music arrangements in the history of moving images that are impossible, inexpensive, steep and discrete. All I can say is "a person alive! This movie is bad!"
