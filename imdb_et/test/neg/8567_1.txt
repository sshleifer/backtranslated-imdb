The film is nothing extraordinary. In fact, it is an insult to the horror genre. Something that's not enough to be scary ... not even close to a frightening threshold ... <br /> <br /> This is another case of seeing another "teenage horror movie" and you have all seen it. The first few minutes of the movie and you'll find out what's going on. The worst part is that the script is sharper than the last part of the scary movie. It would have been better if it was written in Spanish. And don't let me get started with fun and punchline. <br /> <br /> Although I give little credit for special effects. But trust me, as every other Hollywood made horror film, CGI and special effects have little or no effect on the horror film's ability to scare. In fact, it makes it worse. <br /> <br /> There is not much to see in this movie between fresh-looking Anita Briem and the horrible location.
