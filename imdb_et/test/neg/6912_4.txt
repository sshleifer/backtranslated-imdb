When I watched this movie, I was coming home afternoon after work. I love horror films and I've seen some really hair, but it takes a cake. The plot displayed at the beginning of the movie seems a bit intriguing, but when the film progresses, the script turns a wrong turn with terrible clich√©s and poor presentation, which in turn makes the movie completely boring and boring. I don't want to criticize the script and plot because I believe it is not the worst part. I have to say that the whole actor was not terrible because I was impressed by Taylor Locke, one of his first films. The worst part of the movie was special effects. They looked at the low budget and destroyed the viewers' entertainment, even if he was interested in the plot. I suggest you watch this movie to understand the bad script and plot power. Only then can you really understand good writers and directors.
