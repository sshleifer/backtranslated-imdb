Dear Film Director: <br /> <br /> In the future, if you try to create urgency, it may be best for your hero to * run instead of running / mixing. Especially when you try to strengthen the schedule. For example, if you try to convince an audience that a bad man kills a hostage, if the hero does not find him, it is probably a good idea to convey the feeling that your hero believes it can actually happen ... Let's face it. * Making a good * movie was probably not your goal. Your goal was to pump out some garbage that makes more money than you pay. Otherwise you could have hired some participants. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, boring viewer. <br /> <br /> This is the worst film I've ever seen. I can't say it's the worst because I can stop it. It was bad, bad, bad. Dude, where's my return?
