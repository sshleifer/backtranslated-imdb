... don't waste your time looking at this vanity project. My comment is now twice deleted for reasons that I do not yet understand, except for the suspicion that someone associated with "Gone" is not happy with what I had to say. So, I've been parked with things that are nitty this time and an excerpt from my original comments, which in no way can be considered a personal attack by anyone or an unfair comment: <br /> <br /> "" Gone "is a kind of train wreck that gives Dreadful, inclined dialogue, a script that just looks like a fish out of the water, acting to shame the most self-centered cinematography of the community theater, inspired by the "Survivor" school, which has dug crane shots, followed by static, nostril close-ups, terrible ADR work, special visual effects, pedestrian music that can't fully maintain mood or emotion, terrible editing completely useless freezes and fades, talk about any artistic direction --- Poor Lydia goes on and on ... I felt disappointed as time went by, I took most of this fast ... the time that could have been better spent than looked in the wall ... Under no circumstances should anyone u be very nice to read this topic on this "movie" because long before it ends they want them to be "attacked" before they the mistake you made. "<br /> <br /> The case is closed. Amen.
