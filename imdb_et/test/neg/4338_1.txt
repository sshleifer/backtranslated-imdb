Don't pay attention to the terrible reviews of this movie here. This is the worst Van Damme movie and one of the worst I've ever seen. It would be an appeal to someone who does not have the depth of needing anything other than the armed forces and the explosions to be attracted. <br /> <br /> Seeing that Peter Hyams is leading it, he has realized that Peter is not a talent director, but is very good at shooting explosions and the like. But movies also need other elements; for example a story. It had no such thing. This may explain the obsession of some of Hyams' latest films, hardly better than this one. <br /> <br /> You can't think of how some people are behind the camera.
