"Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is one not too well known for the early American Hitchcock movie. But when the "lifeboat" (which unfortunately falls into this category) is an underestimated masterpiece, it is not really worth seeing all the captain of the film, who at the time (in the early 40s) wrote. And, to tell the truth, the failure to discover this film is really gone. <br /> <br /> "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is the usual and usual screw comedy where it is quite difficult to find a Hitchcock connection. Perhaps you can glimpse your shadow (which is not much) in the cruelty that Carole Lombard is sometimes able to (but it is well hidden in a personalized package), a vertigo scene where two characters are up for the commercial environment and perhaps the character of the mother. And that's it! Even the Hitchcock fan has little connection. <br /> <br /> And in the case of screwdriver comedies, the amateur doesn't have much more: no situation is exaggerated to be really funny, and we're, for example, far away from Hawks' masterpieces. And if one or two scenes are quite entertaining, Hitchcock's filmography is not even the most fun to create comic situations in almost all of his films (even "Psycho" can be considered a very dark humor). So, there is very little to save in this movie, which can't bother anyone (or maybe only both Hitchcock and the screw comedy who are in love with Carole Lombard) remain one of the not-well-known early American Hitchcock's Movies.
