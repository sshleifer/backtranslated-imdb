It's hard to say how bad this film is. Even in the 1950s, when the search for intellectual thought was fashionable and powerful rejection of physical comfort, clean clothes, discounts, etc. were a common reaction to the insidious middle classes in both the United States and Western Europe. has been smelly. The plot has several ex machina mishmash (if it is correct Latin grammar); the active ingredient consists of random hysterics (men and women) from the broken body; Watching Catherine Deneuve's (or someone's) breasts for free is valuable to Budweiser; The repetitive cytone orchestral performance in an abandoned building is sure that the Director General has a meaning, but for me this is another stupid symbol thrown under this meaningless movie - I rantan, because my time has been wasted watching this scam for art flick. The landscape is beautiful and the sex scene is hot - but under her clothes there is no substance for that king.
