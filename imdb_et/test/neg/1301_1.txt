This movie was just two nights running in ITV1 .. dear oh dear. Someone actually bought it with Robert Carlylse. OK, I got stuck from the beginning ... but what I saw was so bad that I thought not ... Nothing was based on reality, I doubt things would go on like they did in the movie. All this movie was poor. OK, cgi .. but there is no reality. Writing gave the impression of a stone hanger. Trying, I wasn't impressed. Yes, formula. The end could not be guessed. What I saw was the army's upper hand, the people who did heroic things, set aside time to do that, wouldn't it have happened? It was worse than leaving your brain on the door. It was annoying .. as someone else said ... yes, of course ... it would have happened ... not! Credit cards mentioned Quebec and Canada .. so it was co-production, the third party concerned missed it. I have to look back at that place. I'm not usually critical, but it's annoying me.
