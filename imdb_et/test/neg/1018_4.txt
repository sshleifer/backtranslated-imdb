The DVD of this movie is Alpha Video - a company that almost always releases the worst quality pictures. In Alpha protection, it is often the only print available but specialized for public and cheap film. If you find another printing by another company, try it first because printing this film is scratched and faded. However, compared to most Alpha DVDs, this is great - especially since the sound is quite clear (and Alpha never seems to contain closed captions - even with horrible sound-containing movies). <br /> <br /> The man has met the lady for a very long time. One night he's a bad boy and spends the night with another woman. Soon after he understood it, he would be cleaned of that bride, he would forgive him and they would marry. <br /> <br /> Very soon after the wedding she will get a foul speech from another woman - she must SEE to see her and have just tried to kill her. When they meet, he learns he has an STD and he wants him to know that he has it now. Then, although there is a sister and they treat her for suicide, she finds a weapon and kills herself! It makes a big mistake. She's not talking to her doctor and she's not talking to her new wife. Some time goes by and now she and the baby are infected! Then the doctor meets the man and tells him how important it is to get the treatment, and they show him the rooms that are filled with terribly infected people (in fact, these were only the people who had STD they stapled in a film with a syphilis). <br /> <br /> Sometimes the film is very progressive. It deals with a serious problem and it is interesting how the film encourages couples NOT to wait to get married but get married quickly and give them sexual demands - only with each other (not bad advice at all). On the other hand, the film never says exactly what it says. They never use the terms STD, VD, etc., nor do they mention these diseases. Often it refers to the syphilis, but at other times the herpes or other STDs are talked about - information is not very clear or specific - a very common problem with such films of this age. The audience that had heard at that time had to be quite confused about what they saw, and many of the more na√Øve have probably had some of their "faster" friends to explain to all of them! Speaking of "such films", in the 1930s - 50s, many small and often mild production companies made films that destroyed drugs and sexual threats (though often they wanted to allow a little cheesecake for an audience who would not normally have seen such a peaceful price in Hollywood movies. they are hysterically funny because they are so superfluous and the information is so inaccurate. The most famous examples are REEFER MADNESS and SEX MADNESS (both by the same double production company) as well as the delicate and foolish of these two films, this inexpensive movie seems to be Criterion Collection, it is interesting that there are some weird ones (certainly some of them) who enjoy watching movies, because they are often so bad and so terrible that they are very fun. a bad or a message that has been twisted and the film of victims is not as grotesque as some of the similar movies. wild, for the 1933 film, is pretty good - despite occasional bad action and ridiculous suicide areas. Remember children - just say "NO" to suicide! <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, the "two-year treatment" they're talking about in the movie was actually a syphilis norm back in 1933. It is much more treatable - just like the rest of the STDs.
