Sorry, maybe this part of the 911's firefighter wave, maybe it's an old-fashioned story, maybe it's not meant to suppress your socks, but I'm sorry this movie is terrible. As with the title, cliché 49, I think it has at least as many clichés. There is a horrible story about the firefighter (impressive management when there are dangerous fires and lives). And his harsh life was meaninglessly "a scene that is now modest" to the style of the past. We start the movie in a hero who is in a dangerous situation in a collapsing burning building. The whole movie tells us that we want to love such a man, so we squeeze a few tears when he meets the final of the scene at the end of the movie. It was hard for me to take care and wanted her to smoke earlier. Clichés are abundant, such as: - best friend's death, first place, love in a new job, firstborn, worrying husband with dangerous work with husband, father's parent / boss, 2.4 children (well 2 but close enough) sacrificing their lives to save others, awards for bravery .... and on. It is the life of every firefighter, every cop, sister, doctor in some way. It was lazy when it was meant for "the life that flashes in front of his eyes" when he died, God helps the poor son, I'm surprised he didn't suck more smoke to go faster. Returns are mostly everyday and predictable, worked well, and the soundtrack that could be out of Laughing Cow's business was so exciting, actually it seemed like a musician or copyright free lift stuff !!! It should be avoided at all costs if you have nothing to watch on Sunday evening with Grandma. Or maybe if your relationship with a firefighter - a warning - your life ends awful or alive when you are a brave firefighter in this movie. If your John Travolta (weird Velcro style hair in it!)
