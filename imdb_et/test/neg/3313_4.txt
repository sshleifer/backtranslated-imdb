White and different shapes, beautiful naked, random pictures. It is this little experimental short film. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to think about how such pictures could be transferred to the film in the first days of the film, but despite my love for many surreal images and movies and weird, this movie didn't do it for me. <br /> <br /> I am not sorry that I was watching it, but if it makes sense, then I'm not getting it. Visually, my humble opinion is not outstanding. As an example of Dadaism, I think it would work well, because it seems to reject logic or similarity, although I would have preferred it to be visually more interesting. <br /> <br /> But for everyone.
