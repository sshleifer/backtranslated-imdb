ATTENTION: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You can go out of the meal * Avoid all costs <br /> <br /> Adam's Story O 'Halloran) and Paul (Tom Murphy) ), two heroin addicts in the Dublin slums, and their daily ambitions in their meaningless lives, looking for the next day that makes them the day. Along the way, they agree with close family members and friends whom they have created and destroyed over the years. <br /> <br /> I know a lot of Irish people who want to drink, but it seems that some of them have heroin problems with the look of this movie. I know there is a bit of a drug problem, as in many parts of the world, so another sense of humor is not an unexpected thing. <br /> <br /> Recall the latest Irish movie I saw (the film is made of style that makes it stand out from any recent movie). . The film is quite funny in some parts, but it is probably another comedy that is not afraid to smile close. The scene where a boy with a mental disability is tracked at the back of the track is definitely true to what a few junkies could feed on, but is still completely despicable, and I'm not sure if it was meant for dark humor somehow, but it certainly didn't look like a smile on my face! It is also inconsistent with the earlier actions in which they see, showing their soft sides that praise the child up and down. In the light of this, some may find the ending sadness, others may only see it as dessert. <br /> <br /> In general, I didn't see a movie point. I didn't see any "story" of motivation he was talking about. It seems to despise it without being involved at all. Unlike Trainspotting (which dealt with similar topics!), This unsuccessful effort in most cases, when I was slipping on the edge, despite being a very short 83-minute working time. Truly, it is not more enjoyable to observe the two real worlds in one day. **
