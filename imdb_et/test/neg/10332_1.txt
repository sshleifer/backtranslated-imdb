I had a bad feeling when I saw a cheap title job. This movie took only a few scenes to confirm that this movie is a real smelly! The only pleasure I got out of it was to laugh at the technical flaws (for example - the sound of the "car sound" just disappeared during the scene with Danny and the dog dog in the car). Production shows a complete lack of imagination (for example - a slow moving machine gun fires again). Sandra Bullock is basically playing a bit of a piece that is totally unnecessary on the plot. Say that this movie is actually on the plot writing more justice than it deserves. Ancient computer hardware is kind of interesting. This movie was released in 1982 (not in 1987 when the IMDb database shows) and then the current high-tech 4.7 MHz IBM computer was amber with floppy disks. Maybe the computer was the real star of the movie ... at least it was interesting. <br /> <br /> We got a few dollars on this DVD on the WalMart discount table. As other reviewers point out, we paid too much!
