Why is it that in the 1950s and 60s, Italians made the best films, then in the 70s and 80s did nothing other than zombie and cannibal films? Probably because the arts did not make money. , Cannibal Movie, unlike the Zombie movie created by the Americans and used by Italians, is a purely Italian creation that is designed as a demonstration of the exploitation of mondo and as much money as possible (artistic integrity is not achieved) here). Eaten Alive came to Cannibal Movie during flowering. The director, Umberto Lenzi, was not yet hit; His genre classic, Cannibal Ferox, was still a year. <br /> <br /> Similarly (ripped off), the Ruggero Deodato Peninsula Cannibal Holocaust, Janet Agren, got the word police that they have received an 8mm film from their sister. She's lost in Africa and suspected that the film depicted on the film may be related to it. Mel Ferrer, like another professor, tells him that a man named Jonas (Ivan Rassimov) has started Jonestown culture in New Guinea, and that is the sister. She hires a tutor (Robert Kerman) to carry her through the jungle to find a cult and her sister. And you don't know, the jungle is full of cannibals. <br /> <br /> One sentence should be summed up: if you have seen Cannibal Movie, you have seen them all, mainly because these films steal shamelessly (Lenzi copied Cannibal Holocaust to make this movie, and restarted it Cannibal Ferox, Deodato copied this part to Hit and Run, and since they all share the same material, they all have the same feature: terrible photography, boring terrain, terrible duplication, over-acting and exploiting, exploiting, exploiting. all in this is a veteran of genres, Rassimov and Kerman have a race for eating landscapes, Agren exists only in the nude, rape or threat, and all the sick are there, cannibals who actually seem to be local cannibals, eat lunch, which is considered human muscle. In the tradition, the live animal on the screen is usually killed shortly. I'm sure there are psychopaths who find this stool fun. I know I did.
