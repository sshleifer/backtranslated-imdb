One commentator said you like this movie, like Austin Powers. I liked Autin Powers and was disappointed with this movie. The film works hard, maybe too hard to laugh. Perhaps it was that all the crooks of this film shouted as if the shouting itself was funny. I get where they tried to go with this flick. Cross between Zorro and Scarlet Pimpernel, but it just doesn't work. Austin Powers, as silly, but intelligent, Zorro Gay Blade lacks Austin Powers, Big Lebowski, or Kingpin. <br /> <br /> I was waiting to laugh and suddenly waited for someone to actually pay for the script. My 15-year-old daughter also thought the film was flat. My 17-year-old who chose this flick for the title went out in 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> It seems that many people in IMDb liked this movie, but for me it wasn't good comedy or jokes about it. .
