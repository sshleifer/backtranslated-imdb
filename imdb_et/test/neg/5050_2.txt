It is disgraceful when high-quality actors and actors participate in a clean mess, probably because they were offered a lot of money. Not one of Helen Mirren's better career. "Teenside" action is just terrible, it is not helped by the script, which is partially incorrect. <br /> <br /> Most of Kevin Williamson's works are in a higher-than-average box, but it's really down to par. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you watch on TV, if there's nothing better and you have had half a bottle of wine to drink and you expect the pizza to be delivered so you can drink the other half.
