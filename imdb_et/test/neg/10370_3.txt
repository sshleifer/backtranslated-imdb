I'm a big fan of demonic dolls. Looking at this surface, it looks pretty good! You have Decapitron, dolls and a new villain! Unfortunately, a small bank that does this project will not be able to live, live objects. She stinks! Her girlfriend is worse. If they were left out, it would probably be cool, BLADE VS. TOTEM. I'd watch it for 2 hours. Instead, the role of the dolls is played and the whole film has suffered as a result. The mystical Skull boy who has created the totem is the best, and the appearance of Decapitron has long been awaited, short and really quite disappointing. You'd better look at the first one.
