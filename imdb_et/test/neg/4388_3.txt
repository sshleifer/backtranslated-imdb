Check out all of the positive user reviews for this movie, then check if everyone is posting user comments. They post once. Companies seem to be paying for services that post spam comments on IMDb. <br /> <br /> This movie was terrible. The plot was stupid. Operation was bad. The jokes were not even funny. The film contained some nudity about what seemed like porn actors, but no other characters. <br /> <br /> In the first 15 minutes, it was clear that the film was not funny. Here and there were tiny, but most humor had to be derived from characters that spoke behind each other and spread rumors. It's not even well done. Every joke is obvious and you see it coming. <br /> <br /> The film is worth a quick rewind or better but no viewing. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to review this movie and the studio and distributor stole me for 1.5 hours.
