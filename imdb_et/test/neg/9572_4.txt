I had to reduce the rating of this movie to 4 because of the terrible soundtrack. I'm pretty sure it wasn't a problem for me or tape because some of the participants and the soundtrack sounded great. However, most of the actors' voices were distorted or abandoned, especially by non-Britons. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of cute little twists that make it a pleasant movie - getting lost in Bosnia is big - but much of the humor has lost its sound.
