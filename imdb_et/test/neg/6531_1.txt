I went out of this movie and did it only once before the Australian movie Sweetie nearly 20 years ago. After about three minutes, I felt I killed the camera man and just couldn't believe that the movie actually showed somewhere and guess what - called two independent Spirit Awards. What ???? Regardless of how realistic the dialogue is (I never use the word "guy" again!) - who wants to listen to these conversations? I'm not going to make the movies upset, but that's all I have. The only good thing I came up with was that when this film gets to Sundance and other festivals, someone can do it. Wait, this may not be good ...
