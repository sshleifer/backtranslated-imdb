I know there are some fans who like this movie. I know that the idea of ​​searching for God may seem more interesting, but it is really boring. <br /> <br /> The film is just boring. If it is a little interesting, it becomes stupid. Come on ... Kirk fights against God and wins? How low is it possible? The only good part of the movie is the campsite in the first 5 minutes, which is really big, but after that the film becomes boring, irritating, nothing more than good music. <br /> <br /> Thank God, we have Star Trek VI. (Hopp, Kirk beat him).
