Wow ... this is a movie that makes you wonder who the idea is and what the soup kitchen is eating now. To say that it was bad is an insult to the bad movies we all know and love. <br /> <br /> When I saw Guttenberg's name on a television camera, I thought it would be a fraud ... maybe it should have been. You could make a better movie. <br /> <br /> Look for a scene where they are in the middle of an airplane while the door is open and the wind is never so. They could have been pulled at least for the fan. <br /> <br /> Search for several Canadian and C list participants in the movie. This is a movie that cleans b-speed cable stations you never see, except for a rainy Sunday.
