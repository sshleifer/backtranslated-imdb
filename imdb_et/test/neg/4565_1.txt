I thought I could just get some laugh from this long-called movie, but unfortunately I was disappointed. This film is about losers who spend most of their time trying to get through the class, even trying to open a book or do something. The film also featured teachers and principals, Mary Tyler Moore (Mrs. Stark), Labor Pains, 2000, as complete idiots. I know this should be a comedy, but it never made me laugh and I thought the whole movie was FULL TIME! But all the actors gave great performances and they had a difficult task to make this movie an enjoyable and fun FILM! Only easy learning and getting good grades for college is the only way to go!
