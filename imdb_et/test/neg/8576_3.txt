This week's surprise check at the GV turned out to be a horror film by Nun (La Monja). Seriously, I think horror movies should try to find more imaginative headlines, although the story is of the character described in the title. Who knows, soon we will have spinoffs, such as Monk, the priest and others who belong to different religious sects. <br /> <br /> The main premise goes very simply that the nuns' clothing (so he can claim the title) goes around killing the ex-monastery girls. It seems to be some sort of conspiracy, because the daughter of one victim, Eva (played by Anita Briem, an eye candy), finds out with the help of a good friend like looting I know what you did last summer (also mentioned by the way). <br /> <br /> So when the body number increases, this race is time-consuming, so that our emotionally in love (isn't it always?) the heroine to discover the truth and save the day. When she got into the sins of mothers, it made the film inconceivable because it was a dream order as an introduction. I hate the sequences of dreams because it is a pretty cheap technique if it isn't done correctly, and there are a couple of them in the movie. <br /> <br /> Partly when the Ju-On movie was played occasionally, many Dark Water references and they could have looked back on Unholy Water, the film's circumstances and plot points. But there are plenty of pictures, so don't look at the story too deeply. You've been waiting for a standard textbook to be able to turn to a sadistic nun and kits that look like competing recently with the Thai fear movie Dorm. perfect for strongly emphasized english. And since most of them are pleasing to the eye, the story must tell the love scene in the middle of the witchcraft. What gives? Hi, I got hantu, I still got mood ah? Again, ghoul is a pretty inexpensive animated / SFX that has a built-in AI that opens every time and then, differently, just to get scared from a few audiences. The characters also interrupt all the unwritten rules of horror in Do-Nots, so you know and expect their desserts just. <br /> <br /> Can you enjoy this movie? Of course you can. Just make sure you look at it in full house (it should be easy because the local people are nursing something horribly awful) and laughing at those who are so nervous that they scream in every "scary" scene. It's fun and adds to the atmosphere beyond what's happening on the screen. Surround sound is not even close. Think about how you look at the Scooby Doo episode without wisecracks, and it is a pity that the cozy moments of the movie had to be censored for PG rating. These could have been the best bits that are now on the censor's floorboard.
