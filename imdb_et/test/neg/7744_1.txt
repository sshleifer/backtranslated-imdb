Kathy Ireland: Goddess's Body, Angel's Face, Smurf's Voice. <br /> <br /> And talcum-filled shovel talent. If you don't believe me, look at it: "Alien from L.A." It really depends on the whole 9/10 movie! Of course, he gets to the end with a nice red bikini head and surrounding skirt, but it's too late (so to speak) too late. <br /> <br /> It seems that Ireland is a well-known scientist's daughter who falls into the middle of the earth to find her. Along the way, he falls to a man named Charmin (yes, like a toilet paper - make your jokes) and explains how "Mad Max" lives. Did you know that the people who live deep on earth are Australian accents? Nor is it so. <br /> <br /> It was bad (it was after all MST) and also the output of Golan-Globus, but after all is said and done, Ireland just disappears as he tries to find where photographers are so he can take pictures instead. <br /> <br /> I don't blame her. <br /> <br /> One Star. And if you want to watch it, do it with the sound turned off - save the headphones.
