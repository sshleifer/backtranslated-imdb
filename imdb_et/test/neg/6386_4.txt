I went to this film, waiting for hopelessness in the style of exploiting the seventies, but what I got was more strange pseudo-west where there was too much talk and not enough action. It is clear that this film has been made from the budget; Locations are drab and badly shot while the actress leaves much to be desired as well. At the center of the plot is a trio of robbers (father and two sons) who steal gold after killing some miners. They come into contact with a salon where a young girl and her stepmother live ... and all this is told by a young girl who is currently living in a shelter. It is clear that directors Louis Leahman and William Sachs thought they were doing something really shocking; South of Hell Mountain, despite its best efforts, is surprising to the observer. The film travels for about eighty minutes and most of it is made up of eternal characters who talk about boring and long-lasting dialogue. The only good thing I say about the film is music; which are good places. The end is the only other good movie in the movie; and it's just because it's the last thing that happens. I wouldn't recommend anyone to suppress it ... in the seventies there was a much better trash.
