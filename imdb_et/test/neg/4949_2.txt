I just watched the forensic files marathon court TV. The episode was identical to the plot of the film, right up to the incest secret and the sister-sister subplot. I do not remember any True Story disclaimer, but in this case MOW is overwritten. He probably crowns Ruby Morris's actual killing by his wife, Earli, and was sentenced to 25 years of age for murder. Just going to show you, the truth may be stranger than fiction, because I thought the lifetime plot was created and more than "stretching" when credibility goes. I'm with other posters who said it was bad. I didn't notice it with all the players. It was indeed a sign, a daughter whose performance was bad.
