"In the fierce summer of 1958, the Broulyn gang, Deuces, was threatened with turmoil when Vipers, the leader of the rival gang, was released from prison. Leon (Stephen Dorff), the leader of Deuces, is trying to push Vipers out of his boys' bloody blow, but when his brother (Brad Renfro) gets into a shameful - and dangerous - relationship with Annie (Fairuza Balk), Viper's sister and her girlfriend are brutally attacked, Leon and his gang are getting into all sorts of war to save his brother, his girl and his neighborhood! " DVD sleeve description. This is certainly not a "basketball diary". <br /> <br /> Think of it as the "West Side Story" that has hit over the head of baseball bats and steel pipes, an adhesive stick that left Brooklyn with Dodgers. "Deuces Wild" are some cool Hollywood kits, 1950s car and soundtrack songs; and much of it is nicely photographed by John A. Alonzo. The story and direction never reach beyond these strengths, allowing the film to type and continue downhill during the opening hours. Casting looks good when you read the credit, but that means forgery, blood and Brylcreem aging, loosening. and one fear wig. It looks like sadness and regret over production. <br /> <br /> Deuces Wild (3.5.2005) Scott Kalvert ~ Stephen Dorff, Brad Renfro, Fairuza Balk, Frankie Muniz
