You know, I really have a problem with movie listings. I read a Maxim magazine a while ago and had a list of the 50 biggest B-films of all time and I knew I had to look through all of them and look at them all and write them all. That's why you'll see movies like Gator Bait and Barb Wire and Coffy in my list. So I noticed H.O.T.S. on the second day of the video shop and admitted it to the Maximi 50 largest B-movie list and decided to rent it and check it out. My only consolation is that I rented it because I felt it on the B movie list, so I already knew he was going to suck. <br /> <br /> Given this type of movie, I can't say that H.O.T.S. it is a complete failure because it is nothing more than an end-70s R&D movie, and it is never something else. The only place where it is widespread is its filthy sub-block, which includes a few former minuses who have placed a lot of stolen money in the building, which was called by H.O.T.S. move because there is no place in the movie in this sub-block. Despite the fact that the rest of the film is, this sub-block is completely superfluous and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The story is based on a couple of rival sororities loved by the FU, which exists among one of the universities that includes a single corporation until rejection is their own to get back to the snob. This new corporation, assisted by the seals (HOTS), is a corporation that is supposedly based on assisting seals (the seal block is another one that does not really belong to the film, and little attention is paid to the meaning of the name except that the seal runs here and there throughout the film ). <br /> <br /> It is strange, but in fact there was one scene that I had an impressive impression on. One SHOT that I had impressed would say. In the middle of the movie, there is one Pi, a rival corporation girl, pouring alcohol into a punch and pouring some glass and drinking it. Strangely enough, what he does when he drinks this alcohol reminds me of something Charlie Chaplin would do that really made the film glow. Obviously, there is nothing in this film that Chaplin would ever have had, but it only increased the result of the movie from 2 to 4. <br /> <br /> However, the movie as a whole is exactly what you think it would be, many people are running around looking for excuses to take their clothes off (I liked how the end-one-one-of-dress-for-football match every score at the end was one of GIRLS ideas. For example, at the beginning of the film, there is a scene where a couple of Pi girls are cast by H.O.T.S. a person who accidentally fell into the accusing photo (the girl who took the picture did not know that she was photographing them), although the photo never came up in the film for some reason. <br /> <br /> I've seen such movies as before, it's like Gator Bait, but without violence and rednecks and Coffy wasn't far away. Even Barb Wire is much the same, with a higher budget and more silicon. Fortunately, the Maximi 50-B movie list contains only a few comedies, because although these cheesy teen R&D movies are entertaining every time as bad movies with occasional semi-scenes, after watching H.O.T.S. I think I've decided that I like bad movies like bad comedies. I'd rather watch that many terrible actors pretend they're scared when you pretend they're funny.
