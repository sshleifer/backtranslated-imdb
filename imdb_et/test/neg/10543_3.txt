I liked the first "Toxic Avenger" but the sequel just didn't work. There are some funny gags opening up, involving the home of the blind, but I was just bored. The sequel is also full of a lot of unusual and low-eyed humor. It's not funny this time! Much of the gags are emerging over Japanese stereotypes. Almost every character in Japan seems to be cutting fish. Do all fish in Japan begin to fish? Troma movies are known as more than a little unreliable, but if you use humor that includes racial stereotypes, it makes it at least funny. I can't laugh when I get the same mess I've seen a million times before! One thing I have to give is a free event. There's still free nudity free at first. But at all, I was very disappointed and the film ended up with a tedious chasing scene with huffing and puffing, dying to turn the film black. At least there is one fun line from the movie that had me laughing. After the villain tells Shakespeare to a local resident, the citizen (elderly woman) says, "F ** k you - that's David Mamet." <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (out of 10)
