I wrote a spoiler warning, but there's not much that can be spoiled. It's like robbing a rotten meat. This movie is probably the worst I've ever seen. Not because of actors or special effects, but because of the number of factual and physical errors. First, MIGs are not MIGs at all. They are Mirages and they are French. And how does Daddy Dad's father manage his son's maneuvers to fight "MIGs" without g-suits? And why should Chappy try his plane without a g-suit? And how did Doug win the enemy ace so easily? Anyway, I didn't like this movie. And the worst part is that it has three sequences, the last one since 1995. Now it's scary.
