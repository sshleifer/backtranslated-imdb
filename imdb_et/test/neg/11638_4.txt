Made with Nana's surviving film equipment, Sur and Air de Charleston, 1927, is a film about all the parties involved and is the best way to watch it. Jean Renoir seems to have never thought enough about it to even edit the film material together. The plot is a simple reversal of racial stereotypes? In 2028, a black researcher travels to Paris, where his mother tongue teaches him Charleston (of course he assumes he is a savage whose dancing is an accusation to him before he gave himself to the seductive beat of music to a white aboriginal)). There are a lot of surreal touches, be it a pet gorilla eating flowers in Catherine Hessling's hair, angels girls' phones (including Renoir and producer Pierre Braunberger), or the fact that black speaker Johnny Huggins plays a role in the mini ring when Hessling's dance ability is almost non-existent and some interesting random attempts with slow motion, but not really enough to keep it on two rolls. The extra air of surrealism is that this silent music is absolutely no score on the new Lions Gate DVD?
