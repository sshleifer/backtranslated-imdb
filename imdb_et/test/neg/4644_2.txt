It's a truism that it takes a lot of effort to make a bad movie - it's no exception. <br /> <br /> I am not a rabbit lover, but their amazingly simplistic worldview and their ability to reduce everything to black and white (even in fictional novels) fit into the agenda with little or no connection to any complexity that irritates extreme . <br /> <br /> Wilbur Smith is descriptive of verbs, but he tells the complex stories that deserve more than what this terrifying film game has given. <br /> <br /> Sadly for those who never read Smith. They have less than a proper imagination from their Egyptian series, which has to be said to be gigantic in their exposition. <br /> <br /> Indiana Jones movies were horrible. Try to repeat it by manipulating Smith's novel into a product that is left with the country's mile. <br /> <br /> Pathetic, except Photography and Art Malik.
