Willies starts late in the evening when brother Josh (Joshua Miller) and Kyle (Jason Horst) go outside their cousin Michael (Sean Astin) who decide to pass by, telling horrible stories ... <br /> <br /> First, Michael is a story titled "Bad Apples", where a young boy named Danny Hollister (Ian Fried) has been bullied at school, but the bad new caregiver Mr. Jenkins (James Karen) decides to help him. Next is Kyle, because he talks about a strange story called "Flyboy", where an overweight bully with a worrying thrill of dead flies gets what he deserves in a twisted way ... <br /> <br /> Literature and director Brian Peck Willies didn't do much for me and I doubt it will do much for you. The script is strange about episodic anthologies, instead of the usual three or four readings, there are only two main stories at first and a couple of strange "urban myths" type mini-scenes that consist of a person who orders food at a fast food restaurant only to find his chicken dead rat, a man who dies for a heart attack, and someone who is trying to dry their trees only in the microwave to explode. I have no idea what the purpose of these scenes is, but they don't add anything to the movie because they are both weak for these two main stories. Initially, they are too long, which is a big mistake in the types of these films, usually the stories of anthologies are short, sharp and fast, and at the end there is a great twist, usually accompanied by the people they deserve. But in Willies, the last 40-minute stories are longer than the average TV episode and I have to admit that I found both stories very boring, they have been very little to them and seem to be aimed at children. The first story is better to look at as a whole, but it has no twist when I see it, while the other has a nice 'just desert' ending, but its build is weak and pulled out without good reason. I really like a horror anthology movie, so Willies is disappointing, to be honest, it will fall into the genre. <br /> <br /> Director Peck obviously worked with a small budget and as a whole. , there are lots of consistency errors and it is badly done. There is no atmosphere, no fears, no gore, special effects are bad, and there are black toilets that are not needed many times. In general, this is a rather unpleasant film to sit on. <br /> <br /> Technically, Willies's small edges are tough, the effect is far from special and it is extremely dreary and grainy. Action is bad, no one will definitely win any prizes. <br /> <br /> Willies is a bad film, it's not scary, it's not fun, it's not fun, and it only contains two remaining tracks. This is certainly not recommended.
