This movie was very bad. First they did not follow the facts. Half of the film was composed and it was a deputy whose mother was one of Ed Gein's victims. The action was terrible, except for the man who played Ed Gein, but it wasn't difficult to confuse. even though I think it was terrible, I gave him three because they started it with photos of real crimes. it was the best part of the movie. As soon as the film was introduced, the film went down. The writer of this film tried to spice it, but it wasn't supposed to be. Ed Ge's story is interesting enough without any falsification of information.
