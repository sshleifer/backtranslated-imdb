A TV announcer who introduced this late Saturday night said he should have won the Oscar. Quite a few notices about a movie that I never heard, even though I should have known something about the TV listener, I don't know. If the speaker spoke, he speaks of a failure. <br /> <br /> This is a tough, unhappy movie that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I couldn't go on with Hoskins' terrible Burr-ming rubber accent. Midland has no advantage in Midland. <br /> <br /> Unsolved yarns are abundant ... and I wouldn't usually want to think about it, but half of them don't make sense. And how, when Hoskins says he chooses Felicia outside his guesthouse, even though he didn't tell him where he was exactly? Or buying it in a funeral that has probably never happened (and where was it these days?) Clumbsy and bad thinking, when you ask me. . It's full of theoretical harrows. It's frustrating ... <br /> <br /> Disliked. I thought it was garbage. Wouldn't recommend it. 'Sufficiently said.
