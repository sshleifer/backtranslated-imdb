Open the scene pulled me to watch the movie. But no more than 5 minutes later I went out of my eyes. Not only could I understand the word that was said to have been better off by a group of people with mental disabilities. One emphasis of this film was that there was a punk-white dwarf. But I didn't quite get in touch with how the white dwarf was a child of two African Americans. But I think something is possible. Also, why in hell was Robin in the movie? I'm not sure it added anything artificially. In general, I suggest you jump out of the shore before renting a movie.
