Solomon and Sheba have fallen in Hollywood, not for the quality of the film, but for the fact that Tyrone Power died at the time it was made. I was in fifth grade and I remember the great news of the days when this tragedy happened. I didn't know who Tyrone Power was, but I learned and learned to evaluate the body of my work. <br /> <br /> I often don't know if Tail made sense in terms of this movie and what it proved. He was also an unnamed producer. Maybe he just didn't want to face the critics. The good thing Power actually went with the witness to the prosecutor's office, even though you see him with a long shot when you get close. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a biblical pea that is likely to interfere with the magnificent Solomon itself. Many of the incidents described in the Bible, treated separately by the Bible, have been knit together into a single plot, with some additions by Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The real story about Sheba's queen is that she went to a trade mission to the Kingdom of Israel, spoke a little with Salomon, and returned a lot of merchandise and that was the case. The story of romance between him and Solomon is a legend. The ancient kingdom of Sheba is where Yemen is now and its people allegedly moved to the African continent, which is the way of establishing Ethiopia. <br /> <br /> The Queen never saw Solomon's famous case of a two-woman child with separate demands, nor was she involved in building the first temple. Nor was he destroying it. Because that wasn't Solomon. <br /> <br /> And he was not involved in the inheritance dispute when Solomon's brother Adonijah made a counterclaim. It's the heart of this movie. Adonia, hearing that King David died, declares himself king. Of course David is temporarily gathering and saying that God came to him and said Solomon should follow him. When David hears of what Adonia did, he says that what became of God, Adon is greedy. After that, Adonijah is drawing out. <br /> <br /> Things seem to be in the full circle that Ty Power has fallen into a set when duo with George Sanders like Adony. Sanders and Power were competitors in many films, especially in Lloyds of London, which played a role in Power's breakthrough. If Sanders is not quite sophisticated sophistication, he was in Samson and Delilah, he is still Sanders, biblical. <br /> <br /> When Power died, Yul Brynner was brought to Solomon to play and wiggle that an existing movie with a long shot of Power can be saved. Brynner invests in dialogue with the right dignity, but I think he regretted this pinching. <br /> <br /> Gina Lollobrigida is the Queen of Sheba and is tempting as a biblical alluring Cecil in B. DeMille's tradition. He seems to have no real conviction and I think he was shocked by Power's sudden death and had to do it again. Marisa Pavan as Abishag can give the film the best result. <br /> <br /> The true story of Adonijah is not as detailed as this movie. He challenged Solomon's inheritance and, as a supporter, gathered around the group king David's place. Solomon forgave them once, and then Adonijah asked Abishagi for marriage. Abishag in the Bible and here was King David's daughter in old age. When Solomon hears it, he decides that Adonijah will be greedy again and he will kill. The Bible mentions someone called Berniah, who went mainly through the contract hits of Adonjan's supporters. <br /> <br /> The film has a remarkable climax that includes the miracles I was looking for and found. This was due to the fruitful imagination of King Vidor, who ended his long and outstanding career in sour cream. It was a question about Vidor who, from a biblical point of view, tried to make Cecil B. DeMille. He didn't do it.
