Unfortunately, I think it's one of those movies that if you or I took it to the studio and said, "Can I make this great movie with my friends from Mary, Mungo and Midge?" the studio would have died on the spot. But if you say a huge number of Hollywood names, "Look, do I like to walk with Italy with my companions? studio writes a check. <br /> <br /> We'll start with Ocean's 11 casino chiefs, watching the robbers who went off with their cash, and then Brad Pitt ransack Catherine Zeta Jones, and then there are some monkeys around Amsterdam and Italy and such and such and then everything ends somehow. <br /> <br /> The film, however, contains a more shameful moment in the career of Julia Robert and Bruce Willis, a cinematic pearl. I almost vomited in my lap and put my eyes out when Julia Roberts, playing in Tess, pretends she is (you thought) Julia Roberts! Bruce Willis is clearly thinking about when he can leave and how much control he has. <br /> <br /> Well, to be fair, I would have done it for money, so I think I can do it. In fact, you criticize poor love, but I'm not disappointed, not a Hollywood legend. I think this really irritates the movie, it's not that it is boring and pointless and it has a terrible story, but I think the actors were probably all happy! I think the actor's entire job is to push the emotions out ... I feel I would pay for the party, but I had to stand in the rain. Booo! <br /> <br /> See if you like Como, or a fancy CZJ or something, but otherwise go for a walk.
