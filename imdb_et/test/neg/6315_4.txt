This movie is based on Street Fighter Alpha (or Zero)! It will be placed in a different setting as Streetfighter! This film is related to Ryu, accompanied by Ken and Chun Li. I knew Rose, Zanghief and Birdie! No other characters were used in the video game (which I could discover)! Fighting scenes were OK, but something very remarkable! There were not many of them! For me, it's strange! Is Streetfighter not a fight! Streetfighter animation (1994) is much better than this movie. He's trying to be more than it really is! The use of "Hada Power" and other supernatural elements has nothing to do with the characters in the video game! And in that case it's bad! The story is so boring that you don't care what's going on! Activities are significantly reduced! Why? And what happened to other characters in the video game! Certainly they are more interesting than this story! The main attraction of the video game is the characters of your special skills! In this movie, everything is Ryu! That's why this anime fails!
