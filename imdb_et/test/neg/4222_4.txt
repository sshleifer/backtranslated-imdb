If you really loved GWTW, you will find it quite disappointing. Those who think it is almost a romantic story and a lunch are probably happy with this decent television production (although I find Scarlett an important mess). But let me say that given the novel, nothing good could come out of it. <br /> <br /> I have read GWTW more than 20 times and I really appreciate that Mrs Mitchell did the film. I had some time to understand how good the end is: Scarlett knew he was going to get Rhetto back because he always got what he wanted. But in the end, they could not kiss kiss. <br /> <br /> Then Alexandra Ripley had to "fix" it, showing us exactly how perfect and powerful Scarlett could be and of course describes in detail how she can get exactly Rhett even if she had an important thing with someone else ( Mrs Mitchell's mind was not certain). <br /> <br /> The story of these points is, in my opinion, just a long and boring ride ending the ends, showing costumes and scenarios to give us a clear and completely unnecessary ending. <br /> <br /> When Margaret Mitchell could live again, she died again at the moment she learned what Scarlett had become of GWTW. <br /> <br /> It is certainly not fair to compare it to the original, but it is not a GWTW error. Is not it? Is it good if I don't compare it to the original? Maybe. Sorry to say I really don't care. <br /> <br /> I look forward to some more compromises to continue with someone else's (sub) work, otherwise I won't even try.
