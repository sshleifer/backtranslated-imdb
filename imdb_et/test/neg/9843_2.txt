If he had been directed by a man, he would be imprisoned. Although Adrian Lyne was in the editorial room with a lawyer to monitor the disruption of the classical literary equipment to calm the censors, and to prevent the child pornography defense law from being shut down in 1996, the woman throws us up and everyone praises. Did I miss the meeting? In addition to severe pedophilia, this film is completely redundant. Has this woman ever walked to an active military base? Has he ever encountered a soldier? Whose army is that? Uniforms must come from Uniforms-R-Us. Just throw in some patches that care? Just make sure all of them have a big red. Here it is easy to joke that the head of the author undoubtedly went over, but maybe somebody slipped out of the military vehicles. There were certainly no military advisors. The US Army is not working on slums. Temporary base camps in jungle war zones are cleaner. The US Army does not make 14-year-old girls work in military bases, or let them use firearms or training. There are many mines in the sexual age of teenage girls. This film has nothing to do with it.
