What to say about this movie? The couple have more than each other. After some time playing, things become more serious. You have to make a difficult choice: continue the old situation or start with the whole heart. Guess what will happen at the end. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be very small. But a good story doesn't have to be expensive. It seems to be a game that has been transformed into a movie using only several cheap locations (at least very few other people) more than just on stage, in this house. From the first minute, future developments are clear as water. Nothing happens unexpectedly. Sometimes you can think of watching soft porn movies, in which case you know that there is no story. <br /> <br /> I find this film a disappointment that explains the vote (4).
