Nine out of nine people who watched it have declared that they are spiritually in love with life. No one should see this abomination. English is poorly equipped to express how this "film" is completely, terribly cruel. It is not quite worth the plastic that is made. Humanity is not committed to greater crime in the history of its creation; never worse. <br /> <br /> It was agreed that the scene of Tommy's shrunken driver and young girl's blouse was incredibly ill and twisted; in fact, many of us have not yet recovered from the experiment and are now sitting in the corner of the room that swings, sucking our thumbs and shining. <br /> <br /> The fundamental question about each lips must be "Why ???". How is it possible that everyone can create such fear and then subject them to so many innocent people? After watching the trailer, we thought this film might be ridiculous: how wrong we are. <br /> <br /> Please sign the petition to get rid of the "Shrunken Heads" world, so no other poor civilian would come into contact with it. Please, for humanity.
