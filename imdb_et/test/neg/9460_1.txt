Before I saw this movie, I believed there were two types of bad cinema. (1) Your average, totally unnecessary fare (ie "Constantine") and (2) amazingly bad work or so bad - that's good (la "Manos hands fate"). Now that I've seen "Dr Gore", I know there is a third kind of bad movie: the perfect mess of a sandwich. It is irreversibly tattooed in your memory. A work that is reasonably flexible. Anathema. <br /> <br /> I've hated some movies before, but I've never hated the movie so much that my ailment hit me and became SELF hostile! Have you seen a movie that not only detracts from losing the feeling you look at, but is putting you back for an hour? The disciples of the Mystery Science Theater are cautious, this is the cinema of sucking the soul. Go for rent instead of "Iron Iron" or "Killer Shrews".
