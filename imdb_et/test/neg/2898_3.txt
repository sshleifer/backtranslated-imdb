"Ninja III" is not as bad as the first part of "trilogy", but it is still a very bad film. Fans of martial arts are hardly wanting because there are not enough actions out there, but even scenes of action are often robbed of ridiculous excessive acts and unnecessary violence. As the film was not already weak enough, the filmmakers become part of the idiotic "Exorcist". The only redemption value is the winning presence of an actor who plays the "dominated" heroine; she is a beautiful and athletic woman who is not forgotten by the director with various weak ways - she just happens to be an aerobics teacher. I don't mind taking a bit of a soft core, but it must not be anything else.
