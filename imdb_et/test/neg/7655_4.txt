The second woman is the story of a mysterious man who lost his wife and now believes that someone wants to harm her. The girl who likes her wants to help her, but she has to believe her fears are due to mental illness ... <br /> <br /> Interesting plot, very good action, but the result as a whole is bad in many ways. The story is too simplified or rather simplified (though a few interesting plot revolutions). For example, people say they love each other after only two meetings. I don't want to publish anything else, but you see what I mean when you watch a movie. "Come on, it was fifties!", You might think. But I have seen quite a few movies of this era and I know some don't seem so dated today. <br /> <br /> Something that disturbed me was that some scenes were dark in the dark, making it almost impossible to see what was happening. Ok, this is a movie noir, but it is too noir at some point ...: o) <br /> <br /> Generally the second woman is not a masterpiece of this era, but also a trash. See if you have nothing else to do ...
