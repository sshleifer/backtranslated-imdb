I saw it with great expectations. Come on, this is Akshay Kumar, Govinda and Paresh Rawal, all of whom are amazing in their comedy, I really hoped to laugh. Unfortunately, this is not what I ever got ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, nothing in this movie made me laugh out loud. There were times when I smiled at one or two things, but nothing really laughed. In short, it was a bad comedy and in some ways a little Hera Pheri wannabe. <br /> <br /> Three of the main men think Paresh Rawal's role was the most powerful. It wasn't the biggest role, but it seemed to be more than Govinda or Akshay. Their performances were well thought. Something special, just mediocre. Although Govinda stole more than a few scenes from Akshay's limelight. Lara Dutta and Tanushree Dutta are also in this movie and both were pretty bad. Lara's role did not move me or make me laugh, and Tanushree Dutta's character just to my nerves! Music seems to be the only good thing in Bhagam Bhag. My favorite song is "Hello Bin" followed by "Afreen", which I really liked. "Signal" and the title song "Bhagam Bhag" are also worthwhile. </p> <p> </p> And judging by the lack of comedy and lack of direction, I don't think you will.
