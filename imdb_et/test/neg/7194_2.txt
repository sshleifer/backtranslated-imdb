Do you ever have one of these sermons that stand out forever? You squint and gather together and grab the closest paper product that prepares the world's biggest spray ... and then tends to. "Frankenhooker" was the cinematic equivalent of its lost sneezing. Now I'm big in B movies and I always look different when the boom mike appears on the screen or when the actor speaks with Gerald Ford's whole enthusiasm, but it really does. For example, on the cover of the video is the entire film bridge. Using parts of the murdered New York prostitutes, Dr Franken restores his dead groom so that he can act in Manhattan as a sort of super prostitute with a bad attitude. After one and a half years of building up, it seemed quite funny ten minutes of little anti-climatic.
