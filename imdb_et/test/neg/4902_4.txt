It is important to remember that when you look at Pride, the phrase "True Story Inspired" has a real meaning. It's kind of like "You could save up to 50%," which can literally translate "You can't save more than 50%." Everything sounds fine until you realize that the "up" bottom is "zero". Similarly, "true story inspired" means that someone heard the story and it made them think. The only certainty is that the actual story and what you see is not the same thing. <br /> <br /> There is a real Jim Ellis who started training the swimming team for the Philadelphia Vacation Department in the early 1970s, but I feel that real Jim Ellis shouldn't have been able to hide some of the feelings of frustration about how the film turned out. It is clear that the story of his life takes natural liberties and I just imagine him when he responds to the strange appearance of his friends who do not know why the film is so different from the man they know. <br /> <br /> At any rate, one thing he certainly boasts is that he is depicted by Terrence Howard, one of our best actors, who played next to Bernie Mac, who, despite the lack of original and vigorous story, still gives a cordial and mobile performance. The film takes place in the 1970s in Philadelphia, a time and place where racism was the norm, not an exception, and educated and professional Jim Ellis, who is also a swimmer, has difficulty finding it. a cost-effective teaching position until finally the disintegrating resort, to which it has been set up before demolition, comes down. We can definitely understand his indignation. <br /> <br /> When we first meet with Elston, a caretaker (Bernie Mac), he is a frustrated abyss sitting in his office surrounded by junk blocks that touch the ceiling and watch a daily TV on an old, dusty TV. Needless to say, if Jim appears to clean and clean the place, Elston is not very friendly with him. He knew his rec center was closed and all his anger over Jim was running smoothly. <br /> <br /> Considering the college swimmer's past, Jim takes a special interest in the pool, which he cleans and fills and brings out the shape. A group of black teenagers playing basketball just outside the city center are interested in the pool when their basketball edge is taken away and the heat is still warm, and soon the group is developing a swim team that they will swim in the district. Those who call them underdogs would, of course, have some inaccuracy. They are unorganized, unprofessional, inadequately trained and have no idea how to swim. <br /> <br /> This is, of course, not important. The film is your standard sport story, so the first athletic outing is totally irrelevant than anything other than a learning experience, a catalyst that drives your much harder and much more focused training, leading to a sporty outing. matters. By now, the only thing a sports film has done is that head designer (s) do not have to win at the top of the film, we only need to understand the meaning and importance of these efforts. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film has all the characteristics of the old Seagal films. Good guys are good guys because they just should be, and bad guys are nasty white swimmers who are laughing and robbing and racist jokes in our team. Oh, and there is one scene where one of the white boys strikes one black boy when they are in the middle of the race. I didn't know that it was really possible for anyone to hit underwater like that, but you get the idea of ​​how deep the character's development is. <br /> <br /> We understand that this is a group of children to whom Jim Ellis turned from children hanging on the streets, doing nothing in his life and in an organized and competitive swimming team, but we do not know who they are . <br /> <br /> But the biggest problem is that the only real statements made by the film are that efforts and organizations lead to success and racism is bad. Both of them are so obvious that when a movie is made with them alone, it comes to an empty and unnecessary feeling. In the 1970s, racism was so much more powerful in America that it was a huge loss that the film dealt with the issue directly, but did not talk about it. It's a kind of feeling-good movie, but when it's over and you realize how much it should have said, it's much bigger than what he said is a feeling-good feeling sad disappointment.
