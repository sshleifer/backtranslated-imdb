This film was a frustrating attempt to revive the decisive time in English history. Cromwell's growing stake in war is very small, but the overall historical accuracy of this film was far away. This film suggests that the war began with religious differences, but the civil war was in no way Catholic and Protestant: both sides were Protestants. Cromwell was never in the battle of Edgehill and never "saved the day". The queens did not win, the battle ended with a pull. In general, this film was decent. Manufacturers were trying hard on WAY and it wasn't that big. certainly could have been better.
