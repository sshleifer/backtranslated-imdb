The Realty Television Team is set to cover a small town high school hockey team running a series of killer wearing a black mask and hood. Many interviews where team members (and some locals who live in White Plains, where most of this film is) talk to each other with the camera they are experiencing in White Plains, their current situation and their life's exemplary side. The scenario is often acidic, cynical, and alkaline, and Killer Movie basically plays the sounds of real television on real television. If this plot is attractive to you, tap yourself. I found that the characters are tiring and satire is an old hat. Paul Wesley, a director who needs more pause, who has experienced more than he might be able to meet, Jake Tanner is a nice guy who comes in a very pleasant and tolerant way, keeping in mind the prima donna and immature people of his companion, who often cause only migraine. Particularly uncomfortable is his producer Lee (Cyia Batten), a tyrant who constantly grabs orders for everyone, his poisonous attitude that creates a lot of tension .. it's a manufacturer who wants to take advantage of a small town rash against a killer using the cover story of a hockey team that is Exploiting the tragedy in White Plains. Those who know Kaley Cuoco know that by now he has perfected the pampered princess, because that is the only role we usually see. Like Blanca, he is polarizing the way he demands attention, milking what he feels to be a little celebrity, making a lot of friction, because he becomes a source of frustration, and has a rather potty mouth (Cuoco could just take that part with Cuoco, all together) Cast, serves Killer Movie as an eye candy, but it's hard to find any characters you wouldn't want to see, cut the meat cutter. Jason London is a boy of sound / equipment, a real sour attitude that often tortures others who are outrageous We know a lot of personality clashes, looking at how these self-absorbing Hollywood species are poured on top of each other. The killer's identity shouldn't surprise anyone, it's quite obvious. Some small gores, but most of the violence has been captured. Leighton Meester appears as a lovely victim in the film Director / writer Jeff Fisher is getting pretty attractive but I'm not is not able to distinguish it from countless slogans that have been hidden from the horror of SCREAM over the last ten years. Although I have never liked anyone of Cuoco's characters, I have never looked at him, but in the end he has to show a role that does not consist of his preaching, unpleasant arrogance, always chasing and complaining.
