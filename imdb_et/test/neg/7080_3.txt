The biggest problem in searching for historical Jesus is that there are very few searches for it. Shick-Sunn gave these "documentaries" in the 1970s and in the 80s, where interviews with "experts" and "science" and "facts" were held to make the film's title desperate, unfortunately, "historical Jesus" is really little more than The dramatization of the third level of Christ's life. Unlike Shick-Sun's better "Noah's Gulf Search", which spends most of his working time discussing the possibility that the ark is on earth today and where possible, this film is basically the story of Jesus without any effort to prove or challenge his existence. Turrin's famous cover has been mentioned, but little other detective work is done much on the screen. <br /> <br /> For fans of quad-documentaries such as "Jupiter Menace" and "In Bigfoot" etc. , this movie doesn't offer much.
