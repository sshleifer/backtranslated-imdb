Although the writing was terrible, the actor was terrifying, the only thing that saved this "turtle" was the chest, but it wasn't enough to look at me again. Everyone said and did that I actually watch this movie. For Troma, this new low. Lloyd Kaufman, who started a movie carrying a garbage bag and made fairy tales, should have understood what I did. It was by far the worst thing a Troma team ever put out. The best place to show this movie is for the disabled, feeling that they can't change the channel. In conclusion, this is not a quick desire to watch this movie just for the breasts.
