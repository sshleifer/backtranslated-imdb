Anyone who thinks that School Moe Dee, Carol Alt, and Corey Feldman are made up of a list of good actors, has to smoke something that I would sometimes try. Where to start: funny sound, hammy action, "action" locations. It is a typical amateur-written hack-feed that has been washed out and has never been love to celebrate. I was embarrassed by the "stars" of this "movie". The only shortcoming that this upper part was missing was Gary Coleman, who would have been in the film, would have done it at least somewhat bad, not just bad. <br /> <br /> There was a part in the movie where Carol Alt shouted, "Do you think I'm IDIOT?!?" Yes, Carol, I, your agent is doing, and PLEASE LOVE everyone who is decent and holy ... GO AWAY and stop yourself so humiliating! This movie is something that Anna Nicole Smith attended. <br /> <br /> I would tell you what the plot was, but it would be another sentence for this article, plus my mind repeatedly repeatedly in the movie anyway, so I hardly paid attention.
