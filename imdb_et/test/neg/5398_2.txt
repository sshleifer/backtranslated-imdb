It may include *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Where to start with this particular empty wasteland? Well, it would have been nice if they actually had a plot. Talent, decent dialogue, intercourse, humor, hey even free sex would have helped this flick. Unfortunately, there were only a lot of gore (even that it wasn't done), automatic weapons, and no. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to add the basic situation, the native American curse to protect the tribal bodies he was murdered, and that was followed by a federal special team dressed in clothing (?). In most cases, one of the horror films in the attack was one of the basic rules that are separated from the group, so you can take it one after the other. You think this team would be more aware, especially since they are actually the third team to be sent to investigate, the other two teams disappear. When they finally realize they are picked out, they make one of several stands and shoot their weapons only to shoot the trees. The picture scene repeats indefinitely in this movie to save money. <br /> <br /> If they don't let the trees follow, they will watch the spirit who doesn't leave a trace (who knows how they follow it) and many macho BSs. By the way, did I mention that most of this team are women? Interesting to listen to them talk tough. Not very entertaining, but interesting. <br /> <br /> All in all, the best movies are in the Kmartis box.
