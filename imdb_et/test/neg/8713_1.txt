Very, very, very slow moving, purposeful film about unhappy, drifting young man. Not sure who was more lost - flat characters or audiences, almost half of whom went out. <br /> <br /> The attitude of music and black and smart camera angles is disappointed - it became even more ridiculous - when the actor was bad and the plot and lines were almost non-existent. Very little music or something to talk about. The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo tries to find a song that runs through his head. She goes to the used disc store to buy her lover, and she has to sing for the two sellers before finding the album. The lovely scene made a promise, but it went down there. The rest of the film lacks art, charm, meaning ... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty. Unfortunately, two hours.
