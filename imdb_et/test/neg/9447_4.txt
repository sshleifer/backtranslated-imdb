The lives of Megan (Jackie Kresler) and Dylan (Shane Elliott) are changing between Nevada and Reno and Las Vegas. They stop to eat a small greasy spoon where the caf√© owner (Jonathan Breck) blesses the notorious area 51. After returning to Lincoln forty years old, the radio receives little mad broadcasting at Hitler's speech at the 1836 Olympics, and later the 1958 Elvis Presley newsletter is prepared for the military. The car is slowly disintegrating and two are scaring their lives when a mysterious unexplained thing occurs in a secluded desert with lonely radiation; remnants of nuclear tests. Megan meets a lost girl (Channing Nichols) and a wounded WWII soldier. The night-trip does not end there. Kresler is impressive and writer / director James Lay uses Patsy Cline's songs well. All in all, moderately interesting is Sci-Fi.
