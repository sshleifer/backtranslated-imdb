I was really disappointed with the film I had great hopes. It seemed that it had rushed to make use of the success of the screwdriver comedies at that time (including MGM's own "Libeled Lady" with two of the same stars) and the success of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Three years after they were tied, they were still attractive in their sightings and fires, but the weak scenario and the urgent prerequisite are destroying all the possibilities that this year's "Libeled Lady" and two "Thin Man" films they did before. "Double Wedding" talks about the life of a sister (Myrna Loy), who is going to dominate her sister's (Florence rice), future brother (John Beal) and her own servants (including Sidney). Toler and Mary Gordon). When an independent witty William Powell comes to his life, who has interrupted Loy's constant control of Rice and Beale, Loy meets his game. Right now it sounds good, right? Yes, the interesting assumption is short, sad to say, because Loy's character is so one-dimensional that it is hard, as he said, that Powell falls in love with what we know soon. This is another attempt to put a woman with a career in mind, changing her views on her life, and what life she has led. When Loy says he doesn't have time to run his own business or to be a man in his life, he is a lover. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Powell is free to entertain Jessie Ralph. The sister's rich older woman, who helped Loy start her business, is familiar with Powell and immediately sees Loy's glamor that she's excited about her. Rice and Beal are a boring couple and all Powell's premise between them is pointless. Then Powell's ex-husband, which is not really necessary at the late stage of the story, and the last wedding (where the crowd tries to get into Powell's small trailer) is a weak attempt to bring some farce. (It's funny, however, that Powell's items marked by Loy have hit Edgar Kennedy, who is very welcome because there are so few others.) Powell and Loy would do better with the two later comedies, "I Love You Again and "Love Crazy", which is experienced, witty and fun, this movie is trying to be all three, but it gets into a complicated hole.
