This movie was so bad and so cheap and so funny, I found this movie as one of the most boring slowest films of the early 80s I've ever seen. I like most 80 cheap horror movies, but I never rent it. It just didn't make sense. In a family living in the woods, their son, wife, and daughter are invited to spend time with them during their holidays, and for some reason the mother and the girl do not go well during the film. We will never be able to figure out why until almost the end of the movie, but until then, the mother has some sort of ESP and the girl has nightmares and a backlash about what happens to the unfortunate victims of this "thing" that we have no idea about it What it looks like, everything we see is a bright light that signals its approach and everything we hear is Darth Vadar's voices and various horror movies. Then when we finally find out what and who it was, I made a laugh. This "killer" turns out to be an alien Japanese soldier who has apparently come back to claim his mother and his family. And all the mother is standing there in front of the living room, shaking her hands with fire or something like she goes into some cramps. This movie is pathetic! Avoid this, it's not even worth renting.
