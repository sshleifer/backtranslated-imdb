I read some gorestic, bloodiest movies that Asia had to offer in Stuff Magazine and I immediately jumped to Netflix to quench thirst. The boy I made the mistake. This movie is one of the worst films I've seen. First of all, there is no plot I expected as a plot (see: "Revenge") that has become a series of events that have just taken place to spend their special effects budget of $ 14.89 and studio time. They should have kept their money and did not waste their time or time. <br /> <br /> When a big plot twist occurs, Tetsuo II: Body Hammer will be given a new identity and I didn't buy it. Feedback has been given that should answer our questions, but it seemed to me that I switched Showtime 3:47 am and dropped to ACID. The film continues and spirals are out of control with chewing graphics and special (Olympic) effects. <br /> <br /> Can I see this bitter after the movie? Yes, yes. Did I see Iron Man? Was there a plot? Was it so symbolic that I didn't understand? NO. Was there a Body Hammer there? Beats Hellist about me. So take my advice and leave it !!!!!! <br /> <br /> (I have to admit that I have so much fun writing it and laughing at this movie that if you want to laugh, look at it!)
