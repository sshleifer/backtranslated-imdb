I love absolutely comedy. I love to hear the rumors that stand on stage because they have the different life experiences they have had with their peers, or the things they have thought or seen that they just thought they were so **** stupid that they had it with someone share. <br /> <br /> There were previously stand-ups who took the person anyone could associate with (Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or was just so fucking crazy that you couldn't laugh at them because they smiled at others (Richard Pryor). And then thought-provoking comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a creature, were the smartest man in the room who called on people to think about the things they saw when they were around, and understand how screwed things were and how easily they changed things. <br /> <br /> It may not now be related to the idea of ​​Mencia, which, as I agree with most commentators here, is comedy. A central terrible solution to the disappearance of the "Chappelle Exhibition", but that's it. Carlos Mencia spends half of his show on his audience with stand-up bits, sometimes on popular topics, mostly only for racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above types of status. He is the director, the annual Mexican named Carlos, who, despite his stereotypes, is your ordinary man. He then tries to laugh at others, the people he calls racist, or just those who disagree with his opinion. Finally, she presents sketches to the audience and viewer of the studio, telling them that it helps them see their perspective. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia always says that he shows that people do not see, but what he actually does is not only the promotion of racist stereotypes that already exist and killed him, but he encourages people to hear them stupidly and do what helps them keep them: laugh. /> <br /> Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, but the easiest way to laugh. The best comedians who are afraid that Carlos Mencia feels he is a good company need not use them. They speak universally and ask you to laugh at the absurdity of AT, not as Mencia encourages. Because he creates more skepticism or "real life" situations that require the use of racism or other people to use it, he tells us not to ask us to laugh, and in fact, these absurds are rather true than just its extremes. <br /> <br /> His show is the minds of offensive people. Mencia does not give us comedy and does not ask us to digest it and take what we want (something I hate to compare, "Chappelle's show" was of the highest quality), she tells us exactly how we should look at it and respond to it --- which, according to her, is to make a stupid face and say "Dee Dee Dee!" This exhibition is appropriately mentioned. This is indeed an exhibition of "Mencia". It is Mencia's mind, through and through, and as such it is nothing more than stupid entertainment. The exhibition is tailored specifically to give your main audience, 14-24 years old, the lessons of life, how stereotypes are bad, but this racial bashing is right for Carlos Mencia and it should be right for you!
