Uncle Fred I Ray gives us a bit of "Retromedia" goodness with this soft core Cinemax, which is not classic. <br /> <br /> A couple of unknown walnuts look at the stones when they come in a "black hole" by "intelligent bucks" in a rotating vortex. Soon, an attractive cave girl will come into the age of one million years and put her future. Soon his second half will have a future for his future and will strike the way to future beds. <br /> <br /> Ray will again give you a satisfying (but barely) smut-festival with terrible action but some decent skin. Yes it is hardly titillating but heh! If worse worsens, it will improve insomnia. <br /> <br /> S10 reviews: 1/5 or 3/10
