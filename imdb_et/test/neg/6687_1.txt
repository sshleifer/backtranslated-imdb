Seriously, I didn't find anything that would represent the rational thinking of this film. For some reason, the writer decided to have a bunch of participants in random places, bullying, screaming and shouting like a Cro-Magnoni biped. I understand that it was related to gymnastics, but seriously, what are all roaring and beating people? I also saw at least five participants with overactive terret syndrome and Phase 10 syphilis. human speech patterns. This is indeed a milestone in the history of making a movie because there was no conscious decision to make a character more than just Urrrrr! or Rfff! sound. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable.
