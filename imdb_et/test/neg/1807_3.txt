The Heart of Darkness Film Review Is a book known for its vocabulary and complex concepts ever good enough to depict the deep meaning of the book? So far, this goal has not been achieved. An attempt was made to make the heart work of darkness in 1993, but it was unsuccessful compared to the book. <br /> <br /> It's hard enough to make a movie from any book. It is always a concern that it is not so descriptive or the same meaning. Why is the novel, The Heart of Darkness, made for film, I'm helpless. There are so many descriptions and hidden meanings throughout the book. Just reading the words just, I think the person thinks it's pretty boring and doesn't get the symbolism. I think it happened in the movie; the movie just created a story on the surface. <br /> <br /> The movie didn't even follow the full line of the book, major changes were made that I thought the film was getting worse. For example, the driver did not go with the boat to Marlow and the rest of the crew, the spy did instead. I think it took out some of the bigger plots and took out a big manager's fraud with Kurtz. Even Kurtz wasn't even dead on the steamboat, which made the whole journey even more meaningless, which after a while became annoying. And when Marlow spoke to Kurtz's groom about his last moments and words, it was not where it was almost as descriptive or important that the bride couldn't even irritate her. the participants did a very good job, except for the actress who played Mfumu. In my opinion, Kurtz was not very bad and it was an important thing in the book. Also, the other characters, such as Marlow, the leader and the fianc√© did not make the book they deserve from the book. Their action was not very exciting or memorable at all. All in all, I don't think this book should even have been tried to make a movie. I think it's good to use some of the topics on a different story line such as Apocalypse Now. But with the same exact story in the same book, it's just a shame.
