What's more, Bronson's talent is mostly wasted on the 1984 shock value that (uncut) is much more annoying than most of what is still out. The fact that "bad men do" is very disturbing (in their verbal and visual torture image) is not a problem. This is a shameful charge in which it is presented. Interestingly, this film symbolizes the last part of Bronson's career, where he has tortured many of his fans with the same exceptionally predictable and hopeless plots. One hopes that this good actor will rise again.
