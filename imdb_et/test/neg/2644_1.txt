This movie was terrible. If it had never been done, the world would be a better place. Come on, a flying wagon? What did they mean? It was a terrible hook sub-par movie, and I would like to apologize to this studio with some cookies to help me pay back for the time I wasted the fucking festival I can never get back. If you pay for watching this movie, I really regret it because I watched it on television on Sunday afternoon when I had nothing better to do and it pretty much destroyed the whole week. Flying freaking WAGON?!?! And this should compensate for the terrifying mother who cares more about her own twisted needs than her children? It is no wonder that they do not have a good idea to tell someone they beat them, their mother teaches them something, but what she wants is everything else. Absolutely terrible.
