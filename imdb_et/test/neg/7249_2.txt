I bought this movie at Blockbuster for $ 3.00 because it sounded interesting (a little bit of Ranma-esque, the idea that someone slips around the skeleton) because she was wearing a little girl, and because there was a limited sticker. I thought it was a sweet or at least sincere story of age with a strange indie edge. I was 100% wrong. <br /> <br /> Having watched this, I have to think about how it got a limited sticker, because there is hardly any mistake, the closest to violence and nudity (Honestly! doesn't usually go around, hoping for it!) when The girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties in this movie a lot, no matter what, she wears some kind of mini bag). Even anti-religious humor is taming (and flat, caricature, insecure, derived, unoriginal, and the worst not funny - it would be better to just listen to Ray Stevens' 'Will Jesus carry Rolex's own TV show'), that would hardly qualify for PG-13 ( is not rated), but Blockbuster refuses to let under 17-year-olds rent it - as it would be pornographic. Every little boy could go there and rent it to an edited Dream, but they demand Zack and Reba are worse. <br /> < br /> It is, but not so. <br /> <br /> In some ways, it is worrying - the only thing that can offend people is the beginning of the idea of ​​suicide. If someone has to watch the movies honestly depicted suicide (not that, but better) like both the Suicides of the Virgin, this is a teenage. If both films were rated R only because of the suicide aspect, I have little chance of the story I have written on PG-13 (the main characters are eleven and one and a half and twelve). p is one of the three leading causes of death in teenagers (I think it's number 2), so most teenagers are likely to be affected or affected by it. <br /> <br /> Just tell this movie, but. 2/10.
