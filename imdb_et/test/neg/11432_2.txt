The filmmakers went well to find ONLY the following demographic elements: Palestinians with peace-loving, good-will-solving goodwill, Palestinians (especially older women and families with children), who are particularly uncomfortable fences and Israelis who do not believe in the security fence great support for its alleged impact on the Palestinians and considers it to be unnecessarily divisible and / or waste money. Oh yes, they put a member of the Israeli government who supports this fence, but do what they can to portray him as inhuman and insecure and ask him some very leading questions that are really statements (eg "The wall is bad for the environment." it destroys everything "). <br /> <br /> I have no problem if the movie (well, most) shows it. But much I disagree with those they interview, their opinions are sufficiently documentary. HOW: There are at least two sides to the Israeli security fence, and despite the fact that the vast majority of Israelis (and many others) support the construction of the fence and believe that it has a positive overall effect, this "documentary" does not even present any such person. even go so far as to interview an Israeli Jew who claims "all Israelis support the fence" and are therefore crazy and then stubbornly refuse to interview even one such "crazy" Israel. Oh, and in order to turn it all off, they set film tone, interviewing a couple of young Israeli children (really exceptions to the rule - I have been there) that laugh at their Arab neighbors all over the fence. <br /> <br /> "Documentary" is a film that explores the problem and presents a whole host of facts Unfortunately, this is not a documentary. It is incompatible with PROPAGANDA FILM, which offers very clear, extremely strong support for just one stroke. on one side of the religion, emotionally and politically charged. It's no longer a documentary when, say, Fahrenheit 9/11.
