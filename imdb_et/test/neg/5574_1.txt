this movie is so bad. but it is so bad that I smiled my ass. for people who love movies, don't look at it. for people who like movies good and bad, I recommend it. The story slips, the script is terrible, acting is terrible mediocre. the whole movie soundtrack was funny but I loved it. cool quotes were plus tho. ha ha. "if it gets bleeding, it can die". Fighting scenes broke me up. it seemed to them that they spent more time on these parts than any other fight scene was mostly pretty clean. I almost feel this film could have been good if it wasn't f / x .... it would still not be a crapshoot. the eye was horny. and how the chick to eat the men of the kitchen, they could do something to actually eat something or at least put more fake on his face. and the lighthouse explosion deceived me. I thought they would have got a real fire, not a crappy computer. and the end was so predictable that surprised me when they actually did what I did. so in general. id say it's classic as far as crappy movies go. this is my bottom 5.
