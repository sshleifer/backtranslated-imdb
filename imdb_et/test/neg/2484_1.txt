Here we go to another pop star that breaks the grand TV land and my observations of the directors of my pop career saying that your big gwen may be a real star, maybe a few days when you're in the A-list movies, they would do something to expand the show, there's no one there just a pretty face, but they also have the ability to act almost overnight. gwen has some ways to act by looking at actors such as James dean or Clint east, please give the world real people who have to sit behind this box and try to act on pop stars. Please gwen to stick your pretty pop videos to your jap posse and not offend the British in his efforts as an actor. anyway i'll go back to my working class and think to myself god, i could do it. but yes, keep in mind that i work until i am 65 when i live so long and yes, put your feet up with your royalties every three months, bad marry money xxx
