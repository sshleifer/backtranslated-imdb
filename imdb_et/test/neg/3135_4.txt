First of all, I would like to admit that Chokher Bali was not my cup. This film was apparently not aimed at the masses. This is the type that critics would look at. The jump and disclosure were quite misleading. <br /> <br /> I was expecting something very dramatic like Devdas. Realizing that this story and time period required it, I found the film very slowly. The role of Chokher Bali demanded an actor who could portray himself as subversive, not innocent and naive. All others gave good results. The representation of Tagore's human condition has come into contact with celluloid to give the film an interesting subject.
