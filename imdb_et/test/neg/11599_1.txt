First good things: I agree with another viewer who said that Gene Raymond has a wonderful drunk. He does - I was tickled to finally laugh. And there were other moments that I found amusing - Raymond's parents in the bathroom with a defective plumbing and scene in a restaurant where Robert Montgomery tried to make Carole Lombard jealous if he otherwise liked the sweetheart. But generally I was outraged. I love Carol Lombard and most of Hitchcock. And I understand the constraints that Hays put on production. But it was an embarrassing and terrible look. Of course I knew they would come together, it's a romantic comedy. But it didn't make sense, it happened too fast. Plus I can't believe in the professions of love when they face both physical and confrontational behavior.
