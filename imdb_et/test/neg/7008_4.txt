It is amazing to see this movie female: you have Linda Blair (matures nicely), Julie Strain (who doesn't get too many things to say - it's a good thing), Rochelle Swanson (as convincing as a sweet innocent girl or as a bad girl), Toni Napoli and the most beautiful IMO, just stunning Kristina Ducati (how buggy man, Larry Poindexter, who is sexually related to these women, remains a mystery). But besides looking at these beautiful and in some cases talented women there is little to offer. The plot is subtracted and doesn't really go to the last 15 minutes or so; and when Wynorsk finally manages to create some tension, it is a ridiculous "twist" and destroys everything. (* 1/2)
