... a good script or director could not fix it. <br /> <br /> The original "Poseidon Adventure" was a story of people's courage that triumphs horrible opportunities and personal tragedy. Survivors were led by a charismatic figure of great spiritual strength, who took something that God threw at him. <br /> <br /> Follow-up efforts will try to re-create the mix, but will not be able to carry out scripts and pedestrians. Irwin Allen could have been a major producer of catastrophes and did a fine job of leading the "Strong Inferno", but he just can't bring his symbols to the depths of the person. If the characters are not reliable, there is also a risk that they will come into contact. <br /> <br /> The script also tries to copy the original too obviously. So we have Peter Boyle who is doing Ernest Borgnine's thing, being harsh and unpleasant (but he has a gentle heart); Karl Malden is a red button that moderates the effect (and is struggling for a good action for the sick); Slim Pickens makes a comic for Shelley Winters and so on. <br /> <br /> To make the story more up-to-date, we have a rogue gun shop ready to ride with the highest level of plutonium-level weaponry. Really disgusting work that abandons mercilessly wounded men (actors who play their own hands, probably paid as extras because they don't seem to have any traits) and has a woman behind - what a frame! Thanks to goodness, the French rescue services made Poseidon's body hole twice as big as in 1972 (and the other side of the propeller shaft) to get it. And when we are on this topic, how did they get boxes * until ... oh, they forgot about it. <br /> <br /> I actually paid good money to see it when it was released. Given the current image of the film, it may seem strange, but in fact it was a rather confusing picture at that time. Some said it was junk, some said it was as exciting as the original. Remember, nobody can be right all the time.
