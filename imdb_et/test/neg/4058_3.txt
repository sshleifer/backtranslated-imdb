"Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is a very bad exercise for one year to keep up. The first film was cute, cozy and charming. The idea that a dog is playing in a basketball team is quite far removed, but he pulled out enough stunts to save the concepts. Even the story of man explained it. Joshi's father was killed in plane control, so he's sad. And the audience gets emotionally involved. <br /> <br /> Now, it's a bad thing. It's terrible. This is the worst bad sequel, one that makes good ideas and makes them bad. The type that changes the basic piece in one way, this time K-9, plays football instead of basketball. How much time it takes to remember how much time is spent, undoubtedly, walk with an open attitude towards such a film, there is no positive thinking when it comes to making the right bad film. br /> <br /> Kevin Zegers stands for Josh, who is in eight classes. She lives with her mother and her little sister in the outskirts of Seattle. The first film involved the human story that he lost his father in an airplane accident that the audience might associate with, most people know what it is like to close a loved one. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the emotional plot is a bit more complicated. Joshi's mother has met again. He and Buddy, his dog who can play basketball, don't like it at all. Why? If I was in his shoes, I'd be happy to have a older one, especially one in my life. The man's name is Patrick Sullivan and Josie's mother Jackie met him to be a local veterinarian for Buddy. <br /> <br /> The animal's story is too simple. Josh is influenced by his best friend to try the school football team, Timber Wolves. The team itself looks like something from America's most funny video that can even hit the ball or collide with each other. So when Bud appears one day, he proves that he can play as a receiver and is undoubtedly the best player in the team. <br /> <br /> A friend is very cute in his football costume. Oh, he has enough heart to melt. The dog is also the best in this film. It is too bad that he did not do enough tricks to point out that no one is asking any questions about a dog playing a school football team. <br /> <br /> Plot about Russian circus workers who love stealing animals. But their dark thoughts are dominated by animals, and ultimately it is for those who look like "at home alone". <br /> <br /> "Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver" is much more nervous than the first one. . Russian robbers add a lot of flies that I have to admit to laugh at, because of this stupidity. There are too many sequences that describe the nature of the screw ball and the scenes that are too few, which are the real reasons why people see this movie - to watch dogs' football. <br /> <br /> The performances were also quite embarrassing. I liked the reports by Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo, but the overall grade would be D +. Kevin Zegers and Cynthia Stevenson were absolutely pathetic. <br /> <br /> A few football announcers were near some fun moments, but it's not even worth noting. Do kids enjoy this movie? Maybe, but even they grow tired when the heart felt that discussions were getting too long and deep. They certainly complain that the dog did not have enough time on the screen, and complain about the fast changing script and protesting against boring performances and claiming that this film is a trash compared to origami al Air Air, as I did. <br /> <br /> I think they think the dog is divine.
