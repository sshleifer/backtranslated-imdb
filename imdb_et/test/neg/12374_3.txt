Before we start, do I hope you have already eaten it by reading. Why? Because after I first saw this movie, the bird's appearance and sound made me eat chicken after the words "End" appeared on the screen. So don't say you're not warned. <br /> <br /> Fred Sears could lead the "Earth vs. Flying Saucers" (okay movie and one of the biggest examples of Tim Burton's "Martian attacks"), but "The Giant Claw" is not such a giant film. Yes, it is a prehistoric monster flying in the air, attacking planes and cities and sometimes treating itself with a parachute man. Beast is a giant, except in scenes where it is much smaller, but who needs consistent proportions in the film? Scary? It could have been, but not when the plot is hopelessly silly and the monster looks like a doll that ran away from Sesame Street.
