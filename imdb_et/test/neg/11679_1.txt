This film is said to be about three young idealistic people, two of whom join the Naxal movement and the blah blaaga. This is really just one film about some of the beautiful and rich people who are trying to decide who they should put on next time; peasants and naxals and the political struggles of the era are just a picturesque background. In the literal sense of the word, if we do not hear the villagers, never say that someone knows nothing, so they have the same role as "parents" in old Hollywood films. The film is also dull, and the story doesn't get us anywhere - except in the various bedrooms. Apparently, we should admire its artistry, which simply means no good song and dance routine that would not have naturally recorded the film, but could at least ease the boredom. <br /> <br /> My friend Japna was annoyed by the immorality of the whole story, not from the bedroom, but from the meaninglessness of the whole story. The message seems to be that there is no need to continue the ideals.
