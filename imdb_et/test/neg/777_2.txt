I was very disappointed with the quality of this documentary. Content is poorly produced, very poor quality video and especially terrible sound. There is very little about Bruce Haack's music and almost no examples of direct links with later and modern electronic music. Interviews with people who knew Bruce Haack is ad-hoc mainly inarticulate mumbo-jumbo. Too many yak and not enough Haack. Although I have a serious personal interest in electronic music and I have more than average attention, even on a slow and / or complex subject, I fell asleep while watching this documentary and I had to look at it to see what parts I slept on. When you look at it, make sure you set Alex as Clockwork Orange before viewing. Bruce Haack deserves this much better. Shame on the manufacturer and the director.
