It looks like an exciting outlook, the modern dress "Othello" with Christopher Eccleston, who was so terrifyingly good at "Shallow Grave" and (especially) "Jude" and Eamonn Walker, who brought their intensity and introspection to their central role in "Oz." You might think that both are natural Shakespeare, but both performers fail: Walker Othello is a pretty cookie cutter that brings a piece that doesn't have much effect; and Eccleston worships it awfully like Iago, worshiping the camera for an almost attacking parody. He was probably involved by his leader, whose floral approach could have worked better with Elizabeth's language, but who seems to be a painful, hypocritical choice for a modernized scenario. And the scenario itself is less disappointing than it is, if it is obvious? it is like Andrew Davies sketched out a famous plot and just wrote any dialogue that first jumped with his head. All in all, there is a failure. 4 out of 10.
