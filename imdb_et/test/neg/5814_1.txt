I found that this pearl was located in a local video store shop on tapes exchanged between different rental outlets. "The man who shifted from Everest". Hmm ... never heard of it. The box reads some Japanese companion who always wanted to ski at Everest and actually did it. Sounds interesting. I rented it. As expected, it was a documentary style. The first part can be summarized as follows: "I always wanted to ski under Mount Everest." This is followed by some event preparation materials. Lots of preparatory material. OK, I think it takes a lot of preparation. Then the mind is treated for a long time, from the life of Yuichiro Miura's philosophy, and so on. An additional filler follows and I start thinking about where skiing is right for this show. More preparations are being made and they will travel to the mountain. More philosophy is shown. Eventually, they reach the mountain and maybe he will be able to ski. Lots of climbing materials are later described as a parachute device designed to slow down Miura's speed on a steep slope. Finally, he straps the skis and is ready to go. <br /> <br /> She's down ... She's skiing about twenty feet and her skis are shooting down her, she shoots her parachute and smashed into a frightening bundle a few miles down the hill and that's it. End of story. What the hell was that? <br /> <br /> OK, I can buy that he always wanted Everest to ski, made extensive preparations and tried it with the camera team. It didn't work and he got down and almost killed himself, so what egregious hubri did he inspire to release this movie and invite him to ski in Everest? Maybe the title, "The man who fell down from under his feet and slipped down under Everest" was too long for the tape box.
