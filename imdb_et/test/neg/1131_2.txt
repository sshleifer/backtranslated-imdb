This is really a blue Christmas when you are for this family. I loved the original film, and it wasn't for the future. In fact, it is not all its goals and objectives. Only one character from the original return. True, this character happened to be a fun cousin of Eddie, but he's just not fun when the movie's protagonist. His niche is the one of the crazy relative who performs like Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase was necessary in this film to be successful, and he was certainly not there. As far as my mind is concerned, the movie "Vacation" is not a movie, if not good "Clark Griswold is in the wheel.
