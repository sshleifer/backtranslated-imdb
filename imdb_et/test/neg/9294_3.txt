A very sensitive subject - a 15-year-old girl who was abandoned as a mother and who goes to visit her, remains ignored, raped by her mother's boyfriend, gets pregnant. There was not enough depth in this situation. Too much time is spent on a truck with trucks. (Interestingly, this baby with asthma - you never see him cry - except once - is fed, the diapers have changed throughout the truck's failure.) I would have liked to see more mutual relationships, more attention that this girl was juvenile - it should have been upright in court. <br /> <br /> And that was a real story! It deserves a better say than it is! <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for this topic, I'd be closer to 0. I rented it from the library. Only later did I know that it was made for a TV movie. <br /> <br /> Well
