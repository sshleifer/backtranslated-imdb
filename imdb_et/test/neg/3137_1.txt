Critics are strange people. Some of them are ordinary people like you and me. Some of them are not. If the critic says Subconscius's cruelty is beautiful, then do not know where they grew up? What is beautiful when you shoot out some cloud or old tree if you can't do it with style and bring it to the environment. Karim Hussain certainly can't. I have seen children make better material than Karim succeeds in the Subconscius cruelty. But this is not the worst part. The worst part is the whole recording, I refuse to call it a movie, it's just a bad excuse to portray nudity and extreme torture, rape of both sexes, masturbation, sperm, peeing, cannibalism, child murder and more. I love gore / splatter and I love horror. It's not either of them. It's a complete mess, and if my comments are only made between one person, Subconscius will leave cruelty that's worth it. Keep in mind that your life will not last forever, do not waste two hours of precious time in Subconscius cruelty. You have been warned.
