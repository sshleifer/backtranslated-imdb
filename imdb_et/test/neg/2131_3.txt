I wish I could say something more positive about Devil Fish, but I do not seem to be honest about it coming out. I can't even come to many of those "bad, good" moments. Damn Fish is just old bad. The plot is completely derived (jaws, anyone?), Actress is wood, characters are uninteresting, special effects are bad and the result is annoying. Add the seemingly inert direction of Lamberto Bava and you have one stinky direction. However, I think the biggest sin of the film is the lack of budget. It doesn't seem that Baval had a lot of work. By 1984, the Italian film industry had fallen completely? especially for genre films. The funding available to Bava was probably very weak. Movies like Devil Fish, based on special effects, never had the chance to be good. This is not the only Italian film that carries this destiny. In the mid-1980s, a number of Italian films have been made, the ideas and concepts of which far exceeded what one could expect realistically because of their budget constraints. However, having said all this and seeing a lot of weaknesses in the movie, I can't get a rating of Devil Fish below 3/10. I've even rated it higher, but I can't, because I understand how bad this film is. Why don't I rate it lower? Well, it's hard to explain. Despite the many problems found in the movie, Devil Fish has something I enjoy inexplicably. It may be as simple as my love for a low budget, chewing, Italian film. Maybe my taste in movies is terribly inclined, but I enjoy what I enjoy. <br /> <br /> The Mystery Theater 3000 Devil Fish treatment is actually very enjoyable. I appreciate Devil Fish 4/5 on its MST3K rating scale. The boys are doing a good job for the many mistakes in the movie. One very clever observation comes very early in the commentary when Tom Servo says, "Just because you can change does not mean you should"? emphasizing another of the many weaknesses that took place at Devil Fish.
