This review includes a spoiler. I had no expectations about this movie. I pulled it out of the video store with "White Noise". <br /> <br /> First, the credit for this stupid movie runs about 5 minutes. Acceleration from start to finish is slooooow. The main heroes don't like to wear a bra and the director seems to be happy when Anna Paquin steps down the stairs. If you like bobie movies, this factor has a low level. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is nice that the movie hangs from the elements of Lovecraft and other horror genres, but in better movies, there is at least some rational or consistent irrational behavior. This stinker tries to create some sense of modernity and reality, but then you have situations where no one calls the police, even though they have discovered the treasure that has potentially accusing forensic evidence, and the rituals of other worlds are well-described rituals like Buffy in the comprehensive book. I had been waiting for Miles to appear and give some advice on how to kill a certain demon type and so. <br /> <br /> The premise is that it is possible to open the age of darkness where the creatures that slip on the ceilings can cut your throat or affect the meat machine. Ho hum. To do this, you must have a circle of victims and then have seven children who must have the throat that loves them. It opens the world to the age of darkness. At least that's what he speaks exactly in the book of ancient occult rituals. What raises the annoying question of how, who wrote the book, and if this happens, would you leave this information in the book that you can take out of the library? from the book in a world that is not already covered in the darkness, the age brought by the ransomers who would have been able to do so much earlier, using "occultism to the core of the world for darkness, 2nd edition"? It turns out that the story of the father is the seventh child, the one who ran the ritual 40 years ago; he released his father, who is a doctor / grandfather in the film, who wanted to try the ritual with the other foolish parents who just wanted to see if I was like opening the world to darkness. Grandfather let his father go because he "doesn't love him". Aduh. A stupid stupid movie written by a moral director who seems to think he is a Eurofilm Auteur. The film also includes a scene where the child sees the face with big carts and the mother grabs her and has a complete lack. The whole movie is like that. People who really see strange sh * t and don't react in any way in the usual way. There must be a bad plot and direction. Anna Paquin does her best to play her character realistically without breaking the smile, and she sees a chatter on the strap, but at several critical moments, her sign doesn't bother to make a call. You know, the same, "I'll probably walk into demonic evil situations without any defense or help from others who carry a torch or fire, even though I know the near future." And even if it may seem, even with the age of darkness, those creatures that make you bloody will not be attacked if you have a light source, but they will appear as people you know and tell you to turn off the light source . Reminds me of "Alone In The Dark" video game; maybe this movie is hanging on the concept of this game. <br /> <br /> The best actors in the movie are the young boy and Anna. They both die at the end. The whole family will die. The creatures of darkness are leading them to death, but in fact the foolishness of the family is the main cause of death. Other adults could be interchangeable with all other Red Shoes Diaries with fine cinema actors. <br /> <br /> So, to film, the worst things in this movie are the foolishness of the dark character, apparently an abnormal situation, really a nonsense plot (the story is an old architect who shapes the altar sacrificed in the house - the architect has suspected from the beginning, would be at the house hidden victims but don't tell anyone because well, there's no real reason they didn't find the kids, but he didn't bother to tell the authorities about HIDDEN ROOMS he had planned for the house, but he doesn't want the house for 40 years hang because he is worried about what's going on inside ... derrrrh ... duuuuh), using frightening mechanisms (more children who stand in the dark or appear only on photos and blood on the wallpaper) and egoism under the direction of the director when you see him in DVD functions , which describes his nonsense as a new and original move, you understand where the real horror of this movie is. <br /> <br /> Is it fun? At 2x speed on a DVD player with subtitles turned on, it can be fun until you finish and realize that the movie is crap, otherwise it can go on. Kinematic equivalent of fatty tremor; empty calories are terrible. <br /> <br /> The film has the feeling that the director must have seen the "Ring" and wanted to try to create something similar in the mood, which in this respect the film is unlucky and so, also in this regard, Jaume Balaguer√≥, is my opinion that you suck what you do.
