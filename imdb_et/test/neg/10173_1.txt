As you can read, the only good comment on this movie is someone watching this movie in his church! Anyway, the film had a good B-film sci-fi start, everything was to make a good entertaining, easy-to-watch movie, then it all seemed in this religious mode of Jesus' will-to-save-all-brainwashing <br /> <br /> story begins with two the main character, 2 journalists, but it quickly gives the first role to the Jesus freak who is to save everyone's soul with the attitude of that successor. <br /> <br /> A few words: This movie goes from entertainment to brainwashing in about 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Waste of time, waste of money ... AVOID IT
