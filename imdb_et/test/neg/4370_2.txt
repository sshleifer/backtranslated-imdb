One day I thought to myself ... what is the worst possible thing that could happen today? I replied to my simple "Oh, it has already happened. I rented Killjoy / Killjoy 2" on a DVD. Well, what's there to say? The budget was not big enough to rent police uniforms, the film removes sex scenes and death scenes. There is one funny line I remember, and acting is much worse than the first one. There seems to be no light on the "set" (somewhere in the woods), and Killjoy (known as Leprechaun's Exorcistina) is a lesser remarkable killer clown. This time he is not represented by Angel Vargas and has completely turned into a mad irritating clown different from the character of a mad irritating clown that says "LAPS" is a lot. Somewhere between Freddy Krueger and the grass blade is this Killjoy version. Somewhere in the pile of dirt and pile of Killjoy. It's bad is underestimated. This movie does not have any redemption features, except for the story that is over credit at the end ... which offers some enjoyment. Killjoy 2 is not really a movie, so an intense effort. Killjoy 1 is at least good enough to be the worst film I've ever seen. MINOR SPOILER ######### Let me describe one supernatural kill scene. The girl is locked in wood, which is kind of (maybe next door?), When Killjoy goes through the hole. He has some small smelly teeth (like the ones you can buy from Spencer's gifts) and he does something with them (maybe they're up?). Then he keeps them in hand and tells a terrible line (which can't be written to IMDB). Out of the teeth collected from this scene (not shown by the movie), the teeth went out and killed the girl in a somewhat interesting but unshowe way, and then returned to Killjoy. If I had these teeth, I would have run. Drive far away from Killjoy so he never gets into my hands. Killjoy 2 is hopefully the last Killjoy we have to endure. Even if the film fan, which others would say, is very bad, I think this "film" could combine human risk and create world peace if it was allowed to destroy this film and something that reminds us of it. I'll give it 2/10 - just because the creators managed to make the pictures.
