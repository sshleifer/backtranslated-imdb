This is an amazingly bad action movie. I would say that its primary mistake is that it is the FUTURE. Arghh! Funky wardrobes, retro stylish design and decent cinematography cannot prevent this flick snoozer. The second (big) mistake of Mod Squad is the lack of character - this is underlined by the lack of talent of the participants. I tend to like Claire Dane's work, so I was quite surprised by her non-existent performance in this film. Giovanni Ribisi is frightening: how could his cotton foot, worship style, fit with the ACTION flick? As for Omar Epps, he has to take some exhibitions to learn how to emulate. The man had the same facial expression for the whole movie! My suggestion is to save a few dollars and wait to see this turkey on the cable.
