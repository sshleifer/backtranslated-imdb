"Destroy All Planets" that are living at the end of the movie "Destroy All Tokyo" when a space-like giant squid falls into the reptile furnace known as Gamera. In fact, Gamera saves the earth by tapping Varian Space Ship # 1 even before the first film roll. The scene turns into a Japanese scout camp, where we meet a couple of meaningless young heroes, Jim and Masha, who are taking part in the release of Gamera after the aliens have been kidnapped and banged on the shield of electrified bubbles on their ship. <br /> <br /> It is quite amazing to see that boys persuade a scientist to let them work on a newly invented submarine that may be faulty. Earlier, the boys genius Masao was in the opposite direction to control the wiring, but Dr Dobie didn't think about the possibility of checking it. At least it prepared the boys to intervene in the alien space ship's control devices by playing a switch with a triangle with a cluster. <br /> <br /> When the boss alien in Vira says, "Activate the videotron," hang the videos from earlier Gamera movies where he fights with Barugon and Gyaos. They take quite a bit of screen time but do not meet the fast forward button if you want to move on. For a long time, Vira has turned to an invisible team and when they finally appeared, they were oriental, who could fly - imagine it! <br /> <br /> Seeing how these films are made for juvenile audiences, it's surprising to see how tough some scenes are. It is necessary to recall Gamera's bleeding and how the members of the space group are paired. When squid tentacles emerged from the main bodies, I made 'foreigners' films; connecting individual units to giant Viras was a clean device. <br /> <br /> I think the appeal to young children may be related to the identification of two young heroes who interact with a giant monster, move freely on an alien space ship and get whatever they want by using alien telepathy technology. Seeing how the movie was supposed to be done by adults could have been just a wish.
