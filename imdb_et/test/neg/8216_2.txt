Okay, don't make a mistake - it's a pretty terrible movie, but I thought it was a couple of scary scenes and won their miserable budget every now and then. At least this is inadvertently funny spots and has a firm atmosphere and discomfort (the burning scene of the face, the part that is hidden in the bride). <br /> <br /> This child falls into the "bad entertainment" category and I would just give it a star. The effects are terrible, the actress is exhausting and the whole thing looks like it was shot daily. You have to love this toy ship at the beginning! It brought back the childhood memories of seeing it late on television. While the Alpha DVD edition seems weak and as if it were recorded directly from old TV or something, I liked that in that case!
