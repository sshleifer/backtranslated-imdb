Hypothetical situations, one-time director Harry Ralston gives us the ultimate apocalyptic glimpse of the dead world that has remained on the streets, in shops, and in the entire landscape, without forgetting the desert. A lonely survivor trying to revive his peace of mind will take food from the city in his wilderness in this bungalow. He only hopes for more, but is he left with no white underwear and passion for a local Indian tribe? until the camera is discovered, which opens new doors and interrupts the barriers to coexistence. Alan, the man of the book, remains on Earth after an unknown catastrophe. Thinking he's alone, will he live his life? Until Jeri Ryan appears (as if she were in a dream) out of the forest, unpleasant and unhappy to find the last person to live ... well ... like Alan. In any case, they try to co-exist, fail, drunk and before the final dystopia they get to Redneck Raphael (played by newcomer Dan Montgomery Jr). Bonds are torn, confusion arises, the couple turns into a third wheel and a battle between physically unsuccessful nerd and brainless jock. Even if no one remained on the planet, it becomes true that even the darkest human nature is created. <br /> <br /> Using the changing film technique, Ralston gives us a mediocre story based on a loose second film, The Quiet Earth (which I look next), which he never gives. With the borrowed story, I think he does a decent job of reinterpreting it. His punch seems to be inadequate at first, while Ralston tries to find his step by borrowing again from other director techniques to try to find his own. He opens the film interestingly, but is unable to answer the direct answers. Of course, the last few days have arrived, but could there be a short answer to "how" or better "why" these few few lived. The start of a spookier would have led us to a stronger comic film. The deviation would have been like the "Shawn of the Dead" but left us as we look at the "television" program. Listening to an audio commentary, I respect Ralston because he worked hard to make this film and his passion almost sells the film, but with his surrender he could say that he was not so happy with his overall final product. There were mistakes, what he noted, and others that he was ashamed of. Although it does make a decent independent film, it sometimes feels cheap and it was the last for Ralston. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that David Arnott's idea of ​​Alan made me. He played this frenzy, school play, and the role of adults very well. He was funny to watch and listen, and he became compassionate to the viewer. He was a key player in keeping the movie together, unfortunately I can't say the same about the rest. It was Dan Montgomery's first film, and it was obvious? I'm thinking ?? really obvious. There were scenes where I thought the smart card had come out and read the lines, perhaps even giving us a more realistic result, but unfortunately it wasn't. Then was Jeri Ryan. He pulled his character at the end of the film, which for me was the culmination of the whole work of art. Finally, he goes to the stranger of the strangers bitter bitter mad girlfriend. Confused? He again fell into his character, giving us just a glimpse of what he might have done when he acted. Even if the commentary progressed, everything he helped, laugh, strangle, or "ohh, look at this color". Although her beauty can sell tickets, she may want to have the same beauty. It was his first film, so I can be too harsh? <br /> <br /> In general, this movie seemed to be missing. Although the idea was strong? the premise is that even with the peppering of people left on the ground, human nature is still there. Brainstorms or bombs can't kill jealousy (maybe because zinc consumes it) and we want to always want what we can't do during the race. Ralston is not a surprising director, his techniques are faulty and pre-used, but he knows how to make a small budget comedy. I think our idea "funny" is different, so I couldn't laugh at the many busts he found "hysterical". His actors gave the film a level of action that was lower than average. His film was loose, which means that the elements were never quite explained or solved (i.e., something that had survived the wings?!?), Which generally damaged the film's intensity. It was a comedy, but it could have been much darker and much more fun. For those who think that Roger Avery was a great element of this movie, as we learn from our comments, was everything he was there for money? it was essentially a bank "Last Man". Don't get your hopes for any classic Avery moment. <br /> <br /> Don't expect more from Ralston? and so I finish it. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** Off *****
