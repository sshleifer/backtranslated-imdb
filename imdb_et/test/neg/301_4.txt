*** Possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I've read a little about Dahmer and saw a new Dahmer movie (with the same name) before. This movie focuses quite a bit on victims and killings, too little for Dahmer. In the movie "Dahmer" there was the opposite problem, his crimes were too small and too much of himself. <br /> <br /> I did not find my dissatisfaction, it was also a certain amateur. , especially probation officer. It also seemed that Dahmer's behavior worsened every time he played a probation officer against an actor. But I may be mistaken for it. <br /> <br /> What bothered me a little was that some scenes were quite distracting, but the filmmakers seemed to try to show "the real deal" about what he did. It's ok - but what I don't understand is that the man who ran away from his apartment when Dahmer was getting beer was not naked, because that was how it happened. This is not a big deal, but it just eats the quality of the film that such details have been omitted. Dahmer's sexual obsession with the deceased did not show whether or not he was really hinted. Again, I do not mind that they did not show it, but at least they could have mentioned it or built it with the film somehow. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think a really good Dahmer movie is still a movie that includes not only Dahmer's crimes but also who he was, and why he did what he did. I think 1.5 or 2 hours is not enough to understand this complexity. This film was just a cut-off (apology) of Dahmer's life and personality and does not give you any "close good" understanding of his life or personality. <br /> <br /> 4/10
