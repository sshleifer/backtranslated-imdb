Poor movies are graveyards of stars of aging martial arts. In such films, they are fighting to preserve this dangerous behavior, which made their early work successful, but they all end in failure. Seagal is too old for such a role, but he won't let go ... no matter how stupid he sees. Some hope that his current work will somehow bring back magic, but there is no magic. At the end of the 80s and early 90s, Steven Seagal and his work made me a fan. I saw that she would fit nicely into the Sopranos nest, where her overweight body, jowly functions and sullen attitude could have found a home. I don't know what the return to the movies is for? As he produces them, I expect $ $ $ to be more than satisfactory. If this is an agreement, the badly done Seagal action will be subordinated to the movies well in the late 60s and 70s .....
