Plunkett and MaCleane are two road riders who rob the rich to give ... rich; relatively they are wealthy. But we know they are good guys because the power of justice and order, sir, is just so evil. She rapes women - or tries. He's fighting his humiliation. He's murdering. He has bad breath. She's not pregnant properly. He has no sense of fashion. She tortures puppies. This latter is just my conclusion: we don't really see Him in torture puppies. But I'm sure he will. The short-lived grass is much related to the pursuit of Plunket and MaCleane. It's just something he does in his spare time, a kind of hobby he takes to make sure we don't like him. He hasn't had to try so hard. No one in this movie is pleasant. <br /> <br /> Let's see. Celebrating Characters? There is none: I believe we have covered it. Swashbuckling? Not swash. Instead, we have a kind of gloomy breathing. Dash? Sparkle? Vigor? I'm afraid that everyone was skipping. Realism? None of this is. I think they tried realism because everyone was so dirty, but the characters and actions were all Errol Flynn's - without nonsense to back them up. Beauty? No. Fine camera works? Maybe for the television team. Humor? If you are in a benevolent mood, you can strangle twice or twice. Then again you may not. Dialogue? See "humor" above. Music? Don't even let me start playing music. Ladyhawk's music was rather uncomfortable; and at least the erroneous aesthetics of this score was consistent. <br /> <br /> Ugh. I apologize to Ladyhawk for even thinking about it in this context. <br /> <br /> All in all, here's a lot of positive mischief and nothing if you don't read Liv Tyler, which I'm talking about in two respects. "Not very good," says the review. It would be much more interesting if I could somehow make DEFEND smallpox, claim that the boxers' critics have got it all wrong - but I don't know how to do it.
