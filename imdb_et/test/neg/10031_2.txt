All the criticisms of this movie are quite valid! It's quite boring and full of all kinds of pointless ridiculous things. Couple exchanging "good grub" over notes. The dining environment when the phone rings until someone finally reaches, sits down and responds quite calmly. Quadruple or more when people look at things. Single banjo-tuning and playing, break for beer. Talking about joking jokes, with a bigger mouth, trying to learn to eat their children, with many big mouth expressions (which are necessary for a weak punchline). Sharing cucumbers and cream cheese sandwiches on oat flakes that become uncomfortable when talking about fire-burned people. Many seemingly equipped footage of wild animals, birds, insects and spiders. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a forest fire, then at least a few decades later some people in these same forests are killed by an ax. The killer he stole was obviously not too happy and killing other people with other possible weapons or bare hands. <br /> <br /> If it is true that the movie is available, the printed video tape will be cut, maybe if there is a lot of pictures that are cut, it deserves another look on the DVD. Otherwise, it will not be very interesting and will probably test the patience of even the heaviest outdoor fan.
