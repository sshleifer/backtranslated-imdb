Medical student Paula Henning won a seat at the exclusive Heidelberg Medical School. When the young man's body with which he trains on the train rises to his dissection table, he begins to investigate the secrets of his death and discovers the terrible conspiracy of an anti-hypocratic mystery society at school. Disturbing and big scary parts. She even has a good script and end. But it has one poor part. What else to see from this movie? It's a good mystery and a horror movie. But of course, if you like it, go buy. If you don't, there's still no reason to waste your money. <br /> <br /> R rated for extreme graphical violence, sexual situations, and misery.
