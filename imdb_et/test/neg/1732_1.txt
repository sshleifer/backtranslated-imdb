It was funny because the whole thing was so unrealistic, I mean, come, just like a pop star just pops up in public high school and will fall in love with a girl who's obsessed with her? Come on, people! <br /> <br /> Everyone except the leading girl was absolutely terrible. The dialogue was funny, the assumption was stupid and the work of the camera was bad. I felt like I was watching a poorly made home video. <br /> <br /> I feel like I would have wasted almost two hours of my life that I never get back. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say except that I face myself several times when I watch this movie again.
