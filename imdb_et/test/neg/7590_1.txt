It must be the worst film I've ever seen. Is the part where they got their daughter off? with a poltergeist with an excess rib? just pushes it with the stupidity over the edge. I looked at it at the exhibition, so it still had a soft core of cheese. I have to say that it made me laugh at my ass. The 80's 3D effects were very inappropriate. Comes with invisible cat and spinning. Wow I don't know if the people who did it feel alive. An actor who plays a woman is familiar but sucks in any case. His shouting could be used as a torture tool for more than retired Nazis. Anyway, thank you for the huge horror movies. I always enjoy the time I looked at the greatest time and money I've ever seen.
