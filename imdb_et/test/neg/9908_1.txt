I hate the lofty attitude of filmmakers and online artists, who are capturing this nonsense to the public, because they think that the audience is so stupid, so unwanted, so tasteless that they deserve such disadvantages. There is an intrinsic entertainment that catastrophe films see and the magic of today's CGI effects give artists powerful tools to explore what was banned before. With this temptation we sat down to look at some chaos and destruction. Well, guess what was the only one we saw was in the next Wednesday's episode. What's up! But wait, there was even bigger. The script itself was a bigger disaster! And then all those involved in turkey were in the direction and stroke. But did we know it before?! We knew that the impact alone is not entertainment, but the network that made this television movie doesn't care about it because their mantras are an eternal line of "never underestimate how stupid the audience is." These men really have to live by this motto, and I'm so fed up. Not surprisingly, the audience has given up draves of US drama and pulled their camp into reality. at least in these programs, nobody tries to do it like anything else: intellectual pornography. Category 6 is worse because it assumes that it is different and "original". Yes, it was an emergency movie, but disasters aren't the ones they're advertising!
