The adaptation of the Heart of Darknes movie is disappointing as a representation of both the film and the classical story of Joseph Conrad. <br /> <br /> There are several small differences between a book and a movie, but this is expected to be a transition to a movie in every book. Kurtz dies in another place; the chairman is not with Marlow on his trip; Kurtz's lover spends much more time with her than the story. The real problem is the amount of film material placed on the film, but it is not the real story. For some reason, the director finds the need to "spice" a scene by adding drama or activities that are rarely of any meaning and that are not always important to the story. Some of the examples that come to mind are Kurtz's "mistress" who beat Marlow over his head and knocked it out. Nothing happens when he is unconscious and Marlow does not even provoke the attack. A few hours will pass and he will wake up: a waste of time. Kurtz has a pet monkey who, for some occasional reason, kills a whim. Similarly, when Marlow leaves Kurtz station, he makes a "noble" decision to leave behind all the priceless ivory he had received without any real reason. Another mistake is Kurtz's character. John Malkovich is a terrible choice to play a man described as high and inspiring: a man with a leading presence. He whispers almost all of his lines, which could have been very provocative for more capable actors. I can't remove John Malkovich's image of a farm with mental disability in Of Mice and men when I look at his role as Kurtz. I would appreciate the 10 out of 10 stars in the movie. This is a good movie when you read the book and want to see it in the form of a movie, maybe helping you to see the scenes visually, but I would never like to do it as a source of entertainment.
