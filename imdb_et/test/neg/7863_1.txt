This movie is so bad that it is really funny. One of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. The funny thing was that the trailer had scenes that were not in the movie. Just looking at the trailer, I would have saved a lot of my time. It really showed everything that happened in the movie except the conclusion and it was so obvious. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think about the reason for making this movie. It's just so bad. Terrible. <br /> <br /> If possible, I'd give it to 0 out of 10. There is nothing else to say about this movie.
