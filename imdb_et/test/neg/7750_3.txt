Even in her glasses that carry the geek mode, Kathy Ireland is very easy for her eyes, but her action is not easy to see. Most of the participants in the film take it from above (outside "fun fun") or act somewhat embarrassingly there. Impacts and soundtrack are not a special and rather low budget. The plot line really stretches their ability to stop disbelief. Try to laugh if it is a premium movie channel or network on Saturday afternoon, but DO NOT waist it. <br /> <br /> One valuable note of the trivia is that one of the underground mobiles plays Deep Roy. Deep is now famous for playing Oompa Loompade at Burton's "Charlie and Chocolate Factory".
