I did very little about this film's expectations. I went with my girlfriend and two friends and none of them was able to explain the story of Grudge 1. Well, if the first one didn't impress them to explain the plot, I doubted it would be better. <br /> <br /> Let me summarize what the trailers tell you: The Asian lady is back and so is Sarah Michelle Gellar. Fortunately, he is not very long. This decision may have saved his career. <br /> <br /> The film has three stories and none of them makes sense. And worse, none of them have been developed. You almost begin to understand, and then someone dies and the story stops. Okay, killing people can be scary, but I was confused about the plot development attempt when I was scared. They will jump between all three stories that are not related ... OR IS THEM?!?! * SOUND EFFECTTT * ~~~ The timing of the three readings has been redesigned, and at the beginning it can be said that there is twisting at the end of the film. BE PREPAREDDD. Wait. Sorry, this is not a fighting club or a vertigo quality twist you can see that it is miles away. And probably a lot better twisting with your head ... they should have hired me. Instead of appearing with "SURPRISING", maybe it could have been Michael Jackson? This part of Scary Movie 4 frightened me. <br /> <br /> Slaughter sequences were awful. Unlike the horror movies of the past, where the killer jumps out, for example, in a closet or behind a door, and everything in the theater pops up (and then a greasy boy who wants to drop his neck) - it didn't have scary pop ups. They grew up where a casual Asian woman or child appeared, and you knew exactly what was coming. Instead of making the music really loud, then silent, you would piss off, music gave you a timing for a scary scene. If I know it's coming, don't frighten me. <br /> <br /> The film started with an explanation of what Grudge is; when a person is killed during a rage, the church is placed in the place where he was killed. Why does her mother's damn Asian lady have any significance for this story? And why have you been scared now? This movie was absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> All of this was forcing my friends to go to me - we should have seen one of these animated Pixar films. It would have been worse.
