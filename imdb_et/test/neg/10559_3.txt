"Shade" is trying to be another "Sting" by replacing poker for horse racing as a means to humiliate the enemy, but it is not unhappy. <br /> <br /> I was looking at the whole thing and still wondering why the young boy wanted to double his partner. Was it because his partner stole his girlfriend? Is there a woman in the world who deserves so much trouble? If it did, it certainly wasn't. He had no redeeming qualities, and in fact he had a special room that allowed the surgeon to remove the kid who tried to take him to the bar? Dina Merrill makes a short look for a wealthy woman who organizes a paid poker party from all things at her palace home. Then players say things like, "I see your thousands and raise you five more." Leave me alone. You can't call ("look") and raise, you do one or the other. All the children who play on the kitchen of nickel and dimes know this. you think adult men who bet on this high - or at least scriptwriter - would know that too. <br /> <br /> One of the other posters mentioned the lack of a high-limit poker game to allow players to deal with their cards and agree. You do not allow two of the most well-known car fraud games where you buy $ 250,000 and then let them deal with each other. It's not poker; It's just to see which one is better. And I would like to know which person, in the right sense, would buy a game where the two best known cardholders play and expect to have a chance to win? And most importantly, what did the Mafia boss lead such a game? Every time Melanie Griffith came on, I was so encouraged by these giant fluorescent red lips that I completely lost that story and saw her and Stallone together as a public service announcement about plastic surgery that went wrong as a love affair. Stallone mentions that he was before he bought the restaurant he is running now, but we don't know what he was, and we never see him with Stallone on their younger days, so we'll wonder if we care about it so much. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is the best character in the whole movie, but he can kill him, and we'll leave the cardboard out, all sounding like they read their rows off the TV, just out of the camera. <br /> <br /> The end does not make sense either. The boy gets his game cut and just walks down a street full of money, and his partner is nowhere to be seen? Mafia doesn't look at every move he does? All others just shrug and accept quietly without losing millions of dollars without trying to get it back? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie for professional poker players around the world is very unfair, assuming that the only way to win is "rubbing and playing" juiced "blankets. And why are they always kings and aces? Sometimes it is necessary Three or nine are needed to fill a straight or full house. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the whole movie are tricks at the start and end credits, everything is ridiculous.
