It was bad enough. I really hope there is no sequel. Maybe it's part of the plot to let you know it's open to opportunity, but no, it's not really. <br /> <br /> It's not really special about this movie. Well, the special effect was pretty good, but nothing could be written at home. <br /> <br /> There were some hot babes, especially Elina Madison and Alexandra Ford, but nothing was seen by people. PG-13, certainly not R. It also says that slaher aspects were less than remarkable. The scoop head was the only thing that was unusual. <br /> <br /> Tame scares the ticket price.
