It was actually a pretty boring movie. I think the problem with the French horror film is that French must be easy to scare or something, because this movie was not just scary. Mom effects with the mummy ghost saw that they didn't even belong to the film, as if they would spice them after the production process, because the actors barely respond to them. <br /> <br /> The plot has a curve that is the opposite of true storytelling. I think it was based on the French TV series, where they had to distill it for two hours. <br /> <br /> The plot is that the animal has a mummy that is probably so weak in security that this girl and her boyfriend can break it many times. (So ​​how people steal Mona Lisa!) The 1960s movie boy and policeman are gathering together and trying to defeat the demon. <br /> <br /> So I'm not sure if it was a bad guy or not. He kills two guards during the film, but he just wants to follow life.
