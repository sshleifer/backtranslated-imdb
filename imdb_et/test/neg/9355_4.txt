Go to any movie fan and ask them that Robert Wise's film title, another feature of Yakima Canutt and Sergio Leone, was designed by Ken Adam and won by Max Steiner, starring Sir Stanley Baker, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Brigitte Bardot. filmed in 1955 with Cinecitta's color, scope and stereo, with thousands of extras - and they tell you to go away and not be silly. <br /> <br /> Tell you that such a movie is NOT SUBMITTED. That the names you have quoted have never worked together - they were not even simultaneous. And you've just picked up the names of the movie and are trying to get them. <br /> <br /> At what point can you redirect them to IMDb and show them Helen and Helen Troy. "They're surprised! Janette Scott and the good old Harry Andrews. <br /> <br /> And that is definitely weird. After the war, 1,000 Italian extras cost about $ 25 a day, and the toa dramas were the main Italian cinema. Orgy scenes were shot twice - one with cups, the other one (you might think of a version of UK and America) .I believe that even La Sophia is one extra in it. <br /> <br /> In both cases, the names STAGGER are in mind, but it's really just a coincidence these names came to the end of their career (Canutt, Steiner) or started (all others). <br /> <br /> Only Robert Wise and Niall MacGinn were in the middle of their careers. and learned their trade - Adam had to find the descending ring of sets ra (the trademark he started using in all early bonds) - Baker was still celebrating and helping to produce "Zulu" and "Robbery" - and to pass on the Welsh TV company Harlech - then die tragically young. <br /> <br /> While Harry Andrews continues as one of Britain's favorite players - Janette Scott (daughter of Thora Rekl) never really takes a great deal of time, but who can forget her on the "Day of Truffles" (though she was added a little later - cushioning and happy ending) )) or "Crack In The World"? <br /> <br /> Sir Cedric was a theater but knew how to put a film on it - and Bardot ... was BARDOT for gawdsake! But what were these stars in this camp in the old mess? Don't ask me. The two main stars were not the names of the Italians - Helen had a mustache and Paris was pretty real - the British were just for the support. great fluke. Stereo. Frankly, if I hadn't seen it - I wouldn't believe it!
