Seven pioneering children will independently catch many miles from Indian territory and harsh weather to reach Oregon. <br /> <br /> Historically, young men who traveled independently through distant areas - such as "Childrens Education" - were manipulated and used when abused and sold into slavery, but these children are quite tough and they are trying to best to dominate your goal to make a farm west. From time to time, the film is a bit too syrup, but "The Waltons" and "Prairie" for small house fans are OK. <br /> <br /> Dean Smith delivers excellent results as Kit Carson.
