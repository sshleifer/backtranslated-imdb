The only reason to see this movie is Sung Hi Lee, a Korean stunning model / actor who plays "Muka Laka Miki" (give me a break) in this otherwise filthy movie. <br /> <br /> He has a fairly important role in this movie and seems to be doing well, though none of these parts are really interesting or well written. Even for a national lambon movie, it's really stupid. Stupid humor is one thing, but just stupid is another. Maybe I laughed once and it was probably polite to me. <br /> <br /> Warning: Watching this movie can be bad for your health twice: 1) It's like a miracle. 2) Sung Hi Lee is so astonishingly proud when he first looks out for his brain. <br /> <br /> So don't say I didn't warn you ...
