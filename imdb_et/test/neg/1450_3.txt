Pros: Mary Boland is happily on the edge as always (I never pull my upper crust, especially "Women" and "Pride and Prejudice"). TUALETT. The short role of the fields is fun, although the famous pool table scene is a bit welcome, as it seems to continue for ten minutes. The periodic features of the film are great. Also, Alison Skipworth's mysteriously loved hotel mourns; I would like to see her more (she reminds me of Marie Dressler, another person who deserves praise). Cons: Gracie Allen. An irritating, uneven presence, the upheaval of which was in front of Adam Sandler's rise. This almost falsetto nasalness, equipped with an accent of unknown origin, changes in its first scene. This is the first of the Burns-Allen films I've seen, and while I (like a big classic comedy buff) try to experience at least one movie with every major comedy star, it's definitely one team I won't be getting. His timing and interpretation of the material are completely off. Maddeningly mediocre talent. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: OK comedy, but the distances are short and far. Only an hour can be expected to not be a Class A Hollywood comedy. Recommended only for Boland and Fields fans who want to see all their work.
