Some people say this exhibition was good in the early years! I do not agree with all em. The exhibition is just stupid and pathetic. My mother hates it, I hate it, my father hates, I don't know my sister, but oh well. Here are some reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1. KNOWLEDGE: Children who are used as grown-up style are stupid. Babies are just early and annoying. Adults and adults are stupid and unpleasant. The worst character is that Angelica Pickles (she really does it for your ear drums if you had a long, hard and unhappy day in the office) and later Kimi Finster; she is too optimistic and pain in the back. She can't decide where she is French or Japanese: it's not important to know; you are an American citizen and you know it! Oh, what I'm talking about, all the signs of this show suck! <br /> <br /> 2. STORIES: The stories are unoriginal and stupid. Do as children go with a great adventure, yes in the backyard. In one episode, Leader created Tommy Pickles, a small butterfly, in the TV control room, and literally almost destroyed it. Do not give children any idea of ​​breaking down the normal T.V station control rooms (they will pay them a lot of money). I can imagine what broadcasters need to know, as this episode is being stimulated, they are likely to be afraid of their machines all day long that the child is braking. Sad! <br /> <br /> 3. Over RATED !: The show has been dragging for years and people are creating more stories and new series and spin-offs. Get out! Simpsons have been almost as much time as this, but they are much better and more fun than kids. The exhibition is just overrated! People with common sense! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was surprised by T.V stations around the world so they'd like to air this series today. The exhibition is completely junk and should never have been produced. The two movies of this movie were the same! 2/10
