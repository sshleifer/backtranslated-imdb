If I knew what I was doing, I would have escaped from the theater. The film is terrible, literally. Despite outstanding images, intriguing places and themes that might have been exciting, the film is dead. <br /> <br /> I didn't know this time in Greek history, and I'm ready to experience a big movie. The hands of the filmmakers are difficult. it is not enough if the train goes; we have to look at it far, we have to look at the car, we have to look at the smoke, we have to see it slow down and we have to see it. The director's approach is didactic. Likewise, he never produces created characters, they do not change. They are so stereotypical that we don't know if they are meant for Everyman? Everygirl? Is it a daily artist? Are there some points in this allegory? This is the most terrible movie I've seen for a long time.
