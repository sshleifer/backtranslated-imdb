How can such a bad film be made with such actors? Were they forced there? The plot has nothing to do with how things would change when the comedian ran for the president. They don't even try to impress. Just when you thought you were watching the famous Liberal commentary on DC politics (the first five minutes), the film runs on the road and in the B-movie drama with about 1) a computer bug, 2) the usual evil corporate suits he wants to cover with the most important historical lines and 3) a neurotic but extremely beautiful female programmer trying to tell the future president. Soon, he will be the victim of a computer company's evil X-Files Master Victims who, instead of killing him, will feel the drugs unreliable. But when he arrives in DC, he doesn't tell him. In fact, the film changes from the B-movie drama, the idiotic B-film-love-drama. So far, we are so far away from the movie's starting point that most people turn it off. I almost did. If it had just been an INTELLIGENT love drama, but no! This is not! This is the "dangers I'm so nervous that I'm always stupid, so please love me for that" - love drama. Everything that has a slow, slow pace is not related to the political plot of the movie, the film's X-file schedule, or the film's comedy. All plots fail at all levels, which every evil meaningless dialogue reminds you of. The love part must be due to the decision of the drinking career "hey, there must be the dynamics of love between the presidential candidate and the very beautiful female programmer, yes, it works! Br /> <br /> In the meantime, Lewis Black is castrated and placed in a position where he does not come out with one Lewis Black Lewis Black's anger is replaced by the hope that it will sometimes appear in a film that he never does. And Christopher Walken is thrown into a hospital with a heart problem to duplicate the dramatic effect of a heart attack on the president's closest help in Westwing, looking at Christopher Walken's castration in Lewis Black. , which constantly struggles uphill to call randomly and to Westwing-ish, but can't go with Titanic as ever, is like watching a big blue whale dying on the beach. Heartbeats. <br /> <br /> And then enter the whole movie's lower point : It Stands Up Amazingly Complex Ethical Question: When Robin Williams Becomes President knowing that he has been selected for computer due to alarm? The American dream and all the good will prevail when he lives off the television presidency, like the dog Lassie. According to the patriotic glamor of the traditional presidency and the self-so-intelligent-just-making-historical atmosphere that Westwing raised during the next million years of illness. <br /> <br /> The director and screenwriter Barry Levinson is now on my personal list of writers and directors, where I am forever. This film has to be seen as a symptom of a flawed production process, where people (including Barry Levinson) were able to spend their production money because of their personal relationships rather than their skills. This is a project aimed at satisfying the desire of poorly qualified people for career prospects and the major actors mentioned earlier. This is the only explanation. PS: In computers, the ballot was caused by the double stars of Dobbs, Kellogs and Mills. Of course, what else could be while writing the script and not being able to tell the computer about the dishwasher.
