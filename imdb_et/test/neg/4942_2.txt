For a thriller to create fear, tension or emotion, the story must be credible. There is nothing plausible or realistic about this film. The main people have several ways to escape or change the tables, but they can be screwed every time. Antagonists who allegedly planned and adapted their trap specifically to the trap left a lot of improvisational weapons. In fact, there is one scene where the "smart" girl has the head of a bad boy and decides to pull her instead. It was a thoroughly predictable, meaningless "thriller". Each character was one-dimensional. "Victims" were the usual broken, brainless sheep worth killing. Does anyone on this planet have the ability to write an intelligent thriller?
