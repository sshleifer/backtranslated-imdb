Last week on Friday, I went out with my friends to see "Snakes on an Airplane". It was amazing compared to this terrible movie (but many scenes were ridiculously fun). Basically, a woman has a Mayan curse, where she carries innocuous innocent garter snakes, which, instead of attacking, abduct the victims. Girl with a coke bag is pretty hot. The title screen says: "100 Passengers ... 3000 Venemous Vipers!" Scary, I know. There were not even 100 passengers on the train. Just wash a few stoners and some others. It is worth five bucks to see that a woman becomes a huge CG snake and eats the whole train, then it is sucked into a huge vortex. It's just sad that someone goes to such lengths as to make an odd film to make a few bucks because the "snake on the plane" is crazy.
