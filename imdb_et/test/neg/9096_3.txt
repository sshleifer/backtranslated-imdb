Gordon goes to the top in a full moon, but it's expected. The combs are surprisingly low-key, keeping their performance at a more realistic level than we are used to seeing. Normal Stuart Gordon's black humor has also gone. <br /> <br /> The film is very effective in showing the breaking of combs and his last heroic act to save his wife and daughter. You feel compassion for your character, despite your shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Personally, I was more surprised by the scene of nudity and borderline porn sex when I was shocked by graphical violence and gore. /> <br /> Not a classic Gordon, but definitely something you might enjoy when you see his most famous movies.
