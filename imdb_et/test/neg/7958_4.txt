Deepa has again tried to boldly bring out a topic that no one wants to talk about. The story is OK, cinematography is prominent, the scenario and acting are below average. I think the guilty of Uttar Pradesh citizens in India, which was destroyed in 2000, was his original set. The result was a completely different lie, I just don't know what a great movie that was Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das and Aamir Khan would have been. The current actors Lisa Ray (who is just good for Bombay painting lining) and John Abraham are pathetic, needing basic lessons. Seema Biswas, Raghubir Yadav and Kulbushan Kharbabda have recorded the film as much as possible. The child had done an excellent job. Editing a movie and stream is not something you would have expected of Deep. A big topic, sending a strong message of practice that is still quite rampant in rural India, but does not meet Deep's standards for fire and land. Watch it once ... if this DVD doesn't bother to pay $ 10 to see it .... well your average Hindi movie every day
