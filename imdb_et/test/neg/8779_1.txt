I remember the bomb that came out in the early 1980s. At first it sounded a great idea. American classic retelling using modern film techniques. The original "Lone ranger", Clayton Moore, was backed up a bit. The film studio had threatened court proceedings when Moore continued as a real single ranger. (Moore was present at the children's hospitals as sick children with Lone Ranger.) For many Americans, Clayton Moore was just that; one and only single ranger. I had always felt that the studio could have justified both the individual ranger and the legacy if Moore had been treated better. Maybe even a new movie. How it was not, and many of the viewing public remained droveses away. The story and the action were also weak. All this was added to the big office bomb and right. Personally, I am delighted that the studio lost a lot of money after being treated with a real Lone Ranger. You will not treat such an American icon.
