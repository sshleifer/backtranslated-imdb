First, the twins are exactly the same. No one is girly and one is tomboy (Ashley is taller than Mary-Kate though) and their boys are not even French, so it's bad because they are counterfeiting accents. Lamo. It is also not so bad, not their best. I'm a big Mary-Kate and Ashley fan, don't get me wrong. storyline is OK and it's funny to watch. this is not the type of movie you would watch again and again. But hey, when they made this movie, they were still brand new, doing their movie thing. Girls also act when they are over 13. but if you are a young viewer, this is a good movie. Not as good as 13 if you are not a parent watching a film with your children. then it is OK. Good luck with MK + A with your future movies!
