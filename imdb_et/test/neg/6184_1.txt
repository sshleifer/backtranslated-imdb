So many people have taken shots of the attack and were born on the fourth of July, inter alia calling them "left-wing propaganda film". It is now my turn to take a political blow to the movie. For me, this film is a very credible religious belief and political view. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, acting and writing was a little cliché. Mel Gibson seems to want to play in these unnecessary violent films and prove it again with his partner Randall Wallace. With all this movie, this garbage prototype "Just tell your family I love them" or "Tell Ronny to pray before sleeping". It was so superfluous with the restored surface of the rubbish I felt I had to vomit. How would this scene be washed in Gibson's wife's hand and this "no color" applies to what to put in the washing machine. In the mid-sixties, he was under the rock, which did not notice racism around him. The second scene is that Gibson's daughter asks her what the war is and the scene is in such a trivial matter. <br /> <br /> Leadership showed it all. Gibson and his family or soldiers pray for stories. I'm glad to show you once or twice, but after a while I don't know if the film is trying to let anything on my head. Several scenes under the American flag during their best hours were photographed with melodramatic music. The director also seems to have won a victory in Vietnam. What exactly did they win. Cinematography was the worst when slowed scenes saw the distance between American flags in scenes. I love America, but such films seem to glorify every little thing we do. <br /> <br /> It may seem like a bead and maybe it is, but I can't hold it when such a film changes people who are not religious so patriotic that they accept what their country is looks bad. This film is narrow and so limited in so many aspects. It tells me if you are not a Christian your wrong. Would God or Jesus want people to kill what I don't think? For me, this film was offensive. At first, this film was funny in countless clichés and superfluous scenes, but when I looked at what this film was trying to say or not, it was really frustrating to look. I think it's my fault that I decided to watch this movie. I hope no one takes this comment offensive because I do not criticize religion or patriotism, but some narrow-minded people who are both both. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> The Plato, born on the fourth of July, is now the Apocalypse, the Fear Hunter, or the Killing Fields. Even a complete metal jacket that I absolutely hated was a better idea. I have read a quotation in the context of saying that a real patriot does not go with everything the government or the state does, but asks how wrong it is. A true patriot loves his country too much to see that it does bad things.
