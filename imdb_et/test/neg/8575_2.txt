I don't usually like to comment on how to act in a movie, because this is one thing people who are on the agenda against the film will go on. I'm making an exception in this movie. The performance of this movie is below average. I mean halfway through the movie, I don't know how the hell producer and / or the director strikes such an ensemble of people who can't act. Even if the value of the production was good, the poorly written story only worsened with the bad results of the actors and even the half-winded attempts to twist the film to the end, which is quite confusing. Is all the Spanish horror filming this disappointment?
