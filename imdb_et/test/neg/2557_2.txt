I thought maybe you could watch a movie that was cast, including Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craigi and Harry Andrews. Unfortunately, I was wrong. From the beginning to the end, take the pretentious nonsense over O'Toole and York from the wild. I watched it twice and still have no idea what it was. I feel that O'Toole is playing a Scottish castle with a drinking problem and who loves childhood games with his sister (York). He's also sick. But besides that, you are as good as me. <br /> <br /> The film has no redemption function. I can only assume that cast and director is shocked to make it terrible, unimaginable, stagy piffle. Obviously, it is a gifted waste of story and director time. Acceptable.
