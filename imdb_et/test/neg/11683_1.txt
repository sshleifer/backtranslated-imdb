OK, this movie wasn't good at all. I wouldn't like video games when I was over 15 years old. Balls for playing games, but writing video commentators may like this movie, it's strange. Just play a video game, don't tell a story about being trapped in one another. I use my cell phone, I hope I don't want to lose my girlfriend. Fat Is The Worst? OK, Grease has a very well thought out story with music. Even if you don't like musicals, someone would say that fat is good. My brother plays video games all the time and he looked 30 minutes and left because it was so terrible. I feel asleep.
