I haven't laughed at this for a long time - or seen the movie so intuitively! Talk so bad that it laughs at me! <br /> <br /> First of all, I think about 40 percent of the movie's length could not tell what's going on or even what I saw. I can only describe the camera's work, which corresponds to the LSD. There are intact segments, one minute long, where everything you see is vague flashes and caves in caves, people and other unidentifiable things. I spent half the film asking my teenage daughters what happened, but they couldn't do it better than me. <br /> <br /> Then there are "black" moments when we try to scare us (woooooooo) everyone's lights go out and the screen turns dark - and I don't think for just a few seconds. I think the longest lasted almost two minutes. I think an empty movie is one way to keep costs ... <br /> <br /> I suspect that "director" had recently read a book on all "must-do's" to make a scary movie and decided to throw them all - about 20 times. <br /> <br /> There are three good things about this movie: 1 / it is short in 90 minutes (though still an hour and a half too long!) 2 / All characters die (after all, taking care of them is impossible). 3 / There was one really good scene - when the group looked up the shaft they came down to, they discovered the discovery of the bottom of their rope (seeing that they were coming), pushing a large stone into the opening, closing them in. Waiting for it, and it was really chilling. <br /> <br /> And what's early on the campfire site when fired after firing at the back of the camp. I swear the director used about the same time almost 20 times in five minutes. <br /> <br /> And I'm positive that after the first killing, the same exact material is used on the cave floor about 90 seconds. <br /> <br /> Overall, CRAP is a movie. I'm looking at almost everything, but it's close to where I draw the drawing.
