I saw this movie as a normal Hollywood movie, but then I learned that his film was made for a TV channel. My DVD has a comment on 2 critics that one of the critical Stephen Farber's careers became his best film of the year .. <br /> <br /> All the characters were simple and decent performances, except for the character of the brain that never grows, what the director wanted to keep mysterious until the end. The police officer and the main culprit was a lesbian thing that seems to be a totally silly idea. God knows what happens to DAVE with a male leadership symbol. <br /> <br /> Another critic of Mr Brown's films said he was shocking and effective, but he didn't live all the Hype ... what I saw after watching the movie. for which I was partly in agreement ... I should have read it before taking the film.
