11 years after the release of this film, only 5 people in IMDb have reviewed it. The reason for this is that it is completely insecure about Acoon the Moon. It is coherent, but there is no cinematic round. Look at this movie's examples of terrible production in every sense. Opening credits are, for example, white stars that rise mechanically from a red background. At the end, Michael McKean, who looks at the prison window, says, "There are many secrets." followed by clip editing / music video from all the tragically uplifting moments of the movie. Julinana Hatfield. All in the meantime is terrible. I was bothered to find the value of this movie and got it empty. Although it is hard to believe, even the Burgess Meridith (always a crowd entertainer) is more frustrated about the role I play. This film is like a look at what's special about movies. The paper has a medium below the film. Women living with a trailer. But what was actually produced was almost unobtrusive. The film tries to branch in many directions, but never through. There have never been any unpleasant conflicts concerning the release of these friends to prison. Conflicts have never been resolved. There is really no conflict. Women try to become whores, but it never happens. Instead, they get jobs as a barman and a shelf holder. Sound exciting? It wasn't. It was stupid. And much of the movie is two women who talk and create conflict. Women are capable actors, but the script was far from poor. Use. It was a terrible movie, but it is even worst when they take Burgess Meridith out of their old home. Bad from start to finish. Like a tooth lion, there is no bite on this film.
