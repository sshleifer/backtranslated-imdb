Unintentionally fun early talkie melodrama with Kay Francis as Countess Balakireff, who was looking for all the pants. At the beginning of the film, he complains to the "stabilizer" that he would be too young before he went to the driver! The high-pitched English set he is moving is a cluster of clich√© that is ridiculous. But the topper is Basil Rathbone with the accent of Italian violinist Chico Marx! "My violence! How do I ever play again?" "Patreecia, my mind is cold!" This is an incredible campaign.
