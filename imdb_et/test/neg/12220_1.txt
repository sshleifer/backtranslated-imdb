I am sure that the ruins of this Yawn festival are somewhere in the documentary, because enough time may have been found by the producers. I do not combine any characters. This is a documentary issue. This disconnection will soon lead to total hostility-limiting hostility. Although the poor story of the flow makes me really unsure of what's going on with them and what their consequences they are trying to do. The story and the faces jump so fast that it is very difficult to understand what is happening. The third founder, who takes them for $ 700K, is introduced to the late movie, Khale and Tom must return (infertile) to explain "oh yes, this man also created the idea". And just when I thought I had a little understanding of who all the tertiary characters were, is this crazy woman talking about getting a puppy? What is it about? Did Tom really have to give all these inconvenient calls to employees? I can only imagine the boredom they felt when it really happened. Actually, I think I know them.
