This is a stereotype. A young fighter will try to enter the competition if he is not ready and is not represented in the selected fighting school. This leads to leaving the fighting school and of course he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight. They are too simple to make 1 + 1 easy for every adult. The fighter has trained and enters, but does not do what he has trained and feeds. The coach cries to do it and does it without success. And after that more ridiculous beating, he suddenly does what he talks and strikes his opponent once. This results in a turning point in the struggle, even though our hero has beaten his life until then. Think of Rocky movies and you have a good reference to how much he actually takes. The struggles are also bad. <br /> <br /> The last thing that screws this movie is stupid romance. Cheesy music and uncomfortable moments are not what I call entertainment. Or another team in my opinion. Maybe they had a small budget, I don't know, but ultimately, this movie is bad and deserves a rating of 3 out of 10.
