The mixing of sheriffs, high school students, fake rock music and some jokes in small towns, especially for no reason, is basically the transformation of The Giant Gila Monster - except without gila monster. Of course, anyone who has actually seen the "Giant Gila Monster" knows that this is one of the slowest movies of all time, often so slow, it's not even funny. And I can't believe that by 1967, "Giant Gila Monster" had gained such a reputation that the young directors were just dying to get to the bottom line, not to mention the revaluation. So can anyone please explain to me why this movie has been made?! By the way, the dance series is historically interesting, although about three years old; but even this is corrupted because it goes ... and ... and ... on ...
