Awful movie. Terrible action, cheesy, completely unrealistic, embarrassing to anyone who has played the game. In the beginning, this boy is not a whore, he would beat two. As for '' I appreciate it is my job '' it is not. For an untrained American audience it may be a good movie. For me, it's a couple of hours of my life, I'll never get back. I read through the reviews and came to the place where the man sounded like he knew what he was talking about. Then I read - <br /> <br /> '' And although American rugby may never reach the level that New Zealand or South Africa has given, the third in the world is something to stop your head '' > <br /> All I can say is LMFAO! Keep your American football and baseball playing, leave the real sport with the big boys.
