This movie can't be serious because it has a funny boy named Curtis who kills people. The other two psychological children are cute, but Curtis-boy is just as ugly as he carries these huge brown and ugly glasses. The actor probably was wrong with the wrong set and had to go to Nerds for revenge. <br /> <br /> Another thing I hate about this movie is that Curtis takes his sweet time in shooting people. I kept my finger on the back and forth button because it took too long and what was his voice? He sounded like he was fourteen and not ten. The other thing I hated was that he continued to smile like an idiot and that didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Then they put this annoying baby in the freezer and somehow found a flashlight. It didn't make any sense or music. Music didn't fit any scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is slow, boring and a waste of time. Watch another movie on your birthday.
