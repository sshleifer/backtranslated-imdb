Carlos wants to show positive actions, racial stereotypes and related topics at his exhibition, which makes him much like the judge of the Supreme Court, Thomas. He's there because of his competition, and then he despises. He may be having fun with the Mexicans, because he himself is Mexico, and I would also like to say that he can effortlessly have a mental challenge because any busy person can say he is not the sharpest tool ... although he is certainly some kind of tool. <br /> <br /> He is a cowboy comedian who, even with writer staff, cannot put together 3 minutes of really funny material during a 30-minute show. I can't think of a comedian who is regularly on TV that Carlos can carry a candle, except perhaps Larry's cable watch (not surprisingly he also has an exhibition at Comedy Central to meet exactly the same audience. <br /> <br /> If you ever see the worship, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, etc., you talk about comedy that you really feel the work and thinking that goes out to develop a funny comedy voice. The voice is partly stolen from other better comedians and partly hidden by its tendency to scream its awkward racist racist fear. The Mencia exhibition is loved by some "at least" Do not marvel it badly from the people ", who firmly believe that he feels better about the fooling of his beaches, unfortunately Carlos and his fans are part of the problem, not the solution to this issue.
