I've seen many movies over the years and I'm a big comedy fan. <br /> <br /> But this so-called comedy reduced me to a tear. This is undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I remember a friend listening to this movie and decided to watch it. If I could return, I'd like to. I regret it as long as I live, the time I waste watching it. <br /> <br /> The story is so crazy; it doesn't make sense and leaves you confused. There's a Scottish mob and a German master who, after Pestario 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), has been scotching after $ 50,000 and the Germans after the head. <br /> <br /> There are many camouflages in the form of masks. But we see the most disturbing, worst, mind-acting, dialogue and sounds in cinema history. This movie disturbed me so much; finally I was full of aggression. I was so angry that I had wasted so much time watching a movie that definitely drove depressed people to a certain suicide. I mean, how can one hope to be allowed to do such a film? <br /> <br /> I know people have their own opinions, but the most exciting thing about Pest is that people really like it. Why? What's funny about a man who is annoying from the first to the last? A man who can't act? Who has a tedious voice and a confused face? <br /> <br /> I sat through it, thinking the film would be better, it would be. It wasn't. You usually want a good boy to survive, but I wanted the Germans or Scottish violence to find and kill Pest, something that made me out of my misery. There's nothing funny, interesting or normal about this movie, it's just annoying and confusing. Jokes are dead even before they are told. I'm sorry for the cameramen who doesn't have any words about making movies, but it really has to be filmed. I wouldn't be surprised when they get counseling. <br /> <br /> If you want to stay healthy and part of society, my suggestion is to watch this movie ever. I would squeeze myself in my room for 5 weeks and go without food and spend time watching this movie again! <br /> <br /> I don't think I'll ever hate anything.
