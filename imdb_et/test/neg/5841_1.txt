Obviously, several agents did not see the dollar signs when they signed their clients down to a 117-minute * tiny * court house complex. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film could have been fine, $ 1 million was left out of it. Seriously. The size of control is not important, prostitution is still prostitution, and no "love occupation" can change the fact that no marriage ever gives any meaning that would mean "for the poor, the poorer, the pimp, and the loyalty". The picture's story otherwise, but: 2 children, flat broke, "desperate" on the border and completely stupid. They collide with a rich business man. Children's marriage struggles with imperfect times and the fact that the husband is a loser. Enter Mr. Tuxedo, fend off magic and stability - a virtual magnet to mark a biological clock - and with him the temptation of a woman, tension, intercourse. Whom does he choose? Maybe I could really care about these conditions. Frankly, Redford's selfish and manipulative playboy is sympathetic in nature. The woman who sells her is just what the man deserves, who is the pimp of his wife. The unreasonable proposal makes the husband TOTAL loser, due to the lack of any positive male character and makes the woman a cheap money, rather attracted by money, not to confuse another potential love, a woman with no moral center and self-esteem. <br /> All the impressive talents (acting, leading, cinematic) that have been wasted on this movie - and it was an impressive amount - could not save this splashy-too-trashy $ 1 million line. When I see this turkey in another bridal shower, I start to roast it! (Or maybe cross the Titanic and put the tape in the ocean!)
