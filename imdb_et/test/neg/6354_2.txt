They have to be. I read them so you can check them one by one: <br /> <br /> - Police regularly tens of millions of dollars of money and drugs simply because they have no evidence <br /> <br /> - When you shoot, you start always hit the same way and fly the same way, even though the body never has a sign. <br /> <br /> - The police are unable to detect the sound of the weapon cadres and do not think anything is suspicious when a hidden police officer phone call at a high-level drug and money transaction has been released by this weapon. <br /> <br /> - Bad guy gunmen can hit mannequins in one shot, but can't hit a big, voluminous martial artist 100. <br /> <br /> - If you rocket the car park, the next three on the line will blow cars evenly after 15 seconds. <br /> <br /> - In addition to the last point, all cheap cars are always parked next to each other. <br /> <br /> - The smoke from the rocket launcher is much higher than the amount of smoke caused by the four thousand cars. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games that are a long and long way before any other gaming company can match five floppy disks. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games that are a long and long way before the production of any other gaming company, are graphics that look like Windows 3.1 screensavers. <br /> <br /> - Floppy disks can be read even after they are pulled up. <br /> <br /> - Half-drunk guys in bars are watching the news while they're in the pub, and are thoroughly understanding the modern American military history, Agent Orange, and high-tech military personnel. But they can only express their views through dialogue that sounds foolish from someone over the age of seven. <br /> <br /> - Although the fighting looks almost every hour, this bar has only one employee who pours beer and handles security. Of course he knows martial arts. <br /> <br /> Gold Medal Olympians will make a simple transition to software company business leaders in a few years. <br /> <br /> - A woman who works for a computer game company knows everything about how to win a game she has never played, constantly robs her rivals of big games and can rob her competitors of facts and figures, but she didn't know that almost all other companies in the field exceeded the mergers of large companies. <br /> <br /> Bad guys always die in slow motion. Women tell their husbands that they shave their husband's bravery at killing bad guys. - Women do a lot of their husband's police work; it can explain why she speaks and complains every time she goes to work. Although it does not explain why she adores her so much every time she gets up in the morning, she can read about her murders. <br /> <br /> - It is quite typical that a police officer is involved in kidnapping, killing tons of people on three occasions and completing various multi-million dollar illegal transactions within a week. <br /> <br /> - If you are trying to lose a car that follows you, it is wise to continue driving at the speed limit. And if you follow the police officer, the triviality is not important - you can plow him back, then park next to him. He doesn't notice. <br /> <br /> - All police officers are experienced martial artists. <br /> <br /> - It's possible to hit a man four meters away. <br /> <br /> - People scream or hurt when they are beaten or beaten, but when they break their hand, they don't sound. <br /> <br /> - Bad guys clean their bloody axes with their handkerchiefs, and then leave them in their pockets for several days. <br /> <br /> - Wooden parts, when turned with one sharp blow, crush strong ladders with six or more seats at the same time. <br /> <br /> - The photo and the features listed on the back of the DVD do not necessarily need to be on the DVD. Promoted interactive menus? Why not have any menus at all! Advertised Scene Index? Why not the whole thing is one scene / chapter and no index needed! It's also OK to use the Matrix font and title on the tagline, not in any way rip-off. <br /> <br /> All that I am shocked is that 12 out of 15 top qualified players never acted again.
