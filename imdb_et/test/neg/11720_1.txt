This movie was not only a disappointment for a horror / temporary film lover, but a disappointment for anyone who sees it. WoW. I thought this movie might be funny because a man with a big head. But it was full of a long and drawn conversation that wasn't needed. There was so much sex that I hate women and men. This movie was not only boring, but it wasn't. Wow. Wow. To all this, it seems that every scene looks like it was a light one, and I think they used the same set for two different lawyers, restaurants and airports. This movie is not meant for a movie lover who loves bad movies because it eventually seems to want to waste time. Watch the movie! <br /> <br /> -party
