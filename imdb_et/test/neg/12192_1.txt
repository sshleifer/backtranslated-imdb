I love the distribution of this movie. My peers always try their best to protect it, probably from the love of Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they never convinced me that it should be misled. Here are some great reasons: A: The plot goes from a track video movie to a vampire-populated strip bar that does not contain any settings. Suddenly something very real becomes very fake, which is like an audience sitting on a Thanksgiving celebration, exploding with a dynamite. B: It's involuntary by Juliette Lewis. C: Unbelievable ideas are abundant, such as real torso-and-leg guitars, brothers whose name is "Gecko", bad vampire make-up jobs, Cheech Marin, who plays three characters (?) "Erected" and belongs to a man who goes to "Sex Machine". If Robert Rodriguez didn't try to be so innovative with his violence, I could have amused this obvious popcorn. Like the whole project, he got ideas by playing the key figures. The only thing that is considered to be my favorite scene is George Clooney's ridiculous cheesy monologue after he kills his blood, horny-for-kids, a terrible brother. I swear I think they thought about it right away. This film is offensive and ignites those who want insulting. Terrible movie.
