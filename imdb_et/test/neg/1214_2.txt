Brooke Shields - Leaving his "sudden Susan" tasks - bitter divorce, who blames three girls in "Palm" at Palm Springs. Problem: Brooke is "unlinked" and clever, while his friends are all involved. As a result, the title's consequences and emotional setback are due to their "immoral" weekend. <br /> <br /> Despite some laughter created by Dan Cortes ("Victoria's Closet") and MTV "communication agencies" Adam Corolla and Dr Drew Pinsky, this is a funny thing for women only. D.B. Sweeney, Virginia Madsen and Jon Polito.
