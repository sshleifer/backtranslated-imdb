I bought a video for 13 pounds in HMV (we pay more in the UK) because my friend told me that it was highly appreciated and the reviews on this site were generally impressive. <br /> <br /> I have to say that opening credits was let ... dancing / music is not very powerful. <br /> <br /> A passenger car and an unexpected collision, like a lady was injured, was a nice touch, .. something unexpected ... although the way she took care of the car and still went in the handbag saw most of the directors horny, but For Lynch it was something else. <br /> <br /> The shock was increased by the usual low noise that resembles a finger that was scraped onto the board; I thought another Lynch masterpiece could represent demons burning in his shocked and traumatized self-consciousness. After some time this noise changed somewhat annoying and in the course of further investigation I discovered a new video cassette. (and money) <br /> <br /> Two female characters were at a certain place and lesbian scenes were fairly fair, though predictable. There were no decorations, and after a few vaguely good scenes (turning on Hoover) there were too many terrible scenes that were weak and ridiculous. For example, coffee is spit on the back of a napkin threatening to create a veil and a foolish monster at the back of the canteen. Oh, and how is the color of heaven's jewelsâ€¦ .and naff. <br /> <br /> This whole movie gives you the feeling of an unsuccessful genius ... you know when you listen to the worst Dylan trail ever and think of my God who was embarrassed .... was that really Bob? <br /> <br /> The whole feeling is an unsuccessful TV movie that has been badly put together with some (not many) extra bits to give it 15 <br /> <br /> I threw it over the last 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Will I give her another chance and look again. If I want to be puzzled and work on the film, I look at Frank Woods' guide to consolidated accounts. <br /> <br /> Lynch made one classic .. Blue velvet and straight story was nice. That's like Wild at Heart, was let; his strange is now predictable and hidden. Anyone want to buy a second hand video? <br /> <br /> Make some younger original talent David. <br /> <br /> Ten Ten (and no more). Sorry.
