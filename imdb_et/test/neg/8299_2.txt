Ok, if you like yer monster moovies sullen, rigid, starchy and violently dull, but a lot of throttling, then head right to "Lady Frankenstein", stagy, costumy italian corpse walker. Joseph Cotten ("Citizen Kane") plays an old baron and must really pay for it. Sexy Sarah Bay, who has played in cow-free European B-films, usually Rosabla Neri, including "Hercules Against the Moon Men", plays her ambitious daughter - a surgeon's toasted dress. Cotten makes an ugly, spectacular monster (it's really a lot of trouble to make a nice one?), Who is now Cotten (who took her ticket control and ran), and wanders around for everyone to see. Tania (Bay) decides to change her lover's brain (who is old and wrinkled) to the younger man's brain (who is "beautiful" but stoic) to make another monster to make the first monster Cotten. who is misleading around moving people. Well, after many expositions and some pulls, the two monsters doubled each other a bit, Tania stumbles behind the first monster and then sexes with her second monster - only to pull her! Doh! There's so much choking that you forget about the fact that the film is as exciting as dead carp and mooves as fast. For this review, I saw the version of Alpha Video heavily edited, and one wonders a lot of people, not that it would have greatly improved the film. Director von Theurmer was previously employed in a variety of Z-class bins, including "Jungle Warriors", "Dead Island" (as Mel Wells) and "San Ramoni Baptized Girls". MooCow says to avoid this movie lunatic and find something that is full of ... gas pedal. <br /> <br />; = 8)
