Great D.B. tries to keep peace between settlers and their red brothers. <br /> <br /> Boone (Aging Bruce Bennett) must try and prove to the local Indian leader (Lon Chaney, Jr., seems to be drunk, as usual) that his son was killed by a tribal leader, who has also been involved in gunfire if no one looks. Faron Young sings, although he keeps his rifle like a mop. <br /> <br /> OK is a western adventure led by two men, each with no credit on his CV, but this flick is not too bad and has a nice short driving time of 76 minutes.
