I've been trying to write a summary of the scheme for several minutes and don't seem to do that. But in the case of a movie that is as bad as the Beast of the Blood at night, there is no ghost. Astronauts hit the ground and believe in death. His body later revives, but it has been found to carry embryos in some form of strange alien life. But how did they get there? And where is the alien who implanted strange creatures into the body of Major John Corcoran? <br /> <br /> IMDb lists the duration of a blood beast's night at 62 minutes. Is that right? 62 minutes? It was supposed to be longer. It seemed infinite to me. Even with MST3K's commentary (which was, by the way, very funny), the actual movie felt much, much longer. And it's pretty much snoozer from start to finish. I like a lot of these alien invasion-type movies from the 50s but not. It couldn't grab my interests at any level. The baby's foreigners were too foolish to be taken seriously; Add to it the usual low-budget Roger Corman shots and you have a real movie loser.
