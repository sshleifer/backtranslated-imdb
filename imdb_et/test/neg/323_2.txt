Ugh. Pretty terrible. <br /> <br /> Linnea Quigley gets the best deal, but her character doesn't have much. Who is his character, should this be a little boy's aunt? Another user commented that he got a nude shower in the scene. Though the film had a shower, it was head and shoulders. Maybe it's an alternative version of this movie. <br /> <br /> Quigley still has much more than John Carradine, Cameron Mitchell and Brinke Stevens. Carradine appears for a short time in a clumsy bathrobe that describes a vague dialogue. There is no other character with him, although he is sort of composed, or else there are redundant shots, which is definitely someone else. There's also a really bad photo of her companion medallion (it looks like a bad photocopy) and a decent picture of her family in the Bible. He initially created Jack-O or something like that. <br /> <br /> Cameron Mitchell appears briefly on television as a TV horror. Brinke Stevens is in a movie where she shows "The Coven" where she runs around in a cemetery dress. Obviously there are more Brinke footage features than the Retromedia DVD double function bonus feature. The keyword witch / brides wore blood. <br /> <br /> Jack-O: What is it? Darn if I know. A little boy is told a story about a squirrel killer, and he and some other children are afraid of a woman who, for some reason, is a witch. She is watching her home and helping her family with her haunted garage for Halloween (put your hand through the hole and feel the eyes that are actually grapes, etc.). The squirrel-killer appears several times to keep the branches when he watches the people, or hold his fault in front of the camera for a while. Sometimes he manages to do more than just stand up and actually kill people. <br /> <br /> There are also some setbacks to the western or prairie family, where the little boy plays in this family. I think his ancestors. I think they are the backbone of Jack-O, but I'm not sure how. <br /> <br /> A little boy is seemingly the main character, but we don't know anything about him except he is wearing nightmares and fighting with bullying even when he kills this process. It would have taken more time to create your character. I wouldn't be less dead when he died. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, not even for Halloween.
