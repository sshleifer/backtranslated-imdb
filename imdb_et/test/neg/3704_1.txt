This movie is the worst I've ever seen. You may think you've seen some bad movies of your time, but if you haven't seen it, you don't know how terrible the movie is. But wait, there is worse news! This studio will soon open this masterpiece (I'm ironic) so everyone can see! The only thing that is worse than the plot of the movie is the impact, function, direction and production. Bill Woods, Ed Wood's poorest man (not because Ed Wood is rich) (I like Ed Wood's films) can still keep this movement at the pace of this movie. It opens with a baby's bigfoot catching (Littlefoot? -Parry, can't help) by a couple of unlikely hunters killed by a parent. It causes the whole city where the hunters lived to go to the Bigfoot Hunting Shack. That's pretty much the plot. Nothing is very interesting, and the viewers will never be able to take care of any sign. If a person is interested in Rebane movies, I would recommend it to almost everybody else. But as I said, Troma will soon approve it for a new generation of filmmakers.
