Just saw it again last night and said, "Style instead of substance". We may already think that Jerry Lee Lewis was supposed to be much more than the one shown here. The character of Jerry Lee Lewis in this film is not depicted as a real person in one minute for an entire hour and a half, but then again all other characters are just one pencil stroke, which is the whole comic book character. <br /> <br /> Let's start. We see Jerry Lee and his cousin, Jimmy Swaggart, who slides into the black jazz club and see how Jerry got inspired. It may be possible. We see two cousins ​​choosing different paths in life (possibly). Then we cut Jerry Lee, who played the piano as an adult (now playing Dennis Quaid) and it's exciting and a little scary. Cut the scene where he first meets his other cousin Myraga. Since then, the whole thing has changed into certain events that have been played in the news roll in an appropriate manner at high speed. <br /> <br /> Not that the movie is not a little fun and it's nice to hear new versions of the creators of Jerry Lee. Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Swaggart is also the reason why you should at least look at it, showing his great progress over the next few years. Winona Ryder as Myra is one of the film's most significant characters. She bullies, she stabs, looks at the gum and plays the shell and that's it. No minutes give cause to explain why he was the third Mrs Lewis and talked about women with the first two? That's why it can't really be classified as a biological, but rather an inaccurate newsletter. We see Jerry on his first song on the radio, we see his second single, which goes to the top ten, we see his third. 1 and so on. Then there will be an inevitable fall. Absolutely, no basis in reality. <br /> <br /> Making Another Small Quarrel: The movie takes place '56 to '58 and still Myra says, "I'm only 13" until the end.
