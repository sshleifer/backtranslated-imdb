But certainly a serious candidate from one of the worst 10. <br /> <br /> I got this DVD inexpensive as a case of Sandra Bullock. This is the wrong ad - it has almost 10 minutes on the screen. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there was no other point of sale for this movie - the dialogue was terrible, editing was probably done by someone who was pulled out of Qualudes, was leadership ... well, let's just say that my 14-year-old daughter could do better, but I hope he will not see such a faint praise from me. The family cat might have done better. <br /> <br /> Sandra does a great job for the first movie, in the short time she is on the screen - and this is the only redeeming quality movie. A stupid story, poorly written and transferred to the film, because only the seventh grade media class should be capable. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a dreck.
