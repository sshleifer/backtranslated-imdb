It may be the worst film I've ever seen. I knew it was a B movie before watching it (it was actually the reason for viewing it), but I would never have thought it could be that bad. The title promises Dracula in space and does, but the story does not actually use Casper van Dien as the successor to his parents. And look at the end of the movie, it will come to you soon. I've never seen any graduation "And now we're over budget!" more clearly. Their movie resolution was quite comical, but the story was so obviously in the corner. If you feel you have to see it, check it out with a friend who shares your love for B-movies. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't have done it.
