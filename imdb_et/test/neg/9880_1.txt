OK to get started, this movie wasn't like a book at all. I read the book at the age of 13 and since then it has always been my favorite. When I wait for a different book to come out, this is the book I turn to. I have 3 copies of God. anyway, i knew it wasn't like a book, but come on! They could have done a little better than that. I mean seriously when I wanted to watch an American werewolf in Paris or London when I was watching these films. They took a very good story and turned a story around it that is over and over, and frankly I'm tired of seeing it. I mean, the whole story of f ***** g (sorry) is best when it comes to Gabriel. He won't die. What was that? And she's old in this movie. Gabriel should only be 24 years old, not 44 da **. Awww. And Astrid, who came to her **, had the idea that Astrid is not Viviani's aunt no no. Astrid and Vivian hate each other. Awwww. Anyway yes, it was my little bead seriously pi ** ed off. I hope it helped.
