A ridiculous thriller, where a group of students kidnapped their bad and neurotic teacher (Mirren) just to prevent her from acting against them. An interesting premise can be a good movie, but it's just flat and far drawn. Bored, whose ending is embarrassing, simply to say. Mrs Mirren is trying to give this failure some dignity, but even she - a good actor, she has no doubt - can save the garbage. I'll give it 4 (four).
