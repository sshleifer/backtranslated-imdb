It seems that whatever I see him, Christina Ricci seems full of promise, but can't do it. Of course he can cry and shout, but Prozac Nation sees Ricci out of the depth, maybe I'm too tough .... okay, I'm guilty to the director. Jessica Lange is outrageous and almost reaches the height of Frame Dunaway. Unfortunately, I think Lange got to the top of Frances and it was downhill. This film had every chance that the film was slippery and funny, while depressed. Instead, we have been badly hysteric dressed with eighty-plywood stereotypical tile. I had no background in the movie's eighties because I was not happy with the lame attempt to believe that it was from the eighties just because Ms Ricci wears a madonna-inspired dress for her "lost birth" party. Let everyone, you're all better than that. Filmmakers should hang their heads in disgrace and, as a result of disappointment, Elizabeth Wurtzel is likely to prepare a kit when she complains of "inevitable emotional damage" due to the final product. go ahead lizzie, sue! I could
