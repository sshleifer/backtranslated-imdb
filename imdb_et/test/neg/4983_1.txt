God, I never felt as offended in my life as I did. There are so many ways to describe this grace that I think when I say everything I can remember, I can disable this site. <br /> <br /> How do I start? Well, for one, it doesn't know the knowledge of the original series to find out that this movie is the face of people who have seen it. The biggest grinding of any song in the book is from the metal version to the striking RAP VERSION, what did they mean? How does Underdog and electronic-heavy music style fit? The story is so basic that I do something I usually don't do and don't even give a summary. Just think about it: the dog gets superpowers, fill the rest. That's the predictable movie. And then there will be jokes .... please kill me now. This humor style that may not even get the children to laugh, it's so bad, well, wait to punch the line after sneezing. It was a little funny. But what surprises me is why Jason Lee (Ny Name Is Earl), Patrick Warburton (Emperor's New Groove) and Jim Belush (Jim's) are all here. Actually, the actors acting at these exhibitions / films are a good work and, except for Lee, are the best actors in this movie, but it says very little. The rest deserve this mess of the nerve of the nerve. I am very sad to see that this disaster is buried by such good players. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's as bad as Doogal, which I was looking through, and again my head would burst when I saw something worse than that.
