Heist movie with Jean Reno, Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne ... sounds good on paper? I suspect it must have been done when someone green shone the production of this movie, but the final product is terrible! <br /> <br /> The story is boring, it's boring, and just 88-minute movie seems to be just dragged. I felt that my life was slipping and I was sure I had something better I should have done ... no color to look somewhere dry? <br /> <br /> Sigh. I'm a big fan of Jean Reno, but what did he think about it when he signed it? There are so many other great movies ... go look at one of them and let this movie be best forgotten.
