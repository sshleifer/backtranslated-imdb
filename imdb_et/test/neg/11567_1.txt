What a desperate film. Dress actors with furry towels, place in the suburban wasteland, set the cameras rolling and hope for the best. One can only imagine that what he gave when his characters were killed by socks, thus saving even more. This competitors Monster is a go-go because it is the best medicine for insomnia. Oh God - how can I complete 10 lines, explaining how everyone in this movie will be eternally bored? Whiney crappy plastic bungling robot, who irritates everyone both on the screen and on the screen, the giant spider is reduced to one giant hairy leg, pulled by a string, actors are desperately trying not to look at the pictures.
