This is a great example of what could have been a great movie and a great idea, but it turned out to be really bad in this process. I was mostly tempted by this DVD cover, stupid to me, but I did anyway, and I had a bad sense of blowing. This film is essentially about El Chupacabra, which destroys Los Angeles and the task of the local keeper and writer is to save the day before two corrupt police and two evil scientists bring them down. The main reason I didn't enjoy this movie was due to the big consistency errors that were hard to spot. Along with some bad behavior, scarce lighting and nothing frightening, this movie didn't hit me as much as it probably should be. Compared to other Chupacabra movies, it is definitely on the tables, just barely. <br /> <br /> First of all, the consistency of this movie is far away and I think of the shoulders and ditch. There were so many points when the characters said or did something and then in the next frame, they don't do it or the change has never happened. Case: The main character has a weapon, Chupacabra attacks, he whips out from scratch and breaks and there is no weapon. The girl runs when she protects mysterious protection here and she has no weapon, the main character works with the girl and has a gun. Where this elegance came and what happened to the gun. Time is up. One minute there is the sun and you can still see the sun and then the next minute it looks like midnight. There were some holes in the plot, as was why Chupacabra was there, what did the scientists do, what happened to this man and why did he shoot and live? These things disrupted me and no questions answered. <br /> <br /> The next list is an actor. The boy was wood and bad. The main protagonist, Navarro, played by Eric Algeria, seems to be a bit too calm and too committed at points to find out what some dogs were killing and when a tragedy hit, his emotion was not there. Elina Madison, who played Starlina, did a pretty bad job. He was the author of the best-selling book about Chupacabra and he just didn't seem to be in his role or performance. His act was ridiculous and poor. Even for the author, he is too aware of this thing and knows how to turn off a high security protection system in a hidden laboratory. Tony Criss was okay, but he seemed somewhat calm for some of the things he was doing. The film reminds me of some of the murders of a crime solving exhibition, where actors and actors are not really committed to their work. <br /> <br /> I rarely get this analogue. for lighting or editing, but for this movie, I couldn't be harsh on lighting. It took me out of the movie several times because the lighting was so badly targeted. There were times when they tried to be creative by adding color filters to the scene to make it "comic" but it returned. The worse part is at night, when it's black outside, but the scene is so supersaturated with light, it seems like it's a day. They continue to shift high-intensity light and soft lighting for random scenes and the lights seem so bright that the actors were sliding. It should not be so bright that at night there are dark shadows. At sunset, when the lighting was perfect, it's the only time the light was good, except it was terrible. <br /> <br /> There was no fear in this movie. There was only once I jumped, but it wasn't that scary. There were points where it would probably have been scary, but it was such a damn light that Chupacabra saw the man closer, but if it was dark, it would have been better. Even Chupacabra's creature design was poor, it seemed good, but it was a short man or child in a jumping game. They did not hide their face; they showed him no secret or any mysterious look. There was a fair amount, but it seemed unrealistic. This movie was not just scary, it's all. <br/> <br /> In general, they are America's great South American legend as a thirst-eating human feeder that Chupacabra is not. In fact, it frightened people and killed only goats, sheep, dogs and deer because it was said to hate the smell of people. But would that be the story? I didn't enjoy this movie for some reason, but I give them credit to try to make a good movie with good intentions. I do not recommend this movie to any horrorist, but if you like indie or B movies, you should check it out. Also, if the cult classic is tempting, you will enjoy this movie. I didn't do it, I don't see it again, but in some deeply sedative ways I enjoy these movies just to see what Hollywood's other party is doing.
