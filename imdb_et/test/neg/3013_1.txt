this show just sucks. I don't think I should even say that, or why, because by commenting on the number of comments, I repeat everything. vipi keys are like turning on the TV and throwing it in. that's exactly what it is, as I don't even exceed. these men are so stupid, not funny and not good that it's not even funny. I sat through four episodes and I want my two hours ago. where they find competitors because they are mentally deficient. when I was the man who looked at this idea for the idea and put it on the TV, I'd make it to the world and jump from the highest house I found. how about garbage on such a TV? especially the comedy network should not show something called the comedy network, be it at least a comedy show or maybe so often funny?
