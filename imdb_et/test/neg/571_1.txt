** Possible spoilers ** From Dreamworks and director Peter Chan is the romantic comedy of "The Love Letter" that takes place in the picturesque village of New England, where one mother Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a delightful, small bookstore. One day Helen is calling at an anonymous letter (a letter of love) that has somehow changed under the pillow of reading chambers. After reading the love prose, he believes he has been written, deliberately placed on the couch to find him, and thinks he knows the identity of his secret admirer. Inadvertently, Helen leaves a letter where her employee Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds it to be for her and thinks she knows who wrote it. The facts then bring it to the hands of the young man Johnny (Tom Everett Scott) who thinks that Helen has written to him. And before all this is identified, you can only imagine the fun situations where all the parties involved are cast; and I mean to imagine, because the way this film plays, the audience gets a little more from it than what it brings. There are two specific areas where this romantic comedy is sad: it is not very romantic and it is not funny; and it is a strong combination that causes the credit to open this movie wrong. Once set up and the main character (Helen) is created, it will go a long way in almost ninety minutes. By the time you finally find out who actually wrote the letter, and to whom you might care less. Rounding the story is Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Julianne Nicholson, Gloria Stuart and Geraldine McEwan. It is a shame to see that such a talent wastes a gap like this, and looks at the balance badly. Kate Capshaw, who usually refreshes the screen but looks, looks tired here, while Selleck seems to have just come out of a three-day bend lasting a week. Ellen DeGeneres actually comes to the best of the bunch. It is said that the trip is often more than the main experience. For the "Letter of Love", it would have been best for everyone involved to have just stayed at home. I appreciate it 1/10.
