Here is a decisively average Italian post apocalyptic taking hunting / killing of people in the sports theme area as the most dangerous game in Turkey to shoot, Gymkata and Running Man. <br /> <br /> Surely the movie's watch here is not nearly as much fun as the other listed items, and is also busy with poor voice work, usually as a shameful act, with several perfectly tasted scenes, such as long rape and some really stupid and illogical points . <br /> <br /> Take, for example, at the end of the movie when our hero can penetrate the villains. Initially, he kills the army and leaves his jeep. When this corpse was discovered, the villains react? (keeping in mind that our hero has murdered them all cruelly)? They decide to wait until the next morning to find the culprit (!!!!!!!!!!) <br /> <br /> But I think it is fair, but the movie remains traceable if you can stop your uncertainty during scenes and it brings enormous benefits always in the presence of excellent Woody Strode (even if its screen time is very limited) <br /> <br /> No imagination is a classic, but still worth almost Italian B-film enthusiasts.
