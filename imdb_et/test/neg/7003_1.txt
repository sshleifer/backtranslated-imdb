It's hard to believe that a movie can be bad, but you live and learn. What is even more amazing is that the people who put the thing together were probably college education. Meanwhile, the work of their work brings something that a group of five eighth graders can come to. The light side (if there is one) has some nice moments on the sound track, which is another reason to question how the rest of the film can be so bad.
