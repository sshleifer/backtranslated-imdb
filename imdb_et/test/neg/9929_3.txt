I got this movie halfway and I was very disappointed. It was just boring and completely unreal. I can be away from being unrealistic in many movies, but not when it should be a criminal drama. The process of gathering evidence and interviewing was simply odd. I started a quick transmission to see how it ended. And then I got it forever and just turned it off and returned it. The main character played by Ellen Barkin was not at all plausible. Peta Wilson worked very well in this film, but her character was out there and there was no one who worked for her talents to do it.
