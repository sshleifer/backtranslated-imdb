If you read the novel for the first time, I don't mind filming how different it is to scripting if it follows or at least contains a plot. Just for Hollywood's known reasons, the important parts of the story are ignored and another story added. The reason why this novel passed through the test of time is undoubtedly due to the collapse of both the characters and the plot as a whole. To mix this structure, it is necessary to destroy the complex balance of the gateway and thus the story of the storyteller. Although casting this film is an opinion, it leaves much to be desired. Characters that are considered very fat should be at least portable so that the character can be trusted. The days of slavery cannot be over, or surely the actors of this caliber have been in rebellion, a story of such consolation. Marian Halcolme's face is described as a male appearance, ... Tara Fitzgerald's very feminine look is not true. Again, Laura is described fairly, if not "essential," so dark hair does not fit the impression of the novel. .... Poorly Made, Hollywood! <br /> <br /> J. Hunter
