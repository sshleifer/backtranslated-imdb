(SMALL SPOILERS) Yesterday I bought this movie DVD. I saw it with my friends and I couldn't believe what happened. <br /> <br /> The first three films had at least a glow winner (especially movie 3), but not just the critters hardly ever look, they weren't funny! They never made me laugh. I have to admit that the story started nicely. After an hour I remembered that Critters films were always very short. So I thought to myself, "Where is $ ^% # $ critters?!?!" They were hardly in this movie! If it didn't make me crazy, a boy named Ethan sat in his bed after Charlie "murdered the ship" and he knew that the critters were still on board! In the first film, the brown family frightened their minds. But here, Ethan didn't care! Just when the critters were not even dangerous! <br /> <br /> Now what I want to say now can destroy the end, but I'll say it anyway. In the first film they finally had to fight with a giant critic. In another, there was a big critic. In the third film, criticism sought to burn her spindash (Sonic the Hedgehog) and began to attack a small child. But at the end of the fourth (which caused me to hate), he put naked criticism on Ethan and Ethan kills it as if it were something. <br /> <br /> Now something I really don't understand what happened to Ugis. He was one of my favorite characters in the first two. Then in 50 years he will be evil. It was very disappointing. Not only that, but wasn't he a face whore hunter? Why is he still "Johnny Steele?" He also seemed to have a different personality. He seemed much smarter and not as monotonous as the first two. <br /> <br /> Being someone who actually enjoyed the first two critters and loved the third movie, I'll give Critters 4 a 2/10
