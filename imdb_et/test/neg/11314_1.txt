Leslie Nielsen strikes this thorough comedy, which is the worst main film I've ever seen. Nothing like this movie because it is essentially a joke movie, and the joke is not so funny. How many times do we have to laugh at almost blind people who make themselves stupid? It's not funny, it's just pathetic. Nielsen has to start seriously rejecting some of these pathetic scripts and Stanley Tong must remain in Jackie Chan's movies because it doesn't get much worse.
