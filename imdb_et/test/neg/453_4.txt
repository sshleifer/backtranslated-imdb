I'm a big fan when I'm talking about the Doctor Who series and I'm still, but I was very disappointed when I started watching this new series. <br /> <br /> Children under the age of 15, or even better 10-year-olds, will enjoy the best and perhaps new fans who have not seen any original series. so big, David Tennant took me to appreciate how much better Christoper Eccellestion was a doctor in the first season. <br /> <br /> I only recommend this series to people who haven't seen much of the original series, people under the age of 15, and FULL DIE HARD, who fans, everyone else can just laugh and mourn the curses Russel T Davies, one of our favorite TVs.
