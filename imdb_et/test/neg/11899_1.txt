After watching the movie, I have to say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It takes my worst movie prize away from Komoda, which is not easy. It is neither a porn nor a legitimate film, and it gives them such a bad name. Functioning, camera work, plots, scripts and sound are all terrible. My personal favorite part of the movie is a dude who asks a bartender if he has grapes. Why was such a joke like a movie? Did the director think; "I need a humorous scene to balance a big actor so I'm using some flat ass jokes I read in Laffy Taffy's envelope." Another slowing down is when Norman casts the invisibility drink on himself when he tries to leak it. Why did they even look at the rating of the NC-17 movie, were they hoping to get the largest audience possible? At least if it had been rated X, it would be more sexual and therefore the viewers would concentrate away from the overall low quality. I pray that someone who would work under the tights of this panty would answer.
