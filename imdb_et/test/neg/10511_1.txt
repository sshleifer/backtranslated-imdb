It's 2005, my friends ... time with amazing special effects and technology. So, why don't we see a movie that is a little more thoughtful than this cheesy low-budget movie. I've seen many small-budget movies that robbing my socks, but it's ... it's almost like he's trying to be terrible. Just ... don't ... look at this. I can look for the absence of special effects and computer-generated scenes from the past when it works at least good. I feel like a little child is producing this whole movie. There is not even an initial plot line. Vampire Assassins, by itself, is one big plot hole that tries to ridicule itself. Can anyone tell me if it was meant for a comedy film and I just didn't know it? This makes me wonder what the aftermath for us who loved the first installment?
