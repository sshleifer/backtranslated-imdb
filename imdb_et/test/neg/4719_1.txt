this movie is what happens when people see similar visions in such a blizzard project and say that people in hell run around with the camera, work on slash documentary issues that can't solve the problem, and start a flat idea that makes a terrible script and gives talented actors and start taking a movie. The plot is that in Africa there is a half-human like animals that swell and kill people, locals think it's a demon or a demon, but our wild bunch is in Africa to prove there. there is no need for more words on the plot this movie get is 1 10 and i'm trying to find something good to say about this movie, but after a long time thinking about something nada zero zero.
