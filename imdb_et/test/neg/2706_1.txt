For the first time I watched this movie, which was ten years old. I thought it was bad, and at that age I had no cinematic taste. I watched this movie in Cinemax about 3 days ago and I was reminded why I hated this movie for the first time. Madonna's character, Nikki, is annoying and unpleasant. The main character never loves her. The jokes were brilliant and the dialogue was worse than t.v. soap opera !! I'm glad I didn't see it in the movie theater or rent it. I feel bad for my parents who had to follow me! Madonna may not be a bad actor, but in this role she is depicted as a complete idiot.
