Like almost everyone else, I learned about this turkey from Mystery Science Theater 3000. It's just one of my favorite MST3K episodes. I really couldn't imagine trying to watch this movie to see for myself ......... it's really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really bad. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keeffe stands for Ator, a muscular Fabio wannabe who lives in cave men. We, the spectator, are asked to stop our disbelief that he knows alchemy and chemistry and is able to build a complete hanging table in about 5 minutes. Yeah, of course! There is also a pretty attractive actor (not remembering his name) who carries the breastbone as a breastbone. Oh, and I can't forget that nervous Asian side-blow. He had the easiest role in the film because he didn't speak any dialogue words throughout the film. He had to figure out how to make his character interesting, not to mention ..... and he failed. <br /> <br /> The film is not traceable and should only be viewed in its proper MST3K format. If you look at this version, you are laughing foolishly! <br /> <br /> "I'm great !!!!" <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
