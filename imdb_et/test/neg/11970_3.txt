Nonetheless, this flick also bears the typical features of characteristic symbols, action, dialogue, and general plot. Flick shows signs of its low budget, especially in the case of violence, because most of the actual activities take place outside the screen, instead of showing it happening, close and personal. The screen usually shows the consequences of the revenge of the killer: one man holding his gut, the other with a bet (holding the volleyball net), falling through the chest, blood supply after the woman hit the head. rock, one chick who died after the peacock hit the SUV, etc. There are also some copying problems where it is clear that the sounds of their voices often do not match their lips, especially the unintentionally fun sequence where Ed (Travis Parker) sings the rock star, sings a terrible song to his friends, which they all seem quite impressive .
