Waiting for Peter Fonda to act. Someone who comes from such a talented family is mysterious to me, why Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fonda, who is trying to play someone else. And this is the good news in this disappointing dog that is customizing The Tempest. Open-minded ideas that only show the relationship with Bard's big game are what we serve. The provision is a civil war, and Prospero's (here's Guideon's) evil brother looks like an 1890s melodrama villain with Snidely Whiplash mustache. I waited for him to "Uh ha hah!" what would have been this terrible presentation. None of the supporting pains was memorable and Peter Fonda's expression and wood body movements changed the incomplete story further and further. <br /> <br /> Tempest is Bardi's statement about the unfair treatment of man. The only plausible character was Gator's man, an opponent of Caliban. Gender penetration was an opportunity, but setting up a civil war just didn't change. All in all, it is a very disappointing production. I saw it on the video and would recommend, if you want to set Willy Shakespeare, save your money on it. Rent something else, like Branagh's much Ado, or Kevin Kline's Midsummer Dream.
