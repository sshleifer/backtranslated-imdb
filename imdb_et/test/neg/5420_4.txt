TANDEM is a strange slice of the Japanese pink genre, because it has the required sexual scenes and the misognistic tone that is necessary, but for this type of film, it also casts such a similar drama / dark comedy. d is better suited for different types of films. <br /> <br /> The film starts with two single men in the restaurant - every time you dream of a previous sexual encounter. One of them is a reciprocal subway cut, the other is a pretty typical (for this type of film) semi-root scenario. Two perverts will meet and start talking after another gives the cigarette. They talk about the evening and talk a bit about their sex life. The film is cut by the interaction of both men with the women of their life. These men are falling out and the movie ends with a strange but predictable character ... <br /> <br /> I really don't know what to do with TANDEM. This sorta comes with a soft core, an "odd pair" type of anti-buddy film, but doesn't really explore the subject at any satisfactory level. Similarly, typical extreme sleaks are not so common in this type of film - so I can't really understand what that point was. I also can't tell if the movie should be funny, frustrating, or both. I think TANDEM would have had some potential in the form of a more serious drama with the edge of dark comedy, but if the soft core of a sex film trying to be too "smart" for its well-being, it just doesn't work. One cannot say that I hated it, but I cannot say that this is something significant. 4/10
