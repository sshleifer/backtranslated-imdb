Katharine Hepburn as a mountain woman who interferes with prayer with positive thinking - and the local people think it is a witch. Kate works too hard to try to convince him that he is the backbone (called Trigger Hicks!), But you see that he doesn't even believe in this inadvertently in a comic scenario. Constantly smiling Robert Young plays a master who builds a mountain area that gets Trigger's first burst ... but unfortunately he's married! No white magic can revive this formula by playback and R.K.O. too wide hill. It is pious and almost unobtrusive. * 1/2 from ****
