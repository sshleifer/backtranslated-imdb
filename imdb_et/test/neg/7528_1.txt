PEP SQUAD is at a very shallow point where there is a confusing plot line and terrible action. <br /> <br /> We are dealing with characters first. Cherry (Brooke Balderson) continues to keep all the terrible, boiling anger of the film due to his overweight passionate queen. Nonetheless, the audience is completely unaware of why Cherry first wants to become a prom queen. Before the candidates even read, he rushes around the school constantly uncertainly during his stay and does not show any interest in that place or his students. Why does he care so much to be their queen? Brooke Balderson seems to have highlighted the "acclaimed" performance, but in reality he is always spending an angry face, turning around, killing people. Maybe it's just me, but I think if you gave a young actress / actress script that only requires her crazy behavior, you won't ask much. You also don't allow this character to develop very well. <br /> <br /> Beth's character, played by Jennifer Dreiling, is even worse. Dreiling shows no emotion and no connection with his character. If he is harassed by the head man, he strikes him down (after a few seconds) without feeling disgusted or shocked or equally traumatic. His lines are read as he reads the trash behind the grain box. <br /> <br /> During the rest of the movie, the pupils responsible for his robbery will sound more than they plan to grill, decide what to do with their main thing, sit in the basement in their basement. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Cherry has taken away several female prom queen candidates and no one even knows or care. (Yes, I get it, I get, the whole city is worried about it. Very realistic. At least you could throw some funny scenes at the police, but it may ask too much.) For example, immediately after the cherry drives to school and lets a handful of students find it local media interviews Beth. The reporter mentions the "shooter" so that it doesn't seem like someone killing these innocent students, but then asks one second later: "What do you think minors do?" or something like that. Where did the reporter jump to such conclusions? At the end of the movie, after Cherry kills the winning promotional boy and the prime, it is thought that the media will appear again, Beth just adds that "he understands (Cherry) needs hearing" and walks with his friends, smoking cigarettes in a calm, unmodified mood. No one has even been mistaken for the fact that they just saw the murder. <br /> <br /> Not to mention students who are constantly parked in the yellow zone, and no one seems to care that violence is a steep city, Julie, who lives in a big house with no parents, and a strange party at her house (maybe I'm a little out of the scene, but last time I knew that high school parties were not involved in naked women dancing in the water pool, while the men's bob marshmallows and everyone in Basque "I am both indie and mod" behaviors, Beth's older terrible acts with his mother acting The over-top and his dad just nods for everything the mother has to say (and not in an interesting way) with foolish scenes, such as a new black head that runs for Cherry when she tries to shoot her with a gun. Yes, yes. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> The only compliment I can give this movie is that photography is wonderful. The corners are flattering and the screen is very clear and crisp for every shot. <br /> <br /> Too bad when they show and scripts are not.
