I can't believe I actually bought this movie! It sucks! ... Where I live in Mexican movies Mexican movies have never been advertised or even available ... you can't find them in the usual rental locations ... so I had to buy it ... I like Mexican movies! They bring me closer to my roots and my people and they are different than usual ... but it was so predictable! Your guess could guess what's going on ... I'm not a terrible movie! It just wasn't worth what I paid for it! jaja ... but if you have the time and are really bored, then yes you should watch it .. but if you love Mexican movies and love the theater yourself, don't look at it, it's painful! lol
