Today I had a real desire for a sci-fi movie and so I decided to review Battlespace. Unfortunately, this was one of my biggest mistakes this year. <br /> <br /> I see that director Neil Johnson has directed over 500 music videos, and I suggest he go back. Music videos are a completely good form of entertainment and not everyone can do this. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is probably voice. And it says a lot because special effects are sometimes terrible. Voting didn't work for Blade Runner and it doesn't work here. The first hour, or so, is looking at the protagonist walking in the desert, while his daughter tells the story. I think the story could have been a great movie, but not so. <br /> <br /> Another worst part is the consequences. They are just bad and they don't connect with the rest of the picture, so you just don't believe them. And absolutely all of the film's frames are filtered and not good. The filtering effect is good. 90 minutes of it, bad. <br /> <br /> And what about all the gadgets that talk all the time and don't close!?!? If I had used such technology, I would have gone crazy. I was just waiting for the weapons to burst: "I'm terribly regrettable, but it seems that the ammunition has run out." No, away. This movie is not just worth the time.
