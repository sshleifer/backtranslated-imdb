It's a student film and it's a piece. I would use a much stronger language to describe it, but then the review would not be posted and the world must know - beyond any reasonable doubt - this film really sucks. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a different ruler used to measure the early work of a famous director. As if it was a genius, we were just too stupid to figure it out because it got it right now. I don't buy it. Also LOTR Peter Jackson's nourishing early film "The Bad Taste" and the "early work" of another famous director suck the same way. These "early works" represent everything from budget to scripting, etc. It's all at the bottom of the bucket trash. Don't be fooled by a big name. <br /> <br /> If you like to look at some of the male 70's hip burns, pretend they could ever drive the worst special effect ship - it's your movie <br /> <br /> I can't f * 37449- d believe this thing got the best gold fringe award for the best special effects. Is this a joke right? Or a joke award? <br /> <br /> If you want to see what this film wants, you had rented a season or three red dwarfs you wanted.
