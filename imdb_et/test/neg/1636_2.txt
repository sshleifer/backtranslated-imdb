There are many comments that describe this movie as the worst. There are certainly a lot of mistakes: weak performance, rather boring and clich√©, and sometimes paradoxical script, and B-movie sound and "special" effects. As noted, there is a lot of gloss in the plot, which makes _Cave Dwellers a fantasy film, especially when compared to the Lord of the Rings. However, this film is never the worst film ever. Most, if not all, of their reviews (including this) are written by MSTK3 fans. That's why many of these reviews have quite a lot of summaries of the _Cave Dwellers_ MSTK3 episode. <br /> <br /> Episode Joel, Tom Servo, and Crow note mad scientists that this is the most sent movie for them. Of course, loyal fans have taken this offer and run it. I've found this movie to be loving - not in such a way that it finds itself in _Forrest Gump_ endearing, but some of this movie. This film is also ridiculous without MSTK3 processing. This is because _Cave Dwellers_ does not take himself seriously and he does not try to import any correct topic into his viewers. In the event of all monsters, medieval hanging and the expiration of continuity, this movie is no longer advertised as being the low-profile of a rather low genre. <br /> <br /> Also, I can not take the hate of Miles O'Keeffe or Lisa Foster. Instead, this hate is Coleman Francis, Tony Cardoza, Jennifer Lopez, Arch Hall, Jr. Etc. <br /> <br />
