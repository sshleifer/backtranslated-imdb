.... is where I expect this movie to come. I mean, I've been watching a lot of B movies so far during my young life, and I wouldn't even have classified it as a B movie. I remember movies in my high school mass media class that goes beyond that. <br /> <br /> So the premise is ... a bunch of dance numbers and buggy mess. Bikini women who are not even so big to start, dance early and sing. Boys with a hairy coat will appear and girls out in the sun. I mean, I can barely put together a single sentence just about this movie. Most people on this site say that Manos's fate and Pod People are the worst films (MST3K classics :-D) ... I used to be one of them. Then I saw this movie. I usually don't try to throw the film too much, but the people who did it deserve it. It's bad and it's unbearable, and I assume that the film's director or actor is the only person who's ten.
